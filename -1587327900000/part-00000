It is twenty kilometres west of the provincial boundary between Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\n\n==History==\nWith the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in 1882, Moosomin was established as the first Saskatchewan community on \"steel\". Originally known as \"siding No. 4\" and the \"Moosomin Station\", businesses began to establish and by 1884 the community had grown to include five general stores, five hotels, two livery stables, two blacksmiths, a doctor, a lawyer, butcher, and one printer, among other businesses. Moosomin was incorporated as a town in November 1887. R. D. McNaughton was the first merchant to arrive in Moosomin. He founded the [[R. D. McNaughton Building|R. D. McNaughton Company]], a general store operation that played a vital role in early settlement.<ref name=\"townweb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moosomin.com/about.html|title=History of Moosomin|publisher=Town of Moosomin website|accessdate=2010-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829235850/http://moosomin.com/about.html|archive-date=2010-08-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe town was named after Chief  [[Moosomin (person)|Moosomin]], who became well known for leading his band into treaty status. He signed [[Treaty 6]] at Battleford in 1880.\n\nThe first issue of the ''Moosomin Courier'' weekly newspaper was published on Thursday, October 2, 1884.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/moosomin-courier-oct-02-1884-p-1/|title=NewspaperArchive.com|last=|first=|date=October 2, 1884|website=NewspaperArchive.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMoosomin had several military units that were associated with the community. These included the [[16th Light Horse]], in the early 1900s (decade); [[10th Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles]], 1915; [[217th Battalion, CEF]], and the 101st Battery of the 22nd Field Regiment which was based at ''Moosomin Armories'' (presently the Community Hall).  \n\nMoosomin also had a jail, the ''Moosomin Gaol'', which is located at the site of the present day ''Turpie Farm''. In 1905, a hospital opened, and it was the only hospital between Brandon and Indian Head. A normal school was opened, and before this time it served as the home of the Legislative Assembly for the District of Assiniboia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The first issue of the local newspaper was published October 2, 1884, and the Moosomin ''[[World-Spectator]]'' is the oldest weekly newspaper in Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"townweb\"/><!-- copyvio? -->\n\nOne of Moosomin's more notables is [[Andrew McNaughton|General Andrew McNaughton]], born in Moosomin in 1887. In the Second World War, he commanded Canada's overseas army and then became Minister of Defence. In the interwar years he was Chairman of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] and following the [[Second World War]] was Chairman of the [[International Joint Commission]] which handled questions pertaining to the international waters along the Canada-United States border.<ref name=\"townweb\"/><!-- copyvio? -->\n\nThe social life of the early settlers of the area was limited by distances and transportation methods. Sunday church services were often held in private homes.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Adamson\n | first =Julia\n | title =Saskatchewan Roman Catholic Churches ~ Online Parish Registers ~ History\n | work =Saskatchewan Gen Web\n | publisher =Ancestry.com\n | date =16 Feb 2013 \n | url =http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cansk/Saskatchewan/ChurchHistory.html#Moosomin\n | accessdate = 2013-02-16}}</ref>  The small one room school houses became the centre of activity in most areas. Saturday nights were often the social night of the week, when groceries and supplies were purchased. There was often entertainment in the Opera House in the R.D. McNaughton Store. Summer picnics were held in the period between summerfallowing and haying. July 1 in Moosomin was the highlight of the summer for many years, there would be a parade, sports events and refreshments. With the arrival of the automobile, social life changed accordingly.<ref name=\"townweb\"/><!-- copyvio? -->\n\n==Current development==\nMoosomin grew significantly in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the construction of a major potash mine {{convert|22|mi}} to the north. Moosomin is currently undergoing significant growth. According to Saskatchewan Health, which tracks population based on the number of health cards issued, there were 2,733 people living in Moosomin on June 30, 2010, up from 2,496 a year earlier, an increase of 227 people. The growth is due to several reasons. The PotashCorp [[Rocanville]] potash mine just north of the community is undergoing a $2.8 billion expansion, the $60 million Red Lily Wind Farm just west of the community started producing power in February 2011, since the Trans-Canada Highway was twinned through Moosomin in November 2009 several new businesses have been established along the highway, the Southeast Integrated Care Centre has become a major health care centre for a large region of southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba, and there has been significant activity in the local oil patch, which is at the northern end of the [[Bakken Formation]].\n\nSeveral major projects are on the drawing board in Moosomin. Land has been purchased for two major hotel developments next to the [[Canalta Hotels|Canalta Hotel]], which opened in 2010 facing the new highway, and land has been purchased for Pipestone Villas, a major residential development.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Canada census\n |2011_population=2,485 | 2011_pop_delta=9.9 | 2011_land_area=7.59 | 2011_pop_density=327.5\n |2011_median_age=41.2 | 2011_median_age_m=38.6 | 2011_median_age_f=43.8\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=1,168 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-05-30\n |2006_population=2,257 | 2006_pop_delta=-4.4 | 2006_land_area=5.97 | 2006_pop_density=378.2\n |2006_median_age=44.6 | 2006_median_age_m=41.9 | 2006_median_age_f=47.4\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=1,114 | 2006_mean_hh_income=43,561 | 2006_access_date=2010-09-10\n |2001_population=2,361 | 2001_pop_delta=-2.4 | 2001_land_area=5.90 | 2001_pop_density=399.9\n |2001_median_age=42.9 | 2001_median_age_m=40.1 | 2001_median_age_f=46.0\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=1,125 |2001_mean_hh_income=33,317 | 2001_access_date=\n}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n|location = Moosomin (1981-2010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 10.5\n|Feb record high C = 15.5\n|Mar record high C = 21.7\n|Apr record high C = 33.5\n|May record high C = 36.5\n|Jun record high C = 38.9\n|Jul record high C = 41.1\n|Aug record high C = 38.0\n|Sep record high C = 35.6\n|Oct record high C = 33.0\n|Nov record high C = 24.4\n|Dec record high C = 17.5\n|year record high C = \n|Jan high C = -10.1\n|Feb high C = -6.4\n|Mar high C = -0.2\n|Apr high C = 10.4\n|May high C = 18.0\n|Jun high C = 22.7\n|Jul high C = 25.2\n|Aug high C = 24.9\n|Sep high C = 17.9\n|Oct high C = 9.8\n|Nov high C = -1.6\n|Dec high C = -9.3\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = -14.9\n|Feb mean C = -11.0\n|Mar mean C = -4.9\n|Apr mean C = 4.4\n|May mean C = 11.5\n|Jun mean C = 16.4\n|Jul mean C = 18.8\n|Aug mean C = 18.2\n|Sep mean C = 11.8\n|Oct mean C = 4.6\n|Nov mean C = -5.6\n|Dec mean C = -13.5\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = -19.5\n|Feb low C = -15.5\n|Mar low C = -9.5\n|Apr low C = -1.7\n|May low C = 5.0\n|Jun low C = 10.1\n|Jul low C = 12.2\n|Aug low C = 11.4\n|Sep low C = 5.6\n|Oct low C = -0.7\n|Nov low C = -9.5\n|Dec low C = -17.8\n|year low C = \n|Jan record low C = -43.9\n|Feb record low C = -41.1\n|Mar record low C = -36.7\n|Apr record low C = -23.3\n|May record low C = -15.0\n|Jun record low C = -3.3\n|Jul record low C = 1.1\n|Aug record low C = -3.3\n|Sep record low C = -11.1\n|Oct record low C = -20.0\n|Nov record low C = -33.9\n|Dec record low C = -41.5\n|year record low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 21.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 14.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 25.8\n|Apr precipitation mm = 24.3\n|May precipitation mm = 65.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 90.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 77.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 56.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 35.0\n|Nov precipitation mm = 20.4\n|Dec precipitation mm = 19.4\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name= \"climate\">Environment Canada - Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010\u2014[http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=moosomin&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=2971&dispBack=1 Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010], accessed 3 December 2010</ref>\n|date=December 2010\n|precipitation colour = green\n}}\n\n==Moosomin in popular culture==\n* [[The Guess Who]] has a song called \"[[Runnin' Back to Saskatoon]]\"; it also mentions [[Moose Jaw]] and Moosomin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Running-Back-To-Saskatoon-lyrics-The-Guess-Who/762981F80D809EA94825730D00290436|title=Runnin' Back to Saskatoon Lyrics|publisher=sing365.com|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n* [[Jessica Campbell (ice hockey)|Jessica Campbell]] (born 1992), ice hockey player\n* [[Brock Lesnar]] (born 1977), professional wrestler and mixed martial artist<ref>[http://www.swbooster.com/news/2015/10/27/colter-wall-finds-unexpected-friendship-with-wwe-star-brock-lesn.html Colter Wall finds unexpected friendship with WWE star Brock Lesnar].

It is twenty kilometres west of the provincial boundary between Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\n\n==History==\nWith the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in 1882, Moosomin was established as the first Saskatchewan community on \"steel\". Originally known as \"siding No. 4\" and the \"Moosomin Station\", businesses began to establish and by 1884 the community had grown to include five general stores, five hotels, two livery stables, two blacksmiths, a doctor, a lawyer, butcher, and one printer, among other businesses. Moosomin was incorporated as a town in November 1887. R. D. McNaughton was the first merchant to arrive in Moosomin. He founded the [[R. D. McNaughton Building|R. D. McNaughton Company]], a general store operation that played a vital role in early settlement.<ref name=\"townweb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moosomin.com/about.html|title=History of Moosomin|publisher=Town of Moosomin website|accessdate=2010-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829235850/http://moosomin.com/about.html|archive-date=2010-08-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe town was named after Chief  [[Moosomin (person)|Moosomin]], who became well known for leading his band into treaty status. He signed [[Treaty 6]] at Battleford in 1880.\n\nThe first issue of the ''Moosomin Courier'' weekly newspaper was published on Thursday, October 2, 1884.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/moosomin-courier-oct-02-1884-p-1/|title=NewspaperArchive.com|last=|first=|date=October 2, 1884|website=NewspaperArchive.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMoosomin had several military units that were associated with the community. These included the [[16th Light Horse]], in the early 1900s (decade); [[10th Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles]], 1915; [[217th Battalion, CEF]], and the 101st Battery of the 22nd Field Regiment which was based at ''Moosomin Armories'' (presently the Community Hall).  \n\nMoosomin also had a jail, the ''Moosomin Gaol'', which is located at the site of the present day ''Turpie Farm''. In 1905, a hospital opened, and it was the only hospital between Brandon and Indian Head. A normal school was opened, and before this time it served as the home of the Legislative Assembly for the District of Assiniboia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The first issue of the local newspaper was published October 2, 1884, and the Moosomin ''[[World-Spectator]]'' is the oldest weekly newspaper in Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"townweb\"/><!-- copyvio? -->\n\nOne of Moosomin's more notables is [[Andrew McNaughton|General Andrew McNaughton]], born in Moosomin in 1887. In the Second World War, he commanded Canada's overseas army and then became Minister of Defence. In the interwar years he was Chairman of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] and following the [[Second World War]] was Chairman of the [[International Joint Commission]] which handled questions pertaining to the international waters along the Canada-United States border.<ref name=\"townweb\"/><!-- copyvio? -->\n\nThe social life of the early settlers of the area was limited by distances and transportation methods. Sunday church services were often held in private homes.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Adamson\n | first =Julia\n | title =Saskatchewan Roman Catholic Churches ~ Online Parish Registers ~ History\n | work =Saskatchewan Gen Web\n | publisher =Ancestry.com\n | date =16 Feb 2013 \n | url =http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cansk/Saskatchewan/ChurchHistory.html#Moosomin\n | accessdate = 2013-02-16}}</ref>  The small one room school houses became the centre of activity in most areas. Saturday nights were often the social night of the week, when groceries and supplies were purchased. There was often entertainment in the Opera House in the R.D. McNaughton Store. Summer picnics were held in the period between summerfallowing and haying. July 1 in Moosomin was the highlight of the summer for many years, there would be a parade, sports events and refreshments. With the arrival of the automobile, social life changed accordingly.<ref name=\"townweb\"/><!-- copyvio? -->\n\n==Current development==\nMoosomin grew significantly in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the construction of a major potash mine {{convert|22|mi}} to the north. Moosomin is currently undergoing significant growth. According to Saskatchewan Health, which tracks population based on the number of health cards issued, there were 2,733 people living in Moosomin on June 30, 2010, up from 2,496 a year earlier, an increase of 227 people. The growth is due to several reasons. The PotashCorp [[Rocanville]] potash mine just north of the community is undergoing a $2.8 billion expansion, the $60 million Red Lily Wind Farm just west of the community started producing power in February 2011, since the Trans-Canada Highway was twinned through Moosomin in November 2009 several new businesses have been established along the highway, the Southeast Integrated Care Centre has become a major health care centre for a large region of southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba, and there has been significant activity in the local oil patch, which is at the northern end of the [[Bakken Formation]].\n\nSeveral major projects are on the drawing board in Moosomin. Land has been purchased for two major hotel developments next to the [[Canalta Hotels|Canalta Hotel]], which opened in 2010 facing the new highway, and land has been purchased for Pipestone Villas, a major residential development.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Canada census\n |2011_population=2,485 | 2011_pop_delta=9.9 | 2011_land_area=7.59 | 2011_pop_density=327.5\n |2011_median_age=41.2 | 2011_median_age_m=38.6 | 2011_median_age_f=43.8\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=1,168 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-05-30\n |2006_population=2,257 | 2006_pop_delta=-4.4 | 2006_land_area=5.97 | 2006_pop_density=378.2\n |2006_median_age=44.6 | 2006_median_age_m=41.9 | 2006_median_age_f=47.4\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=1,114 | 2006_mean_hh_income=43,561 | 2006_access_date=2010-09-10\n |2001_population=2,361 | 2001_pop_delta=-2.4 | 2001_land_area=5.90 | 2001_pop_density=399.9\n |2001_median_age=42.9 | 2001_median_age_m=40.1 | 2001_median_age_f=46.0\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=1,125 |2001_mean_hh_income=33,317 | 2001_access_date=\n}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n|location = Moosomin (1981-2010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 10.5\n|Feb record high C = 15.5\n|Mar record high C = 21.7\n|Apr record high C = 33.5\n|May record high C = 36.5\n|Jun record high C = 38.9\n|Jul record high C = 41.1\n|Aug record high C = 38.0\n|Sep record high C = 35.6\n|Oct record high C = 33.0\n|Nov record high C = 24.4\n|Dec record high C = 17.5\n|year record high C = \n|Jan high C = -10.1\n|Feb high C = -6.4\n|Mar high C = -0.2\n|Apr high C = 10.4\n|May high C = 18.0\n|Jun high C = 22.7\n|Jul high C = 25.2\n|Aug high C = 24.9\n|Sep high C = 17.9\n|Oct high C = 9.8\n|Nov high C = -1.6\n|Dec high C = -9.3\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = -14.9\n|Feb mean C = -11.0\n|Mar mean C = -4.9\n|Apr mean C = 4.4\n|May mean C = 11.5\n|Jun mean C = 16.4\n|Jul mean C = 18.8\n|Aug mean C = 18.2\n|Sep mean C = 11.8\n|Oct mean C = 4.6\n|Nov mean C = -5.6\n|Dec mean C = -13.5\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = -19.5\n|Feb low C = -15.5\n|Mar low C = -9.5\n|Apr low C = -1.7\n|May low C = 5.0\n|Jun low C = 10.1\n|Jul low C = 12.2\n|Aug low C = 11.4\n|Sep low C = 5.6\n|Oct low C = -0.7\n|Nov low C = -9.5\n|Dec low C = -17.8\n|year low C = \n|Jan record low C = -43.9\n|Feb record low C = -41.1\n|Mar record low C = -36.7\n|Apr record low C = -23.3\n|May record low C = -15.0\n|Jun record low C = -3.3\n|Jul record low C = 1.1\n|Aug record low C = -3.3\n|Sep record low C = -11.1\n|Oct record low C = -20.0\n|Nov record low C = -33.9\n|Dec record low C = -41.5\n|year record low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 21.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 14.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 25.8\n|Apr precipitation mm = 24.3\n|May precipitation mm = 65.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 90.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 77.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 56.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 35.0\n|Nov precipitation mm = 20.4\n|Dec precipitation mm = 19.4\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name= \"climate\">Environment Canada - Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010\u2014[http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=moosomin&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=2971&dispBack=1 Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010], accessed 3 December 2010</ref>\n|date=December 2010\n|precipitation colour = green\n}}\n\n==Moosomin in popular culture==\n* [[The Guess Who]] has a song called \"[[Runnin' Back to Saskatoon]]\"; it also mentions [[Moose Jaw]] and Moosomin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Running-Back-To-Saskatoon-lyrics-The-Guess-Who/762981F80D809EA94825730D00290436|title=Runnin' Back to Saskatoon Lyrics|publisher=sing365.com|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n* [[Jessica Campbell (ice hockey)|Jessica Campbell]] (born 1992), ice hockey player\n* [[Brock Lesnar]] (born 1977), professional wrestler and mixed martial artist<ref>[http://www.swbooster.com/news/2015/10/27/colter-wall-finds-unexpected-friendship-with-wwe-star-brock-lesn.html Colter Wall finds unexpected friendship with WWE star Brock Lesnar].

Pregnant with Rakhal's child, she escapes from his captive to end her life. While on the train, she tries to commit suicide but is rescued by the madam of a singing house([[Chhaya Devi]]), who brings up to her kotha in Lucknow where she gives birth to a daughter named Suparna, and becomes the courtesan(baijee) christened with a new name, Pannabai. In the meantime, Rakhal traces her out and continues to harass and blackmail her, so she escapes to Calcutta and admits Suparna in a missionary hostel school to distance herself from her so that her daughter can grow up in a good and healthy environment. \n\nIncidentally, she run across her former lover, Manish Roy([[Bikash Roy]]) who is now a famous lawyer, and after hearing her tragic tale proposes to marry her, but Debjani fearing that would soil his name, rather requests to take care of her daughter, Suparna and be her guardian. Manish agrees, and becomes Suparna's guardian.\n\nFew years pass by, adult Suparna([[Suchitra Sen]]) brought up by Manish as his orphaned neice, returns from aboard becoming a lawyer, who is in love with her senior Indranil(Dilip Mukherjee), Manish's assistant. Pannabai has grown older with a heart ailment. When Rakhal realizes that Suparna is his daughter, he comes back to blackmail Pannabai aka Debjani again, threatening to expose Suparna's true identity to her. Debjani shoots him in the heat of argument, and in the court, is defended by Manish. Suparna accuses Manish of being unjust for defending a characterless, fallen woman whom she despises.

Pregnant with Rakhal's child, she escapes from his captive to end her life. While on the train, she tries to commit suicide but is rescued by the madam of a singing house([[Chhaya Devi]]), who brings up to her kotha in Lucknow where she gives birth to a daughter named Suparna, and becomes the courtesan(baijee) christened with a new name, Pannabai. In the meantime, Rakhal traces her out and continues to harass and blackmail her, so she escapes to Calcutta and admits Suparna in a missionary hostel school to distance herself from her so that her daughter can grow up in a good and healthy environment. \n\nIncidentally, she run across her former lover, Manish Roy([[Bikash Roy]]) who is now a famous lawyer, and after hearing her tragic tale proposes to marry her, but Debjani fearing that would soil his name, rather requests to take care of her daughter, Suparna and be her guardian. Manish agrees, and becomes Suparna's guardian.\n\nFew years pass by, adult Suparna([[Suchitra Sen]]) brought up by Manish as his orphaned neice, returns from aboard becoming a lawyer, who is in love with her senior Indranil(Dilip Mukherjee), Manish's assistant. Pannabai has grown older with a heart ailment. When Rakhal realizes that Suparna is his daughter, he comes back to blackmail Pannabai aka Debjani again, threatening to expose Suparna's true identity to her. Debjani shoots him in the heat of argument, and in the court, is defended by Manush. Suparna accuses Manish of being unjust for defending a characterless, fallen woman whom she despises.

{"title_page": "Push-pull configuration", "text_new": "{{Other uses of|push-pull|Push-pull (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Cessna_Skymaster_O-2_5.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cessna O-2 Skymaster]], a [[twin boom]] push-pull design]]\n\nAn [[aircraft]] constructed with a '''push-pull configuration''' has a combination of forward-mounted [[Tractor configuration|tractor]] (pull) [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s, and backward-mounted ([[pusher configuration|pusher]]) propellers.\n\n==Historical==\nThe earliest known examples of \"push-pull\" engined-layout aircraft include a trio of experimental German World War I designs: chronologically comprising the only Fokker twin-engined design of the period, the [[Fokker K.I]] from 1915; followed by the unusual [[Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I]] [[triplane]] fighter design of late 1917, and concluding with the laterally-offset \"push-pull\" [[Gotha G.VI]] bomber prototype of 1918. \n\nAn early post-World War I example of a \"push-pull\" aircraft was the [[Short S.27#Short Tandem Twin|Short Tandem Twin]]: another was the [[Caproni Ca.1 (1914)|Caproni Ca.1]] of 1914 which had two wing-mounted tractor propellers and one centre-mounted pusher propeller. Around 450 of these and their successor, the [[Caproni Ca.3|Ca.3]] were built. One of the first to employ two engines on a common axis (tandem push-pull) was the one-off, ill-fated [[Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] of 1917.\n\n[[Claudius Dornier]] embraced the concept, many of his [[flying boat]]s using variations of the tandem \"push-pull\" engine layout, including the 1922 [[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]], the 1938 [[Dornier Do 26]], and the massive 1929 [[Dornier Do X]], which had twelve engines driving six tractors and six pushers. A number of Farmans and Fokkers also had push-pull engine installations, such as the [[Farman F.121 Jabiru]] and [[Fokker F.32]].\n\n==Configuration==\nPush-pull designs have the engines mounted above the wing as Dornier flying boats or more commonly on a shorter  [[fuselage]] than conventional one, as for [[Rutan Defiant]] or [[Rutan Voyager|Voyager]] canard designs. PINA Twin boomers such as the [[Cessna Skymaster]] and [[Adam A500]] have the aircraft's tail suspended via [[twin boom]]s behind the pusher propeller.  In contrast, both the [[World War II]]-era [[Dornier Do 335]] and the early 1960s-designed French [[Moynet Jupiter|Moynet M 360 Jupiter]] experimental private plane had their pusher propeller behind the tail.<ref>http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/photo_albums/timeline/ww2/Dornier%20Do%20335%20Pfeil.htm</ref><ref>http://aviadejavu.ru/Site/Crafts/Craft30765.htm</ref>\n\n==Design benefits==\nWhile pure pushers decreased in popularity during the [[World War I|First World War]], the push-pull configuration has continued to be used.  The advantage it provides is the ability to mount two propellers on the aircraft's centreline, thereby avoiding the increased drag that comes with twin wing-mounted engines.  It is also easier to fly if one of the two engines fails, as the thrust provided by the remaining engine stays in the centerline.

Around 450 of these and their successor, the [[Caproni Ca.3|Ca.3]] were built. One of the first to employ two engines on a common axis (tandem push-pull) was the one-off, ill-fated [[Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] of 1917.\n\n[[Claudius Dornier]] embraced the concept, many of his [[flying boat]]s using variations of the tandem \"push-pull\" engine layout, including the 1922 [[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]], the 1938 [[Dornier Do 26]], and the massive 1929 [[Dornier Do X]], which had twelve engines driving six tractors and six pushers. A number of Farmans and Fokkers also had push-pull engine installations, such as the [[Farman F.121 Jabiru]] and [[Fokker F.32]].\n\n==Configuration==\nPush-pull designs have the engines mounted above the wing as Dornier flying boats or more commonly on a shorter  [[fuselage]] than conventional one, as for [[Rutan Defiant]] or [[Rutan Voyager|Voyager]] canard designs. PINA Twin boomers such as the [[Cessna Skymaster]] and [[Adam A500]] have the aircraft's tail suspended via [[twin boom]]s behind the pusher propeller.  In contrast, both the [[World War II]]-era [[Dornier Do 335]] and the early 1960s-designed French [[Moynet Jupiter|Moynet M 360 Jupiter]] experimental private plane had their pusher propeller behind the tail.<ref>http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/photo_albums/timeline/ww2/Dornier%20Do%20335%20Pfeil.htm</ref><ref>http://aviadejavu.ru/Site/Crafts/Craft30765.htm</ref>\n\n==Design benefits==\nWhile pure pushers decreased in popularity during the [[World War I|First World War]], the push-pull configuration has continued to be used.  The advantage it provides is the ability to mount two propellers on the aircraft's centreline, thereby avoiding the increased drag that comes with twin wing-mounted engines.  It is also easier to fly if one of the two engines fails, as the thrust provided by the remaining engine stays in the centerline. In contrast, a conventional twin-engine aircraft will [[Yaw angle|yaw]] in the direction of the failed engine and become uncontrollable below a certain airspeed, known as [[V speeds#VMC|V<sub>MC</sub>]].\n\n==Design problems==\nThe rear engine operates in the disturbed air from the forward engine, which may reduce its efficiency to 85% of the forward engine.<ref>https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1055847-stability-changes-under-power/page2 quote:usually at least a couple percent less, typically quite a bit worse than that, and in some cases more than 15% less efficient-Al Bower</ref><ref>Long P.

These buses were part of a joint order with Frederick City Transit, and shared the same paint livery. In 1988, OBI Orion I 30' foot buses were introduced. In 1989, 57 30-foot Gillig Phantom buses, the first buses in the second-generation blue-and-white scheme, went into service. These buses retired in 2014 due to the arrival of the Gillig Advantage CNG\n\nIn the spring of 1996, Ride On's first [[compressed natural gas|CNG]] buses, the 1996 35-foot Orion V buses, went into service. These buses have since retired.\n\n===2000s===\nIn September 2001, Ride On buses were used to transport Montgomery County firemen to the Pentagon in Virginia to assist in search and rescue operations after the September 11 attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH8wXJHb5aA|title=ABC (WJLA) 9-11-2001 News Coverage 11:00 PM - 12:00 AM|first=|last=911NewsCoverage|date=4 July 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2004, Ride On's first low-floor buses, the 2003\u201304 35-foot Orion VII CNG buses (5900\u20135932), went into service. They replaced all of the remaining 1989 30-foot Gillig Phantom buses (which were also Ride On's last buses without wheelchair lifts), therefore resulting in an all-accessible fleet.\n\nIn 2006, Ride On started accepting SmarTrip cards.  All of the buses would be equipped with SmarTrip-compatible fare boxes by August of that year.\n\nAlso in 2006, Ride On's first five hybrid-electric buses, the 2006 40-foot [[Gillig Low Floor]] aka Gillig Advantage buses (5300-5304), went into service. The following year (2007), eight additional 40-foot Gillig Low Floor hybrid-electric buses (5305-5313) went into service.\n\nBetween summer and fall 2008, Ride On's first low-floor diesel buses, the 2008 29-foot Gillig Advantage (5001-5006) and 2008 40-foot Gillig Advantage buses (5726\u20135746), went into service. They are the last buses in the second-generation blue-and-white paint scheme.\n\nIn 2009, Ride On introduced a new logo and blue-yellow-green paint scheme with the delivery of new Gillig Advantage clean diesel and hybrid buses.\n\n===2010s===\nIn autumn 2011, Ride On's 12 40-foot Gillig Low Floor hybrid buses (5349\u20135360) and one clean diesel bus (5758) went into service. All 13 of these buses were purchased with funds from the [[American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]]. Seven additional 40' Gillig Low Floor hybrid buses (5361\u20135367), which were also purchased with stimulus funds from the ARRA, went into service in mid-2012.\n\nIn July 2012, Ride On retired all 62 of its 2007 Champion [[cutaway bus]]es due to fires and replaced them with 30 1998 30-foot Orion V buses. All 30 of these units were formerly operated by [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|WMATA]].\n\nOn September 19, 2013, 12 new 40-foot Gillig Low Floor clean diesel buses (5759\u20135770) went into service. A week later (September 26, 2013), 28 new 29-foot Gillig Low Floor clean diesel buses (5032\u20135059) also went into service. Also, the 2013 29-foot Gillig Low Floor clean diesel buses replaced all of the 2003 model shuttle transit vehicles (STV) that were formerly operated by [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]].\n\nIn April 2014, 19 brand-new 2014 40-foot Gillig Low Floor CNG buses (5837\u20135855) entered service. They are Ride On's first new CNG buses in almost a decade (2005 35' Orion VII CNG buses, which went into service in 2006).\n\nBetween September and October 2014, 32 new 29-foot Gillig Low Floor clean diesel buses (5060\u20135091) went into service and replaced all of the 1998 30-foot Orion V buses that were formerly operated by WMATA.\n\nRide On celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2015, with 3 buses (1 from each of the 3 bus divisions) wrapped in the transit agency's 40th anniversary ad.\n\nBetween April and May 2016, 40 new 40' Gillig LF clean diesel buses (4000-4039), 1 29' Gillig LF clean diesel bus (2000) and 16 40' Gillig LF CNG buses (4040-4055) entered service.  And with the new buses came the new five-digit numbering system for Ride On, along with the addition of suffixes denoting engines with a (\"C\" for compressed natural gas, \"D\" for diesel and \"H\" for hybrid).\n\nRide On extRa, a new limited-stop bus service along Maryland Route 355, began on October 2, 2017 between Lakeforest Transit Center and Medical Center Metro Station. {{As of|2018|9|17|df=US}}, the route serves 13 stops. Ride On added 59 Gillig 40-foot buses in summer and the fall 2017; 42 buses replaced some of the oldest vehicles in the fleet.  Seventeen buses (4056D-4072D) are specially branded and used exclusively for Ride On's new extRa service that began October 2, 2017. This limited-stop service runs along Route 355 from Lakeforest Transit Center to Medical Center Metro Station. All of the 59 buses are manufactured by Gillig; 25 run on clean diesel (4056D-4080D) and 34 use compressed natural gas (4081C-4114C).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.montgomerycountymd.gov/mcgportalapps/Press_Detail.aspx?Item_ID=21097|title=Ride On to Add Dozens of New Buses to Fleet|date=May 16, 2017|access-date = May 20, 2017|website =Montgomery County Department Of Transportation|publisher=MCDOT}}</ref>  Four additional 40-foot CNG buses (4115C-4118C) entered service in the winter of 2018.\n\nRide On was award a $1.75 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration to purchase the county's first four electric buses and charging stations. Ride On is partnering with Proterra, the bus manufacturer, and the Center for Transportation and the Environment, a nonprofit that develops technologies and implements solutions to achieve energy and environmental sustainability. The Montgomery County Department of General Services, which purchases and maintains the Ride On buses, greatly assisted with the grant application. The four Proterra Catalyst 35&nbsp;ft electric buses are scheduled to serve Route 18 in Takoma Park starting in 2019. The county has applied for a separate grant to help buy 10 more electric buses through FTA's Bus and Bus Facilities Infrastructure Investment Program.

These buses were part of a joint order with Frederick City Transit, and shared the same paint livery. In 1988, OBI Orion I 30' foot buses were introduced. In 1989, 57 30-foot Gillig Phantom buses, the first buses in the second-generation blue-and-white scheme, went into service. These buses retired in 2014 due to the arrival of the Gillig Advantage CNG\n\nIn the spring of 1996, Ride On's first [[compressed natural gas|CNG]] buses, the 1996 35-foot Orion V buses, went into service. These buses have since retired.\n\n===2000s===\nIn September 2001, Ride On buses were used to transport Montgomery County firemen to the Pentagon in Virginia to assist in search and rescue operations after the September 11 attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH8wXJHb5aA|title=ABC (WJLA) 9-11-2001 News Coverage 11:00 PM - 12:00 AM|first=|last=911NewsCoverage|date=4 July 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2004, Ride On's first low-floor buses, the 2003\u201304 35-foot Orion VII CNG buses (5900\u20135932), went into service. They replaced all of the remaining 1989 30-foot Gillig Phantom buses (which were also Ride On's last buses without wheelchair lifts), therefore resulting in an all-accessible fleet.\n\nIn 2006, Ride On started accepting SmarTrip cards.  All of the buses would be equipped with SmarTrip-compatible fare boxes by August of that year.\n\nAlso in 2006, Ride On's first five hybrid-electric buses, the 2006 40-foot [[Gillig Low Floor]] aka Gillig Advantage buses (5300-5304), went into service. The following year (2007), eight additional 40-foot Gillig Low Floor hybrid-electric buses (5305-5313) went into service.\n\nBetween summer and fall 2008, Ride On's first low-floor diesel buses, the 2008 29-foot Gillig Advantage (5001-5006) and 2008 40-foot Gillig Advantage buses (5726\u20135746), went into service. They are the last buses in the second-generation blue-and-white paint scheme.\n\nIn 2009, Ride On introduced a new logo and blue-yellow-green paint scheme with the delivery of new Gillig Advantage clean diesel and hybrid buses.\n\n===2010s===\nIn autumn 2011, Ride On's 12 40-foot Gillig Low Floor hybrid buses (5349\u20135360) and one clean diesel bus (5758) went into service. All 13 of these buses were purchased with funds from the [[American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]]. Seven additional 40' Gillig Low Floor hybrid buses (5361\u20135367), which were also purchased with stimulus funds from the ARRA, went into service in mid-2012.\n\nIn July 2012, Ride On retired all 62 of its 2007 Champion [[cutaway bus]]es due to fires and replaced them with 30 1998 30-foot Orion V buses. All 30 of these units were formerly operated by [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|WMATA]].\n\nOn September 19, 2013, 12 new 40-foot Gillig Low Floor clean diesel buses (5759\u20135770) went into service. A week later (September 26, 2013), 28 new 29-foot Gillig Low Floor clean diesel buses (5032\u20135059) also went into service. Also, the 2013 29-foot Gillig Low Floor clean diesel buses replaced all of the 2003 model shuttle transit vehicles (STV) that were formerly operated by [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]].\n\nIn April 2014, 19 brand-new 2014 40-foot Gillig Low Floor CNG buses (5837\u20135855) entered service. They are Ride On's first new CNG buses in almost a decade (2005 35' Orion VII CNG buses, which went into service in 2006).\n\nBetween September and October 2014, 32 new 29-foot Gillig Low Floor clean diesel buses (5060\u20135091) went into service and replaced all of the 1998 30-foot Orion V buses that were formerly operated by WMATA.\n\nRide On celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2015, with 3 buses (1 from each of the 3 bus divisions) wrapped in the transit agency's 40th anniversary ad.\n\nBetween April and May 2016, 40 new 40' Gillig LF clean diesel buses (4000-4039), 1 29' Gillig LF clean diesel bus (2000) and 16 40' Gillig LF CNG buses (4040-4055) entered service.  And with the new buses came the new five-digit numbering system for Ride On, along with the addition of suffixes denoting engines with a (\"C\" for compressed natural gas, \"D\" for diesel and \"H\" for hybrid).\n\nRide On extRa, a new limited-stop bus service along Maryland Route 355, began on October 2, 2017 between Lakeforest Transit Center and Medical Center Metro Station. {{As of|2018|9|17|df=US}}, the route serves 13 stops. Ride On added 59 Gillig 40-foot buses in summer and the fall 2017; 42 buses replaced some of the oldest vehicles in the fleet.  Seventeen buses (4056D-4072D) are specially branded and used exclusively for Ride On's new extRa service that began October 2, 2017. This limited-stop service runs along Route 355 from Lakeforest Transit Center to Medical Center Metro Station.
