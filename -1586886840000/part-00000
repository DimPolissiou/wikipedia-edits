{"title_page": "Hydrogen-like atom", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|Atomic nuclei with one electron, so they behave like hydrogen}}\nA '''hydrogen-like atom/ion''' (usually called a \"hydrogenic atom\") is any [[atomic nucleus]] bound to one [[electron]] and thus is [[isoelectronic]] with [[hydrogen]]. These atoms or ions can carry the positive charge <math>e(Z-1)</math>, where <math>Z</math> is the [[atomic number]] of the atom. Examples of hydrogen-like atoms/ions are [[Hydrogen]] itself, [[Helium|He<sup>+</sup>]], [[Lithium|Li<sup>2+</sup>]], [[Beryllium|Be<sup>3+</sup>]] and [[Boron|B<sup>4+</sup>]]. Because hydrogen-like atoms/ions are two-particle systems with an interaction depending only on the distance between the two particles, their (non-relativistic) [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] can be solved in analytic form, as can the (relativistic) [[Dirac equation]]. The solutions are one-electron functions and are referred to as ''hydrogen-like atomic orbitals''.<ref>In quantum chemistry an orbital is synonymous with \"a one-electron function\", a square integrable function of <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, <math>z</math>.</ref>\n\nOther systems may also be referred to as \"hydrogen-like atoms\", such as [[muonium]] (an electron orbiting an [[muon|antimuon]]), [[positronium]] (an electron and a [[positron]]), certain [[exotic atom]]s (formed with other particles), or [[Rydberg atom]]s (in which one electron is in such a high energy state that it sees the rest of the atom practically as a [[point charge]]).\n\n==Schr\u00f6dinger solution==\nIn the solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is non-relativistic, hydrogen-like atomic orbitals are [[eigenfunction]]s of the one-electron angular momentum operator '''''L''''' and its ''z'' component ''L''<sub>z</sub>. A hydrogen-like atomic orbital is uniquely identified by the values of the [[principal quantum number]] ''n'', the [[Azimuthal quantum number|angular momentum quantum number]] ''l'', and the [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m''. The energy eigenvalues do not depend on ''l'' or ''m'', but solely on ''n''. To these must be added the two-valued [[spin quantum number]] ''m<sub>s</sub>'' = \u00b1\u00bd, setting the stage for the [[Aufbau principle]]. This principle restricts the allowed values of the four quantum numbers in [[electron configuration]]s of more-electron atoms. In hydrogen-like atoms all degenerate orbitals of fixed ''n'' and ''l'', ''m'' and ''s'' varying between certain values (see below) form an [[electron shell|atomic shell]].\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation of atoms or ions with more than one electron has not been solved analytically, because of the computational difficulty imposed by the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Numerical methods must be applied in order to obtain (approximate) wavefunctions or other properties from quantum mechanical calculations. Due to the spherical symmetry (of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), the total angular momentum '''''J''''' of an atom is a conserved quantity. Many numerical procedures start from products of atomic orbitals that are eigenfunctions of the one-electron operators '''''L''''' and ''L''<sub>z</sub>. The radial parts of these atomic orbitals are sometimes numerical tables or are sometimes [[Slater orbitals]]. By [[angular momentum coupling]] many-electron eigenfunctions of '''''J'''''<sup>2</sup> (and possibly '''''S'''''<sup>2</sup>) are constructed.\n\nIn quantum chemical calculations hydrogen-like atomic orbitals cannot serve as an expansion basis, because they are not complete. The non-square-integrable continuum (E > 0) states must be included to obtain a complete set, i.e., to span all of one-electron Hilbert space.<ref>This was observed as early as 1928 by E. A. Hylleraas, ''Z. f. Physik'' vol. '''48''', p. 469 (1928). English translation in H. Hettema, ''Quantum Chemistry, Classic Scientific Papers'', p. 81, World Scientific, Singapore (2000). Later it was pointed out again by H. Shull and P.-O. L\u00f6wdin, ''J. Chem. Phys.'' vol. '''23''', p. 1362 (1955).</ref>\n\nIn the simplest model, the atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms/ions are solutions to the [[particle in a spherically symmetric potential|Schr\u00f6dinger equation in a spherically symmetric potential]]. In this case, the [[potential]] term is the potential given by [[Coulomb's law]]:\n\n:<math>V(r) = -\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Ze^2}{r}</math>\n\nwhere\n* \u03b5<sub>0</sub> is the [[Permittivity#Vacuum permittivity|permittivity]] of the vacuum,\n* ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]] (number of protons in the nucleus),\n* ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] (charge of an electron),\n* ''r'' is the distance of the electron from the nucleus.\n\nAfter writing the wave function as a product of functions:\n:<math>\\psi(r, \\theta, \\phi) = R_{nl}(r)Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\\,</math>\n(in [[spherical coordinates]]), where <math>Y_{lm}</math> are [[spherical harmonics]], we arrive at the following Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n:<math>\n- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\left[{1 \\over r^2}{\\partial \\over \\partial r}\\left(r^2 {\\partial R(r)\\over \\partial r}\\right) - {l(l+1)R(r)\\over r^2} \\right] + V(r)R(r) = E R(r),\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is, approximately, the [[mass]] of the [[electron]] (more accurately, it is the [[reduced mass]] of the system consisting of the electron and the nucleus), and <math>\\hbar</math> is the reduced [[Planck constant]].\n\nDifferent values of ''l'' give solutions with different [[angular momentum]], where ''l'' (a non-negative integer) is the [[quantum number]] of the orbital [[angular momentum]]. The [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m'' (satisfying <math>-l\\le m\\le l</math>) is the (quantized) projection of the orbital angular momentum on the ''z''-axis. See [[Particle in a spherically symmetric potential#Hydrogen-like atoms|here]] for the steps leading to the solution of this equation.\n\n===Non-relativistic wavefunction and energy===\n[[File:2D_Spherical_Harmonic_Orbitals.png|thumb|300px|right|Schr\u00f6dinger 3D Spherical Harmonic orbital solutions in 2D Density plots with Mathematica(TM) generating source code snippet at the top]]\n[[File:Atomic orbitals n1234 m-eigenstates.png|thumb|300px|right|All <math>\\psi_{nlm}</math> eigenfunctions up to ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4. The solid orbitals enclose the volume above a certain probability density threshold. The colors depict the complex phase.]]\n\nIn addition to ''l'' and ''m'', a third integer ''n'' > 0, emerges from the boundary conditions placed on ''R''. The functions ''R'' and ''Y'' that solve the equations above depend on the values of these integers, called ''[[quantum number]]s''. It is customary to subscript the wave functions with the values of the quantum numbers they depend on. The final expression for the normalized wave function is:\n\n:<math>\\psi_{nlm} = R_{nl}(r)\\, Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)</math>\n\n:<math> R_{nl} (r) = \\sqrt {{\\left ( \\frac{2 Z}{n a_{\\mu}} \\right ) }^3\\frac{(n-l-1)!}{2n(n+l)!} } e^{- Z r / {n a_{\\mu}}} \\left ( \\frac{2 Z r}{n a_{\\mu}} \\right )^{l} L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1} \\left ( \\frac{2 Z r}{n a_{\\mu}} \\right ) </math>\n\nwhere:\n* <math>L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}</math> are the [[Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomials]] in the definition given [[Laguerre polynomials|here]].\n* <math>a_{\\mu} = {{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\hbar^2}\\over{\\mu e^2}} = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\alpha\\mu c^2} ={{m_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\over{\\mu}} a_0</math>\n:where <math> \\alpha </math> is the [[fine structure constant]]. Here, <math>\\mu</math> is the reduced mass of the nucleus-electron system, that is, <math>\\mu = {{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\over{m_{\\mathrm{N}}+m_{\\mathrm{e}}}}</math> where <math>m_{\\mathrm{N}}</math> is the mass of the nucleus.

Among other things, this article gives group-theoretical reasons why <math>l < n\\,</math> and <math>-l \\le m \\le \\,l </math>.\n\n===Angular momentum===\n\nEach atomic orbital is associated with an [[angular momentum]] '''L'''. It is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector operator]], and the eigenvalues of its square ''L''<sup>2</sup> \u2261 L<sub>''x''</sub><sup>2</sup> + L<sub>''y''</sub><sup>2</sup> + L<sub>''z''</sub><sup>2</sup> are given by:\n\n:<math>L^2 Y_{lm} = \\hbar^2 l(l+1) Y_{lm} </math>\n\nThe projection of this vector onto an arbitrary direction is [[quantization (physics)|quantized]]. If the arbitrary direction is called ''z'', the quantization is given by:\n\n:<math>L_{\\mathrm{z}} Y_{lm} = \\hbar m Y_{lm}, </math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is restricted as described above. Note that ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>''z''</sub> commute and have a common eigenstate, which is in accordance with Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]]. Since ''L''<sub>''x''</sub> and ''L''<sub>''y''</sub> do not commute with ''L''<sub>''z''</sub>, it is not possible to find a state that is an eigenstate of all three components simultaneously. Hence the values of the ''x'' and ''y'' components are not sharp, but are given by a probability function of finite width. The fact that the ''x'' and ''y'' components are not well-determined, implies that the direction of the angular momentum vector is not well determined either, although its component along the ''z''-axis is sharp.\n\nThese relations do not give the total angular momentum of the electron. For that, electron [[spin (physics)|spin]] must be included.\n\nThis quantization of angular momentum closely parallels that proposed by [[Niels Bohr]] (see [[Bohr model]]) in 1913, with no knowledge of wavefunctions.\n\n===Including spin-orbit interaction===\n{{details|Angular momentum coupling}}\nIn a real atom, the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a moving electron can interact with the [[electric field]] of the nucleus through relativistic effects, a phenomenon known as [[spin-orbit interaction]]. When one takes this coupling into account, the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] and the [[Angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] are no longer [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conserved]], which can be pictured by the [[electron]] [[precess]]ing. Therefore, one has to replace the quantum numbers ''l'', ''m'' and the projection of the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] ''m<sub>s</sub>'' by quantum numbers that represent the total angular momentum (including [[Spin (physics)|spin]]), ''j'' and ''m<sub>j</sub>'', as well as the [[quantum number]] of [[Parity (physics)|parity]].\n\nSee the next section on the Dirac equation for a solution that includes the coupling.\n\n==Solution to Dirac equation==\nIn 1928 in England [[Paul Dirac]] found [[Dirac equation|an equation]] that was fully compatible with [[Special Relativity]]. The equation was solved for hydrogen-like atoms the same year (assuming a simple Coulomb potential around a point charge) by the German [[Walter Gordon (physicist)|Walter Gordon]]. Instead of a single (possibly complex) function as in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, one must find four complex functions that make up a [[bispinor]]. The first and second functions (or components of the spinor) correspond (in the usual basis) to spin \"up\" and spin \"down\" states, as do the third and fourth components.\n\nThe terms \"spin up\" and \"spin down\" are relative to a chosen direction, conventionally the z direction. An electron may be in a superposition of spin up and spin down, which corresponds to the spin axis pointing in some other direction. The spin state may depend on location.\n\nAn electron in the vicinity of a nucleus necessarily has non-zero amplitudes for the third and fourth components. Far from the nucleus these may be small, but near the nucleus they become large.\n\nThe [[eigenfunction]]s of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which means functions with a definite energy (and which therefore do not evolve except for a phase shift), have energies characterized not by the quantum number ''n'' only (as for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation), but by ''n'' and a quantum number ''j'', the [[total angular momentum quantum number]]. The quantum number ''j'' determines the sum of the squares of the three angular momenta to be ''j''(''j''+1) (times ''\u0127''<sup>2</sup>, see [[Planck constant]]). These angular momenta include both orbital angular momentum (having to do with the angular dependence of \u03c8) and spin angular momentum (having to do with the spin state). The splitting of the energies of states of the same [[principal quantum number]] ''n'' due to differences in ''j'' is called [[fine structure]]. The total angular momentum quantum number ''j'' ranges from 1/2 to ''n''\u22121/2.\n\nThe orbitals for a given state can be written using two radial functions and two angle functions. The radial functions depend on both the principal quantum number ''n'' and an integer ''k'', defined as:\n\n:<math>k = \\begin{cases}\n-j-\\tfrac 1 2 & \\text{if }j=\\ell+\\tfrac 1 2 \\\\\nj+\\tfrac 1 2 & \\text{if }j=\\ell-\\tfrac 1 2\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhere \u2113 is the [[azimuthal quantum number]] that ranges from 0 to ''n''\u22121. The angle functions depend on ''k'' and on a quantum number ''m'' which ranges from \u2212''j'' to ''j'' by steps of 1. The states are labeled using the letters S, P, D, F et cetera to stand for states with \u2113 equal to 0, 1, 2, 3 et cetera (see [[azimuthal quantum number]]), with a subscript giving ''j''. For instance, the states for ''n''=4 are given in the following table (these would be prefaced by ''n'', for example 4S<sub>1/2</sub>):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! !!

There are 2''n''<sup>2</sup> states with principal quantum number ''n'', 4''j''+2 of them with any allowed ''j'' except the highest (''j''=''n''\u22121/2) for which there are only 2''j''+1. Since the orbitals having given values of ''n'' and ''j'' have the same energy according to the Dirac equation, they form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space of functions having that energy.\n\nThe energy, as a function of ''n'' and |''k''| (equal to ''j''+1/2), is:\n\n::<math>\\begin{array}{rl} E_{n\\,j} & = \\mu c^2\\left(1+\\left[\\dfrac{Z\\alpha}{n-|k|+\\sqrt{k^2-Z^2\\alpha^2}}\\right]^2\\right)^{-1/2}\\\\ &\\\\& \\approx \\mu c^2\\left\\{1-\\dfrac{Z^2\\alpha^2}{2n^2} \\left[1 + \\dfrac{Z^2\\alpha^2}n\\left(\\dfrac 1{|k|} - \\dfrac 3{4n} \\right) \\right]\\right\\} \\end{array}</math>\n\n(The energy of course depends on the zero-point used.) Note that if {{mvar|Z}} were able to be more than 137 (higher than any known element) then we would have a negative value inside the square root for the S<sub>1/2</sub> and P<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals, which means they would not exist. The Schr\u00f6dinger solution corresponds to replacing the inner bracket in the second expression by 1. The accuracy of the energy difference between the lowest two hydrogen states calculated from the Schr\u00f6dinger solution is about 9 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (90 \u03bc[[Electron volt|eV]] too low, out of around 10 eV), whereas the accuracy of the Dirac equation for the same energy difference is about 3 ppm (too high). The Schr\u00f6dinger solution always puts the states at slightly higher energies than the more accurate Dirac equation. The Dirac equation gives some levels of hydrogen quite accurately (for instance the 4P<sub>1/2</sub> state is given an energy only about {{val|2|e=-10}} eV too high), others less so (for instance, the 2S<sub>1/2</sub> level is about {{val|4|e=-6}} eV too low).<ref>Calculated from Table 4.1 in {{cite web|title=The Quantum Theory of the Hydrogen Atom|url=http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~brezinsk/data/Hydrogenatom.pdf|accessdate=Oct 20, 2013|author=Felix Nendzig|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020180828/http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~brezinsk/data/Hydrogenatom.pdf|archivedate=October 20, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The modifications of the energy due to using the Dirac equation rather than the Schr\u00f6dinger solution is of the order of \u03b1<sup>2</sup>, and for this reason \u03b1 is called the [[fine structure constant]].\n\nThe solution to the Dirac equation for quantum numbers ''n'', ''k'', and ''m'', is:\n\n<math>\\Psi=\\begin{pmatrix}\ng_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\Omega_{k,m}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\\nif_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\Omega_{-k,m}(\\theta,\\phi)\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\ng_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\sqrt{(k+\\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(2k+1)}Y_{k,m-1/2}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\\n-g_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\sgn k\\sqrt{(k+\\tfrac 1 2 +m)/(2k+1)}Y_{k,m+1/2}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\\nif_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\sqrt{(-k+\\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(-2k+1)}Y_{-k,m-1/2}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\\n-if_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\sgn k\\sqrt{(-k+\\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(-2k+1)}Y_{-k,m+1/2}(\\theta,\\phi)\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the \u03a9s are columns of the two [[spherical harmonics]] functions shown to the right. <math>Y_{a,b}(\\theta,\\phi)</math> signifies a spherical harmonic function:\n\n:<math>Y_{a,b}(\\theta,\\phi)= \\begin{cases}\n(-1)^b\\sqrt{\\frac{2a+1}{4\\pi}\\frac{(a-b)!}{(a+b)!}}P_a^b(\\cos\\theta)e^{ib\\phi} & \\text{if }a>0\\\\\nY_{-a-1,b}(\\theta,\\phi)& \\text{if }a<0\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nin which <math>P_a^b</math> is an [[associated Legendre polynomial]]. (Note that the definition of \u03a9 may involve a spherical harmonic that doesn't exist, like <math>Y_{0,1}</math>, but the coefficient on it will be zero.)\n\nHere is the behavior of some of these angular functions.

In the P<sub>1/2</sub> solution (''k'' = 1), the situation is reversed. In both cases, the spin of each component compensates for its orbital angular momentum around the ''z'' axis to give the right value for the total angular momentum around the ''z'' axis.\n\nThe two \u03a9 spinors obey the relationship:\n\n:<math>\\Omega_{k,m}=\\begin{pmatrix}\nz/r & (x-iy)/r\\\\\n(x+iy)/r & -z/r\n\\end{pmatrix}\\Omega_{-k,m}</math>\n\nTo write the functions <math>g_{n,k}(r)</math> and <math>f_{n,k}(r)</math> let us define a scaled radius \u03c1:\n\n:<math>\\rho\\equiv 2Cr</math>\nwith\n:<math>C=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu^2c^4-E^2}}{\\hbar c}</math>\n\nwhere E is the energy (<math>E_{n\\,j}</math>) given above.

Note that the dominant term is quite similar to corresponding the Schr\u00f6dinger solution&nbsp;\u2013 the upper index on the Laguerre polynomial is slightly less (2\u03b3+1 or 2\u03b3\u22121 rather than 2\u2113+1, which is the nearest integer), as is the power of \u03c1 (\u03b3 or \u03b3\u22121 instead of \u2113, the nearest integer). The exponential decay is slightly faster than in the Schr\u00f6dinger solution.\n\nThe normalization factor makes the integral over all space of the square of the absolute value equal to 1.\n\n===1S orbital===\nHere is the 1S<sub>1/2</sub> orbital, spin up, without normalization:\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n(1+\\gamma)r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\\\\n0\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}z/r\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x+iy)/r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nNote that \u03b3 is a little less than 1, so the top function is similar to an exponentially decreasing function of ''r'' except that at very small ''r'' it theoretically goes to infinity. But the value of the <math>r^{\\gamma-1}</math> only surpasses 10 at a value of ''r'' smaller than <math>10^{1/(\\gamma-1)},</math> which is a very small number (much less than the radius of a proton) unless {{mvar|Z}} is very large.\n\nThe 1S<sub>1/2</sub> orbital, spin down, without normalization, comes out as:\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\n(1+\\gamma)r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x-iy)/r\\\\\n-iZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}z/r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nWe can mix these in order to obtain orbitals with the spin oriented in some other direction, such as:\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n(1+\\gamma)r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\\\\n(1+\\gamma)r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x-iy+z)/r\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x+iy-z)/r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhich corresponds to the spin and angular momentum axis pointing in the x direction. Adding ''i'' times the \"down\" spin to the \"up\" spin gives an orbital oriented in the y direction.\n\n===2P<sub>1/2</sub> and 2S<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals===\n\nTo give another example, the 2P<sub>1/2</sub> orbital, spin up, is proportional to:\n\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\rho^{\\gamma-1} e^{-\\rho/2}\\left(Z\\alpha\\rho+(\\gamma-1)\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2-E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)z/r\\\\\n\\rho^{\\gamma-1} e^{-\\rho/2}\\left(Z\\alpha\\rho+(\\gamma-1)\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2-E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)(x+iy)/r\\\\\ni\\rho^{\\gamma-1}e^{-\\rho/2}\\left((\\gamma-1)\\rho+Z\\alpha\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2-E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\n(Remember that <math>\\rho=2rC</math>. ''C'' is about half what it is for the 1S orbital, but \u03b3 is still the same.)\n\nNotice that when \u03c1 is small compared to \u03b1 (or ''r'' is small compared to <math>\\hbar c/(\\mu c^2)</math>) the \"S\" type orbital dominates (the third component of the bispinor).\n\nFor the 2S<sub>1/2</sub> spin up orbital, we have:\n\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\rho^{\\gamma-1} e^{-\\rho/2}\\left(Z\\alpha\\rho+(\\gamma+1)\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2+E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)\\\\\n0\\\\\ni\\rho^{\\gamma-1}e^{-\\rho/2}\\left((\\gamma+1)\\rho+Z\\alpha\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2+E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)z/r\\\\\ni\\rho^{\\gamma-1}e^{-\\rho/2}\\left((\\gamma+1)\\rho+Z\\alpha\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2+E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)(x+iy)/r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nNow the first component is S-like and there is a radius near \u03c1 = 2 where it goes to zero, whereas the bottom two-component part is P-like.\n\n===Negative-energy solutions===\nIn addition to bound states, in which the energy is less than that of an electron infinitely separated from the nucleus, there are solutions to the Dirac equation at higher energy, corresponding to an unbound electron interacting with the nucleus. These solutions are not normalizable, but solutions can be found which tend toward zero as {{mvar|r}} goes to infinity (which is not possible when <math>|E|<\\mu c^2</math> except at the above-mentioned bound-state values of {{mvar|E}}). There are similar solutions with <math>E<-\\mu c^2.</math> These negative-energy solutions are just like positive-energy solutions having the opposite energy but for a case in which the nucleus repels the electron instead of attracting it, except that the solutions for the top two components switch places with those for the bottom two.\n\nNegative-energy solutions to Dirac's equation exist even in the absence of a Coulomb force exerted by a nucleus. Dirac hypothesized that we can consider almost all of these states to be already filled. If one of these negative-energy states is not filled, this manifests itself as though there is an electron which is ''repelled'' by a positively-charged nucleus. This prompted Dirac to hypothesize the existence of positively-charged electrons, and his prediction was confirmed with the discovery of the [[positron]].\n\n==Beyond Gordon's solution to the Dirac equation==\nThe Dirac equation with a simple Coulomb potential generated by a point-like non-magnetic nucleus was not the last word, and its predictions differ from experimental results as mentioned earlier. More accurate results include the [[Lamb shift]] (radiative corrections arising from [[quantum electrodynamics]])<ref>For the radiative correction, see Nendzig, opus citatum.</ref> and [[hyperfine structure]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rydberg atom]]\n*[[Positronium]]\n*[[Exotic atom]]\n*[[Two-electron atom]]\n*[[Dihydrogen cation|Hydrogen molecular ion]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Atomic models}}\n\n==References==\n\n* {{Cite book |title=Mathematical Methods in Quantum Mechanics; With Applications to Schr\u00f6dinger Operators |author= Gerald Teschl |authorlink= Gerald Teschl |publisher= [[American Mathematical Society]] |year=2009 |url=http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-schroe/ |isbn=978-0-8218-4660-5 }}\n* Tipler, Paul & Ralph Llewellyn (2003).

Examples of hydrogen-like atoms/ions are [[Hydrogen]] itself, [[Helium|He<sup>+</sup>]], [[Lithium|Li<sup>2+</sup>]], [[Beryllium|Be<sup>3+</sup>]] and [[Boron|B<sup>4+</sup>]]. Because hydrogen-like atoms/ions are two-particle systems with an interaction depending only on the distance between the two particles, their (non-relativistic) [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] can be solved in analytic form, as can the (relativistic) [[Dirac equation]]. The solutions are one-electron functions and are referred to as ''hydrogen-like atomic orbitals''.<ref>In quantum chemistry an orbital is synonymous with \"a one-electron function\", a square integrable function of <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, <math>z</math>.</ref>\n\nOther systems may also be referred to as \"hydrogen-like atoms\", such as [[muonium]] (an electron orbiting an [[muon|antimuon]]), [[positronium]] (an electron and a [[positron]]), certain [[exotic atom]]s (formed with other particles), or [[Rydberg atom]]s (in which one electron is in such a high energy state that it sees the rest of the atom practically as a [[point charge]]).\n\n==Schr\u00f6dinger solution==\nIn the solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is non-relativistic, hydrogen-like atomic orbitals are [[eigenfunction]]s of the one-electron angular momentum operator '''''L''''' and its ''z'' component ''L''<sub>z</sub>. A hydrogen-like atomic orbital is uniquely identified by the values of the [[principal quantum number]] ''n'', the [[Azimuthal quantum number|angular momentum quantum number]] ''l'', and the [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m''. The energy eigenvalues do not depend on ''l'' or ''m'', but solely on ''n''. To these must be added the two-valued [[spin quantum number]] ''m<sub>s</sub>'' = \u00b1\u00bd, setting the stage for the [[Aufbau principle]]. This principle restricts the allowed values of the four quantum numbers in [[electron configuration]]s of more-electron atoms. In hydrogen-like atoms all degenerate orbitals of fixed ''n'' and ''l'', ''m'' and ''s'' varying between certain values (see below) form an [[electron shell|atomic shell]].\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation of atoms or ions with more than one electron has not been solved analytically, because of the computational difficulty imposed by the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Numerical methods must be applied in order to obtain (approximate) wavefunctions or other properties from quantum mechanical calculations. Due to the spherical symmetry (of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), the total angular momentum '''''J''''' of an atom is a conserved quantity. Many numerical procedures start from products of atomic orbitals that are eigenfunctions of the one-electron operators '''''L''''' and ''L''<sub>z</sub>. The radial parts of these atomic orbitals are sometimes numerical tables or are sometimes [[Slater orbitals]]. By [[angular momentum coupling]] many-electron eigenfunctions of '''''J'''''<sup>2</sup> (and possibly '''''S'''''<sup>2</sup>) are constructed.\n\nIn quantum chemical calculations hydrogen-like atomic orbitals cannot serve as an expansion basis, because they are not complete. The non-square-integrable continuum (E > 0) states must be included to obtain a complete set, i.e., to span all of one-electron Hilbert space.<ref>This was observed as early as 1928 by E. A. Hylleraas, ''Z. f. Physik'' vol. '''48''', p. 469 (1928). English translation in H. Hettema, ''Quantum Chemistry, Classic Scientific Papers'', p. 81, World Scientific, Singapore (2000).

'''23''', p. 1362 (1955).</ref>\n\nIn the simplest model, the atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms/ions are solutions to the [[particle in a spherically symmetric potential|Schr\u00f6dinger equation in a spherically symmetric potential]]. In this case, the [[potential]] term is the potential given by [[Coulomb's law]]:\n\n:<math>V(r) = -\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Ze^2}{r}</math>\n\nwhere\n* \u03b5<sub>0</sub> is the [[Permittivity#Vacuum permittivity|permittivity]] of the vacuum,\n* ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]] (number of protons in the nucleus),\n* ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] (charge of an electron),\n* ''r'' is the distance of the electron from the nucleus.\n\nAfter writing the wave function as a product of functions:\n:<math>\\psi(r, \\theta, \\phi) = R_{nl}(r)Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\\,</math>\n(in [[spherical coordinates]]), where <math>Y_{lm}</math> are [[spherical harmonics]], we arrive at the following Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n:<math>\n- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\left[{1 \\over r^2}{\\partial \\over \\partial r}\\left(r^2 {\\partial R(r)\\over \\partial r}\\right) - {l(l+1)R(r)\\over r^2} \\right] + V(r)R(r) = E R(r),\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is, approximately, the [[mass]] of the [[electron]] (more accurately, it is the [[reduced mass]] of the system consisting of the electron and the nucleus), and <math>\\hbar</math> is the reduced [[Planck constant]].\n\nDifferent values of ''l'' give solutions with different [[angular momentum]], where ''l'' (a non-negative integer) is the [[quantum number]] of the orbital [[angular momentum]]. The [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m'' (satisfying <math>-l\\le m\\le l</math>) is the (quantized) projection of the orbital angular momentum on the ''z''-axis. See [[Particle in a spherically symmetric potential#Hydrogen-like atoms|here]] for the steps leading to the solution of this equation.\n\n===Non-relativistic wavefunction and energy===\n[[File:2D_Spherical_Harmonic_Orbitals.png|thumb|300px|right|Schr\u00f6dinger 3D Spherical Harmonic orbital solutions in 2D Density plots with Mathematica(TM) generating source code snippet at the top]]\n[[File:Atomic orbitals n1234 m-eigenstates.png|thumb|300px|right|All <math>\\psi_{nlm}</math> eigenfunctions up to ''n''=4.

The functions ''R'' and ''Y'' that solve the equations above depend on the values of these integers, called ''[[quantum number]]s''. It is customary to subscript the wave functions with the values of the quantum numbers they depend on. The final expression for the normalized wave function is:\n\n:<math>\\psi_{nlm} = R_{nl}(r)\\, Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)</math>\n\n:<math> R_{nl} (r) = \\sqrt {{\\left ( \\frac{2 Z}{n a_{\\mu}} \\right ) }^3\\frac{(n-l-1)!}{2n(n+l)!} } e^{- Z r / {n a_{\\mu}}} \\left ( \\frac{2 Z r}{n a_{\\mu}} \\right )^{l} L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1} \\left ( \\frac{2 Z r}{n a_{\\mu}} \\right ) </math>\n\nwhere:\n* <math>L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}</math> are the [[Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomials]] in the definition given [[Laguerre polynomials|here]].\n* <math>a_{\\mu} = {{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\hbar^2}\\over{\\mu e^2}} = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\alpha\\mu c^2} ={{m_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\over{\\mu}} a_0</math>\n:where <math> \\alpha </math> is the [[fine structure constant]].

Among other things, this article gives group-theoretical reasons why <math>l < n\\,</math> and <math>-l \\le m \\le \\,l </math>.\n\n===Angular momentum===\n\nEach atomic orbital is associated with an [[angular momentum]] '''L'''. It is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector operator]], and the eigenvalues of its square ''L''<sup>2</sup> \u2261 L<sub>''x''</sub><sup>2</sup> + L<sub>''y''</sub><sup>2</sup> + L<sub>''z''</sub><sup>2</sup> are given by:\n\n:<math>L^2 Y_{lm} = \\hbar^2 l(l+1) Y_{lm} </math>\n\nThe projection of this vector onto an arbitrary direction is [[quantization (physics)|quantized]]. If the arbitrary direction is called ''z'', the quantization is given by:\n\n:<math>L_{\\mathrm{z}} Y_{lm} = \\hbar m Y_{lm}, </math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is restricted as described above. Note that ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>''z''</sub> commute and have a common eigenstate, which is in accordance with Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]]. Since ''L''<sub>''x''</sub> and ''L''<sub>''y''</sub> do not commute with ''L''<sub>''z''</sub>, it is not possible to find a state that is an eigenstate of all three components simultaneously. Hence the values of the ''x'' and ''y'' components are not sharp, but are given by a probability function of finite width. The fact that the ''x'' and ''y'' components are not well-determined, implies that the direction of the angular momentum vector is not well determined either, although its component along the ''z''-axis is sharp.\n\nThese relations do not give the total angular momentum of the electron. For that, electron [[spin (physics)|spin]] must be included.\n\nThis quantization of angular momentum closely parallels that proposed by [[Niels Bohr]] (see [[Bohr model]]) in 1913, with no knowledge of wavefunctions.\n\n===Including spin-orbit interaction===\n{{details|Angular momentum coupling}}\nIn a real atom, the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a moving electron can interact with the [[electric field]] of the nucleus through relativistic effects, a phenomenon known as [[spin-orbit interaction]]. When one takes this coupling into account, the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] and the [[Angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] are no longer [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conserved]], which can be pictured by the [[electron]] [[precess]]ing. Therefore, one has to replace the quantum numbers ''l'', ''m'' and the projection of the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] ''m<sub>s</sub>'' by quantum numbers that represent the total angular momentum (including [[Spin (physics)|spin]]), ''j'' and ''m<sub>j</sub>'', as well as the [[quantum number]] of [[Parity (physics)|parity]].\n\nSee the next section on the Dirac equation for a solution that includes the coupling.\n\n==Solution to Dirac equation==\nIn 1928 in England [[Paul Dirac]] found [[Dirac equation|an equation]] that was fully compatible with [[Special Relativity]]. The equation was solved for hydrogen-like atoms the same year (assuming a simple Coulomb potential around a point charge) by the German [[Walter Gordon (physicist)|Walter Gordon]]. Instead of a single (possibly complex) function as in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, one must find four complex functions that make up a [[bispinor]]. The first and second functions (or components of the spinor) correspond (in the usual basis) to spin \"up\" and spin \"down\" states, as do the third and fourth components.\n\nThe terms \"spin up\" and \"spin down\" are relative to a chosen direction, conventionally the z direction. An electron may be in a superposition of spin up and spin down, which corresponds to the spin axis pointing in some other direction. The spin state may depend on location.\n\nAn electron in the vicinity of a nucleus necessarily has non-zero amplitudes for the third and fourth components. Far from the nucleus these may be small, but near the nucleus they become large.\n\nThe [[eigenfunction]]s of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which means functions with a definite energy (and which therefore do not evolve except for a phase shift), have energies characterized not by the quantum number ''n'' only (as for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation), but by ''n'' and a quantum number ''j'', the [[total angular momentum quantum number]]. The quantum number ''j'' determines the sum of the squares of the three angular momenta to be ''j''(''j''+1) (times ''\u0127''<sup>2</sup>, see [[Planck constant]]). These angular momenta include both orbital angular momentum (having to do with the angular dependence of \u03c8) and spin angular momentum (having to do with the spin state). The splitting of the energies of states of the same [[principal quantum number]] ''n'' due to differences in ''j'' is called [[fine structure]]. The total angular momentum quantum number ''j'' ranges from 1/2 to ''n''\u22121/2.\n\nThe orbitals for a given state can be written using two radial functions and two angle functions. The radial functions depend on both the principal quantum number ''n'' and an integer ''k'', defined as:\n\n:<math>k = \\begin{cases}\n-j-\\tfrac 1 2 & \\text{if }j=\\ell+\\tfrac 1 2 \\\\\nj+\\tfrac 1 2 & \\text{if }j=\\ell-\\tfrac 1 2\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhere \u2113 is the [[azimuthal quantum number]] that ranges from 0 to ''n''\u22121. The angle functions depend on ''k'' and on a quantum number ''m'' which ranges from \u2212''j'' to ''j'' by steps of 1. The states are labeled using the letters S, P, D, F et cetera to stand for states with \u2113 equal to 0, 1, 2, 3 et cetera (see [[azimuthal quantum number]]), with a subscript giving ''j''. For instance, the states for ''n''=4 are given in the following table (these would be prefaced by ''n'', for example 4S<sub>1/2</sub>):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! !!

There are 2''n''<sup>2</sup> states with principal quantum number ''n'', 4''j''+2 of them with any allowed ''j'' except the highest (''j''=''n''\u22121/2) for which there are only 2''j''+1. Since the orbitals having given values of ''n'' and ''j'' have the same energy according to the Dirac equation, they form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space of functions having that energy.\n\nThe energy, as a function of ''n'' and |''k''| (equal to ''j''+1/2), is:\n\n::<math>\\begin{array}{rl} E_{n\\,j} & = \\mu c^2\\left(1+\\left[\\dfrac{Z\\alpha}{n-|k|+\\sqrt{k^2-Z^2\\alpha^2}}\\right]^2\\right)^{-1/2}\\\\ &\\\\& \\approx \\mu c^2\\left\\{1-\\dfrac{Z^2\\alpha^2}{2n^2} \\left[1 + \\dfrac{Z^2\\alpha^2}n\\left(\\dfrac 1{|k|} - \\dfrac 3{4n} \\right) \\right]\\right\\} \\end{array}</math>\n\n(The energy of course depends on the zero-point used.) Note that if {{mvar|Z}} were able to be more than 137 (higher than any known element) then we would have a negative value inside the square root for the S<sub>1/2</sub> and P<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals, which means they would not exist. The Schr\u00f6dinger solution corresponds to replacing the inner bracket in the second expression by 1. The accuracy of the energy difference between the lowest two hydrogen states calculated from the Schr\u00f6dinger solution is about 9 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (90 \u03bc[[Electron volt|eV]] too low, out of around 10 eV), whereas the accuracy of the Dirac equation for the same energy difference is about 3 ppm (too high). The Schr\u00f6dinger solution always puts the states at slightly higher energies than the more accurate Dirac equation. The Dirac equation gives some levels of hydrogen quite accurately (for instance the 4P<sub>1/2</sub> state is given an energy only about {{val|2|e=-10}} eV too high), others less so (for instance, the 2S<sub>1/2</sub> level is about {{val|4|e=-6}} eV too low).<ref>Calculated from Table 4.1 in {{cite web|title=The Quantum Theory of the Hydrogen Atom|url=http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~brezinsk/data/Hydrogenatom.pdf|accessdate=Oct 20, 2013|author=Felix Nendzig|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020180828/http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~brezinsk/data/Hydrogenatom.pdf|archivedate=October 20, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The modifications of the energy due to using the Dirac equation rather than the Schr\u00f6dinger solution is of the order of \u03b1<sup>2</sup>, and for this reason \u03b1 is called the [[fine structure constant]].\n\nThe solution to the Dirac equation for quantum numbers ''n'', ''k'', and ''m'', is:\n\n<math>\\Psi=\\begin{pmatrix}\ng_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\Omega_{k,m}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\\nif_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\Omega_{-k,m}(\\theta,\\phi)\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\ng_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\sqrt{(k+\\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(2k+1)}Y_{k,m-1/2}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\\n-g_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\sgn k\\sqrt{(k+\\tfrac 1 2 +m)/(2k+1)}Y_{k,m+1/2}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\\nif_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\sqrt{(-k+\\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(-2k+1)}Y_{-k,m-1/2}(\\theta,\\phi)\\\\\n-if_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\\sgn k\\sqrt{(-k+\\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(-2k+1)}Y_{-k,m+1/2}(\\theta,\\phi)\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the \u03a9s are columns of the two [[spherical harmonics]] functions shown to the right. <math>Y_{a,b}(\\theta,\\phi)</math> signifies a spherical harmonic function:\n\n:<math>Y_{a,b}(\\theta,\\phi)= \\begin{cases}\n(-1)^b\\sqrt{\\frac{2a+1}{4\\pi}\\frac{(a-b)!}{(a+b)!}}P_a^b(\\cos\\theta)e^{ib\\phi} & \\text{if }a>0\\\\\nY_{-a-1,b}(\\theta,\\phi)& \\text{if }a<0\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nin which <math>P_a^b</math> is an [[associated Legendre polynomial]]. (Note that the definition of \u03a9 may involve a spherical harmonic that doesn't exist, like <math>Y_{0,1}</math>, but the coefficient on it will be zero.)\n\nHere is the behavior of some of these angular functions.

In the P<sub>1/2</sub> solution (''k'' = 1), the situation is reversed. In both cases, the spin of each component compensates for its orbital angular momentum around the ''z'' axis to give the right value for the total angular momentum around the ''z'' axis.\n\nThe two \u03a9 spinors obey the relationship:\n\n:<math>\\Omega_{k,m}=\\begin{pmatrix}\nz/r & (x-iy)/r\\\\\n(x+iy)/r & -z/r\n\\end{pmatrix}\\Omega_{-k,m}</math>\n\nTo write the functions <math>g_{n,k}(r)</math> and <math>f_{n,k}(r)</math> let us define a scaled radius \u03c1:\n\n:<math>\\rho\\equiv 2Cr</math>\nwith\n:<math>C=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu^2c^4-E^2}}{\\hbar c}</math>\n\nwhere E is the energy (<math>E_{n\\,j}</math>) given above.

Note that the dominant term is quite similar to corresponding the Schr\u00f6dinger solution&nbsp;\u2013 the upper index on the Laguerre polynomial is slightly less (2\u03b3+1 or 2\u03b3\u22121 rather than 2\u2113+1, which is the nearest integer), as is the power of \u03c1 (\u03b3 or \u03b3\u22121 instead of \u2113, the nearest integer). The exponential decay is slightly faster than in the Schr\u00f6dinger solution.\n\nThe normalization factor makes the integral over all space of the square of the absolute value equal to 1.\n\n===1S orbital===\nHere is the 1S<sub>1/2</sub> orbital, spin up, without normalization:\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n(1+\\gamma)r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\\\\n0\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}z/r\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x+iy)/r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nNote that \u03b3 is a little less than 1, so the top function is similar to an exponentially decreasing function of ''r'' except that at very small ''r'' it theoretically goes to infinity. But the value of the <math>r^{\\gamma-1}</math> only surpasses 10 at a value of ''r'' smaller than <math>10^{1/(\\gamma-1)},</math> which is a very small number (much less than the radius of a proton) unless {{mvar|Z}} is very large.\n\nThe 1S<sub>1/2</sub> orbital, spin down, without normalization, comes out as:\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\n(1+\\gamma)r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x-iy)/r\\\\\n-iZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}z/r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nWe can mix these in order to obtain orbitals with the spin oriented in some other direction, such as:\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n(1+\\gamma)r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\\\\n(1+\\gamma)r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x-iy+z)/r\\\\\niZ\\alpha r^{\\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x+iy-z)/r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhich corresponds to the spin and angular momentum axis pointing in the x direction. Adding ''i'' times the \"down\" spin to the \"up\" spin gives an orbital oriented in the y direction.\n\n===2P<sub>1/2</sub> and 2S<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals===\n\nTo give another example, the 2P<sub>1/2</sub> orbital, spin up, is proportional to:\n\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\rho^{\\gamma-1} e^{-\\rho/2}\\left(Z\\alpha\\rho+(\\gamma-1)\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2-E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)z/r\\\\\n\\rho^{\\gamma-1} e^{-\\rho/2}\\left(Z\\alpha\\rho+(\\gamma-1)\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2-E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)(x+iy)/r\\\\\ni\\rho^{\\gamma-1}e^{-\\rho/2}\\left((\\gamma-1)\\rho+Z\\alpha\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2-E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\n(Remember that <math>\\rho=2rC</math>. ''C'' is about half what it is for the 1S orbital, but \u03b3 is still the same.)\n\nNotice that when \u03c1 is small compared to \u03b1 (or ''r'' is small compared to <math>\\hbar c/(\\mu c^2)</math>) the \"S\" type orbital dominates (the third component of the bispinor).\n\nFor the 2S<sub>1/2</sub> spin up orbital, we have:\n\n:<math>\\Psi\\propto\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\rho^{\\gamma-1} e^{-\\rho/2}\\left(Z\\alpha\\rho+(\\gamma+1)\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2+E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)\\\\\n0\\\\\ni\\rho^{\\gamma-1}e^{-\\rho/2}\\left((\\gamma+1)\\rho+Z\\alpha\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2+E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)z/r\\\\\ni\\rho^{\\gamma-1}e^{-\\rho/2}\\left((\\gamma+1)\\rho+Z\\alpha\\frac{\\gamma\\mu c^2+E}{\\hbar cC}(-\\rho+2\\gamma)\\right)(x+iy)/r\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nNow the first component is S-like and there is a radius near \u03c1 = 2 where it goes to zero, whereas the bottom two-component part is P-like.\n\n===Negative-energy solutions===\nIn addition to bound states, in which the energy is less than that of an electron infinitely separated from the nucleus, there are solutions to the Dirac equation at higher energy, corresponding to an unbound electron interacting with the nucleus. These solutions are not normalizable, but solutions can be found which tend toward zero as {{mvar|r}} goes to infinity (which is not possible when <math>|E|<\\mu c^2</math> except at the above-mentioned bound-state values of {{mvar|E}}). There are similar solutions with <math>E<-\\mu c^2.</math> These negative-energy solutions are just like positive-energy solutions having the opposite energy but for a case in which the nucleus repels the electron instead of attracting it, except that the solutions for the top two components switch places with those for the bottom two.\n\nNegative-energy solutions to Dirac's equation exist even in the absence of a Coulomb force exerted by a nucleus. Dirac hypothesized that we can consider almost all of these states to be already filled. If one of these negative-energy states is not filled, this manifests itself as though there is an electron which is ''repelled'' by a positively-charged nucleus. This prompted Dirac to hypothesize the existence of positively-charged electrons, and his prediction was confirmed with the discovery of the [[positron]].\n\n==Beyond Gordon's solution to the Dirac equation==\nThe Dirac equation with a simple Coulomb potential generated by a point-like non-magnetic nucleus was not the last word, and its predictions differ from experimental results as mentioned earlier. More accurate results include the [[Lamb shift]] (radiative corrections arising from [[quantum electrodynamics]])<ref>For the radiative correction, see Nendzig, opus citatum.</ref> and [[hyperfine structure]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rydberg atom]]\n*[[Positronium]]\n*[[Exotic atom]]\n*[[Two-electron atom]]\n*[[Dihydrogen cation|Hydrogen molecular ion]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Atomic models}}\n\n==References==\n\n* {{Cite book |title=Mathematical Methods in Quantum Mechanics; With Applications to Schr\u00f6dinger Operators |author= Gerald Teschl |authorlink= Gerald Teschl |publisher= [[American Mathematical Society]] |year=2009 |url=http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-schroe/ |isbn=978-0-8218-4660-5 }}\n* Tipler, Paul & Ralph Llewellyn (2003).

He recorded six demos of the song in 1979 and 1980 with \"'''Real Life'''\", a different song that merged with \"Real Love\". In 1988, the sixth take was posthumously released for the documentary soundtrack ''[[Imagine: John Lennon (soundtrack)|Imagine: John Lennon]]''. In 1995, his demo was completed by his former Beatles bandmates ([[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]]) as part of the ''[[The Beatles Anthology|Beatles Anthology]]'' project, along with \"[[Free as a Bird]]\".\n\nThe song was released as a Beatles single in 1996 in the United Kingdom, United States and many other countries. It reached number 4 and number 11, respectively, in the UK and US singles charts, and earned a gold record more quickly than a number of the group's other singles. The song was not included on the [[BBC Radio 1]] playlist, prompting criticism from fans and British Members of Parliament. The track opened the Beatles' ''[[Anthology 2]]'' album. It is the last single by the Beatles to become a top 40 hit in the US, the last released record of new material credited to the Beatles, and the last to originate and be included on an album.\n\n==Early origins==\nAccording to Beatles biographer John T. Marck, \"Real Love\" originated as part of an unfinished stage play that Lennon was working on at the time, titled ''The Ballad of John and Yoko''. The song was first recorded in 1977 with a handheld tape recorder on his piano at home. Eventually the work evolved under the title \"Real Life\", a song which Lennon would record at least six times in 1979 and 1980, and was then abandoned. The song was eventually combined with elements of another Lennon demo, \"Baby Make Love to You\".<ref>Marck, John T. [http://www.iamthebeatles.com/article1043.html Oh Look Out!

The demo with just Lennon on piano was issued in 1998 on ''[[John Lennon Anthology]]'' and then later on ''[[Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon]]''.\n\n==Reuniting the Beatles==\nBefore [[The Beatles Anthology|the Anthology project]], the closest the Beatles had come to reuniting on record (while all four members were still alive) was for Starr's ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]'' album in 1973, when Lennon, Harrison and Starr collaborated on \"[[I'm the Greatest]]\". By the early 1990s, the idea of redoing some of Lennon's old songs was inspired by former Beatles road manager [[Neil Aspinall]] and Harrison, who first requested some demos from Ono. In January 1994, McCartney went to [[New York City]] for Lennon's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. While there, he received at least four songs from Ono. According to Aspinall, it was \"two cassettes\" which \"might have been five or six tracks\". Ono said of the occasion: \"It was all settled before then, I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul. I did not break up the Beatles, but I was there at the time, you know? Now I'm in a position where I could bring them back together and I would not want to hinder that.\"<ref name=\"fm94\">Maclauchlan, Paul (1998).

I'd never heard them before but she explained that they're quite well known to Lennon fans as bootlegs. I said to Yoko, \"Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough. If it doesn't work out, you can veto it.\" When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that, they were going, \"What? What if we love it?\" It didn't come to that, luckily.<ref name=\"fm94\"/></blockquote>\n\nMcCartney, Harrison and Starr then focused their attention on four songs: \"[[Free as a Bird]]\", \"Real Love\", \"[[Grow Old with Me]]\" and \"[[Now and Then (John Lennon song)|Now and Then]]\". Of these, they liked \"Free as a Bird\" the most, and worked hard on it. Eventually the song was released as the first new Beatles single since 1970. The remaining Beatles then turned their attention to \"Real Love\", which, co-producer [[Jeff Lynne]] later remarked, at least \"had a complete set of words\".<ref name=\"jeff\">(2000).

Lynne recalled:\n\n<blockquote>We tried out a new noise reduction system, and it really worked. The problem I had with \"Real Love\" was that not only was there a 60 cycles mains hum going on, there was also a terrible amount of hiss, because it had been recorded at a low level. I don't know how many generations down this copy was, but it sounded like at least a couple. So I had to get rid of the hiss and the mains hum, and then there were clicks all the way through it&nbsp;... We'd spend a day on it, then listen back and still find loads more things wrong&nbsp;... It didn't have any effect on John's voice, because we were just dealing with the air surrounding him, in between phrases. That took about a week to clean up before it was even usable and transferable to a [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] master. Putting fresh music to it was the easy part!<ref name=\"f95\"/></blockquote>\n\nAlthough \"Real Love\" was more complete than \"Free as a Bird\", which had required the addition of some lyrics by McCartney,<ref name=\"fm94\"/> the song also suffered from problems with Lennon's timing. Lynne recalled that \"it took a lot of work to get it all in time so that the others could play to it.\"<ref name=\"jeff\"/> Lynne emphasised that the three remaining Beatles were keen to ensure the song sounded very \"Beatles-y\": \"What we were trying to do was create a record that was timeless, so we steered away from using state-of the-art gear. We didn't want to make it fashionable.\"<ref name=\"jeff\"/>\n\nAs with \"Free as a Bird\", the Beatles worked at McCartney's studio in [[Sussex]], with the intention of producing another single. Added to the demo were the sounds of a [[double bass]] (originally owned by [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] bassist, [[Bill Black]]), [[Fender Jazz Bass|Fender Jazz]] bass guitar, a couple of [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitars, one of which was Harrison's psychedelically-painted \"Rocky\" Strat (as seen in the \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" video), as well as a Ludwig drum kit.<ref name=\"jeff\"/> Other than their regular instruments, a [[Baldwin Piano Company|Baldwin]] [[Electric piano#Other electric keyboard instruments|Combo Harpsichord]] (as played by Lennon on the Beatles song \"[[Because (Beatles song)|Because]]\") and a [[Pump organ|harmonium]] (which appeared on the band's 1965 hit single \"[[We Can Work It Out]]\") were also used. During the recording process, it was decided to speed up the tape, thereby raising the key from D minor to E flat minor.<ref>[http://www.thebeatles.com.hk/songs/details.php?deTitle=Real+Love Real Love] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716101027/http://www.thebeatles.com.hk/songs/details.php?deTitle=Real+Love |date=16 July 2011 }}.

The assistant engineer was Jon Jacobs, who had worked with McCartney and Emerick since the late 1970s. The attitude in the studio was very relaxed, according to Lynne: \"Paul and George would strike up the backing vocals \u2013 and all of a sudden it's the Beatles again!&nbsp;... I'd be waiting to record and normally I'd say, 'OK, Let's do a take', but I was too busy laughing and smiling at everything they were talking about.\" Starr said that the lightheartedness was key to ensuring he, Harrison and McCartney could focus on the task: \"We just pretended that John had gone on holiday or out for tea and had left us the tape to play with. That was the only way we could deal with it, and get over the hurdle, because [it] was really very emotional.\"<ref name=\"jeff\"/>\n\nStarr commented: \"Recording the new songs didn't feel contrived at all. It felt very natural and it was a lot of fun, but emotional too, at times. But it's the end of the line, really.

Most of the tracks on ''1'' have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by [[Giles Martin]]. Martin and Jeff Lynne also remixed \"Real Love\" for the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The remix of \"Real Love\" cleans up Lennon's vocal further, and reinstates several deleted elements originally recorded in 1995, such as lead guitar phrases and drum fills, as well as making the harpsichord and harmonium more prominent in the mix.\n\n==Lyrics and melody==\nThe song's lyrics have been interpreted by one reviewer to be conveying the message that \"love is the answer to loneliness\" and \"that connection is the antidote to unreality.\"<ref>Bromell, Nicholas Knowles (2000).

The refrain is higher than the verse; while the verse covers a full octave, the refrain, at its peak, is a fifth higher.<ref name=\"pollack\">Pollack, Alan W. (1995).

The introduction occurs in parallel E minor,<ref>{{cite web|title=Real Love sheet music|url=http://www.sheetmusicdirect.com/se/ID_No/16674/Product.aspx|website=Sheet Music Direct}}</ref> with the main thrust of the song being in E major. There are several other occasions where Lennon moves to a chord from the parallel minor, e.g. in the chorus where the progression moves from a major tonic (I) chord to a minor subdominant (iv) chord. The move to minor harmony happens on the words 'alone' and 'afraid'. This combination of lyrics and harmony turning at the same point is a common Beatles device, and helps give the song a wistful feeling. The outro largely comprises the last half of the refrain repeated seven times, slowly fading out.<ref name=\"pollack\"/>\n\n==Personnel==\n\n;Sixth take\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar\n\n;Beatles version\nAccording to [[Ian MacDonald]]<ref>{{cite book| last=MacDonald| first=Ian| year=2005| title=Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties'' (2nd rev. edn)''| publisher=Chicago Review Press| location=Chicago, IL| isbn=978-1-55652-733-3| p=[https://archive.org/details/revolutioninhead0003macd/page/379 379]| url=https://archive.org/details/revolutioninhead0003macd/page/379}}</ref> and [[Mark Lewisohn]]:<ref>{{cite AV media notes|url= |first=Mark|last=Lewisohn|title=[[Anthology 2]] |others=[[The Beatles]] |p=4|year=1996 |type=CD booklet liner notes |publisher=[[Apple Records]] |id=}}</ref>\n*John Lennon \u2013 [[Double tracking|double-tracked]] lead vocals, piano\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 backing vocals, acoustic guitar, piano, bass guitar, [[double bass]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[harpsichord]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTkHAldi4bEC&pg=PA290&lpg=PA290#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Beatles as Musicians: Revolver through the Anthology|last=Everett|first=Walter|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|year=1999| isbn=0-19-512941-5|page=290}}</ref> percussion<ref name=\"jeff\" />\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 backing vocals, electric guitars, acoustic guitar, percussion\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 backing vocals, drums, percussion\n*[[Jeff Lynne]] \u2013 backing vocals, guitar\n\n==Track listings==\nAll tracks written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], except where noted.\n\n;7\" (R6425)\n#\"Real Love\" (Lennon)&nbsp;\u2013 3:54\n#*Recorded at The Dakota, New York City, circa 1979 (original demo) and at The Mill Studio, Sussex, in February 1995.\n#\"[[Baby's in Black]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 3:03\n#*Recorded live at the Hollywood Bowl on 29 August 1965 (spoken introduction by Lennon) and 30 August 1965 (song performance).\n\n;CD (CDR6425)\n#\"Real Love\" (Lennon)&nbsp;\u2013 3:54\n#\"Baby's in Black\"&nbsp;\u2013 3:03\n#\"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:48\n#*Recorded at EMI Studios, London, on 26 May and 1 June 1966.

He recorded six demos of the song in 1979 and 1980 with \"'''Real Life'''\", a different song that merged with \"Real Love\". In 1988, the sixth take was posthumously released for the documentary soundtrack ''[[Imagine: John Lennon (soundtrack)|Imagine: John Lennon]]''. In 1995, his demo was completed by his former Beatles bandmates ([[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]]) as part of the ''[[The Beatles Anthology|Beatles Anthology]]'' project, along with \"[[Free as a Bird]]\".\n\nThe song was released as a Beatles single in 1996 in the United Kingdom, United States and many other countries. It reached number 4 and number 11, respectively, in the UK and US singles charts, and earned a gold record more quickly than a number of the group's other singles. The song was not included on the [[BBC Radio 1]] playlist, prompting criticism from fans and British Members of Parliament. The track opened the Beatles' ''[[Anthology 2]]'' album. It is the last single by the Beatles to become a top 40 hit in the US, the last released record of new material credited to the Beatles, and the last to originate and be included on an album.\n\n==Early origins==\nAccording to Beatles biographer John T. Marck, \"Real Love\" originated as part of an unfinished stage play that Lennon was working on at the time, titled ''The Ballad of John and Yoko''. The song was first recorded in 1977 with a handheld tape recorder on his piano at home. Eventually the work evolved under the title \"Real Life\", a song which Lennon would record at least six times in 1979 and 1980, and was then abandoned. The song was eventually combined with elements of another Lennon demo, \"Baby Make Love to You\".<ref>Marck, John T. [http://www.iamthebeatles.com/article1043.html Oh Look Out!

The song was also released on the ''[[Acoustic (John Lennon album)|Acoustic]]'' album in 2004. The demo with just Lennon on piano was issued in 1998 on ''[[John Lennon Anthology]]'' and then later on ''[[Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon]]''.\n\n==Reuniting the Beatles==\nBefore [[The Beatles Anthology|the Anthology project]], the closest the Beatles had come to reuniting on record (while all four members were still alive) was for Starr's ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]'' album in 1973, when Lennon, Harrison and Starr collaborated on \"[[I'm the Greatest]]\". By the early 1990s, the idea of redoing some of Lennon's old songs was inspired by former Beatles road manager [[Neil Aspinall]] and Harrison, who first requested some demos from Ono. In January 1994, McCartney went to [[New York City]] for Lennon's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. While there, he received at least four songs from Ono. According to Aspinall, it was \"two cassettes\" which \"might have been five or six tracks\". Ono said of the occasion: \"It was all settled before then, I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul. I did not break up the Beatles, but I was there at the time, you know? Now I'm in a position where I could bring them back together and I would not want to hinder that.\"<ref name=\"fm94\">Maclauchlan, Paul (1998).

I'd never heard them before but she explained that they're quite well known to Lennon fans as bootlegs. I said to Yoko, \"Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough. If it doesn't work out, you can veto it.\" When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that, they were going, \"What? What if we love it?\" It didn't come to that, luckily.<ref name=\"fm94\"/></blockquote>\n\nMcCartney, Harrison and Starr then focused their attention on four songs: \"[[Free as a Bird]]\", \"Real Love\", \"[[Grow Old with Me]]\" and \"[[Now and Then (John Lennon song)|Now and Then]]\". Of these, they liked \"Free as a Bird\" the most, and worked hard on it. Eventually the song was released as the first new Beatles single since 1970. The remaining Beatles then turned their attention to \"Real Love\", which, co-producer [[Jeff Lynne]] later remarked, at least \"had a complete set of words\".<ref name=\"jeff\">(2000).

Lynne recalled:\n\n<blockquote>We tried out a new noise reduction system, and it really worked. The problem I had with \"Real Love\" was that not only was there a 60 cycles mains hum going on, there was also a terrible amount of hiss, because it had been recorded at a low level. I don't know how many generations down this copy was, but it sounded like at least a couple. So I had to get rid of the hiss and the mains hum, and then there were clicks all the way through it&nbsp;... We'd spend a day on it, then listen back and still find loads more things wrong&nbsp;... It didn't have any effect on John's voice, because we were just dealing with the air surrounding him, in between phrases.

Putting fresh music to it was the easy part!<ref name=\"f95\"/></blockquote>\n\nAlthough \"Real Love\" was more complete than \"Free as a Bird\", which had required the addition of some lyrics by McCartney,<ref name=\"fm94\"/> the song also suffered from problems with Lennon's timing. Lynne recalled that \"it took a lot of work to get it all in time so that the others could play to it.\"<ref name=\"jeff\"/> Lynne emphasised that the three remaining Beatles were keen to ensure the song sounded very \"Beatles-y\": \"What we were trying to do was create a record that was timeless, so we steered away from using state-of the-art gear. We didn't want to make it fashionable.\"<ref name=\"jeff\"/>\n\nAs with \"Free as a Bird\", the Beatles worked at McCartney's studio in [[Sussex]], with the intention of producing another single. Added to the demo were the sounds of a [[double bass]] (originally owned by [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] bassist, [[Bill Black]]), [[Fender Jazz Bass|Fender Jazz]] bass guitar, a couple of [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitars, one of which was Harrison's psychedelically-painted \"Rocky\" Strat (as seen in the \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" video), as well as a Ludwig drum kit.<ref name=\"jeff\"/> Other than their regular instruments, a [[Baldwin Piano Company|Baldwin]] [[Electric piano#Other electric keyboard instruments|Combo Harpsichord]] (as played by Lennon on the Beatles song \"[[Because (Beatles song)|Because]]\") and a [[Pump organ|harmonium]] (which appeared on the band's 1965 hit single \"[[We Can Work It Out]]\") were also used. During the recording process, it was decided to speed up the tape, thereby raising the key from D minor to E flat minor.<ref>[http://www.thebeatles.com.hk/songs/details.php?deTitle=Real+Love Real Love] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716101027/http://www.thebeatles.com.hk/songs/details.php?deTitle=Real+Love |date=16 July 2011 }}.

The assistant engineer was Jon Jacobs, who had worked with McCartney and Emerick since the late 1970s. The attitude in the studio was very relaxed, according to Lynne: \"Paul and George would strike up the backing vocals \u2013 and all of a sudden it's the Beatles again!&nbsp;... I'd be waiting to record and normally I'd say, 'OK, Let's do a take', but I was too busy laughing and smiling at everything they were talking about.\" Starr said that the lightheartedness was key to ensuring he, Harrison and McCartney could focus on the task: \"We just pretended that John had gone on holiday or out for tea and had left us the tape to play with. That was the only way we could deal with it, and get over the hurdle, because [it] was really very emotional.\"<ref name=\"jeff\"/>\n\nStarr commented: \"Recording the new songs didn't feel contrived at all. It felt very natural and it was a lot of fun, but emotional too, at times. But it's the end of the line, really.

Geoff Wonfor, who directed the ''Anthology'' documentary, filmed the Beatles recording in the studio with a handheld camcorder, as they did not want to be aware of the camera recording. [[Kevin Godley]], who co-directed the music video, said that it was meant to be a \"fly on the wall thing\".<ref name=\"f95\"/>\n\nTwo different versions of the video were made. The first version aired during the second instalment of ''The Beatles Anthology'' television mini-series on ABC, at the end of the episode. The second version is the more common of the two, and appears on the bonus disc of the ''Anthology'' DVD set. The most notable difference between the two is in the way the videos begin: the first is presented by a [[strawberry]] \u2013 possibly a reference to \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\", although also quite likely a nod to Godley's \"Strawberry Studios\" \u2013 while the second opens with a piano (the piano chord at the beginning).\n\n==Release==\nAlthough \"Real Love\" was released as single in both the UK and US on 4 March 1996, the first time the song was publicly aired was on 22 November 1995, when the American television network, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) aired the second episode of ''The Beatles Anthology''.

Conservative MP [[Harry Greenway]] called the action censorship, and urged the station to reverse what he called a ban.<ref name=\"reuters\"/>\n\nMcCartney wrote an 800-word article for British newspaper ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' about the alleged ban, in which he stated: \"the Beatles don't need our new single, 'Real Love', to be a hit. It's not as if our careers depend on it \u2026 It's very heartening to know that, while the kindergarten kings of Radio 1 may think the Beatles are too old to come out to play, a lot of younger British bands don't seem to share that view.

There are several other occasions where Lennon moves to a chord from the parallel minor, e.g. in the chorus where the progression moves from a major tonic (I) chord to a minor subdominant (iv) chord. The move to minor harmony happens on the words 'alone' and 'afraid'. This combination of lyrics and harmony turning at the same point is a common Beatles device, and helps give the song a wistful feeling.

{"title_page": "Iron-rich sedimentary rocks", "text_new": "[[File:Banded iron formation.jpg|thumb|right|Iron ore from [[Krivoy Rog]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n\n'''Iron-rich sedimentary rocks''' are [[sedimentary rock]]s which contain 15% or more [[iron]].  However, most sedimentary rocks contain iron in varying degrees.  The majority of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods:  The [[Precambrian]] (3800 to 570 million years ago), the early [[Paleozoic]] (570 to 410 million years ago), and the middle to late [[Mesozoic]] (205 to 66 million years ago).  Overall, they make up a very small portion of the total sedimentary record. whats up guys?\n\nIron-rich sedimentary rocks have economic uses as [[iron ore]]s. Iron deposits have been located on all major continents with the exception of Antarctica. They are a major source of iron and are mined for commercial use.<ref name=\"Boggs\">Boggs Jr., Sam, 2006, ''Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy'' (4th ed.), Pearson Education Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ, pp. 217\u2013223</ref>  The main iron ores are from the [[Oxide mineral|oxide group]] consisting of [[hematite]], [[goethite]], and [[magnetite]]. The [[Carbonate mineral|carbonate]] [[siderite]] is also typically mined. A productive belt of iron formations is known as an ''iron range.''<ref name=\"Jackson\"/>\n\n==Classification==\nThe accepted classification scheme for iron-rich sedimentary rocks is to divide them into two sections:  ''ironstones'' and ''iron formations'' <ref name=\"Boggs\"/>\n\n===Ironstones===\n{{Main|Ironstone}}\nIronstones consist of 15% iron or more in composition. This is necessary for the rock to even be considered an ''iron-rich'' sedimentary rock. Generally, they are from the Phanerozoic which means that they range in age from the present to 540 million years ago.<ref name=\"Boggs\"/>  They can contain iron minerals from the following groups: [[Oxide mineral|oxides]], [[Carbonate mineral|carbonates]], and [[Silicate mineral|silicates]]. Some examples of minerals in iron-rich rocks containing oxides are [[limonite]], hematite, and magnetite. An example of a mineral in iron-rich rock containing carbonates is siderite and an example of minerals in an iron-rich rock containing silicate is [[chamosite]].<ref name=\"Jackson\">Jackson, Julia A., 1997, ''Glossary of Geology'', American Geologic Institute, Ventura Publisher, Alexandria, VA, pp. 335\u2013336</ref>  They are often interbedded with [[limestones]], [[shale]]s, and fine-grained [[sandstone]]s. They are typically nonbanded, however they can be very coarsely banded on occasion.<ref name=\"Boggs\"/>  They are hard and non[[chert]]y.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/>  The components of the rock range in size from sand to mud, but do not contain a lot of [[silica]].  They are also more aluminous. They are not laminated and sometimes contain ''[[ooid]]s''. Ooids can be a distinct characteristic though they are not normally a main component of ironstones. Within ironstones, ooids are made up of iron silicates and/or iron oxides and sometimes occur in alternating laminae. They normally contain [[fossil]] debris and sometimes the fossils are partly or entirely replaced by iron minerals. A good example of this is [[Permineralization#Pyritization|pyritization]].  They are smaller in size and less likely to be deformed or [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] than iron formations.<ref name=\"Middleton\">Middleton, Gerard V. (and others), 2003, ''Encyclopedia of Sediments and Sedimentary Rocks'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands, pp. 124\u2013125, 130\u2013133, 159\u2013160, 367\u2013368, 376\u2013384, 486\u2013489, 555\u2013557, 701\u2013702</ref>  The term ''iron ball'' is occasionally used to describe an ironstone [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]].<ref name=\"Jackson\"/>\n\n=== Iron formations ===\n[[File:Limonite bog iron cm02.jpg|thumb|right|Bog ore|213x213px]]\nIron formations must be at least 15% iron in composition, just like ironstones and all iron-rich sedimentary rocks. However, iron formations are mainly Precambrian in age which means that they are 4600 to 590 million years old. They are much older than ironstones. They tend to be cherty, though [[chert]] can not be used as a way to classify iron formations because it is a common component in many types of rocks. They are well banded and the banding can be anywhere from a few millimeters to tens of meters thick. The layers have very distinct banded successions that are made up of iron rich layers that alternate with layers of chert. Iron formations are often associates with [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], quartz-rich sandstone, and [[black shale]]. They sometimes grade locally into chert or dolomite. They can have many different textures that resemble limestone. Some of these textures are micritic, pelleted, intraclastic, peloidal, [[oolite|oolitic]], [[pisolitic]], and [[Stromatolite|stromatolitic]].<ref name=\"Boggs\" />  In low-grade iron formations, there are different dominant minerals dependent on the different types of [[Sedimentary facies|facies]]. The dominant minerals in the oxide facies are magnetite and hematite. The dominant minerals in the silicate facies are [[greenalite]], [[minnesotaite]], and [[glauconite]]. The dominant mineral in the carbonate facies is siderite.  The dominant mineral in the sulfide facies is [[pyrite]]. Most iron formations are deformed or metamorphosed simply due to their incredibly old age, but they still retain their unique distinctive chemical composition; even at high metamorphic grades. The higher the grade, the more metamorphosed it is. Low grade rocks may only be compacted while high grade rocks often can not be identified. They often contain a mixture of [[banded iron formation]]s and granular iron formations. Iron formations can be divided into subdivisions known as: banded iron formations (BIFs) and granular iron formations (GIFs).<ref name=\"Middleton\" />\n\nThe above classification scheme is the most commonly used and accepted, though sometimes an older system is used which divides iron-rich sedimentary rocks into three categories: ''[[bog iron]] deposits'', ''[[ironstone]]s'', and ''iron formations''. A bog-iron deposit is iron that formed in a [[bog]] or [[swamp]] through the process of [[oxidation]].\n\n==Banded iron formations vs. granular iron formations==\n[[File:MichiganBIF.jpg|thumb|left|Banded iron formation close up, Upper Michigan|alt=]]\n\n=== Banded iron formations ===\n[[Banded iron formation]]s (BIFs) were originally chemical muds and contain well developed thin lamination. They are able to have this lamination due to the lack of burrowers in the Precambrian. BIFs show regular alternating layers that are rich in iron and chert that range in thickness from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. The formation can continue uninterrupted for tens to hundreds of meters stratigraphically. These formations can contain [[sedimentary structure]]s like [[cross-bedding]], [[graded bedding]], [[load cast]]s, [[ripple mark]]s, [[mud crack]]s, and [[erosion]] channels. In comparison to GIFs, BIFs contain a much larger spectrum of iron minerals, have more [[Redox|reduced]] facies, and are more abundant.<ref name=\"Boggs\"/>\n\nBIFs are divided into type categories based on the characteristics related to the nature of their formation and unique physical and chemical properties. Some categories of banded iron formations are the ''Rapitan type'', the ''Algoma type'', and the ''Superior type''.\n[[File:Black-band ironstone (aka).jpg|thumb|Superior type banded iron formation, North America<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandatlas.org/banded-iron-formation/|title=Banded iron formation|website=www.sandatlas.org|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\n==== Rapitan type ====\nRapitan types are associated with the glaciogenic sequences of the Archean and Early Proterozoic. The type is distinctive as the hydrothermal-input has notably less influence on this formation's Rare Earth Element (REE) chemistry than other formations during this time period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Cornelis|last2=Beukes|first2=Nicolas J.|date=1993-05-01|title=Sedimentology and geochemistry of the glaciogenic late Proterozoic Rapitan Iron-Formation in Canada|url=https://doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.88.3.542|journal=Economic Geology|volume=88|issue=3|pages=542\u2013565|doi=10.2113/gsecongeo.88.3.542|issn=1554-0774}}</ref>\n\n==== Algoma type ====\nAlgoma types are small lenticular iron deposits that are associated with [[volcanic rock]]s and [[turbidite]]s.<ref name=\"Stow\">Stow, Dorrik Av, 2005, Sedimentary Rocks in the Field, Academic press - Manson Publishing, London, UK, p. 218</ref>  Iron content in this class type rarely exceeds 10<sup>10</sup> tons. They range in thickness from 10-100 meters. Deposition occurs in [[island arc]]/[[back arc basin]]s and intracratonic [[rift]] zones.<ref name=\"Harnmeijer\" />\n\n==== Superior type ====\nSuperior types are large, thick, extensive iron deposits across stable shelves and in broad [[Sedimentary basin|basins]].<ref name=\"Stow\" />  Total iron content in this class type exceeds 10<sup>13</sup> tons. They can extend to over 10<sup>5</sup> kilometers<sup>2</sup>. Deposition occurs in relatively shallow marine conditions under transgressing seas.<ref name=\"Harnmeijer\" />\n\n===Granular iron formations===\nGranular iron formations (GIFs) were originally well-sorted chemical sands. They lack even, continuous bedding that takes the form of discontinuous layers. Discontinuous layers likely represent bedforms that were generated by storm waves and currents. Any layers that are thicker than a few meters and are uninterrupted, are rare for GIFs. They contain sand-sized clasts and a finer grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]], and generally belong to the oxide or silicate mineral facies.<ref name=\"Boggs\"/>\n\n==Depositional environment==\n[[File:Continental shelf.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise]] \n\nThere are four facies types associated with iron-rich sedimentary rocks: oxide-, silicate-, carbonate-, and sulfide-facies. These facies correspond to water depth in a marine environment. Oxide-facies are precipitated under the most oxidizing conditions. Silicate- and carbonate-facies are precipitated under intermediate redox conditions. Sulfide-facies are precipitated under the most reducing conditions. There is a lack of iron-rich sedimentary rocks in shallow waters which leads to the conclusion that the depositional environment ranges from the [[continental shelf]] and upper [[continental slope]] to the [[abyssal plain]]. (The diagram does not have the abyssal plain labeled, but this would be located to the far right of the diagram at the bottom of the ocean).<ref name=\"Harnmeijer\">Harnmeijer, Jelte P., 2003, Banded Iron-Formations: A Continuing Enigma of Geology, University of Washington, WA, USA</ref>\n[[File:IronInRocksMakeRiverRed.jpg|thumb|left|Water colored by oxidized iron, Rio Tinto, Spain]]\n[[File:Iron Bacteria in Bankhead National Forest.JPG|thumb|Iron bacteria growing on iron-rich water seeping from a tall bluff, Sipsey Wilderness Area, [[Bankhead National Forest]], Alabama]]\n\n==Chemical reactions==\n[[Ferrous]] and [[ferric]] iron are components in many minerals, especially within sandstones. Fe<sup>2+</sup> is in [[Clay mineral|clay]], carbonates, sulfides, and is even within [[feldspar]]s in small amounts. Fe<sup>3+</sup> is in oxides, hydrous, anhydrous, and in [[glauconite]]s.<ref name=\"Pettijohn\">Pettijohn, Potter, and Siever, 1987, Sand and Sandstone, Springer-Verlag Publishing Inc., New York, NY, pg. 50-51</ref>  Commonly, the presence of iron is determined to be within a rock due to certain colorations from oxidation. Oxidation is the loss of electrons from an element. Oxidation can occur from bacteria or by chemical oxidation. This often happens when ferrous ions come into contact with water (due to dissolved oxygen within surface waters) and a water-mineral reaction occurs. \nThe formula for the oxidation/reduction of iron is: \n:   Fe<sup>2+</sup> \u2194 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + e<sup>\u2212</sup>  \nThe formula works for oxidation to the right or reduction to the left.\n\nFe<sup>2+</sup> is the ferrous form of iron. This form of iron gives up [[electron]]s easily and is a mild reducing agent. These compounds are more soluble because they are more mobile. Fe<sup>3+</sup> is the ferric form of iron. This form of iron is very stable structurally because its valence electron shell is half filled.<ref name=\"Leeder\">Leeder, Mike, 2006, ''Sedimentology and Sedimentary Basins'', Blackwell Publishing, Malden, MA, pp. 20\u201321, 70\u201373</ref>\n\n===Laterization===\n[[Laterite|Laterization]] is a [[soil]] forming process that occurs in warm and moist climates under broadleaf evergreen forests. Soils formed by laterization tend to be highly [[Weathering|weathered]] with high iron and [[aluminium oxide]] content. [[Goethite]] is often made from this process and is a major source of iron in sediments. However, once it is deposited it must be dehydrated in order to come to an equilibrium with hematite. The dehydration reaction is:<ref name=\"Leeder\"/>\n:2HFeO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \n[[File:Pyritized lytoceras.png|thumb|left|Pyritized ''Lytoceras'']]\n\n===Pyritization===\nPyritization is discriminatory. It rarely happens to soft tissue organisms and [[Aragonite|aragonitic]] [[fossil]]s are more susceptible to it than [[calcite]] fossils.

However, most sedimentary rocks contain iron in varying degrees.  The majority of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods:  The [[Precambrian]] (3800 to 570 million years ago), the early [[Paleozoic]] (570 to 410 million years ago), and the middle to late [[Mesozoic]] (205 to 66 million years ago).  Overall, they make up a very small portion of the total sedimentary record.\n\nIron-rich sedimentary rocks have economic uses as [[iron ore]]s. Iron deposits have been located on all major continents with the exception of Antarctica. They are a major source of iron and are mined for commercial use.<ref name=\"Boggs\">Boggs Jr., Sam, 2006, ''Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy'' (4th ed.), Pearson Education Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ, pp. 217\u2013223</ref>  The main iron ores are from the [[Oxide mineral|oxide group]] consisting of [[hematite]], [[goethite]], and [[magnetite]]. The [[Carbonate mineral|carbonate]] [[siderite]] is also typically mined. A productive belt of iron formations is known as an ''iron range.''<ref name=\"Jackson\"/>\n\n==Classification==\nThe accepted classification scheme for iron-rich sedimentary rocks is to divide them into two sections:  ''ironstones'' and ''iron formations'' <ref name=\"Boggs\"/>\n\n===Ironstones===\n{{Main|Ironstone}}\nIronstones consist of 15% iron or more in composition. This is necessary for the rock to even be considered an ''iron-rich'' sedimentary rock. Generally, they are from the Phanerozoic which means that they range in age from the present to 540 million years ago.<ref name=\"Boggs\"/>  They can contain iron minerals from the following groups: [[Oxide mineral|oxides]], [[Carbonate mineral|carbonates]], and [[Silicate mineral|silicates]]. Some examples of minerals in iron-rich rocks containing oxides are [[limonite]], hematite, and magnetite. An example of a mineral in iron-rich rock containing carbonates is siderite and an example of minerals in an iron-rich rock containing silicate is [[chamosite]].<ref name=\"Jackson\">Jackson, Julia A., 1997, ''Glossary of Geology'', American Geologic Institute, Ventura Publisher, Alexandria, VA, pp. 335\u2013336</ref>  They are often interbedded with [[limestones]], [[shale]]s, and fine-grained [[sandstone]]s. They are typically nonbanded, however they can be very coarsely banded on occasion.<ref name=\"Boggs\"/>  They are hard and non[[chert]]y.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/>  The components of the rock range in size from sand to mud, but do not contain a lot of [[silica]].  They are also more aluminous. They are not laminated and sometimes contain ''[[ooid]]s''. Ooids can be a distinct characteristic though they are not normally a main component of ironstones. Within ironstones, ooids are made up of iron silicates and/or iron oxides and sometimes occur in alternating laminae. They normally contain [[fossil]] debris and sometimes the fossils are partly or entirely replaced by iron minerals. A good example of this is [[Permineralization#Pyritization|pyritization]].  They are smaller in size and less likely to be deformed or [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] than iron formations.<ref name=\"Middleton\">Middleton, Gerard V. (and others), 2003, ''Encyclopedia of Sediments and Sedimentary Rocks'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands, pp. 124\u2013125, 130\u2013133, 159\u2013160, 367\u2013368, 376\u2013384, 486\u2013489, 555\u2013557, 701\u2013702</ref>  The term ''iron ball'' is occasionally used to describe an ironstone [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]].<ref name=\"Jackson\"/>\n\n=== Iron formations ===\n[[File:Limonite bog iron cm02.jpg|thumb|right|Bog ore|213x213px]]\nIron formations must be at least 15% iron in composition, just like ironstones and all iron-rich sedimentary rocks. However, iron formations are mainly Precambrian in age which means that they are 4600 to 590 million years old. They are much older than ironstones. They tend to be cherty, though [[chert]] can not be used as a way to classify iron formations because it is a common component in many types of rocks. They are well banded and the banding can be anywhere from a few millimeters to tens of meters thick. The layers have very distinct banded successions that are made up of iron rich layers that alternate with layers of chert. Iron formations are often associates with [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], quartz-rich sandstone, and [[black shale]]. They sometimes grade locally into chert or dolomite. They can have many different textures that resemble limestone. Some of these textures are micritic, pelleted, intraclastic, peloidal, [[oolite|oolitic]], [[pisolitic]], and [[Stromatolite|stromatolitic]].<ref name=\"Boggs\" />  In low-grade iron formations, there are different dominant minerals dependent on the different types of [[Sedimentary facies|facies]]. The dominant minerals in the oxide facies are magnetite and hematite. The dominant minerals in the silicate facies are [[greenalite]], [[minnesotaite]], and [[glauconite]]. The dominant mineral in the carbonate facies is siderite.  The dominant mineral in the sulfide facies is [[pyrite]]. Most iron formations are deformed or metamorphosed simply due to their incredibly old age, but they still retain their unique distinctive chemical composition; even at high metamorphic grades. The higher the grade, the more metamorphosed it is. Low grade rocks may only be compacted while high grade rocks often can not be identified. They often contain a mixture of [[banded iron formation]]s and granular iron formations. Iron formations can be divided into subdivisions known as: banded iron formations (BIFs) and granular iron formations (GIFs).<ref name=\"Middleton\" />\n\nThe above classification scheme is the most commonly used and accepted, though sometimes an older system is used which divides iron-rich sedimentary rocks into three categories: ''[[bog iron]] deposits'', ''[[ironstone]]s'', and ''iron formations''. A bog-iron deposit is iron that formed in a [[bog]] or [[swamp]] through the process of [[oxidation]].\n\n==Banded iron formations vs. granular iron formations==\n[[File:MichiganBIF.jpg|thumb|left|Banded iron formation close up, Upper Michigan|alt=]]\n\n=== Banded iron formations ===\n[[Banded iron formation]]s (BIFs) were originally chemical muds and contain well developed thin lamination. They are able to have this lamination due to the lack of burrowers in the Precambrian. BIFs show regular alternating layers that are rich in iron and chert that range in thickness from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. The formation can continue uninterrupted for tens to hundreds of meters stratigraphically. These formations can contain [[sedimentary structure]]s like [[cross-bedding]], [[graded bedding]], [[load cast]]s, [[ripple mark]]s, [[mud crack]]s, and [[erosion]] channels. In comparison to GIFs, BIFs contain a much larger spectrum of iron minerals, have more [[Redox|reduced]] facies, and are more abundant.<ref name=\"Boggs\"/>\n\nBIFs are divided into type categories based on the characteristics related to the nature of their formation and unique physical and chemical properties. Some categories of banded iron formations are the ''Rapitan type'', the ''Algoma type'', and the ''Superior type''.\n[[File:Black-band ironstone (aka).jpg|thumb|Superior type banded iron formation, North America<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandatlas.org/banded-iron-formation/|title=Banded iron formation|website=www.sandatlas.org|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\n==== Rapitan type ====\nRapitan types are associated with the glaciogenic sequences of the Archean and Early Proterozoic.

Deposition occurs in [[island arc]]/[[back arc basin]]s and intracratonic [[rift]] zones.<ref name=\"Harnmeijer\" />\n\n==== Superior type ====\nSuperior types are large, thick, extensive iron deposits across stable shelves and in broad [[Sedimentary basin|basins]].<ref name=\"Stow\" />  Total iron content in this class type exceeds 10<sup>13</sup> tons. They can extend to over 10<sup>5</sup> kilometers<sup>2</sup>. Deposition occurs in relatively shallow marine conditions under transgressing seas.<ref name=\"Harnmeijer\" />\n\n===Granular iron formations===\nGranular iron formations (GIFs) were originally well-sorted chemical sands. They lack even, continuous bedding that takes the form of discontinuous layers. Discontinuous layers likely represent bedforms that were generated by storm waves and currents. Any layers that are thicker than a few meters and are uninterrupted, are rare for GIFs. They contain sand-sized clasts and a finer grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]], and generally belong to the oxide or silicate mineral facies.<ref name=\"Boggs\"/>\n\n==Depositional environment==\n[[File:Continental shelf.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise]] \n\nThere are four facies types associated with iron-rich sedimentary rocks: oxide-, silicate-, carbonate-, and sulfide-facies. These facies correspond to water depth in a marine environment. Oxide-facies are precipitated under the most oxidizing conditions. Silicate- and carbonate-facies are precipitated under intermediate redox conditions. Sulfide-facies are precipitated under the most reducing conditions. There is a lack of iron-rich sedimentary rocks in shallow waters which leads to the conclusion that the depositional environment ranges from the [[continental shelf]] and upper [[continental slope]] to the [[abyssal plain]]. (The diagram does not have the abyssal plain labeled, but this would be located to the far right of the diagram at the bottom of the ocean).<ref name=\"Harnmeijer\">Harnmeijer, Jelte P., 2003, Banded Iron-Formations: A Continuing Enigma of Geology, University of Washington, WA, USA</ref>\n[[File:IronInRocksMakeRiverRed.jpg|thumb|left|Water colored by oxidized iron, Rio Tinto, Spain]]\n[[File:Iron Bacteria in Bankhead National Forest.JPG|thumb|Iron bacteria growing on iron-rich water seeping from a tall bluff, Sipsey Wilderness Area, [[Bankhead National Forest]], Alabama]]\n\n==Chemical reactions==\n[[Ferrous]] and [[ferric]] iron are components in many minerals, especially within sandstones.

Oxidation is the loss of electrons from an element. Oxidation can occur from bacteria or by chemical oxidation. This often happens when ferrous ions come into contact with water (due to dissolved oxygen within surface waters) and a water-mineral reaction occurs. \nThe formula for the oxidation/reduction of iron is: \n:   Fe<sup>2+</sup> \u2194 Fe<sup>3+</sup> + e<sup>\u2212</sup>  \nThe formula works for oxidation to the right or reduction to the left.\n\nFe<sup>2+</sup> is the ferrous form of iron.
