McDonnell|Jim McDonnell]] to be the company's preliminary design manager.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 13.</ref> With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type: an attack fighter.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 11.</ref>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F3H-G mockup in 1954.jpg|thumb|The McDonnell F3H-G/H mockup, 1954]]\nIn 1953, McDonnell Aircraft began work on revising its [[McDonnell F3H Demon|F3H Demon]] naval fighter, seeking expanded capabilities and better performance. The company developed several projects, including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine,<ref name=\"Demonp61\">Dorr 2008, p. 61.</ref> and variants powered by two [[Wright J65]] engines, or two [[General Electric J79]] engines.<ref name=\"Boeing development\">[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm \"Phabulous 40th: Phantom Development.\"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907090450/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm |date=7 September 2009}} ''1978 Commemorative Book''. Boeing. Retrieved: 14 February 2008.</ref>  The J79-powered version promised a top speed of [[Mach number |Mach]]&nbsp;1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the [[United States Navy]] with a proposal for the \"Super Demon\". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular, as it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon, or 56 [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]] unguided rockets in addition to the nine [[hardpoint]]s under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H, but felt that the upcoming [[Grumman F-11 Tiger|Grumman XF9F-9]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-1]] already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter.<ref>Lake 1992, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. Then on 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] for ground attack and [[F-8 Crusader]] for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.<ref name=\"swan navyp301\"/>\n\n===XF4H-1 prototype===\n[[File:F4h-1 leadership.jpg|thumb|right|Key figures in the F-4 development: [[David S. Lewis|David Lewis]], Robert Little, and Herman Barkey]]\nThe XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AAM-N-6 Sparrow III]] radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through [[intake ramp|fixed geometry intake]]s. The thin-section wing had a [[leading edge]] sweep of 45\u00b0 and was equipped with [[blown flap]]s for better low-speed handling.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/>\n\n[[Wind tunnel]] testing had revealed lateral instability, requiring the addition of 5\u00b0 [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] to the wings.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/> To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12\u00b0, which averaged to the required 5\u00b0 over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive \"dogtooth\" for improved control at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]]. The all-moving tailplane was given 23\u00b0 of [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] to improve control at high angles of attack, while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/> In addition, air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the [[AN/APQ-50]] radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of {{convert|23|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}, while the nose strut could extend by some {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} to increase angle of attack at takeoff.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F4H-1F Phantom II aboard USS Independence (CVA-62), in 1960.jpg|thumb|An F4H-1F aboard {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}, April 1960]]\nOn 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production examples. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear, but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 holes to \"bleed off\" the slow-moving [[boundary layer]] air from the surface of each [[intake ramp]]. Series production aircraft also featured [[Splitter plate (aeronautics)|splitter plates]] to divert the [[boundary layer]] away from the engine intakes. The aircraft soon squared off against the [[XF8U-3 Crusader III]]. Due to operator workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner. Delays with the J79-GE-8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79-GE-2 and \u22122A engines, each having 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.8&nbsp;kN) of [[afterburner|afterburning]] thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete [[launch and recovery cycle|launch-recovery cycle]] performed on 15 February 1960 from {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\nThere were proposals to name the F4H \"[[Satan]]\" and \"[[Mithras]]\".<ref name=\"Donald 2002\">Donald and Lake 2002, pp. 6, 8.</ref> In the end, the aircraft was given the less controversial name \"Phantom II\", the first \"Phantom\" being another McDonnell jet fighter, the [[McDonnell FH Phantom|FH-1 Phantom]]. The Phantom II was briefly given the designation F-110A and the name \"Spectre\" by the USAF, but neither name was officially used.<ref>Angelucci 1987, p. 316.</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:F-4B VF-74 taking off 1961.jpg|thumb|right|VF-74 was the first operational U.S. Navy ''Phantom'' squadron in 1961]]\n\nEarly in production, the radar was upgraded to the Westinghouse [[AN/APQ-120|AN/APQ-72]], an [[AN/APG-50]] with a larger radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]].<ref>Lake 1992, p. 21.</ref> During its career the Phantom underwent many changes in the form of numerous variants developed.\n\nThe USN operated the F4H-1 (re-designated F-4A in 1962) with J79-GE-2 and -2A engines of 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.62&nbsp;kN) thrust and later builds receiving -8 engines. A total of 45 F-4As were built; none saw combat, and most ended up as test or training aircraft.<ref name=\"Edenp278\">Eden 2004, p. 278.</ref> The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a [[Texas Instruments]] AAA-4 [[Infra-red search and track]] pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900&nbsp;lbf (48.5&nbsp;kN) dry and 16,950&nbsp;lbf (75.4&nbsp;kN) [[afterburner]] (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and [[VF-121]] Pacemakers receiving the first examples at [[NAS Miramar]].<ref name=\"Edenp278\"/>\n\nThe USAF received Phantoms as the result of Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]]'s push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the US military. After an F-4B won the \"Operation Highspeed\" fly-off against the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]], the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them F-110A \"Spectre\" in January 1962, and developed requirements for their own version. Unlike the US Navy's focus on air-to-air interception in the Fleet Air Defense (FAD) mission, the USAF emphasized both an air-to-air and an air-to-ground fighter-bomber role. With McNamara's unification of designations on 18 September 1962, the Phantom became the F-4 with the naval version designated F-4B and USAF F-4C.

For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to fire multiple missiles (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, [[rules of engagement]] in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft, but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying [[SUU-16]] external gunpods containing a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan|M61A1 Vulcan]] Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the [[SUU-23]], virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight.

However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters.

It served as the principal [[air superiority fighter]] for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps and became important in the [[attack aircraft|ground-attack]] and [[aerial reconnaissance]] roles late in the war.  During the Vietnam War, one U.S. Air Force pilot, two weapon systems officers (WSOs),<ref name=\"dorrp200-201\"/> one U.S. Navy pilot and one [[radar intercept officer]] (RIO) became [[Flying ace|ace]]s by achieving five aerial kills against enemy fighter aircraft.<ref name=\"Dorrp188-189\" /> The F-4 continued to form a major part of U.S. military air power throughout the 1970s and 1980s, being gradually replaced by more modern aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] in the U.S. Air Force, the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat |F-14 Tomcat]] in the U.S. Navy, and the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet |F/A-18 Hornet]] in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nThe F-4 Phantom II remained in use by the U.S. in the reconnaissance and [[Wild Weasel]] ([[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]]) roles in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], finally leaving service in 1996.<ref name=\"gulfp26\">Donald Spring 1991, p. 26.</ref><ref name=\"gulfvictoryp22\">Donald Summer 1991, p. 22.</ref>  It was also the only aircraft used by both U.S. flight demonstration teams: the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]] (F-4E) and the United States Navy [[Blue Angels]] (F-4J).<ref name=\"Phab40th\"/><ref name=\"Lake 1992, p. 190\">Lake 1992, p. 190.</ref><ref>Lake 1992, p. 203.</ref> The F-4 was also operated by the armed forces of 11 other nations.

McDonnell|Jim McDonnell]] to be the company's preliminary design manager.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 13.</ref> With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type: an attack fighter.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 11.</ref>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F3H-G mockup in 1954.jpg|thumb|The McDonnell F3H-G/H mockup, 1954]]\nIn 1953, McDonnell Aircraft began work on revising its [[McDonnell F3H Demon|F3H Demon]] naval fighter, seeking expanded capabilities and better performance. The company developed several projects, including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine,<ref name=\"Demonp61\">Dorr 2008, p. 61.</ref> and variants powered by two [[Wright J65]] engines, or two [[General Electric J79]] engines.<ref name=\"Boeing development\">[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm \"Phabulous 40th: Phantom Development.\"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907090450/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm |date=7 September 2009}} ''1978 Commemorative Book''. Boeing. Retrieved: 14 February 2008.</ref>  The J79-powered version promised a top speed of [[Mach number |Mach]]&nbsp;1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the [[United States Navy]] with a proposal for the \"Super Demon\". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular, as it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon, or 56 [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]] unguided rockets in addition to the nine [[hardpoint]]s under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H, but felt that the upcoming [[Grumman F-11 Tiger|Grumman XF9F-9]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-1]] already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter.<ref>Lake 1992, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. Then on 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] for ground attack and [[F-8 Crusader]] for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.<ref name=\"swan navyp301\"/>\n\n===XF4H-1 prototype===\n[[File:F4h-1 leadership.jpg|thumb|right|Key figures in the F-4 development: [[David S. Lewis|David Lewis]], Robert Little, and Herman Barkey]]\nThe XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AAM-N-6 Sparrow III]] radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through [[intake ramp|fixed geometry intake]]s. The thin-section wing had a [[leading edge]] sweep of 45\u00b0 and was equipped with [[blown flap]]s for better low-speed handling.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/>\n\n[[Wind tunnel]] testing had revealed lateral instability, requiring the addition of 5\u00b0 [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] to the wings.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/> To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12\u00b0, which averaged to the required 5\u00b0 over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive \"dogtooth\" for improved control at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]]. The all-moving tailplane was given 23\u00b0 of [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] to improve control at high angles of attack, while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/> In addition, air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the [[AN/APQ-50]] radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of {{convert|23|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}, while the nose strut could extend by some {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} to increase angle of attack at takeoff.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F4H-1F Phantom II aboard USS Independence (CVA-62), in 1960.jpg|thumb|An F4H-1F aboard {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}, April 1960]]\nOn 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production examples. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear, but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 holes to \"bleed off\" the slow-moving [[boundary layer]] air from the surface of each [[intake ramp]]. Series production aircraft also featured [[Splitter plate (aeronautics)|splitter plates]] to divert the [[boundary layer]] away from the engine intakes. The aircraft soon squared off against the [[XF8U-3 Crusader III]]. Due to operator workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner.

For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to fire multiple missiles (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, [[rules of engagement]] in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft, but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying [[SUU-16]] external gunpods containing a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan|M61A1 Vulcan]] Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the [[SUU-23]], virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight.

However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters.

Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

animation|computer-animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[adventure film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 56th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], co-directed by [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]] and [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]], the film introduces [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana and features the voices of [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]], [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Alan Tudyk]]. The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances. The film went on to gross over $690&nbsp;million worldwide. Along with ''[[Zootopia]]'', it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year. It received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]]: one for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and another for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[How Far I'll Go]]\").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/2017-oscar-nominations-academy-awards-nominees-1201968107/|title=Oscar Nominations: Complete List|date=January 24, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

In this way the activities of young and student members remain formally independent from but closely engaged with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nYoung Liberals has had an active branch in Northern Ireland since 2010, under the name of Liberal Youth Northern Ireland, which operates as the youth branch of the Northern Ireland Liberal Democrats. Since 2014 it has become an official branch of Young Liberals, though for administrative purposes it is a branch of the English Young Liberals rather than a separate state branch. Liberal Youth Northern Ireland maintains a close working relationship with Alliance Youth, the youth wing of the Alliance Party.\n\n===Conferences===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe federal Conference is the sovereign body of the Young Liberals and has power to determine policy and direction. The federal Young Liberals usually hosts two conferences a year, a conference in the Winter and a training weekend known as 'Activate' in the Summer, which also acts as the constitutionally mandated Annual General Meeting. At conferences policy motions which shape YL policy and amendments to the organisations constitution are debated, alongside training and speaker sessions.\n\nIn addition, during each conference there is an Executive Scrutiny session, whereby members of the executive submit reports to conference on their activities and actions in their job. After each report motions on officers are debated, wherein any member can submit a Motion of commendation, Motion of censure or Motion of no confidence in an officer. Motions of commendation and censure are non-binding opinions of conference passed by a simple majority, expressing either positive or negative opinion on the actions of an officer. Motions of no confidence are binding motions which if passed have the effect of removing an officer from their position and require a two thirds majority in order to pass.\n\n====Conference Locations====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Scotland, there was a separate Scottish Young Liberal Democrats (which also included students of all ages). Liberal Democrat Youth and Students was itself created in 1993 from a merger of the Student Liberal Democrats  and the Young Liberal Democrats of England who had shared many resources in the run-up.  The merger talks were overseen by a committee which included Sarah Gurling, who later married the late [[Charles Kennedy]]. LDYS reorganised into a federal structure in 2000 and then admitted Scottish Young Liberal Democrats as its Scottish federal unit in 2002 - forming a single GB-wide organisation for the first time since the combined ULS-NLYL committees of the 1970s.\n\n===List of former Chairs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!\n!

Membership is automatic for members of the Liberal Democrats aged under 26, and opt-in for those aged 26\u201330. It organises a number of fringe events at the [[Liberal Democrat Federal Conference]], which is held twice each year.\n\nYoung Liberals exists to campaign on issues affecting young people and students, with branches across the UK. The organisation is run by young people and acts as a [[pressure group]] within the Liberal Democrats.\n\n[[Social liberalism]], [[economic liberalism]], [[social justice]], [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and [[pro-Europeanism]] are important components of the group's political philosophy. \n\nThe constitution of the Liberal Democrats requires an affiliated youth and student wing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/libdems/pages/376/attachments/original/1575638700/Federal_Constitution_November_2019.pdf?1575638700|title=The Federal Constitutionof the Liberal Democrats|last=|first=|date=|website=Liberal Democrats|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> Accordingly, Young Liberals is a Specified Associated Organisation (SAO) of the party. It is granted voting rights on various Liberal Democrat committees, such as the Party's Federal Board.\n\nYoung Liberals is affiliated to both the [[International Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth]] (IFLRY) and [[European Liberal Youth]].{{cn}} Its predecessors include the [[National League of Young Liberals]] (NLYL), founded in 1903 and the [[Union of Liberal Students]] (ULS), founded in 1920.\n\n==Organisation and Structure==\n\n===Federal organisation===\nYoung Liberals is the main party, organised in [[Great Britain]] on a federal basis, compromising of [[Welsh Young Liberals]] in [[Wales]], [[Scottish Young Liberals]] in [[Scotland]] and [[English Young Liberals]] in [[England]]. The Convenor of each of these groups organises the regional activity of Young Liberals.{{cn}}\n\n===Executive===\nThe federal organisation of Young Liberals organises liaisons with Liberal Democrats and affiliated organisations. The Federal Executive (current positions: Chair, Vice-Chair, Events Officer, Campaigns Officer, Communications Officer, Finance Officer, International Officer, Policy Officer, Membership Development Officer, Accessibility, Diversity and Standards Officer and Non Portfolio Officer,<ref name=exec>{{Cite web |url=http://www.youngliberqls.uk/exec | title = Meet The Exec | accessdate = 13 March 2018 }}</ref>) operates alongside committees for Conferences, Policy and International affairs. These committees, barring ''ex officio'' members such as representatives from state organisations and delegates from the executive, are elected by the Young Liberals membership via an all-member ballot, terms beginning on 1 November and are responsible to Conference. The English, Scottish and Welsh representatives are elected by the memberships of the state organisations - [[English Young Liberals]], [[Scottish Young Liberals]] and [[Welsh Young Liberals]].<ref name=libyouthconst>{{Cite web| url = http://www.liberalyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Constitution-Liberal-Youth-2011.pdf| title = The Federal Constitution &ndash; Liberal Youth| accessdate = 7 November 2011| format = pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111203115012/http://www.liberalyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Constitution-Liberal-Youth-2011.pdf| archive-date = 3 December 2011| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In this way the activities of young and student members remain formally independent from but closely engaged with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nYoung Liberals has had an active branch in Northern Ireland since 2010, under the name of Liberal Youth Northern Ireland, which operates as the youth branch of the Northern Ireland Liberal Democrats. Since 2014 it has become an official branch of Young Liberals, though for administrative purposes it is a branch of the English Young Liberals rather than a separate state branch. Liberal Youth Northern Ireland maintains a close working relationship with Alliance Youth, the youth wing of the Alliance Party.\n\n===Conferences===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe federal Conference is the sovereign body of the Young Liberals and has power to determine policy and direction. The federal Young Liberals usually hosts two conferences a year, a conference in the Winter and a training weekend known as 'Activate' in the Summer, which also acts as the constitutionally mandated Annual General Meeting. At conferences policy motions which shape YL policy and amendments to the organisations constitution are debated, alongside training and speaker sessions.\n\nIn addition, during each conference there is an Executive Scrutiny session, whereby members of the executive submit reports to conference on their activities and actions in their job. After each report motions on officers are debated, wherein any member can submit a Motion of commendation, Motion of censure or Motion of no confidence in an officer. Motions of commendation and censure are non-binding opinions of conference passed by a simple majority, expressing either positive or negative opinion on the actions of an officer. Motions of no confidence are binding motions which if passed have the effect of removing an officer from their position and require a two thirds majority in order to pass.\n\n====Conference Locations====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Spring 2008 saw LDYS renamed as '''Liberal Youth''', at an event hosted by the Liberal Democrat leader, [[Nick Clegg]].<ref>{{cite press_release | url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/nick-clegg-launches-liberal-youth-2404.html | title=Nick Clegg launches Liberal Youth | publisher=Liberal Democrat Voice | date=25 March 2008 | accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref> Liberal Youth is the successor organisation to all the youth and student wings of the Liberal Democrats, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], including the [[Union of Liberal Students]], the [[National League of Young Liberals]], (the Liberal party's youth wings), the Young Social Democrats and Students for Social Democracy (the youth and student wings of the Social Democratic Party).\n\nThe Liberal Party and the SDP each had separate student and youth wings until their merger in 1988; these merged in England to form the Student Liberal Democrats and the Young Liberal Democrats of England. In Scotland, there was a separate Scottish Young Liberal Democrats (which also included students of all ages). Liberal Democrat Youth and Students was itself created in 1993 from a merger of the Student Liberal Democrats  and the Young Liberal Democrats of England who had shared many resources in the run-up.  The merger talks were overseen by a committee which included Sarah Gurling, who later married the late [[Charles Kennedy]]. LDYS reorganised into a federal structure in 2000 and then admitted Scottish Young Liberal Democrats as its Scottish federal unit in 2002 - forming a single GB-wide organisation for the first time since the combined ULS-NLYL committees of the 1970s.\n\n===List of former Chairs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!\n!

The British frigate [[Protector (1779 frigate)|''Hussar'']], under the command of [[Thomas McNamara Russell]], captured the French frigate ''Sybille'', under the command of [[Th\u00e9obald Ren\u00e9, Comte de Kergariou-Locmaria|Kergariou-Locmaria]].  The circumstances of the battle included controversial violations of accepted [[rules of war]] regarding the flying of [[false flag]]s and distress signals.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Action of 2 January 1783}}\n''Sybille'', a relatively new French frigate, was commanded by Kergariou-Locmaria, a French naval officer.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LtEDAAAAMAAJ&dq=kergariou%20sybille&pg=PA249#v=onepage&q=kergariou%20sybille&f=false ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Acad\u00e9mique de Brest'']</ref> ''Sybille'' had three weeks previously engaged the 32-gun British frigate [[French frigate Magicienne (1778)|HMS ''Magicienne'']], under Captain [[Thomas Graves (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Graves]]. The ships had fought until they had both been dismasted and were forced to disengage. ''Sybille'' made for a French port under a [[jury rig]] and was then caught in a violent storm. Due to this unfortunate series of events Kergariou had been obliged to throw twelve of his guns overboard.\n\n==Action==\nOn 22 January 1783 ''Hussar'' sighted the French 32-gun frigate [[French frigate Sibylle (1777)|''Sybille'']]. When she sighted ''Hussar'', Kergariou ordered the English flag hoisted over the French, the recognised signal of a [[prize (law)|prize]], and at the same time, in the shrouds, an English yachting flag, union downwards, the internationally recognised signal of distress.<ref name=troude238>Troude, vol.2, p.238</ref><ref name=\"levot10\">Levot, ''Biographie bretonne'', vol.2, p.10</ref> Accordingly, Russell bore down to her assistance, but as the two ships drew near, Russell became suspicious and bore away.

He then placed the count under close arrest. The crew of ''Hussar'' discovered \u00a3500 in valuables aboard ''Sybille'' which the French officers claimed as personal property.

The official account was kept from the general public and Russell's accounts of the affair were not published. Kergariou sent his subordinate, the [[Charles Gabriel Morel d'Escures|Chevalier d'Escures]] to see Russell. The Frenchman attempted to threaten Russell with retaliation should he ever publish an account of the matter. When Kergariou was released, he said, Kergariou would use his influence at the French court to acquire another ship to hunt Russell down should that happen. When Russell failed to be moved, the count, again through his subordinate, issued a challenge to Russell to demand personal satisfaction. Russell considered the challenge and transmitted this answer for delivery to Kergariou: \"Sir I have considered your challenge maturely...I will fight him, by land or by water, on foot or on horseback, in any part of this globe that he pleases.

Arbuthnot convinced Russell that he should not attempt to follow Kergariou and so they returned to England.\n\nKergariou himself moved to England five years later at the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]]; in 1795, he was part of a Royalist band supported by the British government and took part in the attempted [[Invasion of France (1795)|Invasion of France]] in 1795. At the [[Invasion of France (1795)|Battle of Quiberon]], Hoche's troops captured him; the Revolutionaries sentenced him to death and shot him.\n\n=== References ===\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|2}}\n;Bibliography\n* J.

The British frigate [[Protector (1779 frigate)|''Hussar'']], under the command of [[Thomas McNamara Russell]], captured the French frigate ''Sybille'', under the command of [[Th\u00e9obald Ren\u00e9, Comte de Kergariou-Locmaria|Kergariou-Locmaria]].  The circumstances of the battle included controversial violations of accepted [[rules of war]] regarding the flying of [[false flag]]s and distress signals.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Action of 2 January 1783}}\n''Sybille'', a relatively new French frigate, was commanded by Kergariou-Locmaria, whose name is badly misspelled in British histories.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LtEDAAAAMAAJ&dq=kergariou%20sybille&pg=PA249#v=onepage&q=kergariou%20sybille&f=false ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Acad\u00e9mique de Brest'']</ref> ''Sybille'' had three weeks previously engaged the 32-gun British frigate [[French frigate Magicienne (1778)|HMS ''Magicienne'']], under Captain [[Thomas Graves (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Graves]]. The ships had fought until they had both been dismasted and were forced to disengage. ''Sybille'' made for a French port under a [[jury rig]] and was then caught in a violent storm. Due to this unfortunate series of events Kergariou had been obliged to throw twelve of his guns overboard.\n\n==Action==\nOn 22 January 1783 ''Hussar'' sighted the French 32-gun frigate [[French frigate Sibylle (1777)|''Sybille'']]. When she sighted ''Hussar'', Kergariou ordered the English flag hoisted over the French, the recognised signal of a [[prize (law)|prize]], and at the same time, in the shrouds, an English yachting flag, union downwards, the internationally recognised signal of distress.<ref name=troude238>Troude, vol.2, p.238</ref><ref name=\"levot10\">Levot, ''Biographie bretonne'', vol.2, p.10</ref> Accordingly, Russell bore down to her assistance, but as the two ships drew near, Russell became suspicious and bore away.
