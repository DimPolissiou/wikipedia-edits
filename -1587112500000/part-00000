While there, his car breaks down, he's mugged, the phone eats the last quarter he has \u2014 and by the time he is rescued by activist Stan Johnson ([[Christopher Birt]]) and returned to his car, it's half-stripped and the thieves have stolen his barbecue. Ben is very impressed by the young man, and when Stan's accused of trying to kill the landlord of the apartment complex he lives in, Ben steps in to defend him and to stand up to the landlord George Mitchell ([[H. Richard Greene]]), who is a very respected man in the legal community.\n\n''Note'': This episode contains hallmark elements of a [[series finale]], but was not aired as such, and instead aired fifth-to-last, yet features several narrative elements that would plainly suggest the series is coming to an end. For the first time, Ben Matlock gets himself thrown out of the courtroom on his own Atlanta home turf, because he has finally tried a judge's patience too far and has a massive outburst of indignation, which ironically works to his advantage and ultimately helps his client go free. Instead of being cited for contempt of court, Matlock walks in on a surprise birthday party in the courtroom being thrown by his friends and colleagues, and the judge, Judge Claggett, a good friend of his, respects what he did and decides to forget about it because it is Ben's birthday, so long as he doesn't do this again. After the festivities draw to a close and night has fallen, the only people left in the courtroom are the main cast of Ben, Jeri, and Cliff. Billy is tickled by news of Ben going \"bonkers\", and Ben reminisces with Billy about being a lawyer for years and this case striking a chord with him. Tired, Jeri and Cliff are ready to go, and Billy begins to follow, but Ben lingers. After Ben requests a moment to himself before following them home, Jeri and Cliff step out and the lights in the room are turned off. A poignant final scene similar to the ending of ''[[Cheers]]'' occurs where Ben is standing alone in the courtroom with the lights off, nostalgically looking at it for one last time, before finally walking out, playing out to a more sentimental and gentle version of the ''Matlock'' theme that implies this is to be our farewell to dear Ben, and leaving viewers looking in on an empty, peaceful courtroom that for the moment has no more cases to be tried and waits for another day's traffic of legal business.\n\n''Guest star'': [[James McEachin]] as Hollis Greeley\n |LineColor=B2BEB5\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Matlock (season 9)\n |EpisodeNumber=190\n |EpisodeNumber2=15\n |Title=The Heist: Part 1\n |DirectedBy=Leo Penn\n |WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay|t=Anne Collins|s=Gerald Sanoff and Joel Steiger}}\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|4|27}}\n |Aux4=16.80{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n |ShortSummary= Ben and Jerri head out to the beach with Billy and Cliff, while Cliff is preparing for an upcoming triathlon.

For the first time, Ben Matlock gets himself thrown out of the courtroom on his own Atlanta home turf, because he has finally tried a judge's patience too far and has a massive outburst of indignation, which ironically works to his advantage and ultimately helps his client go free. Instead of being cited for contempt of court, Matlock walks in on a surprise birthday party in the courtroom being thrown by his friends and colleagues, and the judge, Judge Claggett, a good friend of his, respects what he did and decides to forget about it because it is Ben's birthday, so long as he doesn't do this again. After the festivities draw to a close and night has fallen, the only people left in the courtroom are the main cast of Ben, Jeri, and Cliff. Billy is tickled by news of Ben going \"bonkers\", and Ben reminisces with Billy about being a lawyer for years and this case striking a chord with him. Tired, Jeri and Cliff are ready to go, and Billy begins to follow, but Ben lingers. After Ben requests a moment to himself before following them home, Jeri and Cliff step out and the lights in the room are turned off. A poignant final scene similar to the ending of ''[[Cheers]]'' occurs where Ben is standing alone in the courtroom with the lights off, nostalgically looking at it for one last time, before finally walking out, playing out to a more sentimental and gentle version of the ''Matlock'' theme that implies this is to be our farewell to dear Ben, and leaving viewers looking in on an empty, peaceful courtroom that for the moment has no more cases to be tried and waits for another day's traffic of legal business.\n\n''Guest star'': [[James McEachin]] as Hollis Greeley\n |LineColor=B2BEB5\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Matlock (season 9)\n |EpisodeNumber=190\n |EpisodeNumber2=15\n |Title=The Heist: Part 1\n |DirectedBy=Leo Penn\n |WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay|t=Anne Collins|s=Gerald Sanoff and Joel Steiger}}\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|4|27}}\n |Aux4=16.80{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n |ShortSummary= Ben and Jerri head out to the beach with Billy and Cliff, while Cliff is preparing for an upcoming triathlon.

The company was founded in September 2006 by [[University of Southern California]] roommates Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill, as they sought to create a company that continuously improves on an already released game, instead of commencing development on a new one. Riot Games was majority-acquired by [[Tencent]] in February 2011 and fully acquired in December 2015. {{As of|2018|05}}, Riot Games operates 24 offices around the world, in which it employs 2,500 staff members.\n\nRiot Games is best known for ''[[League of Legends]]'', a [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game and the company's flagship product. The game was first released in October 2009 and subsequently became the game with the highest active player count by 2013. Since 2011, Riot Games also operates various esports tournaments for the game, including the [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]], the [[League of Legends Championship Series|Championship Series]], the [[League of Legends European Championship|European Championship]], and the [[Mid-Season Invitational]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Riot Games (2006).svg|thumb|The original Riot Games logo, used from 2006 to 2019]]\nRiot Games' founders, Brandon \"Ryze\" Beck and Marc \"Tryndamere\" Merrill, became friends while business students and roommates at the [[University of Southern California]], where they bonded over video games.<ref name=\"Kollar16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/13/12891656/the-past-present-and-future-of-league-of-legends-studio-riot-games |title=The past, present and future of League of Legends studio Riot Games |first=Phil |last=Kollar |date=September 13, 2016 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=June 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612194103/https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/13/12891656/the-past-present-and-future-of-league-of-legends-studio-riot-games |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Beck and Merrill were frustrated because they felt game developers were not listening to fans.<ref name=\"Kollar16\" /> Developers, they believed, moved from game to game too quickly, leaving their passionate communities behind.<ref name=\"Kollar16\" /> During their time playing video games together, Beck and Merrill created an idea for a company that continually introduced new features to its games.<ref name=\"Blakely16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201612/burt-helm-lindsay-blakely/company-of-the-year-riot-games.html |title=Why Riot Games Is Inc.'s 2016 Company of the Year |first1=Lindsay |last1=Blakely |first2=Burt |last2=Helm |date=December 2016 |website=[[Inc.

The company was founded in September 2006 by [[University of Southern California]] roommates Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill, as they sought to create a company that continuously improves on an already released game, instead of commencing development on a new one. Riot Games was majority-acquired by [[Tencent]] in February 2011 and fully acquired in December 2015. {{As of|2018|05}}, Riot Games operates 24 offices around the world, in which it employs 2,500 staff members.\n\nRiot Games is best known for ''[[League of Legends]]'', a [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game and the company's flagship product. The game was first released in October 2009 and subsequently became the game with the highest active player count by 2013. Since 2011, Riot Games also operates various esports tournaments for the game, including the [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]], the [[League of Legends Championship Series|Championship Series]], the [[League of Legends European Championship|European Championship]], and the [[Mid-Season Invitational]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Riot Games (2006).svg|thumb|The original Riot Games logo, used from 2006 to 2019]]\nRiot Games' founders, Brandon \"Ryze\" Beck and Marc \"Tryndamere\" Merrill, became friends while business students and roommates at the [[University of Southern California]], where they bonded over video games.<ref name=\"Kollar16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/13/12891656/the-past-present-and-future-of-league-of-legends-studio-riot-games |title=The past, present and future of League of Legends studio Riot Games |first=Phil |last=Kollar |date=September 13, 2016 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=June 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612194103/https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/13/12891656/the-past-present-and-future-of-league-of-legends-studio-riot-games |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Beck and Merrill were frustrated because they felt game developers were not listening to fans.<ref name=\"Kollar16\" /> Developers, they believed, moved from game to game too quickly, leaving their passionate communities behind.<ref name=\"Kollar16\" /> During their time playing video games together, Beck and Merrill created an idea for a company that continually introduced new features to its games.<ref name=\"Blakely16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201612/burt-helm-lindsay-blakely/company-of-the-year-riot-games.html |title=Why Riot Games Is Inc.'s 2016 Company of the Year |first1=Lindsay |last1=Blakely |first2=Burt |last2=Helm |date=December 2016 |website=[[Inc.
