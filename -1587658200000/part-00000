Ziegler discovered the original Titanium based catalyst essential for olefin polymerization, while Natta used the catalyst to alter and control the [[stereochemistry]] (tacticity) of the olefin polymers (hence [[Ziegler\u2013Natta catalyst]]).<ref>http://pslc.ws/mactest/ziegler.htm</ref>  By controlling the tacticity of the polymer, a chain can, for example, either be semi [[crystalline]] or [[amorphous]], rigid or elastic, heat resistant or have a low [[glass transition temperature]].  Much research since has been dedicated to predicting and creating polymers based on this work.  [[Living polymerization]] is the term coined to describe the use of specially made catalysts (often involving transition metal centers) in olefin polymerization, since the polymer chains self-propagate in the presence of the catalyst until intentionally terminated.\n\nLiving polymerization, however, produces only one type of tacticity per catalyst.  While the specific tacticity can be controlled by altering the type of catalyst used, creating a block copolymer requires that the polymerization be terminated, the catalyst destroyed, and that the chain re-propagate using another catalyst that produces the desired stereochemistry.  Such manipulations are usually difficult, however.\n\n== Method ==\nChain shuttling polymerization makes use of two catalysts and a '''chain shuttling agent''' (CSA) to generate copolymers of alternating [[tacticity]].  Catalyst 1 (Cat1) propagates a polyolefin of a desired tacticity.  Catalyst 2 (Cat2) generates another chain of a different tacticity.  The two chains are allowed to co-propagate in a single reactor in the same living polymer fashion as before.  To alternate the tacticity, a CSA will [[chain transfer|transfer]] the polymer chain from its respective catalyst.  The CSA can then bind to Cat2 and attach the chain to Cat2.  When the chain attaches to Cat2, the polymerization of that chain continues, except it now propagates with the tacticity dictated by Cat2, not Cat1.  The general result is that the chain will alternate between two different tacticities.  As the forward and reverse reactions occur, the polymer chain is \u201cshuttled\u201d back and forth between the two catalysts and a block copolymer is formed.<ref>Gibson, V. \u201cShuttling Polyolefins to a New Materials Dimension\u201d Science Vol. 312 May 2006</ref>\n[[Image:Chain Shuttling Diagram.jpg|center|Reaction scheme for chain shuttling polymerization]]\nThe shuttling of chains back and forth from catalysts via a CSA can be viewed as a competing [[chemical equilibrium]].  Note that the forward and reverse reactions of CSA binding and leaving either Cat1 or Cat2 are possible.  This competition means that a chain can leave Cat1 via a CSA and the reattach to Cat1, polymerizing the same tacticity.  The [[reaction rate|rate]] at which the reattachment of Cat1 occurs can be controlled by altering the relative concentrations of Cat1, Cat2 and CSA.  For example, if one wanted to produce a polymer with the properties mainly resulting from the use of Cat1 and only wanted to influence its properties slightly by the presence of Cat2, a greater concentration of Cat1 would be used than for Cat2.  The rate of alternation between tacticity can be controlled by altering the concentration of CSA relative to Cat1 and Cat2; having a higher concentration of CSA means that the chains will shuttle back and forth more rapidly, creating shorter units of alternating tacticity.\n\n== Advantages ==\nThe first clear advantage of chain shuttling is that one can design copolymers with more desirable traits.  A polymer that is normally semi crystalline and rigid can be altered so that it has a lower glass transition temperature.  An amorphous, elastic polymer membrane can be altered to have a higher melting point. The technique opens the door for tailor-made polymers to be widely accessible and simple to make inexpensively.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Polymer chemistry]]\n", "text_old": "'''Chain shuttling polymerization''' is a dual-[[catalyst]] method for producing block [[copolymers]] with alternating or variable [[tacticity]].

players for the Edmonton Oilers of the World Hockey Association (WHA)'''.\nIt includes players that have played at least one regular season or playoff game for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] (or the ''Alberta Oilers'', as they were known in their inaugural season) as a franchise in the [[World Hockey Association]] between 1972 and 1979.\n\nA total of 130 skaters and 14 goalies played for the Oilers in the seven seasons between [[1972\u201373 WHA season|1972\u201373]] and [[1978\u201379 WHA season|1978\u201379]].  Of those, 16 also played for the Oilers after they joined the [[National Hockey League]] for the [[1979\u201380 NHL season]].\n\nThe skater with the most games as a WHA Oiler is [[Al Hamilton]], with 455 (he also scored the most points, with 311).  The goaltender with the most games as a WHA Oiler is [[Dave Dryden]], with 197 (he also registered the most wins, with 94).<!--- article is about having played, so # of games is a criteria relevant to purpose of article, have added the other superlatives in parentheses as being a side note for this list ---> There are 6 players who only played a single game as an Oiler during these years, and one player who never played a regular season game (participated in 2 playoff games).\n\n{{See also|List of Edmonton Oilers players}}\nFour ex-Oilers from the WHA era were later elected into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]: [[Jacques Plante]] (1978), [[Norm Ullman]] (1982), and [[Wayne Gretzky]] (1999) as players, and [[Glen Sather]] (1997) in the builder category.\n\n==Key==\n{{legend2|#dbedff|Also

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Brauner  | first1 = Fran\u00e7oise Erna  | authorlink = | title = L'an\u00e9antissement de deux r\u00e9seaux de la r\u00e9sistance | doi = 10.3917/sn.018.0034\n | journal = Sud/Nord | volume = 18  | issue = 1  | pages = 34-48 | year = 2003  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Brauner  | first1 = Fran\u00e7oise Erna  | authorlink = | title = L'an\u00e9antissement de deux r\u00e9seaux de la r\u00e9sistance | doi = 10.3917/sn.018.0034\n | journal = Sud/Nord | volume = 18  | issue = 1  | pages = 34-48 | year = 2003  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

She was his sixth wife, as all his previous wives had died childless and in quick succession. They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  R\u0101malingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu R\u0101man; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child R\u0101malingam.\n\n===Childhood and divine experiences===\nOnce, R\u0101malingam's parents went to the [[Chidambaram Temple|Chidambaram Natar\u0101jar Temple]] with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the [[priest]]  was offering  [[Archana (Hinduism)|Deepa aradhana]] (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by R\u0101malingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:\n\n:\"No sooner the Light was perceived, happiness prevailed on me\", and\n\n:\"The sweet nectar was tasted by me as soon as the Arut perun jothi (Supreme Grace Of Light) became visible\".<ref>[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf Arutperunjothi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916051722/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tamil Nadu Text books online</ref>\n\nIn 1824, his father R\u0101mayy\u0101 pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna k\u0101vanam, Ponneri. Saint R\u0101malingam was a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at [[Sevenwells]] area of [[Chennai]], which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] After R\u0101malingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha sw\u0101mi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give R\u0101malingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. God gave food before sister in law gave food. In return, R\u0101malingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. R\u0101malingam said:\n\n:\"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve.\"<ref>Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm \"Compassion is the essence of Saint R\u0101malingam's philosophy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAt one time, R\u0101malingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upany\u0101sam]] (religious stories) session as up\u0101sakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya pur\u0101nam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|N\u0101yan\u0101rs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. R\u0101malingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. R\u0101malingam says thanks to the [[divinity|Divine]] by:\n\n:\"Effulgent flame of grace, that lit in me intelligence, to know untaught.\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalar.org/WebComponents/FrontPage.aspx?ViewName=enBlogs&WebSiteId=1&ConId=294 Early life of Saint Vallal\u0101r]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nR\u0101malingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to worshipping the formless.\n\nR\u0101malingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru v\u0101sagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\n==Teachings==\n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by R\u0101malinga adigal ]]\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to [[Chidambaram]] where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Sw\u0101migal. At the request of one R\u0101makrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at [[Karunguzhi]] and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the [[caste|caste system]] because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the \"Samarasa  Vedha Sanmarga Sangam\" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed \"Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam\",<ref name=\"ambalamyoga.org\" /> meaning \"Society for pure truth in universal self-hood\".\n\nIn 1867, he established a  facility serving free food named \"The Sathya Dharma Salai\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalarspace.com/VallalarGroups/ Image of Sathya Dharma Salai]</ref> in [[Vadalur]]. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. R\u0101malinga disliked people eating [[non-vegetarian]] foods, about which he said:<blockquote>When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=\"The Hindu\" article on Vallal\u0101r |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n \n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to the Sathya Gnana Sabha. The sign above it reads \"only those who have renounced meat and murder should enter\"]]\nOn January 25th of 1872, R\u0101malingam opened the \"[[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya Gnana Sabha]]\" (Hall of True Knowledge) at [[Vadalur]]. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gn\u0101na sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gn\u0101na sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.<ref>[https://www.vallalyaar.com/enquiry-on-truth-satvisaaram-vallalar/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n \nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its truth.

He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. Looking other souls with compassion, also own soul from birth and death. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallal\u0101r was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth. Today there are spiritual groups spread out all over the world who practice the teachings of R\u0101malingam and follow the path of Arul Perum Jothi.\n\n\nTo attain Deathless life its important to focus mind at the Thiruvadi Of Guru.\nIn the beginning meditate on the physical form, later it will lead to non physical form.\nSathya gnana sabai is built to have same as inner experience. \nSirsabai and Porsabai represents Thiruvadi of God.\nNot Respecting a Guru and Not Offering Guru is a sin.\n\n== Chennai Temples ==\n[[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Kandha kottam Kandasw\u0101mi Temple]]<ref>Official website Kandha kottam temple [http://kandhakottam.tnhrce.in/contact.html kandhakottam.tnhrce.in],  [http://www.kaumaram.com/\u0101layam/kandha_kottam/index.php Chennai Kandha kottam at Kaumaram.com]</ref> is located in the [[George Town, Chennai|Parry's Corner]] neighbourhood of [[Chennai]] city. R\u0101malingam and his mother lived with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at Sevenwells area of Chennai, which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] He spent a lot of his time at this temple. R\u0101malingam composed 'Deiva mani malai' here. At this temple, there is a hall called the [[Mandapa|Mukha mandapam]], where the idols of [[Ganesha|Sarva Siddhi Vinayakar]], [[Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple|Meenakshi Sundareswarar]], Idumban, Sri R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal,<ref>[http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/New_en.php?id=12 Dinamalar newspaper- Kandha kottam photos]</ref> and Pamban sw\u0101migal are found. The locality where he lived, has been renamed as '[[Vallalar Nagar|Vallal\u0101r nagar]]'.\n\nVallalar worshipped Thiruvottiyur Thiyagarajar and Vadivudai Amman Temple. He has written many divine songs against both. Vallalar obtained grace from vadivudai amman(sakthi).\n\n==Literary works==\nAs a musician and divine poet, he composed 5818 poems teaching universal love and peace, compiled into 'Six Thiru Muraigal', which are all available today as a single book called Thiruvarutpa<ref>[http://www.tn.gov.in/tnpsc/FINEARTSde.html Tamil Nadu Public service commission included Thiru arut pa in syllabus]</ref> (tiru-arut-pa, holy book of grace).\n\nAnother work of his is the Manumurai Kanda V\u0101sagam<ref>[http://vallalar.org/Tamil/V000000076B Manumurai Kanda V\u0101sagam ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref> describing the life of [[Manu Needhi Cholan]].\n\nJeeva Karunya Ozhukkam<ref>[http://vallalar.org/english Details on Jeeva Karunya Ozhukkam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002210/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/Jeiva%20Karunai.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}</ref>\n\n===Songs set to music===\n* Thiruvarutpa songs of R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal are divine sung in concerts and now at least 25 songs (in Thiru varut p\u0101 Isai M\u0101lai) are given with swara-t\u0101la notation.\n* ''Th\u0101y\u0101gi thandhaiyumai'' ([[Hamsadhwani]]), ''Idu nalla tharunam'' ([[Dheerasankarabharanam|Shankar\u0101bharanam]])\n* ''Varuvar azhaithu vadi'' (Begada) and ''Thaen ena inikkum''.\n\nSome of his songs were set to music by [[Sirkazhi Govindarajan|S\u012brk\u0101zhi Govindhar\u0101jan]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2004/11/05/stories/2004110503330900.htm Sirkazhi Govindarajan] from \"The Hindu\" newspaper</ref>\n\n==Supposed physical transformation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nPerhaps one of the most notable factors of this sage is the claim that he supposedly attained a divinization of the physical body. He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this R\u0101malingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\n==Merge with Divine as One==\nOn October 22, 1873, R\u0101malingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Val\u0101gam'' in Mettukuppam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=Article in \"The Hindu\" narration on Siddhi Valakam |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, R\u0101malingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be \"United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls',\" as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance<ref>[http://bp3.blogger.com/_ye_-S-DaxNE/R_RyHb_UkJI/AAAAAAAAAqs/98zB2rqpjDI/s1600-h/gazette+1.jpg The image of engraved stone in Vadalur] about the Madras District Gazette's note describing the R\u0101malingam's disappearance incident, that took place on January 30, 1874</ref> were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District [[Gazette]]er'.\n\nThiruarutpa explains that he transmigrated the physical body to divine light body by thavam/penance.

She was his sixth wife, as all his previous wives had died childless and in quick succession. They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  R\u0101malingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu R\u0101man; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child R\u0101malingam.\n\n===Childhood and divine experiences===\nOnce, R\u0101malingam's parents went to the [[Chidambaram Temple|Chidambaram Natar\u0101jar Temple]] with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the [[priest]]  was offering  [[Archana (Hinduism)|Deepa aradhana]] (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by R\u0101malingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:\n\n:\"No sooner the Light was perceived, happiness prevailed on me\", and\n\n:\"The sweet nectar was tasted by me as soon as the Arut perun jothi (Supreme Grace Of Light) became visible\".<ref>[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf Arutperunjothi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916051722/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tamil Nadu Text books online</ref>\n\nIn 1824, his father R\u0101mayy\u0101 pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna k\u0101vanam, Ponneri. Saint R\u0101malingam was a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at [[Sevenwells]] area of [[Chennai]], which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] After R\u0101malingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha sw\u0101mi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give R\u0101malingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. God gave food before sister in law gave food. In return, R\u0101malingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. R\u0101malingam said:\n\n:\"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve.\"<ref>Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm \"Compassion is the essence of Saint R\u0101malingam's philosophy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAt one time, R\u0101malingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upany\u0101sam]] (religious stories) session as up\u0101sakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya pur\u0101nam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|N\u0101yan\u0101rs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. R\u0101malingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. R\u0101malingam says thanks to the [[divinity|Divine]] by:\n\n:\"Effulgent flame of grace, that lit in me intelligence, to know untaught.\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalar.org/WebComponents/FrontPage.aspx?ViewName=enBlogs&WebSiteId=1&ConId=294 Early life of Saint Vallal\u0101r]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nR\u0101malingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to worshipping the formless.\n\nR\u0101malingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru v\u0101sagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\n==Teachings==\n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by R\u0101malinga adigal ]]\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to [[Chidambaram]] where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Sw\u0101migal. At the request of one R\u0101makrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at [[Karunguzhi]] and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the [[caste|caste system]] because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the \"Samarasa  Vedha Sanmarga Sangam\" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed \"Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam\",<ref name=\"ambalamyoga.org\" /> meaning \"Society for pure truth in universal self-hood\".\n\nIn 1867, he established a  facility serving free food named \"The Sathya Dharma Salai\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalarspace.com/VallalarGroups/ Image of Sathya Dharma Salai]</ref> in [[Vadalur]]. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. R\u0101malinga disliked people eating [[non-vegetarian]] foods, about which he said:<blockquote>When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=\"The Hindu\" article on Vallal\u0101r |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n \n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to the Sathya Gnana Sabha. The sign above it reads \"only those who have renounced meat and murder should enter\"]]\nOn January 25th of 1872, R\u0101malingam opened the \"[[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya Gnana Sabha]]\" (Hall of True Knowledge) at [[Vadalur]]. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gn\u0101na sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gn\u0101na sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.<ref>[https://www.vallalyaar.com/enquiry-on-truth-satvisaaram-vallalar/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n \nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its truth.

He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. Looking other souls with compassion, also own soul from birth and death. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallal\u0101r was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth. Today there are spiritual groups spread out all over the world who practice the teachings of R\u0101malingam and follow the path of Arul Perum Jothi.\n\n\nTo attain Deathless life its important to focus mind at the Thiruvadi Of Guru.\nIn the beginning meditate on the physical form, later it will lead to non physical form.\nSathya gnana sabai is built to have same as inner experience. \nSirsabai and Porsabai represents Thiruvadi of God.\nNot Respecting a Guru and Not Offering Guru is a sin.\n\n== Chennai Temples ==\n[[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Kandha kottam Kandasw\u0101mi Temple]]<ref>Official website Kandha kottam temple [http://kandhakottam.tnhrce.in/contact.html kandhakottam.tnhrce.in],  [http://www.kaumaram.com/\u0101layam/kandha_kottam/index.php Chennai Kandha kottam at Kaumaram.com]</ref> is located in the [[George Town, Chennai|Parry's Corner]] neighbourhood of [[Chennai]] city. R\u0101malingam and his mother lived with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at Sevenwells area of Chennai, which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] He spent a lot of his time at this temple. R\u0101malingam composed 'Deiva mani malai' here. At this temple, there is a hall called the [[Mandapa|Mukha mandapam]], where the idols of [[Ganesha|Sarva Siddhi Vinayakar]], [[Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple|Meenakshi Sundareswarar]], Idumban, Sri R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal,<ref>[http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/New_en.php?id=12 Dinamalar newspaper- Kandha kottam photos]</ref> and Pamban sw\u0101migal are found. The locality where he lived, has been renamed as '[[Vallalar Nagar|Vallal\u0101r nagar]]'.\n\nVallalar worshipped Thiruvottiyur Thiyagarajar and Vadivudai Amman Temple. He has written many divine songs against both. Vallalar obtained grace from vadivudai amman(sakthi).\n\n==Literary works==\nAs a musician and divine poet, he composed 5818 poems teaching universal love and peace, compiled into 'Six Thiru Muraigal', which are all available today as a single book called Thiruvarutpa<ref>[http://www.tn.gov.in/tnpsc/FINEARTSde.html Tamil Nadu Public service commission included Thiru arut pa in syllabus]</ref> (tiru-arut-pa, holy book of grace).\n\nAnother work of his is the Manumurai Kanda V\u0101sagam<ref>[http://vallalar.org/Tamil/V000000076B Manumurai Kanda V\u0101sagam ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref> describing the life of [[Manu Needhi Cholan]].\n\nJeeva Karunya Ozhukkam<ref>[http://vallalar.org/english Details on Jeeva Karunya Ozhukkam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002210/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/Jeiva%20Karunai.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}</ref>\n\n===Songs set to music===\n* Thiruvarutpa songs of R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal are divine sung in concerts and now at least 25 songs (in Thiru varut p\u0101 Isai M\u0101lai) are given with swara-t\u0101la notation.\n* ''Th\u0101y\u0101gi thandhaiyumai'' ([[Hamsadhwani]]), ''Idu nalla tharunam'' ([[Dheerasankarabharanam|Shankar\u0101bharanam]])\n* ''Varuvar azhaithu vadi'' (Begada) and ''Thaen ena inikkum''.\n\nSome of his songs were set to music by [[Sirkazhi Govindarajan|S\u012brk\u0101zhi Govindhar\u0101jan]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2004/11/05/stories/2004110503330900.htm Sirkazhi Govindarajan] from \"The Hindu\" newspaper</ref>\n\n==Supposed physical transformation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nPerhaps one of the most notable factors of this sage is the claim that he supposedly attained a divinization of the physical body. He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this R\u0101malingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\n==Merge with Divine as One==\nOn October 22, 1873, R\u0101malingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Val\u0101gam'' in Mettukuppam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=Article in \"The Hindu\" narration on Siddhi Valakam |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, R\u0101malingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be \"United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls',\" as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance<ref>[http://bp3.blogger.com/_ye_-S-DaxNE/R_RyHb_UkJI/AAAAAAAAAqs/98zB2rqpjDI/s1600-h/gazette+1.jpg The image of engraved stone in Vadalur] about the Madras District Gazette's note describing the R\u0101malingam's disappearance incident, that took place on January 30, 1874</ref> were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District [[Gazette]]er'.\n\nThiruarutpa explains that he transmigrated the physical body to divine light body by thavam/penance.

Critics have observed that while Japan announced the first case of infection on 28 January, it took until 17 February for the Health Ministry to inform the public on how to reach public screening centers and 25 February, for the government to issue a \"basic policy\" on outbreak response. The overdue response times of the government has led critics to accuse Abe of \"callous indifference in the face of an unfolding disaster\" and the government as a whole as being \"out of touch with the lives of ordinary people that they seem genuinely uninterested in their plight\".<ref name=\"AutoDW-224\" /><ref name=\"AutoDW-225\" />\n\nThe strict constraints on testing for the virus by Japanese health authorities have drawn accusations from critics such as Masahiro Kami, a [[Hematology|hematologist]] and director of the Medical Governance Research Institute, towards Abe of wanting to \"downplay the number of infections or patients because of the upcoming Olympics.\" Reports that only a small select number of public health facilities were authorized to test for the virus, after which the results could only be processed by five government-approved companies, has created a bottleneck where clinics have been forced to turn away even patients who had high fevers. This has led some experts to question Japan's official case numbers, with Tobias Harris, of [[Teneo]] Intelligence in Washington, D.C. stating \"You wonder, if they were testing nearly as much as South Korea is testing, what would the actual number be?

Critics have observed that while Japan announced the first case of infection on 28 January, it took until 17 February for the Health Ministry to inform the public on how to reach public screening centers and 25 February, for the government to issue a \"basic policy\" on outbreak response. The overdue response times of the government has led critics to accuse Abe of \"callous indifference in the face of an unfolding disaster\" and the government as a whole as being \"out of touch with the lives of ordinary people that they seem genuinely uninterested in their plight\".<ref name=\"AutoDW-224\" /><ref name=\"AutoDW-225\" />\n\nThe strict constraints on testing for the virus by Japanese health authorities have drawn accusations from critics such as Masahiro Kami, a [[Hematology|hematologist]] and director of the Medical Governance Research Institute, towards Abe of wanting to \"downplay the number of infections or patients because of the upcoming Olympics.\" Reports that only a small select number of public health facilities were authorized to test for the virus, after which the results could only be processed by five government-approved companies, has created a bottleneck where clinics have been forced to turn away even patients who had high fevers. This has led some experts to question Japan's official case numbers, with Tobias Harris, of [[Teneo]] Intelligence in Washington, D.C. stating \"You wonder, if they were testing nearly as much as South Korea is testing, what would the actual number be?

When the power supply to the amplifier is first switched on, [[electronic noise]] in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations started. The noise travels around the loop and is amplified and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] until very quickly it converges on a [[sine wave]] at a single frequency.\n\nFeedback oscillator circuits can be classified according to the type of frequency selective filter they use in the feedback loop:<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />\n\n*In an ''[[RC oscillator]]'' circuit, the filter is a network of [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> RC oscillators are mostly used to generate lower frequencies, for example in the audio range.  Common types of RC oscillator circuits are the [[phase shift oscillator]] and the [[Wien bridge oscillator]].\n{{anchor|LC oscillator}}\n*In an ''LC oscillator'' circuit, the filter is a [[tuned circuit]] (often called a ''tank circuit''; the tuned circuit is a [[resonator]]) consisting of an [[inductor]] (L) and [[capacitor]] (C) connected together.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  Charge flows back and forth between the capacitor's plates through the inductor, so the tuned circuit can store electrical energy oscillating at its [[resonant frequency]]. There are small losses in the tank circuit, but the amplifier compensates for those losses and supplies the power for the output signal. LC oscillators are often used at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> when a tunable frequency source is necessary, such as in [[signal generator]]s, tunable radio [[transmitter]]s and the [[local oscillator]]s in [[radio receiver]]s.  Typical LC oscillator circuits are the [[Hartley oscillator|Hartley]], [[Colpitts oscillator|Colpitts]]<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> and [[Clapp oscillator|Clapp]] circuits.\n[[File:Oscillator comparison.svg|thumb|right|400px|Two common LC oscillator circuits, the Hartley and Colpitts oscillators]]\n\n*In a ''[[crystal oscillator]]'' circuit the filter is a [[piezoelectric]] crystal (commonly a [[quartz crystal]]).<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  The crystal mechanically vibrates as a [[resonator]], and its frequency of vibration determines the oscillation frequency. Crystals have a very high [[Q-factor]] and also better temperature stability than tuned circuits, so crystal oscillators have much better frequency stability than LC or RC oscillators. Crystal oscillators are the most common type of linear oscillator, used to stabilize the frequency of most [[radio transmitter]]s, and to generate the [[clock signal]] in computers and [[quartz clock]]s. Crystal oscillators often use the same circuits as LC oscillators, with the crystal replacing the [[tuned circuit]];<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> the [[Pierce oscillator]] circuit is also commonly used. Quartz crystals are generally limited to frequencies of 30&nbsp;MHz or below.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" />  Other types of resonators, [[dielectric resonator]]s and [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) devices, are used to control higher frequency oscillators, up into the [[microwave]] range.  For example, SAW oscillators are used to generate the radio signal in [[cell phone]]s.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Negative-resistance oscillator===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Negative resistance oscillator.svg\n| width1   = 190\n| image2   = Ganna gjenerators M31102-1.jpg\n| width2   = 162\n| footer   = ''(left)'' Typical block diagram of a negative resistance oscillator.

''(right)'' A negative-resistance microwave oscillator consisting of a [[Gunn diode]] in a [[cavity resonator]].  The negative resistance of the diode excites microwave oscillations in the cavity, which radiate out the aperture into a [[waveguide]].\n}}\n\nIn addition to the feedback oscillators described above, which use [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying active elements such as transistors and operational amplifiers, linear oscillators can also be built using [[port (circuit theory)|one-port]] (two terminal) devices with [[negative resistance]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> such as [[magnetron]] tubes, [[tunnel diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s and [[Gunn diode]]s.  Negative-resistance oscillators are usually used at high frequencies in the [[microwave]] range and above, since at these frequencies feedback oscillators perform poorly due to excessive phase shift in the feedback path.\n\nIn negative-resistance oscillators, a resonant circuit, such as an [[LC circuit]], [[crystal oscillator|crystal]], or [[Resonator#Cavity resonators|cavity resonator]], is connected across a device with [[negative differential resistance]], and a DC bias voltage is applied to supply energy.  A resonant circuit by itself is \"almost\" an oscillator; it can store energy in the form of electronic oscillations if excited, but because it has electrical resistance and other losses the oscillations are [[Harmonic oscillator#Damped harmonic oscillator|damped]] and decay to zero.  The negative resistance of the active device cancels the (positive) internal loss resistance in the resonator, in effect creating a resonator with no damping, which generates spontaneous continuous oscillations at its [[resonant frequency]].\n\nThe negative-resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying devices such as transistors and [[vacuum tube|tubes]] also have negative resistance.<ref name=\"Kung\">{{cite web\n | last = Kung\n | first = Fabian Wai Lee\n | title = Lesson 9: Oscillator Design\n | website = RF/Microwave Circuit Design\n | publisher = Prof. Kung's website, Multimedia University\n | year = 2009\n | url = http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | accessdate = October 17, 2012\n | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6a4ZRWA70?url=http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | archive-date = July 16, 2015\n | url-status = dead\n }}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, pp. 9\u201310, 14</ref><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\">{{cite book\n | last = Ellinger\n | first = Frank\n | title = Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and Technologies, 2nd Ed\n | publisher = Springer\n | year = 2008\n | location = USA\n | pages = 391\u2013394\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0pl9xYD0QNMC&pg=PA391&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-3540693246}}</ref>  At high frequencies, transistors and FETs do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show negative resistance due to internal feedback, causing them to oscillate.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\">{{cite book\n | last =  R\u00e4is\u00e4nen\n | first = Antti V.\n | author2=Arto Lehto\n | title = Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications\n | publisher = Artech House\n | year = 2003\n | location = USA\n | pages = 180\u2013182\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Dgkvf84xoC&pg=PA181\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-1580535427}}</ref><ref name=\"Maas\" /> High-frequency oscillators in general are designed using negative-resistance techniques.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\" />\n\nSome of the many harmonic oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 80%\"|Active devices used in oscillators and approximate maximum frequencies<ref name=\" Raisanen\" />\n|-\n!

The switching device periodically charges and discharges the energy stored in the storage element thus causing abrupt changes in the output waveform.\n\nSquare-wave relaxation oscillators are used to provide the [[clock signal]] for [[sequential logic]] circuits such as timers and [[digital counter|counters]], although crystal oscillators are often preferred for their greater stability. Triangle-wave or sawtooth oscillators are used in the timebase circuits that generate the horizontal deflection signals for [[cathode ray tube]]s in analogue [[oscilloscope]]s and [[television]] sets. They are also used in [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]s (VCOs), [[inverter]]s and [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]], [[dual-slope ADC|dual-slope analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs), and in [[function generator]]s to generate square and triangle waves for testing equipment. In general, relaxation oscillators are used at lower frequencies and have poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.\n\n[[Ring oscillator]]s are built of a ring of active delay stages.  Generally the ring has an odd number of inverting stages, so that there is no single stable state for the internal ring voltages. Instead, a single transition propagates endlessly around the ring.\n\nSome of the more common relaxation oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n*[[Multivibrator]]\n*[[Pearson\u2013Anson effect|Pearson\u2013Anson oscillator]]\n*[[Ring oscillator]]\n*[[Delay-line oscillator]]\n*[[Royer oscillator]]\n\n==Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)==\n{{Main|Voltage-controlled oscillator}}\nAn oscillator can be designed so that the oscillation frequency can be varied over some range by an input voltage or current. These [[voltage controlled oscillator]]s are widely used in [[phase-locked loop]]s, in which the oscillator's frequency can be locked to the frequency of another oscillator. These are ubiquitous in modern communications circuits, used in [[electronic filter|filters]], [[modulator]]s, [[demodulator]]s, and forming the basis of [[frequency synthesizer]] circuits which are used to tune radios and televisions.\n\nRadio frequency VCOs are usually made by adding a [[varactor]] diode to the [[tuned circuit]] or resonator in an oscillator circuit. Changing the DC voltage across the varactor changes its [[capacitance]], which changes the [[resonant frequency]] of the tuned circuit. Voltage controlled relaxation oscillators can be constructed by charging and discharging the energy storage capacitor with a voltage controlled [[current source]]. Increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.\n\n==History==\nThe first practical oscillators were based on [[electric arc]]s, which were used for lighting in the 19th century.

However, the [[triode]] vacuum tube oscillator performed poorly above 300&nbsp;MHz because of interelectrode capacitance.{{citation needed|reason=tune out capacitance; lighthouse tubes; transit time|date=April 2017}}  To reach higher frequencies, new \"transit time\" (velocity modulation) vacuum tubes were developed, in which electrons traveled in \"bunches\" through the tube.  The first of these was the [[Barkhausen\u2013Kurz tube|Barkhausen\u2013Kurz oscillator]] (1920), the first tube to produce power in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] range.  The most important and widely used were the [[klystron]] (R. and S. Varian, 1937) and the cavity [[magnetron]] (J. Randall and H. Boot, 1940).\n\nMathematical conditions for feedback oscillations, now called the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]], were derived by [[Heinrich Georg Barkhausen]] in 1921.

When the power supply to the amplifier is first switched on, [[electronic noise]] in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations started. The noise travels around the loop and is amplified and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] until very quickly it converges on a [[sine wave]] at a single frequency.\n\nFeedback oscillator circuits can be classified according to the type of frequency selective filter they use in the feedback loop:<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />\n\n*In an ''[[RC oscillator]]'' circuit, the filter is a network of [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> RC oscillators are mostly used to generate lower frequencies, for example in the audio range.  Common types of RC oscillator circuits are the [[phase shift oscillator]] and the [[Wien bridge oscillator]].\n{{anchor|LC oscillator}}\n*In an ''LC oscillator'' circuit, the filter is a [[tuned circuit]] (often called a ''tank circuit''; the tuned circuit is a [[resonator]]) consisting of an [[inductor]] (L) and [[capacitor]] (C) connected together.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  Charge flows back and forth between the capacitor's plates through the inductor, so the tuned circuit can store electrical energy oscillating at its [[resonant frequency]]. There are small losses in the tank circuit, but the amplifier compensates for those losses and supplies the power for the output signal. LC oscillators are often used at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> when a tunable frequency source is necessary, such as in [[signal generator]]s, tunable radio [[transmitter]]s and the [[local oscillator]]s in [[radio receiver]]s.  Typical LC oscillator circuits are the [[Hartley oscillator|Hartley]], [[Colpitts oscillator|Colpitts]]<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> and [[Clapp oscillator|Clapp]] circuits.\n[[File:Oscillator comparison.svg|thumb|right|400px|Two common LC oscillator circuits, the Hartley and Colpitts oscillators]]\n\n*In a ''[[crystal oscillator]]'' circuit the filter is a [[piezoelectric]] crystal (commonly a [[quartz crystal]]).<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  The crystal mechanically vibrates as a [[resonator]], and its frequency of vibration determines the oscillation frequency. Crystals have a very high [[Q-factor]] and also better temperature stability than tuned circuits, so crystal oscillators have much better frequency stability than LC or RC oscillators. Crystal oscillators are the most common type of linear oscillator, used to stabilize the frequency of most [[radio transmitter]]s, and to generate the [[clock signal]] in computers and [[quartz clock]]s. Crystal oscillators often use the same circuits as LC oscillators, with the crystal replacing the [[tuned circuit]];<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> the [[Pierce oscillator]] circuit is also commonly used. Quartz crystals are generally limited to frequencies of 30&nbsp;MHz or below.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" />  Other types of resonators, [[dielectric resonator]]s and [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) devices, are used to control higher frequency oscillators, up into the [[microwave]] range.  For example, SAW oscillators are used to generate the radio signal in [[cell phone]]s.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Negative-resistance oscillator===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Negative resistance oscillator.svg\n| width1   = 190\n| image2   = Ganna gjenerators M31102-1.jpg\n| width2   = 162\n| footer   = ''(left)'' Typical block diagram of a negative resistance oscillator.

The negative resistance of the diode excites microwave oscillations in the cavity, which radiate out the aperture into a [[waveguide]].\n}}\n\nIn addition to the feedback oscillators described above, which use [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying active elements such as transistors and operational amplifiers, linear oscillators can also be built using [[port (circuit theory)|one-port]] (two terminal) devices with [[negative resistance]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> such as [[magnetron]] tubes, [[tunnel diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s and [[Gunn diode]]s.  Negative-resistance oscillators are usually used at high frequencies in the [[microwave]] range and above, since at these frequencies feedback oscillators perform poorly due to excessive phase shift in the feedback path.\n\nIn negative-resistance oscillators, a resonant circuit, such as an [[LC circuit]], [[crystal oscillator|crystal]], or [[Resonator#Cavity resonators|cavity resonator]], is connected across a device with [[negative differential resistance]], and a DC bias voltage is applied to supply energy.  A resonant circuit by itself is \"almost\" an oscillator; it can store energy in the form of electronic oscillations if excited, but because it has electrical resistance and other losses the oscillations are [[Harmonic oscillator#Damped harmonic oscillator|damped]] and decay to zero.  The negative resistance of the active device cancels the (positive) internal loss resistance in the resonator, in effect creating a resonator with no damping, which generates spontaneous continuous oscillations at its [[resonant frequency]].\n\nThe negative-resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying devices such as transistors and [[vacuum tube|tubes]] also have negative resistance.<ref name=\"Kung\">{{cite web\n | last = Kung\n | first = Fabian Wai Lee\n | title = Lesson 9: Oscillator Design\n | website = RF/Microwave Circuit Design\n | publisher = Prof. Kung's website, Multimedia University\n | year = 2009\n | url = http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | accessdate = October 17, 2012\n | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6a4ZRWA70?url=http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | archive-date = July 16, 2015\n | url-status = dead\n }}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, pp. 9\u201310, 14</ref><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\">{{cite book\n | last = Ellinger\n | first = Frank\n | title = Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and Technologies, 2nd Ed\n | publisher = Springer\n | year = 2008\n | location = USA\n | pages = 391\u2013394\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0pl9xYD0QNMC&pg=PA391&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-3540693246}}</ref>  At high frequencies, transistors and FETs do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show negative resistance due to internal feedback, causing them to oscillate.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\">{{cite book\n | last =  R\u00e4is\u00e4nen\n | first = Antti V.\n | author2=Arto Lehto\n | title = Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications\n | publisher = Artech House\n | year = 2003\n | location = USA\n | pages = 180\u2013182\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Dgkvf84xoC&pg=PA181\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-1580535427}}</ref><ref name=\"Maas\" /> High-frequency oscillators in general are designed using negative-resistance techniques.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\" />\n\nSome of the many harmonic oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 80%\"|Active devices used in oscillators and approximate maximum frequencies<ref name=\" Raisanen\" />\n|-\n!

The switching device periodically charges and discharges the energy stored in the storage element thus causing abrupt changes in the output waveform.\n\nSquare-wave relaxation oscillators are used to provide the [[clock signal]] for [[sequential logic]] circuits such as timers and [[digital counter|counters]], although crystal oscillators are often preferred for their greater stability. Triangle-wave or sawtooth oscillators are used in the timebase circuits that generate the horizontal deflection signals for [[cathode ray tube]]s in analogue [[oscilloscope]]s and [[television]] sets. They are also used in [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]s (VCOs), [[inverter]]s and [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]], [[dual-slope ADC|dual-slope analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs), and in [[function generator]]s to generate square and triangle waves for testing equipment. In general, relaxation oscillators are used at lower frequencies and have poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.\n\n[[Ring oscillator]]s are built of a ring of active delay stages.  Generally the ring has an odd number of inverting stages, so that there is no single stable state for the internal ring voltages. Instead, a single transition propagates endlessly around the ring.\n\nSome of the more common relaxation oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n*[[Multivibrator]]\n*[[Pearson\u2013Anson effect|Pearson\u2013Anson oscillator]]\n*[[Ring oscillator]]\n*[[Delay-line oscillator]]\n*[[Royer oscillator]]\n\n==Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)==\n{{Main|Voltage-controlled oscillator}}\nAn oscillator can be designed so that the oscillation frequency can be varied over some range by an input voltage or current. These [[voltage controlled oscillator]]s are widely used in [[phase-locked loop]]s, in which the oscillator's frequency can be locked to the frequency of another oscillator. These are ubiquitous in modern communications circuits, used in [[electronic filter|filters]], [[modulator]]s, [[demodulator]]s, and forming the basis of [[frequency synthesizer]] circuits which are used to tune radios and televisions.\n\nRadio frequency VCOs are usually made by adding a [[varactor]] diode to the [[tuned circuit]] or resonator in an oscillator circuit. Changing the DC voltage across the varactor changes its [[capacitance]], which changes the [[resonant frequency]] of the tuned circuit. Voltage controlled relaxation oscillators can be constructed by charging and discharging the energy storage capacitor with a voltage controlled [[current source]]. Increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.\n\n==History==\nThe first practical oscillators were based on [[electric arc]]s, which were used for lighting in the 19th century.

However, the [[triode]] vacuum tube oscillator performed poorly above 300&nbsp;MHz because of interelectrode capacitance.{{citation needed|reason=tune out capacitance; lighthouse tubes; transit time|date=April 2017}}  To reach higher frequencies, new \"transit time\" (velocity modulation) vacuum tubes were developed, in which electrons traveled in \"bunches\" through the tube.  The first of these was the [[Barkhausen\u2013Kurz tube|Barkhausen\u2013Kurz oscillator]] (1920), the first tube to produce power in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] range.  The most important and widely used were the [[klystron]] (R. and S. Varian, 1937) and the cavity [[magnetron]] (J. Randall and H. Boot, 1940).\n\nMathematical conditions for feedback oscillations, now called the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]], were derived by [[Heinrich Georg Barkhausen]] in 1921.  The first analysis of a nonlinear electronic oscillator model, the [[Van der Pol oscillator]], was done by [[Balthasar van der Pol]] in 1927.<ref name=\"Van der Pol\">{{cite journal\n | last = Van der Pol\n | first = Balthazar\n | title = On relaxation-oscillations\n | journal = The London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine\n | volume = 2\n | issue = 7\n | pages = 978\u2013992\n | year = 1927\n | issn = \n | doi = 10.1080/14786442608564127\n | id = \n }}</ref> He showed that the stability of the oscillations ([[limit cycle]]s) in actual oscillators was due to the [[linear circuit|nonlinearity]] of the amplifying device.
