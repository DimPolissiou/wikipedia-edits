Another three battalions served with the [[British Indian Army]] in [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India and Burma]]. The regiment took part in six major parachute assault operations in [[British airborne operations in North Africa|North Africa]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], [[Operation Tonga|France]], the [[Operation Market Garden|Netherlands]] and [[Operation Varsity|Germany]], often landing ahead of all other troops.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the regiment was reduced to three [[Standing army|regular army]] battalions first assigned to the [[16th Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Parachute Brigade]] and later the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Airborne Brigade]]. The reserve [[16th Airborne Division]] was formed using the regiment reserve battalions in the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. Defence cuts gradually reduced the TA formations to a parachute brigade and then a single reserve battalion. In the same time period, the regular army battalions have taken part in operations in [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Suez]], [[EOKA|Cyprus]], [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Borneo]], [[Aden Emergency|Aden]], [[Operation Banner|Northern Ireland]], the [[Falklands War|Falklands]], the [[Kosovo War]], the [[Balkans]], [[Operation Palliser|Sierra Leone]], [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], at times being reinforced by men from the reserve battalion.\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:British parachute troops Norwich 1941.jpg|thumb|British parachute troops on exercise in [[Norwich]] 23 June 1941.]]\nImpressed by the success of German airborne operations, during the [[Battle of France]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], directed the [[War Office]] to investigate the possibility of creating a [[corps]] of 5,000 parachute troops.<ref>Otway, p.21</ref> On 22 June 1940, [[No. 2 Commando]] was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November, re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing.<ref>Shott & McBride, p.4</ref><ref>Moreman, p.91</ref> It was these men who took part in the first British airborne operation, [[Operation Colossus]], on 10 February 1941.<ref name=guard218>Guard, p.218</ref> In September, the battalion was re-designated the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment|1st Parachute Battalion]] and assigned to the [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]].<ref name=guard218/> To fill out the brigade, the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2nd]], [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|3rd]] and [[4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment|4th Parachute Battalion]]s were raised by calling for volunteers from all units in the British Army.<ref name=guard218/>\n\nThe first operation by the Parachute Regiment was [[Operation Biting]] in February 1942.

The Paras are the only [[line infantry]] regiment of the British Army that has not been amalgamated with another unit since the end of the [[Second World War]].<ref name=modpara/>\n\nThe Parachute Regiment was formed on 22 June 1940 during the Second World War and eventually raised 17 battalions. In Europe, these battalions formed part of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]], the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] and the [[2nd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Independent Parachute Brigade Group]]. Another three battalions served with the [[British Indian Army]] in [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India and Burma]]. The regiment took part in six major parachute assault operations in [[British airborne operations in North Africa|North Africa]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], [[Operation Tonga|France]], the [[Operation Market Garden|Netherlands]] and [[Operation Varsity|Germany]], often landing ahead of all other troops.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the regiment was reduced to three [[Standing army|regular army]] battalions first assigned to the [[16th Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Parachute Brigade]] and later the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Airborne Brigade]]. The reserve [[16th Airborne Division]] was formed using the regiment reserve battalions in the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. Defence cuts gradually reduced the TA formations to a parachute brigade and then a single reserve battalion.

Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a [[Majority bonus system|superbonus]] of two thirds of seats in the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|House]] for the coalition which would obtain [[at-large]] the [[majority|absolute majority]] of votes. The change was strongly opposed by the opposition parties as well as DC's smaller coalition partners, who had no realistic chance of success under this system.

The government coalition won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Technically, the government won the election, winning a clear working [[majority]] of seats in both houses.

He also strengthen relations with West Germany, becoming a close friend of [[Konrad Adenauer]].<ref>[http://www.gianninispa.it/zzgiaspa1856/anteprima/633-5_Italia%20e%20mondo%20tedesco_anteprima.pdf Italia e mondo tedesco all'epoca di Adenauer]</ref> As premier, he also had to face the complicated [[Suez crisis]] of 1956, in which he staunchly defended Italy's economic interests in the area, always bearing in mind the need to safeguard Atlantic and European solidarity.<ref>[https://www.restorica.it/novecento/la-crisi-di-suez-e-la-fine-del-primato-delleuropa/ La crisi di Suez e la fine del primato dell\u2019Europa]</ref> \n\nDuring his premiership, he had often harsh contrasts with Amintore Fanfani. The secretary of the DC believed, in fact, that the government should have a more critical attitude towards the Anglo-French choices. Moreover, Soviet's brutal repression of [[Hungarian Revolution]], in 1956, further widened the distances between Segni and Fanfani. Segni was contrary to an [[anti-communist]] legislative intervention, as Fanfani asked. The clash between the two leaders was so bitter that Segni threatened to resign. He noted in his diary: \"The events of Hungary are unfortunately subjected to repressive political speculation. I refuse to speculate on them.\"<ref>''Diario (1956\u20131964)'', S. Mura, 2012, page 101)</ref>\n\nIn domestic policy, Segni's government was particularly active in judiciary policies. A law established the National Council of Economy and Labor as well as the Superior Council of the Judiciary. However, the most important event of all was the official opening of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/43204685 I primi due anni di funzionamento della Corte Costituzionale Italiana]</ref>\n\nIn 1957, a political tensions arose between President Gronchi and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[Gaetano Martino]], regarding government's foreign policy.

A law of 21 March 1959 extended insurance against occupational diseases to agricultural workers, while a law approved on 17 May 1959 introduced a special additional indemnity for retired civil servants.

However, he did not continue the important reforms started by his predecessor. He tried to implement the reform step by step, but encountered strong resistance, even in the ministries that were supposed to finance these measures.

Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a [[Majority bonus system|superbonus]] of two thirds of seats in the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|House]] for the coalition which would obtain [[at-large]] the [[majority|absolute majority]] of votes. The change was strongly opposed by the opposition parties as well as DC's smaller coalition partners, who had no realistic chance of success under this system. The new law was called the ''Scam Law'' by its detractors,<ref>Also its parliamentarian exam had a disruptive effect: \"Among the iron pots of political forces that faced in the Cold War, Senate cracked as earthenware pot\": {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= Come il Senato si scopr\u00ec vaso di coccio|journal= L'Ago e Il Filo |date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89210209}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial [[landslide]] to Christian Democracy.\n\nThe campaign of the opposition to the \"Scam Law\" achieved its goal. The government coalition won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Technically, the government won the election, winning a clear working [[majority]] of seats in both houses.

He also strengthen relations with West Germany, becoming a close friend of [[Konrad Adenauer]].<ref>[http://www.gianninispa.it/zzgiaspa1856/anteprima/633-5_Italia%20e%20mondo%20tedesco_anteprima.pdf Italia e mondo tedesco all'epoca di Adenauer]</ref> As premier, he also had to face the complicated [[Suez crisis]] of 1956, in which he staunchly defended Italy's economic interests in the area, always bearing in mind the need to safeguard Atlantic and European solidarity.<ref>[https://www.restorica.it/novecento/la-crisi-di-suez-e-la-fine-del-primato-delleuropa/ La crisi di Suez e la fine del primato dell\u2019Europa]</ref> \n\nDuring his premiership, he had often harsh contrasts with Amintore Fanfani. The secretary of the DC believed, in fact, that the government should have a more critical attitude towards the Anglo-French choices. Moreover, Soviet's brutal repression of [[Hungarian Revolution]], in 1956, further widened the distances between Segni and Fanfani. Segni was contrary to an [[anti-communist]] legislative intervention, as Fanfani asked. The clash between the two leaders was so bitter that Segni threatened to resign. He noted in his diary: \"The events of Hungary are unfortunately subjected to repressive political speculation. I refuse to speculate on them.\"<ref>''Diario (1956\u20131964)'', S. Mura, 2012, page 101)</ref>\n\nIn domestic policy, Segni's government was particularly active in judiciary policies. A law established the National Council of Economy and Labor as well as the Superior Council of the Judiciary. However, the most important event of all was the official opening of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/43204685 I primi due anni di funzionamento della Corte Costituzionale Italiana]</ref>\n\nIn 1957, a political tensions arose between President Gronchi and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[Gaetano Martino]], regarding government's foreign policy. In May 1957, the PSDI withdrew its support to the government and on 6 May, Segni resigned.<ref>[https://storia.camera.it/governi/i-governo-segni I Governo Segni], camera.it</ref> On 20 May, [[Adone Zoli]] sworn in as new head of government.<ref>[https://storia.camera.it/governi/i-governo-zoli Governo Zoli], camera.it</ref>\n\n===After the premiership===\n[[File:Antonio Segni and Konrad Adenauer by Giuseppe Moro, August 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Segni and German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] in August 1959]]\nIn July 1958, Zoli resigned, after having lost his majority in the Parliament, and Fanfani became Prime Minister again.

The most comforting signals, however, came from the economy: industry and commerce expanded, unemployment declined and Italy's [[GDP]] grew by over 6%, a rhythm that placed it among the most dynamic countries in the world.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/il-miracolo-economico-italiano_%28Il-Contributo-italiano-alla-storia-del-Pensiero:-Tecnica%29/ Il miracolo economico italiano], Enciclopedia Treccani</ref>\n\nIn social policy, various reforms in social welfare were carried out. A law of 21 March 1959 extended insurance against occupational diseases to agricultural workers, while a law approved on 17 May 1959 introduced a special additional indemnity for retired civil servants. Another important law of 4 July 1959 extended pension insurance to all artisans.<ref>Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora</ref>\n\n==President==\nSegni was elected President of the Italian Republic on 6 May 1962 (854 to 443 votes).<ref name=\":0\" /> He suffered a serious [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while working at the presidential palace on 7 August 1964. At the time he was 73 years old and the first prognosis was not positive. He only partially recovered, and he retired from office on 6 December 1964. In the interim, the President of the Senate [[Cesare Merzagora]] served as acting president.\n\nPolitically, Segni was a moderate conservative opposed to \"opening to the centre-left\" enabling coalition governments between the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) and the Christian Democrats. Segni was later accused of having tried to instigate a coup d'\u00e9tat (known as [[Piano Solo]]) along with General [[Giovanni De Lorenzo]] during his presidency to frustrate the opening to the left.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJOknreVQJsC&pg=RA1-PA207|title=Paranoia Within Reason: A Casebook on Conspiracy as Explanation|last=Marcus|first=George E.|date=1999-03-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226504575|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSegni was also a professor of law at University of Sassari.

In 1915 German meteorologist [[Alfred Wegener]] proposed the existence of a supercontinent called Pangaea.
