{"title_page": "Community of practice", "text_new": "{{Community}}\nA '''community of practice''' ('''CoP''') is a group of people who share a craft or a profession. The concept was first proposed by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist [[Etienne Wenger]] in their 1991 book ''Situated Learning'' {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book ''Communities of Practice'' {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}.\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) {{Harv|Dub\u00e9|Bourhis|Jacob|2005}} when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media (such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance) or a \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) {{Harv|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}} when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [[American pragmatism]], especially [[C. S. Peirce]]'s concept of the \"[[community of inquiry]]\" {{harv|Shields|2003}}, but also [[John Dewey]]'s principle of learning through occupation {{harv|Wallace|2007}}.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Origin and development===\nSince the publication of \"Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation\" {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}, communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See {{Harvtxt|Hildreth|Kimble|2004|}} for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. {{Harvtxt|Cox|2005}} offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.\n\n====Early years====\nTo understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the [[Institute for Research on Learning]], Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named [[situated learning]].\n\nThe structure of the community was created over time through a process of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991|p= 29}}.\n\nLave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term \"community of practice\" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\n====Later years====\nIn his later work, {{Harvtxt|Wenger|1998}} abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a [[Duality (CoPs)|duality]] instead.  He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to [[knowledge management]].\n\nHe describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: '[[mutual engagement]]', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' {{Harv|Wenger|1998|pp= 72\u201373}}.\n\n* Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement.  These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity.\n* Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise.  The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community.\n* Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.\n\n====Present work====\nFor [[Etienne Wenger]], [[learning]] is central to human [[identity (social science)|identity]]. A primary focus of Wenger's more recent work is on learning as social participation \u2013 the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}. In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities.\n\nThe structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice.\n\n; Domain\n:A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions.\n\n; Community\n:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning.  A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas.\n\n; Practice\n:While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.\n\nIn many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure {{Harv|McDermott|Archibald|2010}}. These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity {{Harv|Wenger|2004}}. Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the [[tacit knowledge]], or the know-how that is not so easily articulated.\n\nAn important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. {{Harvtxt|Lesser|Storck|2001|p=836}} identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: \n* Decreasing the learning curve of new employees\n* Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries\n* Reducing rework and preventing \"reinvention of the wheel\"\n* Spawning new ideas for products and services\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nLave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucat\u00e1n midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}} as well as insurance claims processors. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}. Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education {{Harv|Grossman|2001}}, sociolinguistics, material anthropology, [[medical education]], [[second language acquisition]] {{Harv|Kimble|Hildreth|Bourdon|2008}}, Parliamentary Budget Offices {{Harv|Chohan|2013}}, health care and business sectors,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Linda C |last2=Grimshaw |first2=Jeremy M |last3=Nielsen |first3=Camilla |last4=Judd |first4=Maria |last5=Coyte |first5=Peter C |last6=Graham |first6=Ian D |title=Use of communities of practice in business and health care sectors: A systematic review |journal=Implementation Science |date=17 May 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-27|pmid=19445723 |pmc=2694761 }}</ref> and child mental health practice ([[Adolescent Mentalization-Based Integrative Treatment|AMBIT]]).\n\nA famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field {{Harv|Brown|Duguid|2000}}. The Xerox reps began exchanging tips and tricks over informal meetings over breakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million.\n\n===Compared to functional or project teams===\nCollaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see {{Harvtxt|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}}.\n\nA [[project team]] differs from a community of practice in several significant ways {{harv|McDermott|1999}}. \n* A [[project team]] is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results.\n* A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task.\n* A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project.\n* A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished.\n\nBy contrast,\n* A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community.\n* Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise.\n* A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it.\n\n===Versus communities of interest===\nIn addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from [[community of interest]] (CoI).\n\n'''Community of interest'''\n* A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.\n* Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.\n* The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.\n* Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise \u2013 one only needs to be interested in the subject.\n\n'''Community of practice'''\n* A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.\n* CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.\n* The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.\n* Membership is dependent on expertise \u2013 one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.\n* Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoP's structure, non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\n===Social capital===\n[[Social capital]] is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991).<ref>Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press</ref> That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring [[social capital]] \u2013 especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.\n\n=== Knowledge management ===\n{{Harvtxt|Wasko|Faraj|2000}} describe three kinds of knowledge: \"knowledge as object\", \"knowledge embedded within individuals\", and \"knowledge embedded in a community\".<ref>Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). \"\"It is what one does\": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice\". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155\u2013173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7</ref> Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit \"expertise\", or [[tacit knowledge]]. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}, also {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.\n\nBecause [[knowledge management]] is seen \"primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining\" {{Harv|Thomas|Kellogg|Erickson|2001}}, the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, [[best practices]].\n\nThus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.\n\n== Factors ==\n\n===Individuals===\nMembers of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job {{Harv|Seely Brown|Duguid|1991}}.\n\nStudies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database) {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}. Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP.  Members of the community have [[tacit knowledge]], which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside.  For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve.  In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless {{Harv|Dalkir|2005}}. {{Harvtxt|Duguid|2005}} clarifies the difference between [[tacit knowledge]], or knowing ''how'', and [[explicit knowledge]], or knowing ''what''. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing ''what'' and knowing ''how'' {{Harv|Duguid|2005}}.\n\nAs members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}.\n\n====Social presence====\nCommunicating with others in a community of practice involves creating ''social presence''. {{harvtxt|Tu|2002}} defines social presence as \"the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship\" (p.&nbsp;38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) {{Harv|Tu|2002}}. Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints {{Harv|Wasko|Faraj|2000}}.\n\n====Motivation====\nMotivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}. Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction).\n\n====Collaboration====\nCollaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network {{Harv|Sveiby|Simon|2002}}. Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.\n\n== Cultivating successful CoPs ==\n{{see also|Motivations for online participation}}\n\nWhat makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice:\n\n# Design the community to evolve naturally \u2013 Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus.\n# Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives \u2013 While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals.\n# Welcome and allow different levels of participation \u2013 Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community.\n# Develop both public and private community spaces \u2013 While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs.\n# Focus on the value of the community \u2013 CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group.\n# Combine familiarity and excitement \u2013 CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic.\n# Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community \u2013 CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Adaptive management]]\n* [[Discourse community]]\n* [[Distributed leadership]]\n* [[Duality (CoPs)]]\n* [[Guild]]\n* [[Knowledge transfer]]\n* [[Knowledge tagging]]\n* [[Learning community]]\n* [[Learning organization]]\n* [[Network of practice]]\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Personal network]]\n* [[Professional learning community]]\n* [[Social environment]]\n* [[Situated cognition]]\n* [[Situated learning]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value network analysis]]\n* [[Virtual community of practice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1108/13673270310463626 | ref=harv\n | last1=Ardichvilli | first1=Alexander\n | last2=Page | first2=Vaughn\n | last3=Wentling | first3=Tim\n | year=2003\n | title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge sharing in communities of practice\n | journal=Journal of Knowledge Management\n | volume=7 | issue=1\n | pages=64\u201377\n| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d5387684ab24c90c684c364a08d24ec0ba9853\n }}\n*{{cite book | title=Language and symbolic power | url=https://archive.org/details/languagesymbolic0000bour_1991 | url-access=registration | publisher=Harvard University Press. | author=Bourdieu, P. | year=1991 | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}\n* {{cite journal | ref=harv\n | last1=Brown | first1=John Seely\n | last2=Duguid | first2=Paul\n | year=2000\n | title=Balancing act: How to capture knowledge without killing it\n | journal=Harvard Business Review\n | volume= | issue=\n | url=http://lymabe.edublogs.org/files/2007/04/balancing-act.doc\n}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0165551505057016 | ref=harv\n | last1=Cox| first1=Andrew\n | year=2005\n | title=What are communities of practice?

The concept was first proposed by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist [[Etienne Wenger]] in their 1991 book ''Situated Learning'' {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book ''Communities of Practice'' {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}.\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) {{Harv|Dub\u00e9|Bourhis|Jacob|2005}} when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards and newsgroups, or a \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) {{Harv|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}} when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [[American pragmatism]], especially [[C. S. Peirce]]'s concept of the \"[[community of inquiry]]\" {{harv|Shields|2003}}, but also [[John Dewey]]'s principle of learning through occupation {{harv|Wallace|2007}}.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Origin and development===\nSince the publication of \"Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation\" {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}, communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See {{Harvtxt|Hildreth|Kimble|2004|}} for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. {{Harvtxt|Cox|2005}} offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.\n\n====Early years====\nTo understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the [[Institute for Research on Learning]], Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}. Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named [[situated learning]].\n\nThe structure of the community was created over time through a process of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991|p= 29}}.\n\nLave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term \"community of practice\" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\n====Later years====\nIn his later work, {{Harvtxt|Wenger|1998}} abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a [[Duality (CoPs)|duality]] instead.  He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to [[knowledge management]].\n\nHe describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: '[[mutual engagement]]', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' {{Harv|Wenger|1998|pp= 72\u201373}}.\n\n* Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement.  These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity.\n* Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise.  The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community.\n* Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.\n\n====Present work====\nFor [[Etienne Wenger]], [[learning]] is central to human [[identity (social science)|identity]]. A primary focus of Wenger's more recent work is on learning as social participation \u2013 the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}. In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities.\n\nThe structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice.\n\n; Domain\n:A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions.\n\n; Community\n:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning.  A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas.\n\n; Practice\n:While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.\n\nIn many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure {{Harv|McDermott|Archibald|2010}}. These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity {{Harv|Wenger|2004}}. Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the [[tacit knowledge]], or the know-how that is not so easily articulated.\n\nAn important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. {{Harvtxt|Lesser|Storck|2001|p=836}} identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: \n* Decreasing the learning curve of new employees\n* Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries\n* Reducing rework and preventing \"reinvention of the wheel\"\n* Spawning new ideas for products and services\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}}.\n\nLave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucat\u00e1n midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters {{Harv|Lave|Wenger|1991}} as well as insurance claims processors. {{Harv|Wenger|1998}}. Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education {{Harv|Grossman|2001}}, sociolinguistics, material anthropology, [[medical education]], [[second language acquisition]] {{Harv|Kimble|Hildreth|Bourdon|2008}}, Parliamentary Budget Offices {{Harv|Chohan|2013}}, health care and business sectors,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Linda C |last2=Grimshaw |first2=Jeremy M |last3=Nielsen |first3=Camilla |last4=Judd |first4=Maria |last5=Coyte |first5=Peter C |last6=Graham |first6=Ian D |title=Use of communities of practice in business and health care sectors: A systematic review |journal=Implementation Science |date=17 May 2009 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-27|pmid=19445723 |pmc=2694761 }}</ref> and child mental health practice ([[Adolescent Mentalization-Based Integrative Treatment|AMBIT]]).\n\nA famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field {{Harv|Brown|Duguid|2000}}. The Xerox reps began exchanging tips and tricks over informal meetings over breakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million.\n\n===Compared to functional or project teams===\nCollaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see {{Harvtxt|Kietzmann|Plangger|Eaton|Heilgenberg|2013}}.\n\nA [[project team]] differs from a community of practice in several significant ways {{harv|McDermott|1999}}. \n* A [[project team]] is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results.\n* A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task.\n* A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project.\n* A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished.\n\nBy contrast,\n* A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community.\n* Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise.\n* A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it.\n\n===Versus communities of interest===\nIn addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from [[community of interest]] (CoI).\n\n'''Community of interest'''\n* A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them.\n* Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed.\n* The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic.\n* Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise \u2013 one only needs to be interested in the subject.\n\n'''Community of practice'''\n* A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners.\n* CoP participation is not appropriate for non-practitioners.\n* The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other.\n* Membership is dependent on expertise \u2013 one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.\n* Example: Someone who is interested in photography and has some background/training in it finds an online CoP for working photojournalists, who use it to discuss various aspects of their work. Since this community is focused on working photojournalists, it would not be appropriate for an amateur photographer to contribute to the CoP discussions there. Depending on the CoP's structure, non-CoP members may have access to reading the discussions and accessing other materials of the community.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\n===Social capital===\n[[Social capital]] is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991).<ref>Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press</ref> That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring [[social capital]] \u2013 especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.\n\n=== Knowledge management ===\n{{Harvtxt|Wasko|Faraj|2000}} describe three kinds of knowledge: \"knowledge as object\", \"knowledge embedded within individuals\", and \"knowledge embedded in a community\".<ref>Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). \"\"It is what one does\": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice\". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155\u2013173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7</ref> Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit \"expertise\", or [[tacit knowledge]]. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}, also {{Harv|Hildreth|Kimble|2002}}.\n\nBecause [[knowledge management]] is seen \"primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining\" {{Harv|Thomas|Kellogg|Erickson|2001}}, the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, [[best practices]].\n\nThus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.\n\n== Factors ==\n\n===Individuals===\nMembers of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job {{Harv|Seely Brown|Duguid|1991}}.\n\nStudies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database) {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|2000}}. Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP.  Members of the community have [[tacit knowledge]], which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside.  For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve.  In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless {{Harv|Dalkir|2005}}. {{Harvtxt|Duguid|2005}} clarifies the difference between [[tacit knowledge]], or knowing ''how'', and [[explicit knowledge]], or knowing ''what''. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing ''what'' and knowing ''how'' {{Harv|Duguid|2005}}.\n\nAs members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}.\n\n====Social presence====\nCommunicating with others in a community of practice involves creating ''social presence''. {{harvtxt|Tu|2002}} defines social presence as \"the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship\" (p.&nbsp;38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) {{Harv|Tu|2002}}. Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints {{Harv|Wasko|Faraj|2000}}.\n\n====Motivation====\nMotivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest {{Harv|Ardichvilli|Page|Wentling|2003}}. Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction).\n\n====Collaboration====\nCollaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network {{Harv|Sveiby|Simon|2002}}. Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.\n\n== Cultivating successful CoPs ==\n{{see also|Motivations for online participation}}\n\nWhat makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice:\n\n# Design the community to evolve naturally \u2013 Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus.\n# Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives \u2013 While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals.\n# Welcome and allow different levels of participation \u2013 Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community.\n# Develop both public and private community spaces \u2013 While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs.\n# Focus on the value of the community \u2013 CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group.\n# Combine familiarity and excitement \u2013 CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic.\n# Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community \u2013 CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity {{Harv|Wenger|McDermott|Snyder|2002}}.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Adaptive management]]\n* [[Discourse community]]\n* [[Distributed leadership]]\n* [[Duality (CoPs)]]\n* [[Guild]]\n* [[Knowledge transfer]]\n* [[Knowledge tagging]]\n* [[Learning community]]\n* [[Learning organization]]\n* [[Network of practice]]\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Personal network]]\n* [[Professional learning community]]\n* [[Social environment]]\n* [[Situated cognition]]\n* [[Situated learning]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value network analysis]]\n* [[Virtual community of practice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1108/13673270310463626 | ref=harv\n | last1=Ardichvilli | first1=Alexander\n | last2=Page | first2=Vaughn\n | last3=Wentling | first3=Tim\n | year=2003\n | title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge sharing in communities of practice\n | journal=Journal of Knowledge Management\n | volume=7 | issue=1\n | pages=64\u201377\n| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04d5387684ab24c90c684c364a08d24ec0ba9853\n }}\n*{{cite book | title=Language and symbolic power | url=https://archive.org/details/languagesymbolic0000bour_1991 | url-access=registration | publisher=Harvard University Press. | author=Bourdieu, P. | year=1991 | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}\n* {{cite journal | ref=harv\n | last1=Brown | first1=John Seely\n | last2=Duguid | first2=Paul\n | year=2000\n | title=Balancing act: How to capture knowledge without killing it\n | journal=Harvard Business Review\n | volume= | issue=\n | url=http://lymabe.edublogs.org/files/2007/04/balancing-act.doc\n}}\n* {{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0165551505057016 | ref=harv\n | last1=Cox| first1=Andrew\n | year=2005\n | title=What are communities of practice?

He is currently signed to [[Pro Wrestling Zero1]], where he works as '''Sugi''' (stylized in all capital letters). He has used many aliases, most commonly '''Yoshitsune''' and '''Sugi'''. He is mainly known for his high-flying abilities.\n\n==Career==\n===Toryumon (2002\u20132004)===\nImmediately after graduating in the 11th Toryumon school class term, Sugi debuted in 2003 in [[Toryumon (\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n)|Toryumon Mexico]], shortly after moving to the [[Toryumon (\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n)|Toryumon X]] brand. He went under the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of '''{{Nihongo|Mini Cima|\u30df\u30cbCIMA|Mini Cima}}''', a lighter version of the popular Toryumon wrestler [[Nobuhiko Oshima|Cima]], who was a part of the Mini Crazy Max [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] along with [[Kagetora|Suwacito]] and [[Masaki Okimoto|Small Dandy Fuji]]. Aligning themselves as [[Tweener (professional wrestling)|tweeners]], they got into a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[BabyFace (professional wrestling)|babyface]] faction Sailor Boys ([[Taiji Ishimori]], [[Brahman Brothers|Kei Sato and Shu Sato]]), having several matches against them, sometimes accompanied by senior members of the actual Crazy Max.\n\nIn December 2003, Mini Cima and his team competed in the ''Young Dragons Cup 2003'' scramble match, but they were unable to win, being [[Takeshi Minamino]] the eventual tournament winner. They would be more successful at the ''Yamaha Cup 2004''tag team tournament, with Mini Cima and Suwacito defeating [[Manabu Murakami (wrestler)|Manabu Murakami]] and [[Naoki Tanizaki]] in the first round and the Sailor Boys in the second to crown themselves as winners. On September 9, 2003 the group competed in an elimination match for the [[UWA World Welterweight Championship]], eliminating the team of Los Carros Ex\u00f3ticos (Gallardo, Lambo Miura and Murcielago) before falling short to Los Salseros Japoneses (Minamino, [[Kenichi Sakai|Pineapple Hanai]] and [[Takayasu Fukuda|Mango Fukuda]]). This was the Toryumon X final event, with the promotion folding shortly after. Mini Crazy Max had its last reunion in the special event Dragon Fire The Final Challenge on October 14, where they competed in another special challenge match.\n\n===Hustle (2004\u20132006)===\nIn September 2004, still based on Toryumon, Sugi and his partners started wrestling for the [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|Hustle]] promotion. They appeared as the Hustle Kamen Rangers, a ''[[Power Rangers]]''-inspired [[super sentai]] stable which was a special division of the Hustle Army led by top babyface [[Naoya Ogawa]]. Sugi himself played '''{{Nihongo|Hustle Kamen Red|\u30cf\u30c3\u30b9\u30eb\u4eee\u9762\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Hassuru Kamen Reddo}}''' (a role formerly played by [[Masaki Okimoto]]), teaming up with [[Masaki Okimoto|Hustle Kamen Blue]] and [[Takayasu Fukuda|Hustle Kamen Yellow]] as a power trio. They competed in the undercard of events against villainous characters from the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] Takada Monster Army commanded by [[Nobuhiko Takada|Generalissimo Takada]]; their usual opponents were [[Brahman Brothers|Devil Pierroth I & Devil Pierroth II]], whom they defeated in many occasions.\n\nIn the event Hustle House Vol.10, held on October 27, 2005, Hustle Kamen Rangers were defeated by [[Brahman Brothers|Demon Spider Blue, Demon Spider Yellow]] and [[Taiji Ishimori|Riser Glen]], being the latter in storyline a character come from the TV [[tokusatsu]] series ''Phantom Star God Justirisers'', only brainwashed to serve the Monster Army. In order to counter him, Hustle Kamen Rangers introduced another character from said series, [[Kota Ibushi|Liosazer]], who helped them to defeat the heel stable at the Hustlemania 2005 event and turn Riser again to good. The rangers would still competing for Hustle, being later opposed by an [[itako]] wrestler named Kyou Itako.\n\nOn February 10, 2006, the Monster Army introduced a cadre of [[Evil twin|evil clones]] of the Hustle Kamen Rangers, called the Monster Kamen Rangers. They consistently defeated Sugi and his team, forcing them to introduce a new member, [[Kota Ibushi|Hustle Kamen Orange]], in order to get the first win against the villains. The win was short-lived, however, as the Monster Kamen Rangers defeated them again, and this time kidnapped Hustle Kamen Yellow in order to [[brainwash]] him. Now with Yellow as an enemy, Red and new member Hustle Kamen Green attempted to reason with him, but they were beaten when Yellow pinned Red. The storyline continued until Hustlemania 2006, where they finally managed to bring Yellow back and defeat the Monster Kamen Rangers for good. The team then announced they would travel to the stars in order to defend the peace and justice beyond Hustle, ceasing their apparitions from the promotion.\n\n===Michinoku Pro Wrestling (2004\u20132009)===\nSugi started wrestling for [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]] in October 2004. He debuted during the ''Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament 2004'' under the gimmick of '''{{Nihongo|Michinoku Ranger Gold|MICHINOKU \u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u91d1|Michinoku Renj\u0101 Kin}}''', a super sentai character similar to the one he played in Hustle. Teaming up with [[Masaki Okimoto|Michinoku Ranger Silver]], Sugi got important victories over [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] and [[Shinjitsu Nohashi]] and Los Salseros Japoneses, but they did not win the league. They kept their gimmicks until December, when Sugi adopted the gimmick of '''{{Nihongo|Shanao|\u906e\u90a3\u738b|Shanao}}''', a masked [[Buddhist monk|monk]] inspired on the historical [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]]. Shanao would come to the ring carrying a [[katana]] and saying prayers, and drew popularity among the audience for his high-risk, aerial style of wrestling.\n[[File:FUKUMEN-MANIA2018022048.jpg|thumb|240px|SUGI in 2019.]]\nIn 2005, Shanao joined forces with the Sailor Boys (now composed solely by Kei and Shu Sato) to participate in the ''Michinoku Trios League'', being unsuccessful. The final night of the tournament, in which they had been eliminated by points, Shanao teamed up with his master, [[Yoshihiro Asai|The Tiger II]], to defeat [[Fumiyuki Hashimoto|Kagetora]] and [[Shinjitsu Nohashi]]. The alliance with the Sailor Boys lasted until mid-year, when Shanao formed a tag team with [[Masaki Okimoto|Rasse]]. He also had a brief tenure in the ''Tetsujin Tournament'', but he was forced to forfeit most of his matches due to an injury. Shanao returned on September 10 in a losing effort to Takeshi Minamino, but he got his revenge the same night, defeating Minamino and Los Salseros Japoneses along with Kagetora, [[Kazuya Yuasa|Gaina]] and [[Hayato Fujita]].\n\nKagetora and he eventually kept their alliance and participated in the ''Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament 2005'', winning the league after beating Los Salseros Japoneses again, but Kagetora suddenly turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and attacked Shanao, going to form the villainous stable Stoned. Now back with Rasse, Shanao and he had a shot for the [[Tohoku Tag Team Championship]] held by [[The Great Sasuke]] and [[Dick Togo]], but despite their effort, they were beaten. Days after, Shanao announced he was going to perform a [[genpuku]] ceremony in order to advance in his career, which was officiated by [[Jinsei Shinzaki]]. Shanao then changed his name to '''{{Nihongo|Yoshitsune|\u7fa9\u7d4c|Yoshitsune}}''', openly showing his identity, and changed his outfit to a [[samurai]]-like attire in purple, red and golden. Yoshitsune had his first match teaming up with Shinzaki, who came dressed as [[Sait\u014d Musashib\u014d Benkei]], defeating Rasse and Garuda with his new Shura finishing maneuver.\n\nThe next year, Yoshitsune's fame allowed him a title match for the [[Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Taka Michinoku]], falling short in his challenge. Nonetheless, Yoshitsune allied with The Great Sasuke and the now babyface Los Salseros Japoneses to wage war against Stoned, exchanging wins with them. He performed a new title pursuit by taking part in a tournament for the Tohoku Tag Team Championship with [[Tsutomu Oosugi|Rei]] as his partner, losing to [[Makoto Oishi]] and [[Shiori Asahi]]; Yoshitsune took part in the 2006 edition of the ''Tetsujin Tournament'', but he had to relinquish it again due to an injury. Upon his recovering, Yoshitsune recruited Rasse to compete in the ''Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament 2006'', but success seemed to be away from him that year, as they were eliminated at the finals by Kei and Shu Sato.\n\nIn 2007, Yoshitsune qualified for the ''Fukumen World League'' by defeating [[Kenichi Sakai|Ken45\u00ba]] and Shinjitsu Nohashi in respective matches. During the tournament, he eliminated [[Tatsuhito Senga|Shibaten]] first and legendary [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] member [[Jyushin Thunder Liger]] second, but he eventually fell to Mexican representative [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] thanks to an intervention by Atlantis's cornerman Ol\u00edmpico. Ended the league, Yoshitsune returned to his alliance with the home army and joined The Great Sasuke for the ''Futaritabi Tag Team League''; although Sasuke and him eliminated the team of Rasse and Kagetora, an injury to Sasuke obliged them to exit the tournament and allow their opponents to advance round. Stardom finally came to Yoshitsune on November, however, when defeated [[Osaka Pro Wrestling]] representative Gaina in a match for the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship. Yoshitsune then would open 2008 becoming a double champion, when Sasuke returned from his injury and joined him to defeat Rasse and Kagetora for the title.\n\nSugi retained his titles for most of 2008, beating challengers like Rasse, Takeshi Minamino, Shinji Nohashi and [[Tigers Mask]], as well as the team of [[Mens Teioh]] and [[Shinobu Sugawara|Shinobu]]. However, he would get in a new feud when [[Hayato Fujita]] turned heel and formed the faction Kowloon with the remnants of Stoned. After months of warfare, Hayato challenged Sugi to a match for the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight title, and he won the bout and the championship in an upset. Only months after, Sasuke and Yoshitsune faced Kei and Shu Sato from Kowloon in a match to unify their tag team titles with the [[UWA World Tag Team Championship]], but they were defeated and lost the belts. Concluded his reigns, Yoshitsune announced his departure from Michinoku Pro and had his last match in March 2009.\n\n===Dragondoor and El Dorado Wrestling (2005\u20132007)===\nAlong with most of his Toryumon class, Sugi joined the Dragondoor promotion in July 2005. He was introduced in a [[Vignette (professional wrestling)|vignette]] by top babyface Taiji Ishimori, who described him as a close ally carrying the genes of [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]]. As such, Sugi appeared as '''{{Nihongo|Little Dragon|\u30ea\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Ritoru Doragon}}''', a character wearing a mask and suit patterned after Drag\u00f3n, very much like the wrestler [[Dragon Kid]] from rival promotion [[Dragon Gate (wrestling)|Dragon Gate]]. In his first match, Little Dragon teamed up with Ishimori and the rest of his allies, [[Kota Ibushi]] and [[Tsutomu Oosugi|Milanito Collection a.t.]], in a losing effort against the popular stable Aagan Iisou ([[Shuji Kondo]], [[Yasushi Tsujimoto|Yasshi]] and [[Takuya Sugawara]]). His next and last high level match in the short-lived promotion would be at the final event, fighting with Ishimori against Stoned ([[Brahman Brothers|Kei Sato and Shu Sato]]), being defeated after an intervention by [[KAGETORA (wrestler)|Kagetora]] and [[Manabu Murakami (wrestler)|Maguro Ooma]]. Dragondoor closed shortly after.\n\nWhen the promotion was reopened as El Dorado Wrestling in April 2006, Sugi returned with the rest of wrestlers. This time he took the gimmick of '''{{Nihongo|El Blazer|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Eru Bureiz\u0101}}''', a mysterious, [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]-like character in a gold and blue armored outfit. Blazer formed a tag team with Milanito Collection a.t. and took part in the very first match of the promotion, getting a victory over Kei and Shu Sato. They later avenged their defeats to Aagan Iisou by beating them with Kota Ibushi's aid, and also took another victory before Stoned in a [[Global Professional Wrestling Alliance]] event along with [[Jumping Kid Okimoto]]. In December 2006, the trio split up to compete in the ''Treasure Hunters Tag Tournament 2006'', with Ibushi teaming up with [[Milano Collection A.T.]] while Blazer stayed in Milanito's side; Sugi and his ally were defeated, and Milano and Kota advanced round before being eliminated by Dick Togo and Shuji Kondo at the finals. Milanito and Blazer, however, won the reserve bout of the tournament, defeating the Sato brothers through an intervention of a now unaligned Kagetora. In Sugi's last match in the promotion, he teamed up with Milano and Milanito to defeat a Stoned cell aided by [[Harashima]]. Blazer then announced he went freelance, and put an official end to his team with Milanito, leaving El Dorado.\n\n===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2006\u20132008)===\nOn August 20, 2006, Sugi made his first apparition in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] playing the character of '''Ahii''', the result of a cooperation between [[Sanrio|Sanrio Company Ltd.]] and AJPW. He was introduced by [[Keiji Mutoh]], and revealed himself as a strange character wearing a demonic-looking orange and black full body suit which represented the Mexican [[Habanero]] chili pepper. He made his first in-ring work the same night, entering after the main event to save Mutoh, [[Masanobu Fuchi]] and [[Kaz Hayashi]] from an attack by the [[Voodoo Murders]], and his official debut one day later, defeating VM member [[Fumiyuki Hashimoto|Voodoo Mask]]. Ahii remained as an ally to Mutoh and his babyface wrestlers against Voodoo Murders until November, when he got his own opponents in the form of [[Takayasu Fukuda|Mastodon]] and [[Takeshi Minamino|Tow Van John]], two personal enemies of his. Their enmity would be resolved on February 17, 2007, when Ahii defeated them both in a handicap match with the aid of his storyline brother, a green version of Ahii (played by [[Masaki Okimoto]]).\n\nSugi returned to AJPW on February 15, 2008 for a special event copromoted with [[Playboy]]. He played the one night gimmick of '''{{Nihongo|Rabbit Boy|\u30e9\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4|Rabitto B\u014di}}''', a character wearing a [[rabbit]] mask and a black playboy jacket. In his only apparition, Rabbit Boy defeated [[Masaki Okimoto|Giant Jet]].\n\nOn December 23, Sugi made his last apparition for AJPW for another one night character, this time as part of AJPW's usual copromotions with [[A Bathing Ape]]. Sugi portrayed '''Super Milo''', a [[monkey]] [[superhero]] wearing in green and yellow, and teamed up with [[Mitsunobu Kikuzawa|Teriyaki Boy]] to defeat Ebessan III and [[Kuishinbo Kamen]] in a comedy match.\n\n===Independent circuit (2006\u20132009)===\n[[File:FUKUMEN-MANIA2018022152.jpg|thumb|240px|SUGI along with Mr. Cacao (center) and El Hornet (right) in 2019.]]\nHe also appeared as Yoshitsune in some shows of Big Mouth LOUD and several others Japanese independent promotions, including the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] LOCK UP sub-brand.\n\nSugi continued using the El Blazer gimmick as his main freelancing character. El Blazer then turned to a comedic character prone to mysteriously faint at his entrance, and had an appearance in [[Dramatic Dream Team]]'s brand ''Cruiser's Game'' wrestling against [[Kyohei Mikami|Mikami]] after ([[kayfabe]]) having been smoking [[marijuana]].\n\nSoon after becoming a freelancer, Sugi continued appearing randomly in several Japanese promotions as El Blazer, including [[Inoki Genome Federation|IGF]].\n\nStarting from June 3, 2007, Sugi appears in [[Kensuke Office]] as '''Namazu Man''' (\u306a\u307e\u305a\u30de\u30f3, \"Catfish Man\"). Shortly after, Namazu Man started to be played by another wrestler.\n\nAnother gimmick he used in 2007 is '''UWAI # 32''', a robot character only used in UWAI Station.\n\nOn December 29, 2008, Sugi appeared in an Akiba Pro Wrestling event as '''El Fuerte''' (\u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c6), a character inspired from the [[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]] video game saga.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1221018_1124.html | script-title=ja:\u30bd\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u304c\u7121\u7dda\u3067\u6307\u793a\uff01\uff1f \u30a2\u30ad\u30d0\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9\u7b2c2\u5f3e\u201c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ea\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u6e7e\u5cb8\u6709\u660e\u5371\u6a5f\u4e00\u9aea\uff01\u201d\u304c\u958b\u50ac | date=2008-12-29 | accessdate=2016-10-04 |work=Famitsu.com | language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n===Pro Wrestling Zero1 (2007\u20132009)===\nSugi started wrestling for [[Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max]] in May 2007 under his El Blazer character. After an unsuccessful battle royal match for the [[AWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]], which was won by [[Dick Togo]], Blazer aligned himself under [[Masato Tanaka]]'s Sword Army, getting in battles against [[Takao Omori]]'s Axe Army. He got a shot at the [[ZERO1-MAX International Junior Heavyweight Championship]] held by Dragon Gate wrestler [[Masaaki Mochizuki]], but he was unsuccessful. Mochizuki offered him to team up and invited him to his promotion.\n\nFor most of his tenure in the company, however, Sugi ditched his Blazer identity and played a new character, '''The\u2606ZEST''', sponsored by the homonymous Japanese [[pachinko]] company. The gimmick had been played before by the wrestler Kamikaze, and would be played again by him later. On July 24, Zest won the WWA Junior Lightweight Championship by beating Osamu Namiguchi, and retained him until April 6, when Sugi relinquished both the character and the title and adopted yet a new gimmick, '''Noiz''', sponsored by rock band [[UchuSentai:Noiz]]. Now as Noiz, Sugi defeated Kamikaze as Zest and won again the championship. NOIZ also inherited Blazer's loyalty to Masato Tanaka, wrestling for him occasionally, and retained the title before Osamu Namiguchi before vacating him upon his departure from Zero1.\n\n===Dragon Gate (2008)===\nBlazer originally debuted in Dragon Gate on March 2008 as a Zero1 representative, but he was in storyline recognized by [[Kenichiro Arai]] as a Toryumon graduate. Blazer's first match was a special tag team with [[Ben Satterly|Pac]] against Tozawa-juku (Arai and [[Taku Iwasa]]), but he also aided New Hazard ([[BxB Hulk]] and [[Shinobu Sugawara|Shinobu]]) in the Mochizuki Buyuden events and Typhoon ([[Anthony W. Mori]] and [[Cima (wrestler)|Cima]]) against the [[Muscle Outlaw'z]]. In April, Blazer took part in a tournament for the [[Open the Brave Gate Championship]], eliminating Genki Horiguchi but being eliminated himself by [[Gamma (wrestler)|Gamma]] following outside interference. After his unsuccessful feud with Muscle Outlaw'z, Blazer concluded his tenure in Dragon Gate forming an alliance with fellow outsiders [[Takeshi Minamino]] and [[Shinjitsu Nohashi]], defeating [[Hayato Fujita]], [[Munenori Sawa]] and Yuta Yoshikawa in Mochizuki Buyuden and WORLD-1 ([[Kzy|mcKZ]] & [[Naoki Tanizaki]]) & Super Shenlong in Dragon Gate NEX.\n\n===Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2008)===\nSugi made his [[United States|America]]n debut (as El Blazer) for [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] on May 17, 2008. Replacing [[Kota Ibushi]], he teamed with Kagetora on PWG's second annual ''DDT4'' tournament, defeating [[Scott Lost]] and [[Joey Ryan (wrestler)|Joey Ryan]] in the first round, but losing to the [[PWG World Tag Team Championship|PWG World Tag Team Champions]] [[Kevin Steen and El Generico]] in a title match in the next.\n\n===Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (2009\u20132012)===\nSugi signed up with [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide]] in 2009 and made his return to M\u00e9xico, now under a modified, black and red version of his Yoshitsune outfit and the name of '''Sugi San''' (his last name followed by the [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific -san]]). He was introduced by [[Kenzo Suzuki]] as a part of his [[heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]] stable La Yakuza, thus turning Sugi heel for the first time in his career. The faction, which also included [[El Oriental]], amassed a number of tag team wins until a match in [[Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo (2009)|Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo]], where they fell to [[The Psycho Circus]]. On August 30, Sugi competed individually in a [[Steel Cage Match]] where the last wrestler would be fired; Sugi escaped safely, but he got injured upon doing a theatrical backflip from the cage to the floor.\n[[File:Sugi.jpg|thumb|250px|Sugi in an AAA event.]]\nA month later, with La Yakuza dissolved and now unaligned, Sugi competed in a Five Way Ladder Match for the [[AAA World Cruiserweight Championship]] along with [[Extreme Tiger]], [[Jack Evans (wrestler)|Jack Evans]], [[Rocky Romero]] and [[Teddy Hart]], but he would be (kayfabe) injured by a piledriver by Hart and had to be stretchered out while Tiger won the title. After his return from the injury, Sugi took part in the ''Torneo Alas de Oro 2009'', leaving in second place along with [[Billy Boy]]. On October 9, Suzuki gathered La Yakuza again with [[Go Shiozaki]] replacing El Oriental to face Los Wagner Maniacos ([[Dr. Wagner Jr.]], [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]] & [[\u00daltimo Gladiador]]), but they were defeated. Afterwards, Sugi announced his return to Japan, leaving AAA.\n\nAfter a year of hiatus, Sugi would compete in [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] as an AAA representative, now under the name of '''Sugi''' (in all caps), getting in a feud with [[Tatsuhito Senga|Ronin]] and [[Taiji Ishimori]]. He returned to M\u00e9xico along with Ronin, having touring matches against him, and finally coming back to TV as an unofficial member of [[Aero Star]]'s stable [[Real Fuerza Aerea]]. On June 28, Sugi and Ronin were sent to [[Paris, France]] in order to represent [[puroresu]] in the [[Japan Expo|Japan Expo 12th Impact]], returning to M\u00e9xico on July 5.\n\nOn July 9, 2012, Sugi held a press conference to announce his involvement in a conspiracy that had gotten [[Kazushige Nosawa]] and [[Io Shirai]] arrested for marijuana possession and smuggling. According to Sugi, Masahiro Hayashi, who worked as a liaison between AAA and Japan and had a personal grudge with Nosawa, promised him a contract extension with AAA in exchange for him planting the drugs on the couple.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.com/sugi-san-confiesa-complot-en-contra-de-nosawa/ | title = Sugi San confiesa complot en contra de Nosawa. | author=Dark Angelita | date=2012-07-10 | accessdate=2012-07-10 | publisher=[[Super Luchas]] Magazine | language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Michinoku Pro Wrestling (2016)===\nFollowing the drug smuggling scandal, Sugi remained inactive for more than four years, with the exception of a single match held on November 18, 2015, when he faced [[Takeshi Minamino]] in an event held at [[Shinjuku Face]] to celebrate the 10th anniversary since his debut.\nAfter this long hiatus, Sugi returned to the ring for a charity event held on August 28, 2016, in support of the population hit by the [[2016 Kumamoto earthquakes|2016 Kumamoto earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://lineblog.me/mentaikid/archives/9986865.html | script-title=ja:\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\uff01 | date=2016-08-29 | accessdate=2016-10-06 |work=Mentai Kid Blog | language=Japanese}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, on September 16, he competed in a Michinoku Pro event for the first time in seven years, entering the 2016 Fukumen World League.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://battle-news.com/?p=23839 | script-title=ja:\u30ab\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30b3\uff08\u521d\u4ee3\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30b3\uff09\u304c\u307f\u3061\u306e\u304f\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u51f1\u65cb\uff014\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u4e0d\u7965\u4e8b\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u4f11\u6b62\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305fSugi\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01 | date=2016-09-17 | accessdate=2016-09-17 |work=Battle News | language=Japanese}}</ref> He defeated Leprechaun and Eisa8, but was eliminated by [[Car\u00edstico]] at the semi-finals.\n\n===Return to Zero1 (2017\u2013present)===\nAfter a few appearances in Pro Wrestling Land's End in 2017, Sugi returned to [[Pro Wrestling Zero1]] in August. He challenged unsuccessfully [[Kotaro Suzuki]] for the [[International Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|International Junior Heavyweight]] and [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]]s, after which he declared he would challenge [[Ikuto Hidaka]] and [[Takuya Sugawara]] for the [[NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship]] with an unknown partner, which would revealed to be [[Psycho (wrestler)|Psycho]]. Sugi and him defeated Hidaka and Sugawara in a non-title match, but failed at taking the titles. Sugi replaced Psycho by Sean Guinness for the ''Furinkazan Tag Tournament 2017'', only to be eliminated in the first round by Hidaka and Sugawara again. He spent the next weeks teaming with several wrestlers against his old enemy faction [[Voodoo Murders]], until he announced [[Masamune (wrestler)|Masamune]] as his next tag team partner in his quest for the tag titles. On January 1, 2018, Sugi officially joined Zero1,<ref name=Zero1010118/> and the same day, he and Masamune won the NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship from Sugawara and Hidaka.<ref name=Zero1010118/>\n[[File:FUKUMEN-MANIA2018022147.jpg|thumb|250px|SUGI at the Fukumen Mania 2019.]]\nTheir reign ended in June, when Sugi and Masamune lost the titles to the new team of Ikuto Hidaka and Fuminori Abe. The same month, Sugi joined [[Kohei Sato]] and challenged [[Masato Tanaka]] and [[Yuji Hino]] for the [[NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship]], but they were defeated. He followed with a significantly successful tenure in the ''Fire Festival 2018'', scoring wins over Hino, [[Shinjiro Otani]] and [[Hiroshi Yamato]], though victory escaped his grasp again. In November, Sugi would prove better in the short ''Tenka-Ichi Junior Tournament 2018'' for the vacated [[International Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|International Junior Heavyweight Championship]] and [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]], winning the tournament and the titles after beating [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]], Asuka and [[Hayata (wrestler)|Hayata]]. Now as a champion, he resumed his team Kohei Sato to compete in the ''Furinkazan Tag Tournament 2018'', where they also won by defeating Chris Vice and [[Shogun Okamoto]] at the finals.\n\nSugi invested early 2019 in further championship pursuings. He retained his singles titles against Ikuto Hidaka, Shoki Kitamura and [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]]. However, tag team titles remained away from him, with two failed challenges for the NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championships and NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championships teaming up with [[Madoka (wrestler)|Hagane Shinnou]] and usual partner Sato respectively. In July, he participated in the ''Fire Festival 2019'', where he gained victories over Yuya Aoki, Asuka and [[Yuji Sakuragi|Super Tiger II]], but he was unable to win the tournament after a double countout with [[Yuji Hino]]. He looked to improve his odds in the ''Tenka-Ichi Junior Tournament 2019'', reaching the finals over Raicho and Sean Guiness, but being shockingly eliminated by Hub. This streak continued in the ''Furinkazan Tag Tournament 2019'', where Sugi and [[Dragon Gate (wrestling)|Dragon Gate]] representative [[Kenichiro Arai]] were defeated by [[Shuji Kondo]] and Takuya Sugawara in a match of former [[Toryumon (\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n)|Toryumon]] wrestlers.\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n*'''[[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]]'''\n:*[[Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship]] ([[Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship#Title history|1 time]])\n:*[[Tohoku Tag Team Championship]] ([[Tohoku Tag Team Championship#Title history|1 time]]) \u2013 with [[Great Sasuke]]\n:*Fukumen World League Qualifying Tournament (2007)\n:*Futaritabi Tag Team League (2005) \u2013 with [[Fumiyuki Hashimoto|Kagetora]]\n:*M-12 Battle Royal (2006) <small>with Kagetora</small>\n\n*'''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'''\n:*PWI ranked him #'''355''' of the 500 best singles wrestlers in the [[Pro Wrestling Illustrated|PWI 500]] in 2007\n\n*'''[[Pro Wrestling Zero1]]'''\n**[[International Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|International Junior Heavyweight Championship]] ([[International Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|1 time]])\n**[[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]] ([[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|1 time]])\n:*[[NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship]] ([[NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship|1 time]]) \u2013 with [[Masamune (wrestler)|Masamune]]<ref name=Zero1010118>{{cite web | url = https://www.z-1.co.jp/topics/detail_625.html | script-title=ja:\u5c0f\u5e61\u304c\u4e16\u754c\u30d8\u30d3\u30fc\u3001\u5ca1\u672c\uff06\u5409\u6c5f\u306f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u2015\u30b3\u30f3\u30c1\u7372\u5f97\u3001Sugi\u306f\u5165\u56e3\uff06\u653f\u5b97\u3068\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bf\u30c3\u30b0\u596a\u53d6\u3001\u30d6\u30fc\u30c9\u30a5\u306b\u6731\u5d07\u82b1\u52a0\u5165\u20261\u30fb1\u5f8c\u697d\u5712\u30ea\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff01 | date=2018-01-01 | accessdate=2018-01-01 | work=[[Pro Wrestling Zero1]] | language=Japanese}}</ref>\n:*[[WWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship|WWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship ''(Disputed Branch)'']] ([[WWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship#Title history|2 times]])\n:*Tenka-Ichi Junior Tournament (2018)\n:*[[Furinkazan (wrestling)|Furinkazan]] ([[Furinkazan (wrestling)#2018|2018]]) \u2013 with [[Kohei Sato]]\n\n*'''[[Toryumon (\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n)|Toryumon X]]'''\n:*Yamaha Cup Tag Tournament (2004) \u2013 with [[Fumiyuki Hashimoto|SUWAcito]]\n\n*'''Valerie Office'''\n:*Copa El Jefe (2012) \u2013 with Argos\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Takuya Sugi}}\n*[http://luchalibreaaa.com/sugi-san.php AAA profile]\n*[http://www.myspace.com/el_blazer Takuya Sugi Myspace Fan Blog (English)]\n*[http://ameblo.jp/elblazer/ El Blazer official Blog (Japanese)]\n*[http://yoshitune.jugem.jp/ Yoshitsune official blog (Japanese)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061215012855/http://dgusa.puroresufan.com/doradodata.html El Dorado Roster Page at DGUSA (English)]\n*[http://www.puroresucentral.com/yoshitsune.html Yoshitsune profile at Puroresu Central (English)]\n*[http://www.michipro.net/ Michinoku Pro Wrestling official website (Japanese)]\n*[http://blog.livedoor.jp/dragon_door/archives/cat_50009189.html El Blazer El Dorado Blog (Japanese), no longer active]\n*[http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/yumemaboroshi_nob_naga/ El Blazer official YAHOO Blog (Japanese), no longer active]\n{{Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sugi, Takuya}}\n[[Category:1983 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Japanese male professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:People from Shizuoka (city)]]\n[[Category:Masked wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Shizuoka Prefecture]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Japanese professional wrestler}}\n{{Infobox professional wrestler\n|name= Takuya Sugi\n|image= Sugi -

He is currently signed to [[Pro Wrestling Zero1]], where he works as '''Sugi''' (stylized in all capital letters). He has used many aliases, most commonly '''Yoshitsune''' and '''Sugi'''. He is mainly known for his high-flying abilities.\n\n==Career==\n===Toryumon (2002\u20132004)===\nImmediately after graduating in the 11th Toryumon school class term, Sugi debuted in 2003 in [[Toryumon (\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n)|Toryumon Mexico]], shortly after moving to the [[Toryumon (\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n)|Toryumon X]] brand. He went under the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of '''{{Nihongo|Mini Cima|\u30df\u30cbCIMA|Mini Cima}}''', a lighter version of the popular Toryumon wrestler [[Nobuhiko Oshima|Cima]], who was a part of the Mini Crazy Max [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] along with [[Kagetora|Suwacito]] and [[Masaki Okimoto|Small Dandy Fuji]]. Aligning themselves as [[Tweener (professional wrestling)|tweeners]], they got into a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[BabyFace (professional wrestling)|babyface]] faction Sailor Boys ([[Taiji Ishimori]], [[Brahman Brothers|Kei Sato and Shu Sato]]), having several matches against them, sometimes accompanied by senior members of the actual Crazy Max.\n\nIn December 2003, Mini Cima and his team competed in the ''Young Dragons Cup 2003'' scramble match, but they were unable to win, being [[Takeshi Minamino]] the eventual tournament winner. They would be more successful at the ''Yamaha Cup 2004''tag team tournament, with Mini Cima and Suwacito defeating [[Manabu Murakami (wrestler)|Manabu Murakami]] and [[Naoki Tanizaki]] in the first round and the Sailor Boys in the second to crown themselves as winners. On September 9, 2003 the group competed in an elimination match for the [[UWA World Welterweight Championship]], eliminating the team of Los Carros Ex\u00f3ticos (Gallardo, Lambo Miura and Murcielago) before falling short to Los Salseros Japoneses (Minamino, [[Kenichi Sakai|Pineapple Hanai]] and [[Takayasu Fukuda|Mango Fukuda]]). This was the Toryumon X final event, with the promotion folding shortly after. Mini Crazy Max had its last reunion in the special event Dragon Fire The Final Challenge on October 14, where they competed in another special challenge match.\n\n===Hustle (2004\u20132006)===\nIn September 2004, still based on Toryumon, Sugi and his partners started wrestling for the [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|Hustle]] promotion. They appeared as the Hustle Kamen Rangers, a ''[[Power Rangers]]''-inspired [[super sentai]] stable which was a special division of the Hustle Army led by top babyface [[Naoya Ogawa]]. Sugi himself played '''{{Nihongo|Hustle Kamen Red|\u30cf\u30c3\u30b9\u30eb\u4eee\u9762\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Hassuru Kamen Reddo}}''' (a role formerly played by [[Masaki Okimoto]]), teaming up with [[Masaki Okimoto|Hustle Kamen Blue]] and [[Takayasu Fukuda|Hustle Kamen Yellow]] as a power trio. They competed in the undercard of events against villainous characters from the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] Takada Monster Army commanded by [[Nobuhiko Takada|Generalissimo Takada]]; their usual opponents were [[Brahman Brothers|Devil Pierroth I & Devil Pierroth II]], whom they defeated in many occasions.\n\nIn the event Hustle House Vol.10, held on October 27, 2005, Hustle Kamen Rangers were defeated by [[Brahman Brothers|Demon Spider Blue, Demon Spider Yellow]] and [[Taiji Ishimori|Riser Glen]], being the latter in storyline a character come from the TV [[tokusatsu]] series ''Phantom Star God Justirisers'', only brainwashed to serve the Monster Army. In order to counter him, Hustle Kamen Rangers introduced another character from said series, [[Kota Ibushi|Liosazer]], who helped them to defeat the heel stable at the Hustlemania 2005 event and turn Riser again to good. The rangers would still competing for Hustle, being later opposed by an [[itako]] wrestler named Kyou Itako.\n\nOn February 10, 2006, the Monster Army introduced a cadre of [[Evil twin|evil clones]] of the Hustle Kamen Rangers, called the Monster Kamen Rangers. They consistently defeated Sugi and his team, forcing them to introduce a new member, [[Kota Ibushi|Hustle Kamen Orange]], in order to get the first win against the villains. The win was short-lived, however, as the Monster Kamen Rangers defeated them again, and this time kidnapped Hustle Kamen Yellow in order to [[brainwash]] him. Now with Yellow as an enemy, Red and new member Hustle Kamen Green attempted to reason with him, but they were beaten when Yellow pinned Red. The storyline continued until Hustlemania 2006, where they finally managed to bring Yellow back and defeat the Monster Kamen Rangers for good. The team then announced they would travel to the stars in order to defend the peace and justice beyond Hustle, ceasing their apparitions from the promotion.\n\n===Michinoku Pro Wrestling (2004\u20132009)===\nSugi started wrestling for [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]] in October 2004. He debuted during the ''Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament 2004'' under the gimmick of '''{{Nihongo|Michinoku Ranger Gold|MICHINOKU \u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u91d1|Michinoku Renj\u0101 Kin}}''', a super sentai character similar to the one he played in Hustle. Teaming up with [[Masaki Okimoto|Michinoku Ranger Silver]], Sugi got important victories over [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] and [[Shinjitsu Nohashi]] and Los Salseros Japoneses, but they did not win the league. They kept their gimmicks until December, when Sugi adopted the gimmick of '''{{Nihongo|Shanao|\u906e\u90a3\u738b|Shanao}}''', a masked [[Buddhist monk|monk]] inspired on the historical [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]]. Shanao would come to the ring carrying a [[katana]] and saying prayers, and drew popularity among the audience for his high-risk, aerial style of wrestling.\n[[File:FUKUMEN-MANIA2018022048.jpg|thumb|240px|SUGI in 2019.]]\nIn 2005, Shanao joined forces with the Sailor Boys (now composed solely by Kei and Shu Sato) to participate in the ''Michinoku Trios League'', being unsuccessful. The final night of the tournament, in which they had been eliminated by points, Shanao teamed up with his master, [[Yoshihiro Asai|The Tiger II]], to defeat [[Fumiyuki Hashimoto|Kagetora]] and [[Shinjitsu Nohashi]]. The alliance with the Sailor Boys lasted until mid-year, when Shanao formed a tag team with [[Masaki Okimoto|Rasse]]. He also had a brief tenure in the ''Tetsujin Tournament'', but he was forced to forfeit most of his matches due to an injury. Shanao returned on September 10 in a losing effort to Takeshi Minamino, but he got his revenge the same night, defeating Minamino and Los Salseros Japoneses along with Kagetora, [[Kazuya Yuasa|Gaina]] and [[Hayato Fujita]].\n\nKagetora and he eventually kept their alliance and participated in the ''Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament 2005'', winning the league after beating Los Salseros Japoneses again, but Kagetora suddenly turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and attacked Shanao, going to form the villainous stable Stoned. Now back with Rasse, Shanao and he had a shot for the [[Tohoku Tag Team Championship]] held by [[The Great Sasuke]] and [[Dick Togo]], but despite their effort, they were beaten. Days after, Shanao announced he was going to perform a [[genpuku]] ceremony in order to advance in his career, which was officiated by [[Jinsei Shinzaki]]. Shanao then changed his name to '''{{Nihongo|Yoshitsune|\u7fa9\u7d4c|Yoshitsune}}''', openly showing his identity, and changed his outfit to a [[samurai]]-like attire in purple, red and golden. Yoshitsune had his first match teaming up with Shinzaki, who came dressed as [[Sait\u014d Musashib\u014d Benkei]], defeating Rasse and Garuda with his new Shura finishing maneuver.\n\nThe next year, Yoshitsune's fame allowed him a title match for the [[Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Taka Michinoku]], falling short in his challenge. Nonetheless, Yoshitsune allied with The Great Sasuke and the now babyface Los Salseros Japoneses to wage war against Stoned, exchanging wins with them. He performed a new title pursuit by taking part in a tournament for the Tohoku Tag Team Championship with [[Tsutomu Oosugi|Rei]] as his partner, losing to [[Makoto Oishi]] and [[Shiori Asahi]]; Yoshitsune took part in the 2006 edition of the ''Tetsujin Tournament'', but he had to relinquish it again due to an injury. Upon his recovering, Yoshitsune recruited Rasse to compete in the ''Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament 2006'', but success seemed to be away from him that year, as they were eliminated at the finals by Kei and Shu Sato.\n\nIn 2007, Yoshitsune qualified for the ''Fukumen World League'' by defeating [[Kenichi Sakai|Ken45\u00ba]] and Shinjitsu Nohashi in respective matches. During the tournament, he eliminated [[Tatsuhito Senga|Shibaten]] first and legendary [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] member [[Jyushin Thunder Liger]] second, but he eventually fell to Mexican representative [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] thanks to an intervention by Atlantis's cornerman Ol\u00edmpico. Ended the league, Yoshitsune returned to his alliance with the home army and joined The Great Sasuke for the ''Futaritabi Tag Team League''; although Sasuke and him eliminated the team of Rasse and Kagetora, an injury to Sasuke obliged them to exit the tournament and allow their opponents to advance round. Stardom finally came to Yoshitsune on November, however, when defeated [[Osaka Pro Wrestling]] representative Gaina in a match for the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship. Yoshitsune then would open 2008 becoming a double champion, when Sasuke returned from his injury and joined him to defeat Rasse and Kagetora for the title.\n\nSugi retained his titles for most of 2008, beating challengers like Rasse, Takeshi Minamino, Shinji Nohashi and [[Tigers Mask]], as well as the team of [[Mens Teioh]] and [[Shinobu Sugawara|Shinobu]]. However, he would get in a new feud when [[Hayato Fujita]] turned heel and formed the faction Kowloon with the remnants of Stoned. After months of warfare, Hayato challenged Sugi to a match for the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight title, and he won the bout and the championship in an upset. Only months after, Sasuke and Yoshitsune faced Kei and Shu Sato from Kowloon in a match to unify their tag team titles with the [[UWA World Tag Team Championship]], but they were defeated and lost the belts. Concluded his reigns, Yoshitsune announced his departure from Michinoku Pro and had his last match in March 2009.\n\n===Dragondoor and El Dorado Wrestling (2005\u20132007)===\nAlong with most of his Toryumon class, Sugi joined the Dragondoor promotion in July 2005. He was introduced in a [[Vignette (professional wrestling)|vignette]] by top babyface Taiji Ishimori, who described him as a close ally carrying the genes of [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]]. As such, Sugi appeared as '''{{Nihongo|Little Dragon|\u30ea\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Ritoru Doragon}}''', a character wearing a mask and suit patterned after Drag\u00f3n, very much like the wrestler [[Dragon Kid]] from rival promotion [[Dragon Gate (wrestling)|Dragon Gate]]. In his first match, Little Dragon teamed up with Ishimori and the rest of his allies, [[Kota Ibushi]] and [[Tsutomu Oosugi|Milanito Collection a.t.]], in a losing effort against the popular stable Aagan Iisou ([[Shuji Kondo]], [[Yasushi Tsujimoto|Yasshi]] and [[Takuya Sugawara]]). His next and last high level match in the short-lived promotion would be at the final event, fighting with Ishimori against Stoned ([[Brahman Brothers|Kei Sato and Shu Sato]]), being defeated after an intervention by [[KAGETORA (wrestler)|Kagetora]] and [[Manabu Murakami (wrestler)|Maguro Ooma]]. Dragondoor closed shortly after.\n\nWhen the promotion was reopened as El Dorado Wrestling in April 2006, Sugi returned with the rest of wrestlers. This time he took the gimmick of '''{{Nihongo|El Blazer|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Eru Bureiz\u0101}}''', a mysterious, [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]-like character in a gold and blue armored outfit. Blazer formed a tag team with Milanito Collection a.t. and took part in the very first match of the promotion, getting a victory over Kei and Shu Sato. They later avenged their defeats to Aagan Iisou by beating them with Kota Ibushi's aid, and also took another victory before Stoned in a [[Global Professional Wrestling Alliance]] event along with [[Jumping Kid Okimoto]]. In December 2006, the trio split up to compete in the ''Treasure Hunters Tag Tournament 2006'', with Ibushi teaming up with [[Milano Collection A.T.]] while Blazer stayed in Milanito's side; Sugi and his ally were defeated, and Milano and Kota advanced round before being eliminated by Dick Togo and Shuji Kondo at the finals. Milanito and Blazer, however, won the reserve bout of the tournament, defeating the Sato brothers through an intervention of a now unaligned Kagetora. In Sugi's last match in the promotion, he teamed up with Milano and Milanito to defeat a Stoned cell aided by [[Harashima]]. Blazer then announced he went freelance, and put an official end to his team with Milanito, leaving El Dorado.\n\n===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2006\u20132008)===\nOn August 20, 2006, Sugi made his first apparition in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] playing the character of '''Ahii''', the result of a cooperation between [[Sanrio|Sanrio Company Ltd.]] and AJPW. He was introduced by [[Keiji Mutoh]], and revealed himself as a strange character wearing a demonic-looking orange and black full body suit which represented the Mexican [[Habanero]] chili pepper. He made his first in-ring work the same night, entering after the main event to save Mutoh, [[Masanobu Fuchi]] and [[Kaz Hayashi]] from an attack by the [[Voodoo Murders]], and his official debut one day later, defeating VM member [[Fumiyuki Hashimoto|Voodoo Mask]]. Ahii remained as an ally to Mutoh and his babyface wrestlers against Voodoo Murders until November, when he got his own opponents in the form of [[Takayasu Fukuda|Mastodon]] and [[Takeshi Minamino|Tow Van John]], two personal enemies of his. Their enmity would be resolved on February 17, 2007, when Ahii defeated them both in a handicap match with the aid of his storyline brother, a green version of Ahii (played by [[Masaki Okimoto]]).\n\nSugi returned to AJPW on February 15, 2008 for a special event copromoted with [[Playboy]]. He played the one night gimmick of '''{{Nihongo|Rabbit Boy|\u30e9\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4|Rabitto B\u014di}}''', a character wearing a [[rabbit]] mask and a black playboy jacket. In his only apparition, Rabbit Boy defeated [[Masaki Okimoto|Giant Jet]].\n\nOn December 23, Sugi made his last apparition for AJPW for another one night character, this time as part of AJPW's usual copromotions with [[A Bathing Ape]]. Sugi portrayed '''Super Milo''', a [[monkey]] [[superhero]] wearing in green and yellow, and teamed up with [[Mitsunobu Kikuzawa|Teriyaki Boy]] to defeat Ebessan III and [[Kuishinbo Kamen]] in a comedy match.\n\n===Independent circuit (2006\u20132009)===\n[[File:FUKUMEN-MANIA2018022152.jpg|thumb|240px|SUGI along with Mr. Cacao (center) and El Hornet (right) in 2019.]]\nHe also appeared as Yoshitsune in some shows of Big Mouth LOUD and several others Japanese independent promotions, including the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] LOCK UP sub-brand.\n\nSugi continued using the El Blazer gimmick as his main freelancing character. El Blazer then turned to a comedic character prone to mysteriously faint at his entrance, and had an appearance in [[Dramatic Dream Team]]'s brand ''Cruiser's Game'' wrestling against [[Kyohei Mikami|Mikami]] after ([[kayfabe]]) having been smoking [[marijuana]].\n\nSoon after becoming a freelancer, Sugi continued appearing randomly in several Japanese promotions as El Blazer, including [[Inoki Genome Federation|IGF]].\n\nStarting from June 3, 2007, Sugi appears in [[Kensuke Office]] as '''Namazu Man''' (\u306a\u307e\u305a\u30de\u30f3, \"Catfish Man\"). Shortly after, Namazu Man started to be played by another wrestler.\n\nAnother gimmick he used in 2007 is '''UWAI # 32''', a robot character only used in UWAI Station.\n\nOn December 29, 2008, Sugi appeared in an Akiba Pro Wrestling event as '''El Fuerte''' (\u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c6), a character inspired from the [[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]] video game saga.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1221018_1124.html | script-title=ja:\u30bd\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u304c\u7121\u7dda\u3067\u6307\u793a\uff01\uff1f \u30a2\u30ad\u30d0\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9\u7b2c2\u5f3e\u201c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ea\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u6e7e\u5cb8\u6709\u660e\u5371\u6a5f\u4e00\u9aea\uff01\u201d\u304c\u958b\u50ac | date=2008-12-29 | accessdate=2016-10-04 |work=Famitsu.com | language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n===Pro Wrestling Zero1 (2007\u20132009)===\nSugi started wrestling for [[Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max]] in May 2007 under his El Blazer character. After an unsuccessful battle royal match for the [[AWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]], which was won by [[Dick Togo]], Blazer aligned himself under [[Masato Tanaka]]'s Sword Army, getting in battles against [[Takao Omori]]'s Axe Army. He got a shot at the [[ZERO1-MAX International Junior Heavyweight Championship]] held by Dragon Gate wrestler [[Masaaki Mochizuki]], but he was unsuccessful. Mochizuki offered him to team up and invited him to his promotion.\n\nFor most of his tenure in the company, however, Sugi ditched his Blazer identity and played a new character, '''The\u2606ZEST''', sponsored by the homonymous Japanese [[pachinko]] company. The gimmick had been played before by the wrestler Kamikaze, and would be played again by him later. On July 24, Zest won the WWA Junior Lightweight Championship by beating Osamu Namiguchi, and retained him until April 6, when Sugi relinquished both the character and the title and adopted yet a new gimmick, '''Noiz''', sponsored by rock band [[UchuSentai:Noiz]]. Now as Noiz, Sugi defeated Kamikaze as Zest and won again the championship. NOIZ also inherited Blazer's loyalty to Masato Tanaka, wrestling for him occasionally, and retained the title before Osamu Namiguchi before vacating him upon his departure from Zero1.\n\n===Dragon Gate (2008)===\nBlazer originally debuted in Dragon Gate on March 2008 as a Zero1 representative, but he was in storyline recognized by [[Kenichiro Arai]] as a Toryumon graduate. Blazer's first match was a special tag team with [[Ben Satterly|Pac]] against Tozawa-juku (Arai and [[Taku Iwasa]]), but he also aided New Hazard ([[BxB Hulk]] and [[Shinobu Sugawara|Shinobu]]) in the Mochizuki Buyuden events and Typhoon ([[Anthony W. Mori]] and [[Cima (wrestler)|Cima]]) against the [[Muscle Outlaw'z]]. In April, Blazer took part in a tournament for the [[Open the Brave Gate Championship]], eliminating Genki Horiguchi but being eliminated himself by [[Gamma (wrestler)|Gamma]] following outside interference. After his unsuccessful feud with Muscle Outlaw'z, Blazer concluded his tenure in Dragon Gate forming an alliance with fellow outsiders [[Takeshi Minamino]] and [[Shinjitsu Nohashi]], defeating [[Hayato Fujita]], [[Munenori Sawa]] and Yuta Yoshikawa in Mochizuki Buyuden and WORLD-1 ([[Kzy|mcKZ]] & [[Naoki Tanizaki]]) & Super Shenlong in Dragon Gate NEX.\n\n===Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2008)===\nSugi made his [[United States|America]]n debut (as El Blazer) for [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] on May 17, 2008. Replacing [[Kota Ibushi]], he teamed with Kagetora on PWG's second annual ''DDT4'' tournament, defeating [[Scott Lost]] and [[Joey Ryan (wrestler)|Joey Ryan]] in the first round, but losing to the [[PWG World Tag Team Championship|PWG World Tag Team Champions]] [[Kevin Steen and El Generico]] in a title match in the next.\n\n===Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (2009\u20132012)===\nSugi signed up with [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide]] in 2009 and made his return to M\u00e9xico, now under a modified, black and red version of his Yoshitsune outfit and the name of '''Sugi San''' (his last name followed by the [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific -san]]). He was introduced by [[Kenzo Suzuki]] as a part of his [[heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]] stable La Yakuza, thus turning Sugi heel for the first time in his career. The faction, which also included [[El Oriental]], amassed a number of tag team wins until a match in [[Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo (2009)|Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo]], where they fell to [[The Psycho Circus]]. On August 30, Sugi competed individually in a [[Steel Cage Match]] where the last wrestler would be fired; Sugi escaped safely, but he got injured upon doing a theatrical backflip from the cage to the floor.\n[[File:Sugi.jpg|thumb|250px|Sugi in an AAA event.]]\nA month later, with La Yakuza dissolved and now unaligned, Sugi competed in a Five Way Ladder Match for the [[AAA World Cruiserweight Championship]] along with [[Extreme Tiger]], [[Jack Evans (wrestler)|Jack Evans]], [[Rocky Romero]] and [[Teddy Hart]], but he would be (kayfabe) injured by a piledriver by Hart and had to be stretchered out while Tiger won the title. After his return from the injury, Sugi took part in the ''Torneo Alas de Oro 2009'', leaving in second place along with [[Billy Boy]]. On October 9, Suzuki gathered La Yakuza again with [[Go Shiozaki]] replacing El Oriental to face Los Wagner Maniacos ([[Dr. Wagner Jr.]], [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]] & [[\u00daltimo Gladiador]]), but they were defeated. Afterwards, Sugi announced his return to Japan, leaving AAA.\n\nAfter a year of hiatus, Sugi would compete in [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] as an AAA representative, now under the name of '''Sugi''' (in all caps), getting in a feud with [[Tatsuhito Senga|Ronin]] and [[Taiji Ishimori]]. He returned to M\u00e9xico along with Ronin, having touring matches against him, and finally coming back to TV as an unofficial member of [[Aero Star]]'s stable [[Real Fuerza Aerea]]. On June 28, Sugi and Ronin were sent to [[Paris, France]] in order to represent [[puroresu]] in the [[Japan Expo|Japan Expo 12th Impact]], returning to M\u00e9xico on July 5.\n\nOn July 9, 2012, Sugi held a press conference to announce his involvement in a conspiracy that had gotten [[Kazushige Nosawa]] and [[Io Shirai]] arrested for marijuana possession and smuggling. According to Sugi, Masahiro Hayashi, who worked as a liaison between AAA and Japan and had a personal grudge with Nosawa, promised him a contract extension with AAA in exchange for him planting the drugs on the couple.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.com/sugi-san-confiesa-complot-en-contra-de-nosawa/ | title = Sugi San confiesa complot en contra de Nosawa. | author=Dark Angelita | date=2012-07-10 | accessdate=2012-07-10 | publisher=[[Super Luchas]] Magazine | language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Michinoku Pro Wrestling (2016)===\nFollowing the drug smuggling scandal, Sugi remained inactive for more than four years, with the exception of a single match held on November 18, 2015, when he faced [[Takeshi Minamino]] in an event held at [[Shinjuku Face]] to celebrate the 10th anniversary since his debut.\nAfter this long hiatus, Sugi returned to the ring for a charity event held on August 28, 2016, in support of the population hit by the [[2016 Kumamoto earthquakes|2016 Kumamoto earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://lineblog.me/mentaikid/archives/9986865.html | script-title=ja:\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\uff01 | date=2016-08-29 | accessdate=2016-10-06 |work=Mentai Kid Blog | language=Japanese}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, on September 16, he competed in a Michinoku Pro event for the first time in seven years, entering the 2016 Fukumen World League.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://battle-news.com/?p=23839 | script-title=ja:\u30ab\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30b3\uff08\u521d\u4ee3\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30b3\uff09\u304c\u307f\u3061\u306e\u304f\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u51f1\u65cb\uff014\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u4e0d\u7965\u4e8b\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u4f11\u6b62\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305fSugi\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01 | date=2016-09-17 | accessdate=2016-09-17 |work=Battle News | language=Japanese}}</ref> He defeated Leprechaun and Eisa8, but was eliminated by [[Car\u00edstico]] at the semi-finals.\n\n===Return to Zero1 (2017\u2013present)===\nAfter a few appearances in Pro Wrestling Land's End in 2017, Sugi returned to [[Pro Wrestling Zero1]] in August. He challenged unsuccessfully [[Kotaro Suzuki]] for the [[International Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|International Junior Heavyweight]] and [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]]s, after which he declared he would challenge [[Ikuto Hidaka]] and [[Takuya Sugawara]] for the [[NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship]] with an unknown partner, which would revealed to be [[Psycho (wrestler)|Psycho]]. Sugi and him defeated Hidaka and Sugawara in a non-title match, but failed at taking the titles. Sugi replaced Psycho by Sean Guinness for the ''Furinkazan Tag Tournament 2017'', only to be eliminated in the first round by Hidaka and Sugawara again. He spent the next weeks teaming with several wrestlers against his old enemy faction [[Voodoo Murders]], until he announced [[Masamune (wrestler)|Masamune]] as his next tag team partner in his quest for the tag titles. On January 1, 2018, Sugi officially joined Zero1,<ref name=Zero1010118/> and the same day, he and Masamune won the NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship from Sugawara and Hidaka.<ref name=Zero1010118/>\n[[File:FUKUMEN-MANIA2018022147.jpg|thumb|250px|SUGI at the Fukumen Mania 2019.]]\nTheir reign ended in June, when Sugi and Masamune lost the titles to the new team of Ikuto Hidaka and Fuminori Abe. The same month, Sugi joined [[Kohei Sato]] and challenged [[Masato Tanaka]] and [[Yuji Hino]] for the [[NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship]], but they were defeated. He followed with a significantly successful tenure in the ''Fire Festival 2018'', scoring wins over Hino, [[Shinjiro Otani]] and [[Hiroshi Yamato]], though victory escaped his grasp again. In November, Sugi would prove better in the short ''Tenka-Ichi Junior Tournament 2018'' for the vacated [[International Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|International Junior Heavyweight Championship]] and [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (Zero1)|NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]], winning the tournament and the titles after beating [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]], Asuka and [[Hayata (wrestler)|Hayata]]. Now as a champion, he resumed his team Kohei Sato to compete in the ''Furinkazan Tag Tournament 2018'', where they also won by defeating Chris Vice and [[Shogun Okamoto]] at the finals.\n\nSugi invested early 2019 in further championship pursuings. He retained his singles titles against Ikuto Hidaka, Shoki Kitamura and [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]]. However, tag team titles remained away from him, with two failed challenges for the NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championships and NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championships teaming up with [[Madoka (wrestler)|Hagane Shinnou]] and usual partner Sato respectively.

Marx invented and narrated a story for Eleanor based on an antihero called Hans R\u00f6ckle. Eleanor reports that this was one of her favourite childhood stories. The story is significant because it offered Eleanor lessons through allegory of Marx's critique of political economy which he was writing in ''Das Kapital''.<ref>Holmes, Rachel.

During her work in the SDF, she met [[Edward Aveling]], with whom she would spend the rest of her life despite his faithlessness, thievery from the movement, and mental cruelty.<ref>Feuer, Lewis S., \"Marxian Tragedies: A Death in the Family,\" Encounter magazine, November 1962, at 23-32.</ref> \n\n====Socialist League====\nIn 1885, after some bitter polemics, there was a split in the organization. Eleanor Marx and some others left SDF, and founded the rival [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]]. \n\nThe split had two root causes: personality problems, as Hyndman was accused of leading the SDF in a dictatorial fashion,<ref name=SE/> and disagreements on the issue of internationalism. In this point Hyndman was accused by Marx among others of nationalist tendencies. He was, for example, opposed to Marx's idea of sending delegates to the [[French Workers' Party]] calling the proposal a \"family manoeuvre\", since Eleanor Marx's sister [[Laura Marx|Laura]] and her husband [[Paul Lafargue]] were members of that party. Therefore, both Marx and Aveling became founding members of the Socialist League, whose most prominent member was [[William Morris]].<ref name=Brodie/>\n\nOther leaders of the Socialist League were [[Ernest Belfort Bax]], [[Sam Mainwaring]], and [[Tom Mann]], the latter two being representatives of the working class. [[Annie Besant]] was also an active member.\n\nMarx wrote a regular column called \"Record of the Revolutionary International Movement\" for the Socialist League's monthly newspaper, ''[[Commonweal (United Kingdom)|Commonweal]].''<ref>[[Yvonne Kapp]], ''Eleanor Marx: Volume 2.'' New York: Pantheon Books, 1976; pg. 66.</ref>\n\nIn 1884, Marx met [[Clementina Black]], a painter and trade unionist, and became involved in the [[Women's Trade Union League (UK)|Women's Trade Union League]]. She would go on to support numerous strikes including the [[Bryant & May strike]] of 1888 and the [[London Dock Strike of 1889]]. She spoke to the Silvertown strikers at an open meeting in November 1889 alongside her friends [[Edith Ellis]] and [[Honor Brooke]].

Marx and Aveling, as firm advocates of the principle of participation in political campaigns, found themselves in an uncomfortable minority in the party.

This resolution was voted down by a substantial margin, as was another put forward by the same branch in support of contesting seats in both local and parliamentary elections. Moreover, the Socialist League at this occasion suspended the 80 members of the Bloomsbury branch on the grounds that the group had put up candidates jointly with the SDF, against the policy of the party.

Two years later, the play was revised and renamed ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' by [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]].

Eleanor Marx and some others left SDF, and founded the rival [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]]. \n\nThe split had two root causes: personality problems, as Hyndman was accused of leading the SDF in a dictatorial fashion,<ref name=SE/> and disagreements on the issue of internationalism. In this point Hyndman was accused by Marx among others of nationalist tendencies. He was, for example, opposed to Marx's idea of sending delegates to the [[French Workers' Party]] calling the proposal a \"family manoeuvre\", since Eleanor Marx's sister [[Laura Marx|Laura]] and her husband [[Paul Lafargue]] were members of that party. Therefore, both Marx and Aveling became founding members of the Socialist League, whose most prominent member was [[William Morris]].<ref name=Brodie/>\n\nOther leaders of the Socialist League were [[Ernest Belfort Bax]], [[Sam Mainwaring]], and [[Tom Mann]], the latter two being representatives of the working class.

She would go on to support numerous strikes including the [[Bryant & May strike]] of 1888 and the [[London Dock Strike of 1889]]. She spoke to the Silvertown strikers at an open meeting in November 1889 alongside her friends [[Edith Ellis]] and [[Honor Brooke]]. She helped organise the [[National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers|Gasworkers' Union]] and wrote numerous books and articles.<ref name=SE/>\n\nIn 1885, she helped organise the International Socialist Congress in Paris.<ref name=SE/> The following year, she toured the United States along with Aveling and the German socialist [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], raising money for the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].<ref name=EoM/>\n\nBy the late 1880s, the Socialist League was deeply divided between those advocating political action and its opponents \u2013 who were themselves split between those like William Morris who felt that parliamentary campaigns represented inevitable compromises and corruptions, and an [[anarchism|anarchist]] wing which opposed all electoral politics as a matter of principle.

The Bloomsbury branch thus exited the Socialist League for a new, albeit brief, independent existence as the [[Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].<ref>Kapp, ''Eleanor Marx: Volume 2,'' pp. 264\u2013265.</ref>\n\n====Bloody Sunday (London)====\nAlong with many other leading Socialists, Eleanor took active role in organizing the London demonstration of 13 November 1887 that resulted in the suppression of the [[Bloody Sunday (1887)]].<ref>[https://www.socialistparty.org.uk/socialistwomen/sw12.htm Women fighters and revolutionaries - Eleanor Marx] www.socialistparty.org.uk</ref> Several other demonstrations followed in the aftermath, with Eleanor urging the radical line.<ref>E.P.

Two years later, the play was revised and renamed ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' by [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]].

'''''mestiza''''') is a term historically used in [[Spain]] and [[Hispanic America]] that originally referred to a person of combined [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] descent, regardless of where the person was born. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category for mixed-race ''[[casta]]s'' that evolved during the [[Spanish Empire]]. Although broadly speaking, ''mestizo'' means someone of mixed European/indigenous heritage, the term did not have a fixed meaning in the colonial period. It was a formal label for individuals in official documentation, such as censuses, parish registers, Inquisition trials, and other matters. Individuals were labeled by priests and royal officials as mestizos, but the term was also used for self identification.<ref>Rappaport, ''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 4</ref>\n\nIn the modern era, particularly in [[Hispanic America]], ''mestizo'' has become more of a cultural term, with the term '''Indian''' being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate indigenous ethnic identity, [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]], tribal affiliation, etc. In late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Peru, for instance, ''mestizos'' denoted those peoples with evidence of \"mixed\" ethno-racial descent ''and'' access--usually monetary access, but not always--to secondary educational institutions. This conception changed by the 1920s, especially after the national ascension and spiritual economy of ''[[Indigenismo#Indigenism_in_Peru|indigenismo]]''.\n\nThe term '''[[casta#mestizaje|mestizaje]]''' \u2013 taking as its root ''mestizo'' or mixed \u2013 came from the Latin word ''mixtus'', meaning mixed. It is the modern Spanish word coined in the twentieth century for race mixture or [[miscegenation]], the general process of mixing ancestries.<ref>Rappaport, Joanne, ''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 247.</ref>\n\nTo avoid confusion with the original usage of the term {{lang|es|mestizo}}, mixed people started to be referred to collectively as {{lang|es|castas}}. In some Latin American countries, such as [[Mexico]], the concept of the mestizo became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly indigenous, and the word ''mestizo'' acquired its current meaning, it being used by the government to refer to all Mexicans who do not speak [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]],<ref name=\"EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|url-status=dead|title=en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dej\u00f3 de clasificar a la poblaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds en tres categor\u00edas raciales, blanco, mestizo e ind\u00edgena, y adopt\u00f3 una nueva clasificaci\u00f3n \u00e9tnica que distingu\u00eda a los hablantes de lenguas ind\u00edgenas del resto de la poblaci\u00f3n, es decir de los hablantes de espa\u00f1ol.|archivedate=23 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Bartolom\u00e9 |first=Miguel Alberto |year=1996 |chapter=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en M\u00e9xico |title=Coloquio sobre derechos ind\u00edgenas |location=Oaxaca |publisher=IOC |isbn=978-968-6951-31-8 |chapterurl=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf |page=5}}</ref> including people of complete European or indigenous descent as well as [[Asian Mexicans|Asians]] and [[Afro-Mexicans|Africans]].<ref name=\"Knight 1990:73\">{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910\u20131940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870\u20131940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/73 73] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73856-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/73 }}</ref> While the caste system and racial classifications were officially abandoned once Mexico achieved its [[Independence of Mexico|independence]], the label mestizo was still used in academic circles: now to refer to all the people who were [[mixed race]]. It was in those academic circles that the \"Mestizaje\" or \"[[La Raza C\u00f3smica|Cosmic Race]]\" ideology was created, the ideology asserted that Mestizos are the result of the mixing of all the races. After the [[Mexican Revolution]] the government, on its attempts to create an unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions adopted and actively promoted the \"Mestizaje\" ideology.<ref name=\"EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES\"/>\n\nThe [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[cognate]], ''[[mesti\u00e7o]]'', historically referred to any mixture of Portuguese and local populations in the [[Portuguese colonies]]. In [[colonial Brazil]] most of the non-enslaved population was initially ''[[caboclo|mesti\u00e7o de indio]]'', i.e. mixed Portuguese and native Brazilian. There was no descent-based casta system, and children of upper class Portuguese landlord males and enslaved females would enjoy privileges higher than the ones given to the lower classes, such as formal education, though such cases were not so common and they tended to not inherit property, generally given to the children of free women, who tended to be legitimate offspring in cases of concubinage (also a common practice, inherited from Amerindian and African customs).\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], which was a colony of Spain, the term [[Filipino mestizo|''mestizo'']] came to refer to a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] with any foreign ancestry, and usually shortened as ''[[Tisoy]]''.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the term mestizo refers to ethnicity which is a mixture of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]s and [[native Indonesian]]; they are usually referred to as the [[Indo people]].\n\nIn [[Ontario]] and western [[Canada]], the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] people are a distinct community composed of the descendants of Europeans (usually French or Scottish, sometimes English) involved in the fur trade and Canadian First Nations peoples (especially [[Cree]] and [[Anishinaabe]]; it does not include people of mixed European and Inuit ancestry). As used in [[Quebec]], however, the term refers to anyone of mixed European (usually French) and First Nations ancestry.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Spanish word {{lang|es|mestizo}} is from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''mixticius'', meaning mixed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mestizo |title=mestizo |year=2008 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |quote=a person of mixed blood; specifically: a person of mixed European and American Indian indigenous ancestry}}</ref><ref name=\"dictionary.reference.com\">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mestizo |title=Mestizo \u2013 Define Mestizo at Dictionary.com |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> Its usage has been documented as early as 1275, to refer to the offspring of an [[Egypt|Egyptian/Afro/Hamite]] and a [[Semitic people|Semite]]/Afro Asiatic.<ref name=\"AlfonsoX-p261R\">{{cite book |author=Alfonso X |title=General Estoria.

It is related to the particular racial identity of historical Amerindian-descended [[Hispanic and Latino American]] communities in an American context.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, [[M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Canadian M\u00e9tis]] (with upper-case), as a loanword from French, refers to persons of mixed French and Indigenous ancestry. French-speaking Canadians, when using the word m\u00e9tis, are referring to [[M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Canadian M\u00e9tis]] ethnicity, and all persons of mixed Amerindian and European ancestry, rather than the broader concept of mixed people in general ({{lang|fr|m\u00e9tis}} with lowercase), present in all other French-speaking countries, as would speakers of Spanish; the usual term to refer to mixed-ethnicity people in general is thus \"mul\u00e2tre\", which is considered elsewhere pejorative. In the United States, [[M\u00e9tis people (United States)|M\u00e9tis Americans]] and [[Mestizos in the United States|Mestizo Americans]] are two distinct racial and [[racial identity|ethno-racial identities]], as reflected in the use of French and Spanish loanwords, respectively.\n\nIn the Philippines, the word ''mestizo'' usually refers to a Filipino with combined [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Indigenous]] and European ancestry, but occasionally it will be used for a Filipino with apparent Chinese ancestry, who will also be referred to as 'chinito'. The latter was officially listed as a \"mestizo de sangley\" in birth records of the 19th century, with 'sangley' as a reference to the [[Hokkienese]] word for business, 'seng-li'.\n\nIn the Portuguese-speaking world, the contemporary sense has been the closest to the historical usage from the Middle Ages, because of important linguistic differences, so that {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} (mixed, mixed-ethnicity, miscegenation, etc.) is separated altogether from {{lang|pt|pardo}} (any kind of brown people) and {{lang|pt|caboclo}} (brown people originally of European\u2013Amerindian admixture or assimilated Amerindians), in which {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} can be also fully African or East Asian in their full definition (thus not brown) and one does not need to be a {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} to be a part of the latter two categories.\n\nIn Brazil specifically, at least in modern times all non-Indigenous people are part of a single ethnicity ({{lang|pt|os brasileiros}}; lines between ethnic groups are historically fluid), the {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} ({{IPA-pt|me\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu}}, {{IPA-pt|mi\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}}) group is by far the largest among the free people since the earliest decades of the colony. As explained above, the concept of {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} should not in any way be confused with the mestizo as used in either the Spanish-speaking world or the English-speaking one, as it relates no special relation to being of Amerindian extraction, and also should not be confused with {{lang|pt|pardo}}, literally \"brown people\" (there are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} among all major groups of the country, Indigenous, Asian, {{lang|pt|pardo}} and African, and they are likely the majority in the three latter ones).\n\nIn [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], the term ''mestizo'' refers to people of mixed European (usually French) and East Asian ancestry.<ref name=SaintBarts1>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tb.html |title=Saint Barthelemy: People and Society |date=13 September 2012|work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Cognates===\n{{lang|es|Mestizo}} ({{IPA-es|mes\u02c8ti\u03b8o|lang}} <small>or</small> {{IPA-es|mes\u02c8tiso|}}), {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} ({{IPA-pt|m\u0268\u0283\u02c8tisu|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|mes\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}} <small>or</small> {{IPA-pt|mi\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}}), {{lang|fr|m\u00e9tis}} ({{IPA-fr|me\u02c8tis|lang}}), {{lang|ca|mest\u00eds}} ({{IPA-ca|m\u0259s\u02c8tis|lang}}), {{lang|de|Mischling}} ({{IPA-de|m\u026a\u0283\u02c8l\u026a\u014b\u0261|lang}}), {{lang|it|meticcio}} ({{IPA-it|me\u02c8titt\u0283o|lang}}), {{lang|nl|mestiezen}} ({{IPA-nl|m\u025bs\u02c8tiz\u0259(n)|lang}}), ''mestee'' ({{IPA-all|m\u0259s\u02c8ti\u02d0|Middle English:}}), and mixed (English) are all [[cognates]] of the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''mixticius''.\n\n==Mestizo as a colonial-era category==\n{{Main|Casta}}\n[[File:Castas 01mestiza max.jpg|thumb|From Spaniard and Indian woman, Mestiza.

Although this has been conceived of as a \"system,\" and often called the ''sistema de castas'' or ''sociedad de castas'', archival research shows that racial labels were not fixed throughout a person's life{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. Artwork created mainly in eighteenth-century Mexico, \"[[Casta#casta paintings|casta paintings]],\" show groupings of racial types in hierarchical order, which has influenced the way that modern scholars have conceived of difference in Spanish America.<ref>Rappaport, Joanne, ''The Disappearing Mestizo: Configuring Difference in the Colonial New Kingdom of Granada''.

Throughout the territories of [[Spanish Empire]] in the Americas, ways of differentiating individuals in a racial hierarchy, often called in the modern era the ''sistema de castas'' or the ''sociedad de castas'' developed where society was divided based on color, ''calidad'' (status) and other factors.  The main divisions were as follows:\n\n# ''Espa\u00f1ol'' (fem. espa\u00f1ola), i.e. [[Spaniards|Spaniard]] \u2013 person of Spanish or other European ancestry; a blanket term, subdivided into ''Peninsulares'' and ''Criollos''\n#*''[[Peninsulars|Peninsular]]'' \u2013 a European born in Spain who later settled in the Americas;\n#* ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'' (fem. criolla)&nbsp;\u2013 a Spanish or other European descent born in the Americas;\n# ''[[Castizo]]'' (fem. castiza) \u2013 a person with primarily European and some Amerindian ancestry born into a mixed family; the offspring of a castizo and an espa\u00f1ol was considered espa\u00f1ol. Offspring of a castizo/a of an Espa\u00f1ol/a returned to Espa\u00f1ol/a.\n# ''Mestizo'' (fem. mestiza) \u2013 a person of extended mixed European and Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indio]]'' (fem. India) \u2013 a person of pure Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Pardo]]'' (fem. parda) \u2013 a person of mixed White, Amerindian and African ancestry; sometimes a polite term for a black person;\n# ''[[Mulatto|Mulato]]'' (fem. mulata) \u2013 a person of mixed White, and African ancestry;\n# ''[[Zambo]]'' \u2013 a person of mixed African and Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Negro]]'' (fem. negra)&nbsp;\u2013 a person of [[Atlantic slave trade|African]] descent, primarily former enslaved Africans and their descendants.\n\nIn theory, and as depicted in eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings, ''espa\u00f1ol'' status could also be restored to the offspring of a Castizo/a [mixed Spanish - Mestizo] and an Espa\u00f1ol/a.<ref>M\u00f6rner, ''Race Mixture'', p.58.</ref>\n\n'''Racial labels in a set of eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]''':\n*'''De Espa\u00f1ol e India, nace Mestiza'''\n*'''De Espa\u00f1ol y Mestiza, nace Castiza'''\n*De Castizo y Espa\u00f1ola, nace Espa\u00f1ola\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Negra, nace Mulata\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Mulata, nace Morisca\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Morisca, nace Albino\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Albina, nace [[Torna atr\u00e1s]]\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Torna atr\u00e1s, \"Tente en el ayre\"\n*De Negro y India, Chino Cambuja\n*De Chino Cambujo y India, [[Lobo (racial category)|Loba]]\n*De Lobo y India, Albarazado\n*'''De Albarazado y Mestiza, Barcino'''\n*De Indio y Barcina, Zambaiga\n*'''De Castizo y Mestiza, Chamizo'''\n*Indios Gentiles (Barbarian [[Chichimeca|Meco Indians]])\n\nIn the early colonial period, the offspring of Espa\u00f1oles and Indias were raised either in the Hispanic world, if the father recognized the offspring as his natural child; or the child was raised in the indigenous world of the mother if he did not.  As early as 1533, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] mandated the high court ([[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]]) to take the children of Spanish men and indigenous women from their mothers and educate them in the Spanish sphere.<ref name=\"auto1\">M\u00f6rner, ''Race Mixture'', p. 55.</ref> This mixed group born out of Christian wedlock increased in numbers, generally living in their mother's indigenous communities.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMestizos were the first group in the colonial era to be designated as a separate category from European whites (Espa\u00f1oles) and enslaved African blacks (''Negros'') and were included in designation of \"vagabonds\" (''vagabundos'') in 1543 in Mexico. Although mestizos were often classified as ''castas'', they had a higher standing than any mixed-race person since they did not have to pay tribute, the men could be ordained as priests, and they could be licensed to carry weapons, in contrast to ''negros'', mulattoes, and other castas.  Unlike blacks and mulattoes, mestizos had no enslaved ancestors.<ref>Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of Mirrors: Power, Witchcraft, and Caste in Colonial Mexico''. Durham: Duke University Press 2003, p. 84.</ref> Intermarriage between Espa\u00f1oles and mestizos resulted in offspring designated ''[[castizo]]s'' (\"three-quarters white\"), and the marriage of a castizo/a to an Espa\u00f1ol/a resulted in the restoration of Espa\u00f1ol/a status to the offspring. Don Alonso O\u2019Crouley observed in Mexico (1774), \"If the mixed-blood is the offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian, the stigma [of race mixture] disappears at the third step in descent because it is held as systematic that a Spaniard and an Indian produce a mestizo; a mestizo and a Spaniard, a castizo; and a castizo and a Spaniard, a Spaniard. The admixture of Indian blood should not indeed be regarded as a blemish, since the provisions&nbsp; of law give the&nbsp; Indian all&nbsp; that he could wish for,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Philip II granted to mestizos the privilege of becoming priests. On this consideration is based&nbsp;the&nbsp;common estimation of&nbsp; descent&nbsp; from a&nbsp; union of&nbsp; Indian and European or creole Spaniard.\"<ref>Sr. Don Pedro Alonso O\u2019Crouley, ''A Description of the Kingdom of New Spain'' (1774),trans. and ed. Sean Galvin. San Francisco: John Howell Books, 1972, 20</ref>&nbsp; O\u2019Crouley states that the same process of restoration of racial purity does not occur over generations for European-African offspring marrying whites. \u201cFrom the union of a Spaniard and a Negro the mixed-blood&nbsp; retains&nbsp; the stigma for generations without losing the original quality of a mulato.\"<ref>O\u2019Crouley, \u201cA Description of the Kingdom of New Spain\u2019\u2019, p. 20</ref>\n\nThe Spanish colonial regime divided groups into two basic legal categories, the Republic of Indians (''Rep\u00fablica de Indios'') and the Republic of Spaniards (''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles'') comprised European whites (Espa\u00f1oles) and all other non-Indians.  Indians were free vassals of the crown, whose commoners paid tribute while indigenous elites were considered nobles and tribute exempt, as were mestizos. Indians were nominally protected by the crown, with non-Indians\u2014mestizos, blacks, and mulattoes\u2014forbidden to live in indigenous communities. Mestizos and Indians in Mexico habitually held each other in mutual antipathy. This was particularly the case with commoner Indians against mestizos, some of whom infiltrated their communities and became part of the ruling elite. Spanish authorities turned a blind eye to the mestizos' presence, since they collected commoners' tribute for the crown and came to hold offices. They were useful intermediaries for the colonial state between the Republic of Spaniards and the Republic of Indians.<ref>Lewis, ''Hall of Mirrors'', pp. 86-91.</ref>\n\nA person's legal racial classification in colonial Spanish America was closely tied to social status, wealth, culture and language use. Wealthy people paid to change or obscure their actual ancestry.

It was a first attempt by the [[Spaniards]] to establish a permanent settlement in El Salvador. The city was abandoned after Native repeatedly attacked and then resettled again in 1528, then completely abandoned and dismantled in 1545 and moved to modern day [[San Salvador]] City. The settlement resembles more of a fortified military base rather than a city. The historic census indicates that the city contained male Spaniards with many Mestizo children with Native American indigenous wives]]\n\nIn [[Central America]], intermarriage by European men with the Native American Indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]] and [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women of what is now [[El Salvador]] happened almost immediately after the arrival of the European [[Spaniards]] led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Other indigenous groups in the country such as [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Poqomam people]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Ch'orti' people]], [[Alaguilac]], [[Xinca people]], [[Mixe]] and [[Mangue language]] people became culturally extinct due to the Mestizo process or diseases brought by the Spaniards. Mestizo culture quickly became the most successful and dominant culture in El Salvador. The majority of Salvadorans in modern El Salvador identify themselves as 86.3% Mestizo roots.<ref>[http://www.digestyc.gob.sv/servers/redatam/htdocs/CPV2007S/Docs/RESULTADOS_FINALES.pdf Ethnic Groups -2007 official Census]. Page 13, Digestyc.gob.sv</ref>\n\nIn 1932, ruthless dictator [[Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez]] was responsible for La Matanza (\"The Slaughter\"), known as the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre]] in which the Native American indigenous people were murdered in an effort to wipe out the indigenous people in El Salvador during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Indigenous peoples, mostly of Lenca, Cacaopera and Pipil descent are still present in El Salvador in several communities, conserving their languages, customs, and traditions.\n\nThere is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000), mostly from [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Palestine]] (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent is around 27,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. Many of these Arab groups naturally mixed and contributed into the modern Salvadoran Mestizo population.\n\n[[Pardo]] is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have a significant African population due to many factors including El Salvador not having a Caribbean coast, and because of president [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]], who passed racial laws to keep Afros and other peoples out of El Salvador, though [[Afro-Salvadoran|Salvadorans with African ancestry]], called Pardos, were already present in El Salvador, the majority are tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans who largely cluster with the Mestizo population. They have been mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. A total of only 10,000 enslaved Africans were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. The enslaved Africans that were brought to El Salvador during the colonial times, eventually came to mix and merged into the much larger and vaster Mestizo mixed European Spanish/Native Indigenous population creating Pardo or Afromestizos who cluster with Mestizo people, contributing into the modern day Mestizo population in El Salvador, thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America.\n\nToday, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Native American indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages nor have an indigenous culture, also tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans, and Salvadoran of Arab descent, also identify themselves as culturally Salvadoran Mestizo by absorption.\n\n====Guatemala====\n{{See also|Demographics of Guatemala}}\nThe Ladino population in [[Guatemala]] is officially recognized as a distinct ethnic group, and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala uses the following definition: \n<blockquote>\"The ladino population has been characterized as a heterogeneous population which expresses itself in the Spanish language as a maternal language, which possesses specific cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with indigenous cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly considered as western.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minedoc.gob.gt/administracion/dependencias/centrales/ccre/ccre_interculturalidad.htm |title=Reflexiones sobre el mestizaje y la identidad nacional en Centroam\u00e9rica: de la colonia a las R\u00e9publicas liberales |access-date=28 July 2008 |author=Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n (MINEDUC) |authorlink= |year=2008 |website= |pages= |language=Spanish |doi= |quote= }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Spanish-speaking South America==\n\n===Argentina and Uruguay===\n{{main|Argentine people|Uruguayan people}}\nInitially colonial [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] had a predominately mestizo population like the rest of the Spanish colonies, but due to a flood of European migration in the 19th century and the repeated intermarriage with Europeans the mestizo population became a so-called {{lang|es|castizo}} population. With more Europeans arriving in the early 20th century, the majority of these immigrants coming from [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], the face of Argentina and Uruguay has overwhelmingly become European in culture and tradition. Because of this, the term mestizo has fallen into disuse.

In Southern Chile, the Mapuche, were one of the only Amerindian tribes in the Americas that were in continuous conflict with the [[Spanish Empire]] and did not submit to a European power.\n\nA public health book from the [[University of Chile]] states that 30% of the population is of White origin; mestizos are estimated to amount to a total of 65%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%. A genetic study by the same university showed that the average Chilean's genes in the mestizo segment are 60% European and 40% Amerindian.\n\n===Colombia===\n{{Main|Mestizo Colombian}}\n[[Colombia]] whose land was named after explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] is the product of the interacting and mixing of the European [[conquistador]]s and colonist with the different Amerindian peoples of Colombia. Later the African element was introduced into the coastal parts of Colombia as enslaved people.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nOver time Colombia has become a primarily Mestizo country due to limited immigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the minorities being: the [[Mulatto]]es and [[Pardo]]s living primarily in the coastal areas; and pockets of Amerindians living around the rural areas and the Amazonian Basin regions of the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAn extraofficial estimate considers that the 49% of the Colombian population is [[Mestizo Colombian|Mestizo]] or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Approximately 37% is of [[White Colombian|European]] ancestry (predominantly [[Spaniards|Spanish]], and a part of [[Italians|Italian]], [[French people|French]], and [[Germans|German]]) and of [[Arab diaspora in Colombia|Middle Eastern]] ancestry. 10.6% is of [[Afro-Colombian|African]] ancestry.

With the passage of time these Spanish conquerors and succeeding Spanish colonists sired offspring with the local Amerindian population, since Spanish immigration did not initially include many White females to the colonies. In a couple of generations a predominately mestizo population emerged in Ecuador with a drastically declining Amerindian Population due to European diseases and wars.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Afro-Ecuadorians]] ([[Zambos]] and [[Mulatto]]es), who are a minority in the country, can be found mostly in the [[Esmeraldas Province]], in the [[Valle del Chota]] of the [[Imbabura Province]], and as small communities of Afro-Ecuadorians living along the coastal areas as minorities.\n\nMestizos are by far the largest of all the ethnic groups, and comprise 71.9% of the current population. The next 28% of the population is comprised by four ethnic groups with about 7% each, the Montubios, Afro-Ecuadorian, Amerindian (Indigenous) and White.\n\n===Paraguay===\n{{main|Paraguayan people}}\nDuring the reign of [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], the first consul of [[Paraguay]] from 1811 to 1840, he imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos or Indians.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This was introduced to eliminate any sense of racial superiority, and also to end the predominantly Spanish influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo (although his paternal grandfather was [[Afro-Brazilian]]), but feared that racial superiority would create [[class division]] which would threaten his [[Autocracy|absolute rule]].\n\nAs a result of this, today 90% of Paraguay's population are mestizo, and the main language is the native [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], spoken by 60% of the population as a first language, with Spanish spoken as a first language by 40% of the population, and fluently spoken by 75%, making Paraguay one of the most bilingual countries in the world. Although it did not had the exposition to [[miscegenation]] as de Francia wanted, after the tremendous decline of male population as a result of the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], European male worker \u00e9migr\u00e9s mixed with the female mestizo population so as that pushed a middle class of mestizo background largely accepted as a configuration of the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Peru===\n[[File:Mestizo.

The Mixed Ethnicty Day, or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mesti\u00e7o), on 27 June, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Para\u00edba and a holyday in two cities.\n\nOne of the most notorious group is the {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown people), also informally known as {{lang|pt|moreno}} (tan skinned people; given its euphemism-like nature, it may be interpreted as offensive). They include mostly those of non-white skin color. Nevertheless, not all {{lang|pt|pardos}} are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}}. For example, an Amerindian (initially and most often {{lang|pt|\u00edndio}}, often more formally {{lang|pt|ind\u00edgena}}, rarely {{lang|pt|amer\u00edndio}}, an East Indian ({{lang|pt|indiano}})) or a Filipino may be initially described as {{lang|pt|pardo/parda}} (in opposition to {{lang|pt|branco}}, white, {{lang|pt|negro}}, Afro, and {{lang|pt|amarelo}}, yellow) if his or her ethnicity is unknown, and it is testified by the initial discovery reports of Portuguese navigators. In the same way, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}}, a term used to describe anyone with any degree of [[miscegenation]] in one's blood line, may apply to all said groups (that in Portugal and its ex-colonies, always depended solely on phenotype, meaning a brown person may have a full sibling of all other basic phenotypes and thus ethnic groups).\n\nImportant {{lang|pt|pardo}} groups in Brazil are the {{lang|pt|caboclos}} (largely contemporary usage) or {{lang|pt|mamelucos}} (largely archaic usage), the {{lang|pt|mulatos}}, and the {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The first group is composed of the culturally assimilated Amerindians as well as the ''brown-skinned'' descendants or children of both white or {{lang|pt|moreno}} (swarthy) people of otherwise White phenotype and Amerindians. They are an important group in the Northern (Amazon Basin) region, but also relatively numerous on the Northeastern and Center-Western ones. Then, those, neither Afro- nor fair-skinned, whose origins come from the admixture between White or {{lang|pt|morenos}} and Afros or {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The last group is composed of descendants of Amerindians or {{lang|pt|caboclos}} and Afros or other {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. Finally, those whose origins possess a notorious level of European ancestry and in which neither Amerindian nor African phenotypical traces are much more present than each other are sometimes known as {{lang|pt|ju\u00e7aras}}.\n\n[[File:Ronaldo-14-05-2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Brazilian footballer [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]]]\nThere are, however, important groups who are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} but not necessarily {{lang|pt|pardos}}. People of East Asian and non-Asian descent combined are known as {{lang|pt|ainokos}}, from the Japanese \"love (ai) child (ko)\" (also used for all children of illegitimate birth.  Mixed children are now largely referred to as \"half\" or [[h\u0101fu]]), though often, for those without contact with the term, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o de}} [East Asian nationality/ethnicity] may also be used. {{lang|pt|[[Sarar\u00e1]]s}} differ from {{lang|pt|mulatos}} at being fair-skinned (rather than brown-skinned), and having non-straight [[blond]] or [[red hair]].\n\nOther people who are not brown (and thus not {{lang|pt|pardo}}), but also their phenotypes by anything other than skin, hair and eye color do not match white ones but rather those of people of color may be just referred to as {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}}, without specification to skin color with an identitarian connotation (there are the distinctions, though, of {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o claro}}, for the fair-skinned ones, and {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o moreno}}, for those of olive skin tones). In Brazilian censuses, those people may choose to identify mostly with {{lang|pt|branco}} (White) or {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown) or leave the question on ethnic/color blank.\n\n===Lusophone Africa===\n\n====Angolan mesti\u00e7o====\nThe {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} are primarily of mixed European, [[Jus soli|native]] born [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Precolonial history of Angola|Angolan]] or other [[Sub-Saharan Africans#Sub-Saharan Africa|indigenous African]] lineages. They tend to be Portuguese culturally and to have full Portuguese names.\n\nAlthough they make up about two percent of the population, they are the socially elite and racially privileged group in the country. Historically, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} formed social and cultural allegiances with [[Colonial history of Angola|Portuguese colonists]] subsequently identifying with the Portuguese over and above their indigenous identities. Despite their loyalty, the ethnic group faced economic and political adversity at hands of the white population during times of economic hardship for whites. These actions lead to ostracizing Mesti\u00e7os from their inherited economic benefits which sparked the group to take a new sociopolitical direction.\n\nAcross the 500 year Portuguese presence in the country, the Mesti\u00e7o have retained their position of entitlement which is highly evident in the political, economic and [[Culture of Angola#Mesti\u00e7o|cultural]] hierarchy in present-day [[Angola]]. Their [[phenotype]] range is broad with a number of members possessing physical characteristics that are close to others within the indigenous Afro [[Demographics of Angola|non-mixed]] population.

''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 247.</ref> In the modern era, it is used to denote the positive unity of race mixtures in modern Latin America. This ideological stance is in contrast to the term [[miscegenation]], which usually has negative connotations.<ref>Lewis, Stephen. \"Mestizaje\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 840.</ref>  The main ideological advocate of mestizaje was [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] (1882\u20131959), the Mexican Minister of Education in the 1920s. The term was in circulation in Mexico in the late nineteenth century, along with similar terms, ''cruzamiento'' (\"crossing\") and ''mestizaci\u00f3n'' (process of \"mestizo-izing\"). In Spanish America, the colonial-era system of castas sought to differentiate between individuals and groups on the basis of a hierarchical classification by ancestry, skin color, and status (''calidad''), giving separate labels to the perceived categorical differences and privileging whiteness. In contrast, the idea of modern ''mestizaje'' is the positive unity of a nation's citizenry based on racial mixture. \"Mestizaje placed greater emphasis [than the casta system] on commonality and hybridity to engineer order and unity\u2026 [it] operated within the context of the nation-state and sought to derive meaning from Latin America\u2019s own internal experiences rather than the dictates and necessities of empire... ultimately [it] embraced racial mixture.\"<ref>Vinson, Ben III. ''Before Mestizaje''. New York: Cambridge University Press 2018, pp. 61-2.</ref>\n\n===Mestizaje as an ideology in modern Mexico===\nAt independence in Mexico, the casta classifications were abolished, but discrimination based on skin color and socioeconomic status continued.  Liberal intellectuals grappled with the \u201cIndian Problem,\u201d that is the Indians\u2019 lack of cultural assimilation to Mexican national life as citizens of the nation rather than members of their indigenous communities. Urban elites spurned mixed-race urban plebeians and Indians along with their traditional popular culture. In the late nineteenth century during the rule of [[Porfiriato|Porfirio D\u00edaz]], elites\u2019 sought to be, act, and look like modern Europeans, that is, different from the majority of the Mexican population.  D\u00edaz was mixed race himself, but powdered his dark skin to hide his Mixtec indigenous ancestry.   At the end of the nineteenth century, however, as social and economic tensions increased in Mexico, two major works by Mexican intellectuals sought to rehabilitate the assessment of the mestizo. D\u00edaz\u2019s Minister of Education, [[Justo Sierra]] published ''The Political Evolution of the Mexican People'' (1902), which situated Mexican identity in the mixing of European whites and Indians. Mexicans are \"the sons of two peoples, of two races. [This fact] dominates our whole history; to this we owe our soul.\"<ref>Sierra, Justo. ''The Political Evolution of the Mexican People\u2019\u2019. Trans. Charles Ramsdell. Austin: University of Texas Press.  P. xvii.</ref>  Intellectual [[Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez]] also took a revisionist stance on mestizos in his work ''Los grandes problemas nacionales'' (The Great National Problems) (1909).  \n\nThe Mexican state after the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910\u201320) embraced the ideology of mestizaje as a nation-building tool, aimed at integrating Indians culturally and politically in the construction of national identity. As such it has meant a systematic effort to eliminate indigenous culture, in the name of integrating them into a supposedly inclusive mestizo identity.  For [[Afro-Mexicans]],  the ideology has denied their historical contributions to Mexico and their current place in Mexican political life. Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of \"mestizaje\" (the process of ethnic homogenization).<ref>{{cite book |last=Wade |first=Peter |year=1997 |title=Race and Ethnicity in Latin America |location=Chicago |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=978-0-7453-0987-3 |page=32 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910\u20131940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870\u20131940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/78 78\u201385] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73856-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/78 }}</ref>\n\nCultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to \"help\" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the Mestizo society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  \n\nIn recent years, mestizos\u2019 sole claim to Mexican national identity has begun to erode, at least rhetorically.\"<ref>Lewis, \"Mestizaje', p. 841.</ref>  A constitutional changes to Article 4 that now says that the \"Mexican Nation has a pluricultural composition, originally based on its indigenous peoples.

'''''mestiza''''') is a term historically used in [[Spain]] and [[Hispanic America]] that originally referred to a person of combined [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] descent, regardless of where the person was born. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category for mixed-race ''[[casta]]s'' that evolved during the [[Spanish Empire]]. Although broadly speaking, ''mestizo'' means someone of mixed European/indigenous heritage, the term did not have a fixed meaning in the colonial period. It was a formal label for individuals in official documentation, such as censuses, parish registers, Inquisition trials, and other matters. Individuals were labeled by priests and royal officials as mestizos, but the term was also used for self identification.<ref>Rappaport, ''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 4</ref>\n\nIn the modern era, particularly in [[Hispanic America]], ''mestizo'' has become more of a cultural term, with the term '''Indian''' being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate indigenous ethnic identity, [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]], tribal affiliation, etc. In late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Peru, for instance, ''mestizos'' denoted \"mixed\" peoples by ethno-racial descent with access--usually monetary access, but not always--to secondary educational institutions. This conception changed by the 1920s with the national and spiritual ascension of ''[[Indigenismo#Indigenism_in_Peru|indigenismo]]''.\n\nThe term '''[[casta#mestizaje|mestizaje]]''' \u2013 taking as its root ''mestizo'' or mixed \u2013 came from the Latin word ''mixtus'', meaning mixed. It is the modern Spanish word coined in the twentieth century for race mixture or [[miscegenation]], the general process of mixing ancestries.<ref>Rappaport, Joanne, ''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 247.</ref>\n\nTo avoid confusion with the original usage of the term {{lang|es|mestizo}}, mixed people started to be referred to collectively as {{lang|es|castas}}. In some Latin American countries, such as [[Mexico]], the concept of the mestizo became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly indigenous, and the word ''mestizo'' acquired its current meaning, it being used by the government to refer to all Mexicans who do not speak [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]],<ref name=\"EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|url-status=dead|title=en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dej\u00f3 de clasificar a la poblaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds en tres categor\u00edas raciales, blanco, mestizo e ind\u00edgena, y adopt\u00f3 una nueva clasificaci\u00f3n \u00e9tnica que distingu\u00eda a los hablantes de lenguas ind\u00edgenas del resto de la poblaci\u00f3n, es decir de los hablantes de espa\u00f1ol.|archivedate=23 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Bartolom\u00e9 |first=Miguel Alberto |year=1996 |chapter=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en M\u00e9xico |title=Coloquio sobre derechos ind\u00edgenas |location=Oaxaca |publisher=IOC |isbn=978-968-6951-31-8 |chapterurl=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf |page=5}}</ref> including people of complete European or indigenous descent as well as [[Asian Mexicans|Asians]] and [[Afro-Mexicans|Africans]].<ref name=\"Knight 1990:73\">{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910\u20131940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870\u20131940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/73 73] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73856-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/73 }}</ref> While the caste system and racial classifications were officially abandoned once Mexico achieved its [[Independence of Mexico|independence]], the label mestizo was still used in academic circles: now to refer to all the people who were [[mixed race]].

After the [[Mexican Revolution]] the government, on its attempts to create an unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions adopted and actively promoted the \"Mestizaje\" ideology.<ref name=\"EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES\"/>\n\nThe [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[cognate]], ''[[mesti\u00e7o]]'', historically referred to any mixture of Portuguese and local populations in the [[Portuguese colonies]]. In [[colonial Brazil]] most of the non-enslaved population was initially ''[[caboclo|mesti\u00e7o de indio]]'', i.e. mixed Portuguese and native Brazilian. There was no descent-based casta system, and children of upper class Portuguese landlord males and enslaved females would enjoy privileges higher than the ones given to the lower classes, such as formal education, though such cases were not so common and they tended to not inherit property, generally given to the children of free women, who tended to be legitimate offspring in cases of concubinage (also a common practice, inherited from Amerindian and African customs).\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], which was a colony of Spain, the term [[Filipino mestizo|''mestizo'']] came to refer to a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] with any foreign ancestry, and usually shortened as ''[[Tisoy]]''.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the term mestizo refers to ethnicity which is a mixture of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]s and [[native Indonesian]]; they are usually referred to as the [[Indo people]].\n\nIn [[Ontario]] and western [[Canada]], the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] people are a distinct community composed of the descendants of Europeans (usually French or Scottish, sometimes English) involved in the fur trade and Canadian First Nations peoples (especially [[Cree]] and [[Anishinaabe]]; it does not include people of mixed European and Inuit ancestry). As used in [[Quebec]], however, the term refers to anyone of mixed European (usually French) and First Nations ancestry.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Spanish word {{lang|es|mestizo}} is from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''mixticius'', meaning mixed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mestizo |title=mestizo |year=2008 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |quote=a person of mixed blood; specifically: a person of mixed European and American Indian indigenous ancestry}}</ref><ref name=\"dictionary.reference.com\">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mestizo |title=Mestizo \u2013 Define Mestizo at Dictionary.com |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> Its usage has been documented as early as 1275, to refer to the offspring of an [[Egypt|Egyptian/Afro/Hamite]] and a [[Semitic people|Semite]]/Afro Asiatic.<ref name=\"AlfonsoX-p261R\">{{cite book |author=Alfonso X |title=General Estoria.

It is related to the particular racial identity of historical Amerindian-descended [[Hispanic and Latino American]] communities in an American context.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, [[M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Canadian M\u00e9tis]] (with upper-case), as a loanword from French, refers to persons of mixed French and Indigenous ancestry. French-speaking Canadians, when using the word m\u00e9tis, are referring to [[M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Canadian M\u00e9tis]] ethnicity, and all persons of mixed Amerindian and European ancestry, rather than the broader concept of mixed people in general ({{lang|fr|m\u00e9tis}} with lowercase), present in all other French-speaking countries, as would speakers of Spanish; the usual term to refer to mixed-ethnicity people in general is thus \"mul\u00e2tre\", which is considered elsewhere pejorative. In the United States, [[M\u00e9tis people (United States)|M\u00e9tis Americans]] and [[Mestizos in the United States|Mestizo Americans]] are two distinct racial and [[racial identity|ethno-racial identities]], as reflected in the use of French and Spanish loanwords, respectively.\n\nIn the Philippines, the word ''mestizo'' usually refers to a Filipino with combined [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Indigenous]] and European ancestry, but occasionally it will be used for a Filipino with apparent Chinese ancestry, who will also be referred to as 'chinito'. The latter was officially listed as a \"mestizo de sangley\" in birth records of the 19th century, with 'sangley' as a reference to the [[Hokkienese]] word for business, 'seng-li'.\n\nIn the Portuguese-speaking world, the contemporary sense has been the closest to the historical usage from the Middle Ages, because of important linguistic differences, so that {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} (mixed, mixed-ethnicity, miscegenation, etc.) is separated altogether from {{lang|pt|pardo}} (any kind of brown people) and {{lang|pt|caboclo}} (brown people originally of European\u2013Amerindian admixture or assimilated Amerindians), in which {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} can be also fully African or East Asian in their full definition (thus not brown) and one does not need to be a {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} to be a part of the latter two categories.\n\nIn Brazil specifically, at least in modern times all non-Indigenous people are part of a single ethnicity ({{lang|pt|os brasileiros}}; lines between ethnic groups are historically fluid), the {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} ({{IPA-pt|me\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu}}, {{IPA-pt|mi\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}}) group is by far the largest among the free people since the earliest decades of the colony. As explained above, the concept of {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} should not in any way be confused with the mestizo as used in either the Spanish-speaking world or the English-speaking one, as it relates no special relation to being of Amerindian extraction, and also should not be confused with {{lang|pt|pardo}}, literally \"brown people\" (there are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} among all major groups of the country, Indigenous, Asian, {{lang|pt|pardo}} and African, and they are likely the majority in the three latter ones).\n\nIn [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], the term ''mestizo'' refers to people of mixed European (usually French) and East Asian ancestry.<ref name=SaintBarts1>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tb.html |title=Saint Barthelemy: People and Society |date=13 September 2012|work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Cognates===\n{{lang|es|Mestizo}} ({{IPA-es|mes\u02c8ti\u03b8o|lang}} <small>or</small> {{IPA-es|mes\u02c8tiso|}}), {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} ({{IPA-pt|m\u0268\u0283\u02c8tisu|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|mes\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}} <small>or</small> {{IPA-pt|mi\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}}), {{lang|fr|m\u00e9tis}} ({{IPA-fr|me\u02c8tis|lang}}), {{lang|ca|mest\u00eds}} ({{IPA-ca|m\u0259s\u02c8tis|lang}}), {{lang|de|Mischling}} ({{IPA-de|m\u026a\u0283\u02c8l\u026a\u014b\u0261|lang}}), {{lang|it|meticcio}} ({{IPA-it|me\u02c8titt\u0283o|lang}}), {{lang|nl|mestiezen}} ({{IPA-nl|m\u025bs\u02c8tiz\u0259(n)|lang}}), ''mestee'' ({{IPA-all|m\u0259s\u02c8ti\u02d0|Middle English:}}), and mixed (English) are all [[cognates]] of the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''mixticius''.\n\n==Mestizo as a colonial-era category==\n{{Main|Casta}}\n[[File:Castas 01mestiza max.jpg|thumb|From Spaniard and Indian woman, Mestiza.

Although this has been conceived of as a \"system,\" and often called the ''sistema de castas'' or ''sociedad de castas'', archival research shows that racial labels were not fixed throughout a person's life{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. Artwork created mainly in eighteenth-century Mexico, \"[[Casta#casta paintings|casta paintings]],\" show groupings of racial types in hierarchical order, which has influenced the way that modern scholars have conceived of difference in Spanish America.<ref>Rappaport, Joanne, ''The Disappearing Mestizo: Configuring Difference in the Colonial New Kingdom of Granada''. Durham: Duke University Press 2014, pp.208-09.</ref>\n\nThere were three main categories of ethnicity during the initial period of colonization of the Americas by the Spanish: European white or Spaniard (''espa\u00f1ol''), Amerindian (''indio''), and African (''negro''). Throughout the territories of [[Spanish Empire]] in the Americas, ways of differentiating individuals in a racial hierarchy, often called in the modern era the ''sistema de castas'' or the ''sociedad de castas'' developed where society was divided based on color, ''calidad'' (status) and other factors.  The main divisions were as follows:\n\n# ''Espa\u00f1ol'' (fem. espa\u00f1ola), i.e. [[Spaniards|Spaniard]] \u2013 person of Spanish or other European ancestry; a blanket term, subdivided into ''Peninsulares'' and ''Criollos''\n#*''[[Peninsulars|Peninsular]]'' \u2013 a European born in Spain who later settled in the Americas;\n#* ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'' (fem. criolla)&nbsp;\u2013 a Spanish or other European descent born in the Americas;\n# ''[[Castizo]]'' (fem. castiza) \u2013 a person with primarily European and some Amerindian ancestry born into a mixed family; the offspring of a castizo and an espa\u00f1ol was considered espa\u00f1ol. Offspring of a castizo/a of an Espa\u00f1ol/a returned to Espa\u00f1ol/a.\n# ''Mestizo'' (fem. mestiza) \u2013 a person of extended mixed European and Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indio]]'' (fem. India) \u2013 a person of pure Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Pardo]]'' (fem. parda) \u2013 a person of mixed White, Amerindian and African ancestry; sometimes a polite term for a black person;\n# ''[[Mulatto|Mulato]]'' (fem. mulata) \u2013 a person of mixed White, and African ancestry;\n# ''[[Zambo]]'' \u2013 a person of mixed African and Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Negro]]'' (fem. negra)&nbsp;\u2013 a person of [[Atlantic slave trade|African]] descent, primarily former enslaved Africans and their descendants.\n\nIn theory, and as depicted in eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings, ''espa\u00f1ol'' status could also be restored to the offspring of a Castizo/a [mixed Spanish - Mestizo] and an Espa\u00f1ol/a.<ref>M\u00f6rner, ''Race Mixture'', p.58.</ref>\n\n'''Racial labels in a set of eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]''':\n*'''De Espa\u00f1ol e India, nace Mestiza'''\n*'''De Espa\u00f1ol y Mestiza, nace Castiza'''\n*De Castizo y Espa\u00f1ola, nace Espa\u00f1ola\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Negra, nace Mulata\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Mulata, nace Morisca\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Morisca, nace Albino\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Albina, nace [[Torna atr\u00e1s]]\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Torna atr\u00e1s, \"Tente en el ayre\"\n*De Negro y India, Chino Cambuja\n*De Chino Cambujo y India, [[Lobo (racial category)|Loba]]\n*De Lobo y India, Albarazado\n*'''De Albarazado y Mestiza, Barcino'''\n*De Indio y Barcina, Zambaiga\n*'''De Castizo y Mestiza, Chamizo'''\n*Indios Gentiles (Barbarian [[Chichimeca|Meco Indians]])\n\nIn the early colonial period, the offspring of Espa\u00f1oles and Indias were raised either in the Hispanic world, if the father recognized the offspring as his natural child; or the child was raised in the indigenous world of the mother if he did not.  As early as 1533, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] mandated the high court ([[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]]) to take the children of Spanish men and indigenous women from their mothers and educate them in the Spanish sphere.<ref name=\"auto1\">M\u00f6rner, ''Race Mixture'', p. 55.</ref> This mixed group born out of Christian wedlock increased in numbers, generally living in their mother's indigenous communities.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMestizos were the first group in the colonial era to be designated as a separate category from European whites (Espa\u00f1oles) and enslaved African blacks (''Negros'') and were included in designation of \"vagabonds\" (''vagabundos'') in 1543 in Mexico. Although mestizos were often classified as ''castas'', they had a higher standing than any mixed-race person since they did not have to pay tribute, the men could be ordained as priests, and they could be licensed to carry weapons, in contrast to ''negros'', mulattoes, and other castas.  Unlike blacks and mulattoes, mestizos had no enslaved ancestors.<ref>Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of Mirrors: Power, Witchcraft, and Caste in Colonial Mexico''. Durham: Duke University Press 2003, p. 84.</ref> Intermarriage between Espa\u00f1oles and mestizos resulted in offspring designated ''[[castizo]]s'' (\"three-quarters white\"), and the marriage of a castizo/a to an Espa\u00f1ol/a resulted in the restoration of Espa\u00f1ol/a status to the offspring. Don Alonso O\u2019Crouley observed in Mexico (1774), \"If the mixed-blood is the offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian, the stigma [of race mixture] disappears at the third step in descent because it is held as systematic that a Spaniard and an Indian produce a mestizo; a mestizo and a Spaniard, a castizo; and a castizo and a Spaniard, a Spaniard. The admixture of Indian blood should not indeed be regarded as a blemish, since the provisions&nbsp; of law give the&nbsp; Indian all&nbsp; that he could wish for,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Philip II granted to mestizos the privilege of becoming priests. On this consideration is based&nbsp;the&nbsp;common estimation of&nbsp; descent&nbsp; from a&nbsp; union of&nbsp; Indian and European or creole Spaniard.\"<ref>Sr. Don Pedro Alonso O\u2019Crouley, ''A Description of the Kingdom of New Spain'' (1774),trans. and ed. Sean Galvin. San Francisco: John Howell Books, 1972, 20</ref>&nbsp; O\u2019Crouley states that the same process of restoration of racial purity does not occur over generations for European-African offspring marrying whites. \u201cFrom the union of a Spaniard and a Negro the mixed-blood&nbsp; retains&nbsp; the stigma for generations without losing the original quality of a mulato.\"<ref>O\u2019Crouley, \u201cA Description of the Kingdom of New Spain\u2019\u2019, p. 20</ref>\n\nThe Spanish colonial regime divided groups into two basic legal categories, the Republic of Indians (''Rep\u00fablica de Indios'') and the Republic of Spaniards (''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles'') comprised European whites (Espa\u00f1oles) and all other non-Indians.  Indians were free vassals of the crown, whose commoners paid tribute while indigenous elites were considered nobles and tribute exempt, as were mestizos. Indians were nominally protected by the crown, with non-Indians\u2014mestizos, blacks, and mulattoes\u2014forbidden to live in indigenous communities. Mestizos and Indians in Mexico habitually held each other in mutual antipathy. This was particularly the case with commoner Indians against mestizos, some of whom infiltrated their communities and became part of the ruling elite. Spanish authorities turned a blind eye to the mestizos' presence, since they collected commoners' tribute for the crown and came to hold offices. They were useful intermediaries for the colonial state between the Republic of Spaniards and the Republic of Indians.<ref>Lewis, ''Hall of Mirrors'', pp. 86-91.</ref>\n\nA person's legal racial classification in colonial Spanish America was closely tied to social status, wealth, culture and language use. Wealthy people paid to change or obscure their actual ancestry. Many indigenous people left their traditional villages and sought to be counted as mestizos to avoid tribute payments to the Spanish.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peter N. Stearns  |author2=William L.

The city was abandoned after Native repeatedly attacked and then resettled again in 1528, then completely abandoned and dismantled in 1545 and moved to modern day [[San Salvador]] City. The settlement resembles more of a fortified military base rather than a city. The historic census indicates that the city contained male Spaniards with many Mestizo children with Native American indigenous wives]]\n\nIn [[Central America]], intermarriage by European men with the Native American Indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]] and [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women of what is now [[El Salvador]] happened almost immediately after the arrival of the European [[Spaniards]] led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Other indigenous groups in the country such as [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Poqomam people]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Ch'orti' people]], [[Alaguilac]], [[Xinca people]], [[Mixe]] and [[Mangue language]] people became culturally extinct due to the Mestizo process or diseases brought by the Spaniards. Mestizo culture quickly became the most successful and dominant culture in El Salvador. The majority of Salvadorans in modern El Salvador identify themselves as 86.3% Mestizo roots.<ref>[http://www.digestyc.gob.sv/servers/redatam/htdocs/CPV2007S/Docs/RESULTADOS_FINALES.pdf Ethnic Groups -2007 official Census]. Page 13, Digestyc.gob.sv</ref>\n\nIn 1932, ruthless dictator [[Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez]] was responsible for La Matanza (\"The Slaughter\"), known as the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre]] in which the Native American indigenous people were murdered in an effort to wipe out the indigenous people in El Salvador during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Indigenous peoples, mostly of Lenca, Cacaopera and Pipil descent are still present in El Salvador in several communities, conserving their languages, customs, and traditions.\n\nThere is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000), mostly from [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Palestine]] (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent is around 27,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. Many of these Arab groups naturally mixed and contributed into the modern Salvadoran Mestizo population.\n\n[[Pardo]] is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have a significant African population due to many factors including El Salvador not having a Caribbean coast, and because of president [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]], who passed racial laws to keep Afros and other peoples out of El Salvador, though [[Afro-Salvadoran|Salvadorans with African ancestry]], called Pardos, were already present in El Salvador, the majority are tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans who largely cluster with the Mestizo population. They have been mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. A total of only 10,000 enslaved Africans were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. The enslaved Africans that were brought to El Salvador during the colonial times, eventually came to mix and merged into the much larger and vaster Mestizo mixed European Spanish/Native Indigenous population creating Pardo or Afromestizos who cluster with Mestizo people, contributing into the modern day Mestizo population in El Salvador, thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America.\n\nToday, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Native American indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages nor have an indigenous culture, also tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans, and Salvadoran of Arab descent, also identify themselves as culturally Salvadoran Mestizo by absorption.\n\n====Guatemala====\n{{See also|Demographics of Guatemala}}\nThe Ladino population in [[Guatemala]] is officially recognized as a distinct ethnic group, and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala uses the following definition: \n<blockquote>\"The ladino population has been characterized as a heterogeneous population which expresses itself in the Spanish language as a maternal language, which possesses specific cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with indigenous cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly considered as western.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minedoc.gob.gt/administracion/dependencias/centrales/ccre/ccre_interculturalidad.htm |title=Reflexiones sobre el mestizaje y la identidad nacional en Centroam\u00e9rica: de la colonia a las R\u00e9publicas liberales |access-date=28 July 2008 |author=Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n (MINEDUC) |authorlink= |year=2008 |website= |pages= |language=Spanish |doi= |quote= }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Spanish-speaking South America==\n\n===Argentina and Uruguay===\n{{main|Argentine people|Uruguayan people}}\nInitially colonial [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] had a predominately mestizo population like the rest of the Spanish colonies, but due to a flood of European migration in the 19th century and the repeated intermarriage with Europeans the mestizo population became a so-called {{lang|es|castizo}} population.

In Southern Chile, the Mapuche, were one of the only Amerindian tribes in the Americas that were in continuous conflict with the [[Spanish Empire]] and did not submit to a European power.\n\nA public health book from the [[University of Chile]] states that 30% of the population is of White origin; mestizos are estimated to amount to a total of 65%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%.

With the passage of time these Spanish conquerors and succeeding Spanish colonists sired offspring with the local Amerindian population, since Spanish immigration did not initially include many White females to the colonies. In a couple of generations a predominately mestizo population emerged in Ecuador with a drastically declining Amerindian Population due to European diseases and wars.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Afro-Ecuadorians]] ([[Zambos]] and [[Mulatto]]es), who are a minority in the country, can be found mostly in the [[Esmeraldas Province]], in the [[Valle del Chota]] of the [[Imbabura Province]], and as small communities of Afro-Ecuadorians living along the coastal areas as minorities.\n\nMestizos are by far the largest of all the ethnic groups, and comprise 71.9% of the current population. The next 28% of the population is comprised by four ethnic groups with about 7% each, the Montubios, Afro-Ecuadorian, Amerindian (Indigenous) and White.\n\n===Paraguay===\n{{main|Paraguayan people}}\nDuring the reign of [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], the first consul of [[Paraguay]] from 1811 to 1840, he imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos or Indians.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This was introduced to eliminate any sense of racial superiority, and also to end the predominantly Spanish influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo (although his paternal grandfather was [[Afro-Brazilian]]), but feared that racial superiority would create [[class division]] which would threaten his [[Autocracy|absolute rule]].\n\nAs a result of this, today 90% of Paraguay's population are mestizo, and the main language is the native [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], spoken by 60% of the population as a first language, with Spanish spoken as a first language by 40% of the population, and fluently spoken by 75%, making Paraguay one of the most bilingual countries in the world. Although it did not had the exposition to [[miscegenation]] as de Francia wanted, after the tremendous decline of male population as a result of the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], European male worker \u00e9migr\u00e9s mixed with the female mestizo population so as that pushed a middle class of mestizo background largely accepted as a configuration of the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Peru===\n[[File:Mestizo.

The Mixed Ethnicty Day, or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mesti\u00e7o), on 27 June, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Para\u00edba and a holyday in two cities.\n\nOne of the most notorious group is the {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown people), also informally known as {{lang|pt|moreno}} (tan skinned people; given its euphemism-like nature, it may be interpreted as offensive). They include mostly those of non-white skin color. Nevertheless, not all {{lang|pt|pardos}} are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}}. For example, an Amerindian (initially and most often {{lang|pt|\u00edndio}}, often more formally {{lang|pt|ind\u00edgena}}, rarely {{lang|pt|amer\u00edndio}}, an East Indian ({{lang|pt|indiano}})) or a Filipino may be initially described as {{lang|pt|pardo/parda}} (in opposition to {{lang|pt|branco}}, white, {{lang|pt|negro}}, Afro, and {{lang|pt|amarelo}}, yellow) if his or her ethnicity is unknown, and it is testified by the initial discovery reports of Portuguese navigators. In the same way, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}}, a term used to describe anyone with any degree of [[miscegenation]] in one's blood line, may apply to all said groups (that in Portugal and its ex-colonies, always depended solely on phenotype, meaning a brown person may have a full sibling of all other basic phenotypes and thus ethnic groups).\n\nImportant {{lang|pt|pardo}} groups in Brazil are the {{lang|pt|caboclos}} (largely contemporary usage) or {{lang|pt|mamelucos}} (largely archaic usage), the {{lang|pt|mulatos}}, and the {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The first group is composed of the culturally assimilated Amerindians as well as the ''brown-skinned'' descendants or children of both white or {{lang|pt|moreno}} (swarthy) people of otherwise White phenotype and Amerindians. They are an important group in the Northern (Amazon Basin) region, but also relatively numerous on the Northeastern and Center-Western ones. Then, those, neither Afro- nor fair-skinned, whose origins come from the admixture between White or {{lang|pt|morenos}} and Afros or {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The last group is composed of descendants of Amerindians or {{lang|pt|caboclos}} and Afros or other {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. Finally, those whose origins possess a notorious level of European ancestry and in which neither Amerindian nor African phenotypical traces are much more present than each other are sometimes known as {{lang|pt|ju\u00e7aras}}.\n\n[[File:Ronaldo-14-05-2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Brazilian footballer [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]]]\nThere are, however, important groups who are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} but not necessarily {{lang|pt|pardos}}. People of East Asian and non-Asian descent combined are known as {{lang|pt|ainokos}}, from the Japanese \"love (ai) child (ko)\" (also used for all children of illegitimate birth.  Mixed children are now largely referred to as \"half\" or [[h\u0101fu]]), though often, for those without contact with the term, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o de}} [East Asian nationality/ethnicity] may also be used. {{lang|pt|[[Sarar\u00e1]]s}} differ from {{lang|pt|mulatos}} at being fair-skinned (rather than brown-skinned), and having non-straight [[blond]] or [[red hair]].\n\nOther people who are not brown (and thus not {{lang|pt|pardo}}), but also their phenotypes by anything other than skin, hair and eye color do not match white ones but rather those of people of color may be just referred to as {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}}, without specification to skin color with an identitarian connotation (there are the distinctions, though, of {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o claro}}, for the fair-skinned ones, and {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o moreno}}, for those of olive skin tones). In Brazilian censuses, those people may choose to identify mostly with {{lang|pt|branco}} (White) or {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown) or leave the question on ethnic/color blank.\n\n===Lusophone Africa===\n\n====Angolan mesti\u00e7o====\nThe {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} are primarily of mixed European, [[Jus soli|native]] born [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Precolonial history of Angola|Angolan]] or other [[Sub-Saharan Africans#Sub-Saharan Africa|indigenous African]] lineages. They tend to be Portuguese culturally and to have full Portuguese names.\n\nAlthough they make up about two percent of the population, they are the socially elite and racially privileged group in the country. Historically, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} formed social and cultural allegiances with [[Colonial history of Angola|Portuguese colonists]] subsequently identifying with the Portuguese over and above their indigenous identities. Despite their loyalty, the ethnic group faced economic and political adversity at hands of the white population during times of economic hardship for whites. These actions lead to ostracizing Mesti\u00e7os from their inherited economic benefits which sparked the group to take a new sociopolitical direction.\n\nAcross the 500 year Portuguese presence in the country, the Mesti\u00e7o have retained their position of entitlement which is highly evident in the political, economic and [[Culture of Angola#Mesti\u00e7o|cultural]] hierarchy in present-day [[Angola]]. Their [[phenotype]] range is broad with a number of members possessing physical characteristics that are close to others within the indigenous Afro [[Demographics of Angola|non-mixed]] population. Since the Mesti\u00e7os are generally better educated than the rest of the indigenous Afro population, they exercise influence in government disproportionate to their numbers.\n\n====Bissau-Guinean mesti\u00e7o====\n1% of the population is of mixed African and Portuguese descent, [[Tamahaq language|Tamahaq]], and Arabic genetic influence ignored.\n\n====Mozambican mesti\u00e7o====\nA minority population of Mozambicans of mixed Bantu and Portuguese heritage.\n\n====Mesti\u00e7os of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe====\nMesti\u00e7os of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are descendants of Portuguese colonists and enslaved Africans brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola (these people also are known as {{lang|pt|filhos da terra}} or \"children of the land\").\n\n===Lusophone Asia===\n\n====Sri Lankan mesti\u00e7o====\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], the names [[Mesti\u00e7os (Sri Lanka)|''mesti\u00e7os'']] (Portuguese for \"mixed ethniicity\") or ''casados'' (\"married ones\") were applied to people of mixed Portuguese and Sri Lankan ([[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil people|Tamil]]) descent, starting in the 16th century.\n\n==French-speaking North America==\n\n===M\u00e9tis of Canada===\n{{Main|M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Indian Act}}\n[[File:Louis Riel.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Louis Riel]], Canadian M\u00e9tis.]]\nA [[French colonial empire|French Colonial empire]] in Canada, the M\u00e9tis are regarded as an independent ethnic group.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This community of descent consists of individuals descended from marriages of [[First Nation]] women, specifically [[Cree]], [[Ojibwa]]y, and [[Saulteaux]] with Europeans, usually [[French Canadian|French]], [[English Canadian|English]], and [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]] [[Engag\u00e9|laborers]] or merchants employed in the [[Fur Trade|North American Fur Trade]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} Their history dates to the mid 17th century, and they have been recognized as a distinct people since the early 18th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nTraditionally, the M\u00e9tis spoke a mixed language called [[Michif]] (with various regional dialects).

''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 247.</ref> In the modern era, it is used to denote the positive unity of race mixtures in modern Latin America. This ideological stance is in contrast to the term [[miscegenation]], which usually has negative connotations.<ref>Lewis, Stephen. \"Mestizaje\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 840.</ref>  The main ideological advocate of mestizaje was [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] (1882\u20131959), the Mexican Minister of Education in the 1920s. The term was in circulation in Mexico in the late nineteenth century, along with similar terms, ''cruzamiento'' (\"crossing\") and ''mestizaci\u00f3n'' (process of \"mestizo-izing\"). In Spanish America, the colonial-era system of castas sought to differentiate between individuals and groups on the basis of a hierarchical classification by ancestry, skin color, and status (''calidad''), giving separate labels to the perceived categorical differences and privileging whiteness. In contrast, the idea of modern ''mestizaje'' is the positive unity of a nation's citizenry based on racial mixture. \"Mestizaje placed greater emphasis [than the casta system] on commonality and hybridity to engineer order and unity\u2026 [it] operated within the context of the nation-state and sought to derive meaning from Latin America\u2019s own internal experiences rather than the dictates and necessities of empire... ultimately [it] embraced racial mixture.\"<ref>Vinson, Ben III. ''Before Mestizaje''. New York: Cambridge University Press 2018, pp. 61-2.</ref>\n\n===Mestizaje as an ideology in modern Mexico===\nAt independence in Mexico, the casta classifications were abolished, but discrimination based on skin color and socioeconomic status continued.  Liberal intellectuals grappled with the \u201cIndian Problem,\u201d that is the Indians\u2019 lack of cultural assimilation to Mexican national life as citizens of the nation rather than members of their indigenous communities. Urban elites spurned mixed-race urban plebeians and Indians along with their traditional popular culture. In the late nineteenth century during the rule of [[Porfiriato|Porfirio D\u00edaz]], elites\u2019 sought to be, act, and look like modern Europeans, that is, different from the majority of the Mexican population.  D\u00edaz was mixed race himself, but powdered his dark skin to hide his Mixtec indigenous ancestry.   At the end of the nineteenth century, however, as social and economic tensions increased in Mexico, two major works by Mexican intellectuals sought to rehabilitate the assessment of the mestizo. D\u00edaz\u2019s Minister of Education, [[Justo Sierra]] published ''The Political Evolution of the Mexican People'' (1902), which situated Mexican identity in the mixing of European whites and Indians. Mexicans are \"the sons of two peoples, of two races. [This fact] dominates our whole history; to this we owe our soul.\"<ref>Sierra, Justo. ''The Political Evolution of the Mexican People\u2019\u2019. Trans. Charles Ramsdell. Austin: University of Texas Press.  P. xvii.</ref>  Intellectual [[Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez]] also took a revisionist stance on mestizos in his work ''Los grandes problemas nacionales'' (The Great National Problems) (1909).  \n\nThe Mexican state after the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910\u201320) embraced the ideology of mestizaje as a nation-building tool, aimed at integrating Indians culturally and politically in the construction of national identity. As such it has meant a systematic effort to eliminate indigenous culture, in the name of integrating them into a supposedly inclusive mestizo identity.  For [[Afro-Mexicans]],  the ideology has denied their historical contributions to Mexico and their current place in Mexican political life. Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of \"mestizaje\" (the process of ethnic homogenization).<ref>{{cite book |last=Wade |first=Peter |year=1997 |title=Race and Ethnicity in Latin America |location=Chicago |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=978-0-7453-0987-3 |page=32 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910\u20131940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870\u20131940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/78 78\u201385] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73856-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/78 }}</ref>\n\nCultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to \"help\" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the Mestizo society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  \n\nIn recent years, mestizos\u2019 sole claim to Mexican national identity has begun to erode, at least rhetorically.\"<ref>Lewis, \"Mestizaje', p. 841.</ref>  A constitutional changes to Article 4 that now says that the \"Mexican Nation has a pluricultural composition, originally based on its indigenous peoples.
