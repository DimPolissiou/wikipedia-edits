Following the 18-year rule of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Andropov served in the post from November 1982 until his death in February 1984.\n\nEarlier in his career, Andropov served as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary from 1954 to 1957, during which time he was involved in the suppression of the [[1956 Hungarian Uprising]]. He was named Chairman of the KGB on 10 May 1967. In this position,  he oversaw a massive crackdown on dissent that was carried out via mass arrests and the wholesale application of involuntary psychiatric [[Involuntary commitment|commitment]] of people deemed \"socially undesirable\". As Brezhnev's health declined during the latter years of his leadership, Andropov formed a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union#List of troikas|troika]] alongside Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] and Defense Minister [[Dmitry Ustinov]] that ultimately came to dominate Soviet policy.\n\nUpon Brezhnev's death on 10 November 1982, Yuri Andropov succeeded him as General Secretary and (by extension) [[leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]]. During his short tenure, Andropov sought to eliminate corruption and inefficiency within the Soviet system by investigating longtime officials for violations of party discipline and criminalizing truancy in the workplace. The Cold War intensified,  and he was at a loss for how to handle the growing crisis in the Soviet economy. His major long-term impact was bringing to the fore a new generation of young reformers, as energetic as himself,  including [[Yegor Ligachyov]], [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and, most important, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>Mauricio Borrero, \"Andropov, Yuri Vladimirovich 1914\u20131984.\" ''Encyclopedia of Modern Dictators'' (2006), pp. 7\u201310.</ref>  However, upon suffering [[kidney failure]] in February 1983, Andropov's health began to deteriorate rapidly.

In his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] recalled that when Andropov was the leader, Gorbachev and [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], the chairman of [[Gosplan]], asked him for access to real budget figures. \"You are asking too much,\" Andropov responded. \"The budget is off limits to you.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Gorbachev, Mikhail|title=Memoirs|date=1996|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0385480192|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsgorb00gorb/page/147 147]|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsgorb00gorb/page/147}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-corruption campaign====\nIn contrast to Brezhnev's policy of avoiding conflicts and dismissals, he began to fight violations of party, state and labour discipline, which led to significant personnel changes during an anti-corruption campaign against many of Brezhnev's cronies.<ref name=\"Century Communism 2010\"/> During 15 months in office, Andropov dismissed 18 ministers and 37 first secretaries of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|obkoms]], kraikoms and Central Committees of Communist Parties of Soviet Republics, and [[criminal case]]s against high level party and state officials were started. Biographers including Solovyov and Klepikova (1983) and Zhores Medvedev (1983) have discussed the complex possibilities underlying the motivations of anti-corruption campaigning in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and early 1980s: at the same time that it is true that Andropov fought corruption for moral, ethical, ascetic, and ideological reasons, it is also true that it was an effective way for party members from the police and security organizations to defeat competitors for power at the senior levels of the party. Thus Andropov himself, as well as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s including [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], could advance their own power by the same efforts that also promised to be better for the country in terms of justice, economic performance, and even defense readiness (which depended on economic performance). Thus there was a certain inevitable amount of \"what's better for the country also happens to align with what's best for my own power.\" It is not possible to measure the exact balance of self-interest versus selfless altruism and patriotism in this equation. Part of the complexity is that in the Brezhnev era, much corruption was implicitly tolerated and was pervasive (although officially denied), and many a member of the police and security organizations themselves participated in it to various degrees, but only those organizations had access to the power to measure it and monitor its details. In such an environment, anti-corruption campaigning is inherently a path by which police and security people have the potential or opportunity to appear to be white-hat heroes cleaning up the malfeasance of black-hat villains and 'coincidentally' increasing their own power, whereas there may be an underlying reality of one set of gray-hat [[antihero]]es defeating another set of gray-hat antiheroes in a [[wikt:grey area|morally gray]] power struggle. This complex dynamic is perennial; 21st-century anti-corruption campaigns are just as subject to its possibilities as were 20th-century instances.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Anti kernwapendemonstratie in Den Haag ( 550 duizend deelnemers ) overzichten m, Bestanddeelnr 253-8819.jpg|thumb|Protest against the [[nuclear arms race]] between the U.S./NATO and the Soviet Union, [[The Hague]], Netherlands, 1983]]\nAndropov faced a series of foreign policy crises: the hopeless situation of the Soviet army in Afghanistan, threatened revolt in Poland, growing animosity with China, the polarization threat of war in the Middle East, Troubles in Ethiopia and South Africa. The most critical threat was the \"Second Cold War\" launched by American President Ronald Reagan and a specific attack on rolling back what he denounced as the \"[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]\". Reagan was using American economic power, and Soviet economic weakness, to escalate massive spending on the [[Cold War]], emphasizing high technology that Moscow lacked.<ref>Lawrence T. Caldwell, and Robert Legvold, \"Reagan through Soviet eyes.\" ''Foreign Policy'' 52 (1983): 3-21 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148230 Online].</ref> The main response was raising the military budget to 70 percent of the national budget, and supplying billions of dollars worth of military aid to Syria, Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, the PLO, Cuba, and North Korea. That included tanks and armored troop carriers, hundreds of fighter planes, as well as anti-aircraft systems, artillery systems, and all sorts of high tech equipment for which the USSR was the main supplier for its allies. Andropov's main goal was to avoid an open war.<ref>Dimitri Volkogonov, ''Autopsy for an empire''  (1998) pp 358\u2013360.</ref><ref>Taylor Downing, ''Reagan, Andropov, and a World on the Brink'' (2018) pp. 34\u201350.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Steele|title=Soviet Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYqQYs8lnWQC&pg=PA4|year=1984|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=4\u20135|isbn=9780671528133}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|conflict in Afghanistan]] continued even though Andropov, who now felt the invasion was a mistake, half-heartedly explored options for a negotiated withdrawal. Andropov's rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the [[United States]]. During a much-publicized \"walk in the woods\" with Soviet dignitary Yuli Kvitsinsky, American diplomat [[Paul Nitze]] suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in Europe on both sides that was ultimately ignored by the Politburo.<ref>{{cite book |last=Matlock |first=Jack F., Jr. |title=Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2005|location=New York |pages=41\u201346 |isbn=978-0-8129-7489-8}}</ref> Kvitsinsky would later write that, despite his own efforts, the Soviet leadership was not interested in compromise, instead calculating that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kwizinskij|first=Julij A. |title=Vor dem Sturm: Erinnerungen eines Diplomaten |publisher=Siedler Verlag |year=1993 |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-88680-464-1}}</ref> On 8 March 1983, during Andropov's reign as General Secretary, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] famously labeled the Soviet Union an \"[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]\". The same month, on 23 March, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. Reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defence would be \"consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty\". However, Andropov was dismissive of this claim, and said that \"It is time they [Washington] stopped ... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war. ... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane\".<ref>''[[Pravda]]'', 27 March 1983</ref>\n\nIn August 1983, Andropov made an announcement that the country was stopping all work on space-based weapons. One of his most notable acts during his short time as leader of the Soviet Union was in response to a letter from a 10-year-old American child from Maine named [[Samantha Smith]], inviting her to the Soviet Union. She came, but he was too ill to meet with her, thus revealing his grave condition to the world. Meanwhile, Soviet\u2013U.S. arms control talks on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe were suspended by the Soviet Union in November 1983 and by the end of the year, the Soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|title=Person of the Year 1983: Ronald Reagan and Yuri Andropov|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=1 January 1984 |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1983.html|accessdate=2 January 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:1981-09-15 12-00-00 United States Hawaii Aliamanu 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|A photograph of Korean Air Lines HL7442, the airliner shot down by Soviet aircraft after drifting into [[prohibited airspace]] during the KAL 007 Flight.]]\nMassive bad publicity worldwide came when Soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner, [[Korean Air Flight KAL-007]], which carried 269 passengers and crew. It had strayed over the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 on its scheduled route from Anchorage, Alaska, US to Seoul, South Korea. Andropov kept secret the fact that the Soviet Union held in its possession the [[Flight recorder|black box]] from KAL 007 which proved the pilot had made a typographical error when entering data in the automatic pilot. Soviet air defence system was unprepared to deal with a civilian airliner, and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question.<ref>Jonathan Haslam,  \"The KAL shootdown (1983) and the state of Soviet air defence.\" ''Intelligence and National Security'' 3.4 (1988): 128\u2013133.</ref> Instead of admitting an accident, Soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a Western provocation. Together with the low credibility created by the poor explanation in 1986 of the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises; the propaganda system was only useful for individuals and states that were aligned with the Soviet Union. Both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures, compounded by human error.<ref>Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, \"KAL 007 and Chernobyl: The Soviet management of crises.\" Survival 29.3 (1987): 215\u2013223.</ref>\n\n==Death and funeral==\n[[File:Reagan at the USSR Embassy.jpg|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] signing condolence book on death of Andropov at the Soviet Embassy]]\nIn February 1983, Andropov suffered total [[kidney failure]].

He died on 9 February 1984 at 16:50 in his hospital room at age 69.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/world/andropov-dead-moscow-69-reagan-asks-productive-contacts-names-bush-attend.html|title=Andropov is Dead in Moscow at 69; Reagan Asks 'Productive Contacts' and Names Bush to Attend Funeral|last=Burns|first=John F.|date=11 February 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=11 July 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Few of the top Soviet leaders, not even all the Politburo members, learned of his death on that day. According to the Soviet post mortem medical report, Andropov suffered from several medical conditions: [[interstitial nephritis]], [[nephrosclerosis]], residual [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes]], which were worsened by chronic kidney deficiency.\n\nA four-day period of nationwide mourning was announced. Andropov was succeeded by [[Konstantin Chernenko]], who seemed to mirror Andropov's tenure. Chernenko had already been afflicted with severe health problems when he ascended to the USSR's top spot, and served an even shorter time in office (13 months). Like Andropov, Chernenko spent much of his time hospitalized, and also died in office, in March 1985.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n\nAndropov lived at 26 [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt]], the same building in which Suslov and Brezhnev also lived. He was first married to Nina Ivanovna; she was born not far from the local farm in which Andropov was born. In 1983 she was diagnosed with [[cancer]] and underwent a successful operation. He met his second wife, Tatyana Filipovna, during World War II on the [[Karelian Front]] when she was Komsomol secretary. She had suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. Andropov's chief guard informed Tatyana about the death of her husband. She was too grief-stricken to join in the procession and during the funeral her relatives helped her to walk. Before the lid could be closed on Andropov's coffin, she bent to kiss him. She touched his hair and then kissed him again. In 1985, a respectful 75-minute film was broadcast in which Tatyana (not even seen in public until Andropov's funeral) reads love poems written by her husband. Tatyana became ill and died in November 1991.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[image:Yuri andropov grave in the kremlin wall necropolis july 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Grave of Andropov at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]], Moscow.]]\nAndropov's legacy remains the subject of much debate in Russia and elsewhere, both among scholars and in the popular media. He remains the focus of television documentaries and popular non-fiction, particularly around important anniversaries. As KGB head, Andropov was ruthless against dissent, and author [[David Remnick]], who covered the Soviet Union for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in the 1980s, called Andropov \"profoundly corrupt, a beast\".<ref name=\"D\">Remnick, David, ''Lenin's Tomb:The Last Days of the Soviet Empire''. New York; Random House, 1993, p. 191.</ref> [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], later an advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev and the ideologist of [[perestroika]], said: \"In a way I always thought Andropov was the most dangerous of all of them, simply because he was smarter than the rest.\"<ref name=\"D\"/> However, it was Andropov himself who recalled Yakovlev back to high office in Moscow in 1983 after a ten-year exile as ambassador to Canada after attacking Russian chauvinism. Yakovlev was also a close colleague of Andropov associate KGB General [[Yevgeny Primakov]], later [[Prime Minister of Russia]]. Andropov began to follow a trend of replacing elderly officials with considerably younger replacements.\n\nAccording to his former subordinate [[Securitate]] general [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]],\n\n<blockquote>In the West, if Andropov is remembered at all, it is for his brutal suppression of political dissidence at home and for his role in planning the [[Prague Spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. By contrast, the leaders of the former [[Warsaw Pact]] intelligence community, when I was one of them, looked up to Andropov as the man who substituted the KGB for the Communist party in governing the Soviet Union, and who was the godfather of Russia's new era of deception operations aimed at improving the badly damaged image of Soviet rulers in the West.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/pacepa200409200814.asp No Peter the Great. Vladimir Putin is in the Andropov mold], by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], ''[[National Review]]'', 20 September 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite Andropov's hard-line stance in [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungary]] and the numerous banishments and intrigues for which he was responsible during his long tenure as head of the KGB, he has become widely regarded by many commentators as a reformer, especially in comparison with the [[stagnation (USSR)|stagnation]] and corruption during the later years of his predecessor, Leonid Brezhnev. Andropov, \"a throwback to a tradition of Leninist asceticism\",<ref name = \"D\"/> was appalled by the corruption during Brezhnev's regime, and ordered investigations and arrests of the most flagrant abusers. The investigations were so frightening that several members of Brezhnev's circle \"shot, gassed or otherwise did away with themselves.\"<ref name=\"D\"/> He was certainly generally regarded as inclined to more gradual and constructive reform than was Gorbachev; most of the speculation centres around whether Andropov would have reformed the USSR in a manner which did not result in its [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|eventual dissolution]].\n\nThe Western media favored Andropov because of his supposed passion for Western music and scotch.<ref>Suny, Ronald Grigor, ''The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the successor states'' Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 449.</ref> However, these were unproven rumours. It is also questionable whether Andropov spoke any English at all.<ref>Edward Jay Epstein [http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/andropov.htm The Andropov Hoax] ''The New Republic'' 7 February 1983</ref> The short time he spent as leader, much of it in a state of extreme ill health, leaves debaters few concrete indications as to the nature of any [[alternate history (fiction)|hypothetical]] extended rule. The 2002 Tom Clancy novel ''[[Red Rabbit]]'' focuses heavily on Andropov during his tenure of KGB chief, when his health is slightly better. It mirrors his secrecy in that British and American intelligence know little about him, not even able to confirm he was a married man. The novel also depicts Andropov as being a fan of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboros]] and [[starka]] vodka, almost never available to ordinary Soviet citizens.\n\n==Attitudes to Andropov==\nIn a message read out at the opening of a new exhibition dedicated to Andropov, [[Vladimir Putin]] called him \"a man of talent with great abilities.\"<ref>{{cite news|author =Miletitch, Nicolas|title=Andropov birth centenary evokes nostalgia for Soviet hardliner|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Arts-and-Ent/Culture/2014/Jul-29/265406-andropov-birth-centenary-evokes-nostalgia-for-soviet-hardliner.ashx|work=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)]]|date=29 July 2014}}</ref> Putin has praised Andropov's \"honesty and uprightness.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Putin puts Yuri Andropov back on his pedestal|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/putin-puts-yuri-andropov-back-on-his-pedestal-1.1145047|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=16 June 2004}}</ref> According to Russian historian [[Nikita Petrov]], \"He was a typical Soviet jailer who violated human rights.

Following the 18-year rule of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Andropov served in the post from November 1982 until his death in February 1984.\n\nEarlier in his career, Andropov served as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary from 1954 to 1957, during which time he was involved in the suppression of the [[1956 Hungarian Uprising]]. He was named Chairman of the KGB on 10 May 1967. In this position,  he oversaw a massive crackdown on dissent that was carried out via mass arrests and the wholesale application of involuntary psychiatric [[Involuntary commitment|commitment]] of people deemed \"socially undesirable\". As Brezhnev's health declined during the latter years of his leadership, Andropov formed a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union#List of troikas|troika]] alongside Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] and Defense Minister [[Dmitry Ustinov]] that ultimately came to dominate Soviet policy.\n\nUpon Brezhnev's death on 10 November 1982, Yuri Andropov succeeded him as General Secretary and (by extension) [[leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]]. During his short tenure, Andropov sought to eliminate corruption and inefficiency within the Soviet system by investigating longtime officials for violations of party discipline and criminalizing truancy in the workplace. The Cold War intensified,  and he was at a loss for how to handle the growing crisis in the Soviet economy. His major long-term impact was bringing to the fore a new generation of young reformers, as energetic as himself,  including [[Yegor Ligachyov]], [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and, most important, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>Mauricio Borrero, \"Andropov, Yuri Vladimirovich 1914\u20131984.\" ''Encyclopedia of Modern Dictators'' (2006), pp. 7\u201310.</ref>  However, upon suffering [[kidney failure]] in February 1983, Andropov's health began to deteriorate rapidly.

Chernenko handled espionage, KGB, the Interior Ministry, party organs, ideology, and organizational matters, as well as propaganda, culture, science, and higher education.

In his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] recalled that when Andropov was the leader, Gorbachev and [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], the chairman of [[Gosplan]], asked him for access to real budget figures. \"You are asking too much,\" Andropov responded. \"The budget is off limits to you.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Gorbachev, Mikhail|title=Memoirs|date=1996|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0385480192|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsgorb00gorb/page/147 147]|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsgorb00gorb/page/147}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-corruption campaign====\nIn contrast to Brezhnev's policy of avoiding conflicts and dismissals, he began to fight violations of party, state and labour discipline, which led to significant personnel changes during an anti-corruption campaign against many of Brezhnev's cronies.<ref name=\"Century Communism 2010\"/> During 15 months in office, Andropov dismissed 18 ministers and 37 first secretaries of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|obkoms]], kraikoms and Central Committees of Communist Parties of Soviet Republics, and [[criminal case]]s against high level party and state officials were started. Biographers including Solovyov and Klepikova (1983) and Zhores Medvedev (1983) have discussed the complex possibilities underlying the motivations of anti-corruption campaigning in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and early 1980s: at the same time that it is true that Andropov fought corruption for moral, ethical, ascetic, and ideological reasons, it is also true that it was an effective way for party members from the police and security organizations to defeat competitors for power at the senior levels of the party. Thus Andropov himself, as well as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s including [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], could advance their own power by the same efforts that also promised to be better for the country in terms of justice, economic performance, and even defense readiness (which depended on economic performance). Thus there was a certain inevitable amount of \"what's better for the country also happens to align with what's best for my own power.\" It is not possible to measure the exact balance of self-interest versus selfless altruism and patriotism in this equation. Part of the complexity is that in the Brezhnev era, much corruption was implicitly tolerated and was pervasive (although officially denied), and many a member of the police and security organizations themselves participated in it to various degrees, but only those organizations had access to the power to measure it and monitor its details. In such an environment, anti-corruption campaigning is inherently a path by which police and security people have the potential or opportunity to appear to be white-hat heroes cleaning up the malfeasance of black-hat villains and 'coincidentally' increasing their own power, whereas there may be an underlying reality of one set of gray-hat [[antihero]]es defeating another set of gray-hat antiheroes in a [[wikt:grey area|morally gray]] power struggle. This complex dynamic is perennial; 21st-century anti-corruption campaigns are just as subject to its possibilities as were 20th-century instances.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Anti kernwapendemonstratie in Den Haag ( 550 duizend deelnemers ) overzichten m, Bestanddeelnr 253-8819.jpg|thumb|Protest against the [[nuclear arms race]] between the U.S./NATO and the Soviet Union, [[The Hague]], Netherlands, 1983]]\nAndropov faced a series of foreign policy crises: the hopeless situation of the Soviet army in Afghanistan, threatened revolt in Poland, growing animosity with China, the polarization threat of war in the Middle East, Troubles in Ethiopia and South Africa. The most critical threat was the \"Second Cold War\" launched by American President Ronald Reagan and a specific attack on rolling back what he denounced as the \"[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]\". Reagan was using American economic power, and Soviet economic weakness, to escalate massive spending on the [[Cold War]], emphasizing high technology that Moscow lacked.<ref>Lawrence T. Caldwell, and Robert Legvold, \"Reagan through Soviet eyes.\" ''Foreign Policy'' 52 (1983): 3-21 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148230 Online].</ref> The main response was raising the military budget to 70 percent of the national budget, and supplying billions of dollars worth of military aid to Syria, Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, the PLO, Cuba, and North Korea. That included tanks and armored troop carriers, hundreds of fighter planes, as well as anti-aircraft systems, artillery systems, and all sorts of high tech equipment for which the USSR was the main supplier for its allies. Andropov's main goal was to avoid an open war.<ref>Dimitri Volkogonov, ''Autopsy for an empire''  (1998) pp 358\u2013360.</ref><ref>Taylor Downing, ''Reagan, Andropov, and a World on the Brink'' (2018) pp. 34\u201350.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Steele|title=Soviet Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYqQYs8lnWQC&pg=PA4|year=1984|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=4\u20135|isbn=9780671528133}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|conflict in Afghanistan]] continued even though Andropov, who now felt the invasion was a mistake, half-heartedly explored options for a negotiated withdrawal. Andropov's rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the [[United States]]. During a much-publicized \"walk in the woods\" with Soviet dignitary Yuli Kvitsinsky, American diplomat [[Paul Nitze]] suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in Europe on both sides that was ultimately ignored by the Politburo.<ref>{{cite book |last=Matlock |first=Jack F., Jr. |title=Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2005|location=New York |pages=41\u201346 |isbn=978-0-8129-7489-8}}</ref> Kvitsinsky would later write that, despite his own efforts, the Soviet leadership was not interested in compromise, instead calculating that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kwizinskij|first=Julij A. |title=Vor dem Sturm: Erinnerungen eines Diplomaten |publisher=Siedler Verlag |year=1993 |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-88680-464-1}}</ref> On 8 March 1983, during Andropov's reign as General Secretary, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] famously labeled the Soviet Union an \"[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]\". The same month, on 23 March, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. Reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defence would be \"consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty\". However, Andropov was dismissive of this claim, and said that \"It is time they [Washington] stopped ... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war. ... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane\".<ref>''[[Pravda]]'', 27 March 1983</ref>\n\nIn August 1983, Andropov made an announcement that the country was stopping all work on space-based weapons. One of his most notable acts during his short time as leader of the Soviet Union was in response to a letter from a 10-year-old American child from Maine named [[Samantha Smith]], inviting her to the Soviet Union. She came, but he was too ill to meet with her, thus revealing his grave condition to the world. Meanwhile, Soviet\u2013U.S. arms control talks on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe were suspended by the Soviet Union in November 1983 and by the end of the year, the Soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|title=Person of the Year 1983: Ronald Reagan and Yuri Andropov|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=1 January 1984 |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1983.html|accessdate=2 January 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:1981-09-15 12-00-00 United States Hawaii Aliamanu 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|A photograph of Korean Air Lines HL7442, the airliner shot down by Soviet aircraft after drifting into [[prohibited airspace]] during the KAL 007 Flight.]]\nMassive bad publicity worldwide came when Soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner, [[Korean Air Flight KAL-007]], which carried 269 passengers and crew. It had strayed over the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 on its scheduled route from Anchorage, Alaska, US to Seoul, South Korea. Andropov kept secret the fact that the Soviet Union held in its possession the [[Flight recorder|black box]] from KAL 007 which proved the pilot had made a typographical error when entering data in the automatic pilot. Soviet air defence system was unprepared to deal with a civilian airliner, and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question.<ref>Jonathan Haslam,  \"The KAL shootdown (1983) and the state of Soviet air defence.\" ''Intelligence and National Security'' 3.4 (1988): 128\u2013133.</ref> Instead of admitting an accident, Soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a Western provocation. Together with the low credibility created by the poor explanation in 1986 of the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises; the propaganda system was only useful for individuals and states that were aligned with the Soviet Union. Both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures, compounded by human error.<ref>Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, \"KAL 007 and Chernobyl: The Soviet management of crises.\" Survival 29.3 (1987): 215\u2013223.</ref>\n\n==Death and funeral==\n[[File:Reagan at the USSR Embassy.jpg|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] signing condolence book on death of Andropov at the Soviet Embassy]]\nIn February 1983, Andropov suffered total [[kidney failure]]. In August 1983, he entered the Central Clinical Hospital in western Moscow on a permanent basis, where he would spend the remainder of his life.\n\nIn late January 1984, Andropov's health deteriorated sharply and due to growing [[Kidney failure|toxicity in his blood]], he had periods of falling consciousness. He died on 9 February 1984 at 16:50 in his hospital room at age 69.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/world/andropov-dead-moscow-69-reagan-asks-productive-contacts-names-bush-attend.html|title=Andropov is Dead in Moscow at 69; Reagan Asks 'Productive Contacts' and Names Bush to Attend Funeral|last=Burns|first=John F.|date=11 February 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=11 July 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Few of the top Soviet leaders, not even all the Politburo members, learned of his death on that day. According to the Soviet post mortem medical report, Andropov suffered from several medical conditions: [[interstitial nephritis]], [[nephrosclerosis]], residual [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes]], which were worsened by chronic kidney deficiency.\n\nA four-day period of nationwide mourning was announced. Andropov was succeeded by [[Konstantin Chernenko]], who seemed to mirror Andropov's tenure. Chernenko had already been afflicted with severe health problems when he ascended to the USSR's top spot, and served an even shorter time in office (13 months). Like Andropov, Chernenko spent much of his time hospitalized, and also died in office, in March 1985.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n\nAndropov lived at 26 [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt]], the same building in which Suslov and Brezhnev also lived. He was first married to Nina Ivanovna; she was born not far from the local farm in which Andropov was born. In 1983 she was diagnosed with [[cancer]] and underwent a successful operation. He met his second wife, Tatyana Filipovna, during World War II on the [[Karelian Front]] when she was Komsomol secretary. She had suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. Andropov's chief guard informed Tatyana about the death of her husband. She was too grief-stricken to join in the procession and during the funeral her relatives helped her to walk. Before the lid could be closed on Andropov's coffin, she bent to kiss him. She touched his hair and then kissed him again. In 1985, a respectful 75-minute film was broadcast in which Tatyana (not even seen in public until Andropov's funeral) reads love poems written by her husband. Tatyana became ill and died in November 1991.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[image:Yuri andropov grave in the kremlin wall necropolis july 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Grave of Andropov at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]], Moscow.]]\nAndropov's legacy remains the subject of much debate in Russia and elsewhere, both among scholars and in the popular media. He remains the focus of television documentaries and popular non-fiction, particularly around important anniversaries. As KGB head, Andropov was ruthless against dissent, and author [[David Remnick]], who covered the Soviet Union for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in the 1980s, called Andropov \"profoundly corrupt, a beast\".<ref name=\"D\">Remnick, David, ''Lenin's Tomb:The Last Days of the Soviet Empire''. New York; Random House, 1993, p. 191.</ref> [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], later an advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev and the ideologist of [[perestroika]], said: \"In a way I always thought Andropov was the most dangerous of all of them, simply because he was smarter than the rest.\"<ref name=\"D\"/> However, it was Andropov himself who recalled Yakovlev back to high office in Moscow in 1983 after a ten-year exile as ambassador to Canada after attacking Russian chauvinism. Yakovlev was also a close colleague of Andropov associate KGB General [[Yevgeny Primakov]], later [[Prime Minister of Russia]]. Andropov began to follow a trend of replacing elderly officials with considerably younger replacements.\n\nAccording to his former subordinate [[Securitate]] general [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]],\n\n<blockquote>In the West, if Andropov is remembered at all, it is for his brutal suppression of political dissidence at home and for his role in planning the [[Prague Spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. By contrast, the leaders of the former [[Warsaw Pact]] intelligence community, when I was one of them, looked up to Andropov as the man who substituted the KGB for the Communist party in governing the Soviet Union, and who was the godfather of Russia's new era of deception operations aimed at improving the badly damaged image of Soviet rulers in the West.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/pacepa200409200814.asp No Peter the Great. Vladimir Putin is in the Andropov mold], by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], ''[[National Review]]'', 20 September 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite Andropov's hard-line stance in [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungary]] and the numerous banishments and intrigues for which he was responsible during his long tenure as head of the KGB, he has become widely regarded by many commentators as a reformer, especially in comparison with the [[stagnation (USSR)|stagnation]] and corruption during the later years of his predecessor, Leonid Brezhnev. Andropov, \"a throwback to a tradition of Leninist asceticism\",<ref name = \"D\"/> was appalled by the corruption during Brezhnev's regime, and ordered investigations and arrests of the most flagrant abusers. The investigations were so frightening that several members of Brezhnev's circle \"shot, gassed or otherwise did away with themselves.\"<ref name=\"D\"/> He was certainly generally regarded as inclined to more gradual and constructive reform than was Gorbachev; most of the speculation centres around whether Andropov would have reformed the USSR in a manner which did not result in its [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|eventual dissolution]].\n\nThe Western media favored Andropov because of his supposed passion for Western music and scotch.<ref>Suny, Ronald Grigor, ''The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the successor states'' Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 449.</ref> However, these were unproven rumours. It is also questionable whether Andropov spoke any English at all.<ref>Edward Jay Epstein [http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/andropov.htm The Andropov Hoax] ''The New Republic'' 7 February 1983</ref> The short time he spent as leader, much of it in a state of extreme ill health, leaves debaters few concrete indications as to the nature of any [[alternate history (fiction)|hypothetical]] extended rule. The 2002 Tom Clancy novel ''[[Red Rabbit]]'' focuses heavily on Andropov during his tenure of KGB chief, when his health is slightly better. It mirrors his secrecy in that British and American intelligence know little about him, not even able to confirm he was a married man.

The Japanese relied on the vast Polish network of spies, and allowed the Poles to openly place their agents inside embassies of its protectorate of Manchukuo. The military cooperation was so close, that in fact the Japanese ambassador was one of the people involved in smuggling of a Polish flag made for the London-based Polish Air Squadron. Before the war, Japan wanted Poland to join the Axis countries. At the time of signing the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact and attack on Poland, Japan declared that from now on she would never trust Hitler anymore and would only use him for her own purposes, so as not to help Nazi Germany in the war with the Soviets at the end of the war.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], despite being allied with [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Empire of Japan]] along with [[Italy]]  did not support diplomatically  the Nazi invasion of Poland and the  Japanese  actively supported the Polish government in exile. This decision was dictated by the Japanese distrust of their Nazi ally, who made a secret pact with the [[Soviet Union]]. Thus, the Japanese government decided to continue to rely on Polish spies even after a formal declaration of war by Poland, which was rejected by prime minister Tojo Hideki under the pretense that the Polish Government in Exile was  forced to issue it in compliance with its alliance to both the United Kingdom and the US and that made the declaration legally void this ensured co-operation between the two intelligence services in gathering information on both the Soviet Union and Third Reich. The Japanese agents in Europe during the World War II continued to support the  Polish struggle for freedom against [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] as far as the Japanese interests went, and sheltered Polish-Jewish refugees fleeing occupation from both German and Soviet forces, though at first it was done against the orders from Tokyo, by  Sugihara who only after proving to the Japanese authorities that the refugees would only be traveling through Japan to the US, gained the full legal acceptance and assistance from the Government of Japan. Throughout this whole secret alliance, the Japanese never used the Polish spy network to obtain information on Polish western allies.

Marx wrote:\n\n\"This primitive accumulation plays in [[political economy]] about the same part as original sin in theology. Adam bit the apple, and thereupon sin fell on the human race. Its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone-by there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and, above all, frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, and more, in riotous living. (...) Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins.

They see primitive accumulation as a process happening in the transition from the feudal \"stage\" to the capitalist \"stage\". {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nHowever, this can be seen as a misrepresentation of both Marx's ideas and historical reality, since feudal-type economies exist in various parts of the world, even in the 21st century.\n\nMarx's story of primitive accumulation is best seen as a ''special'' case of the ''general'' principle of capitalist market expansion. In part, trade grows incrementally, but usually the establishment of capitalist [[relations of production]] involves force and violence; transforming property relations means that assets previously owned by some people are no longer owned by them, but by other people, and making people part with their assets in this way involves coercion.\n\nIn his preface to [[Das Kapital]] Vol. 1, Marx writes \"The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future\". The less developed countries ''also'' face a process of primitive accumulation, it is an ongoing process of [[Eminent domain|expropriation]], [[Proletarianization]] and [[Urbanization]]. Marx comments that \"if, however, the German reader shrugs his shoulders at the condition of the English industrial and agricultural labourers, or in optimist fashion comforts himself with the thought that in Germany things are not nearly so bad, I must plainly tell him, \"''De te fabula narratur'' ! (the tale is told of you!)\".\n\nMarx was referring here to the expansion of the capitalist [[mode of production]] (not the expansion of ''world trade''), through ''expropriation'' processes. He continues, \"Intrinsically, it is not a question of the higher or lower degree of development of the social antagonism that results from the natural laws of capitalist production. It is a question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies working with iron necessity towards inevitable results.\"\n\n== David Harvey's theory of accumulation by dispossession ==\n\n[[David Harvey (social theorist and geographer)|David Harvey]] expands the concept of \"primitive accumulation\" to create a new concept, \"accumulation by dispossession\", in his 2003 book, \"The New Imperialism\". Like Mandel, Harvey claims that the word \"primitive\" leads to a misunderstanding in the history of capitalism; that the original, \"primitive\" phase of capitalism is somehow a transitory phase that need not be repeated once commenced. Instead, Harvey maintains that primitive accumulation (\"accumulation by dispossession\") is a continuing process within the process of capital accumulation on a world scale. Because the central Marxian notion of crisis via \"[[over-accumulation]]\" is assumed to be a constant factor in the process of capital accumulation, the process of \"accumulation by dispossession\" acts as a possible safety valve that may temporarily ease the crisis. This is achieved by simply lowering the prices of consumer commodities (thus pushing up the propensity for general consumption), which in turn is made possible by the considerable reduction in the price of production inputs. Should the magnitude of the reduction in the price of inputs outweigh the reduction in the price of consumer goods, it can be said that the [[rate of profit]] will, for the time being, increase. Thus:\n<blockquote>\n\"Access to cheaper inputs is, therefore, just as important as access to widening markets in keeping profitable opportunities open. The implication is that non-capitalist territories should be forced open not only to trade (which could be helpful) but also to permit capital to invest in profitable ventures using cheaper labour power, raw materials, low-cost land, and the like. The general thrust of any capitalist logic of power is not that territories should be held back from capitalist development, but that they should be continuously opened up.\" (Harvey, ''The New Imperialism'', p. 139).\n</blockquote>\n\nHarvey's theoretical extension encompasses more recent economic dimensions such as intellectual property rights, privatization, and predation and exploitation of nature and folk lore.\n\nPrivatization of public services puts enormous profit into capitalists' hands. If it belonged to the public sector, that profit would not have existed. In that sense, the profit is created by dispossession of peoples or nations. Destructive industrial use of the environment is similar because the environment \"naturally\" belongs to everyone, or to no one: factually, it \"belongs\" to whoever lives there.\n\nMultinational pharmaceutical companies collect information about how herb or other natural medicine is used among natives in less-developed country, do some R&D to find the material that make those natural medicines effective, and patent the findings. By doing so, multinational pharmaceutical companies can now sell the medicine to the natives who are the original source of the knowledge that made production of medicine possible. That is, dispossession of folklore (knowledge, wisdom, practice) through intellectual property rights.\n\nDavid Harvey also argues that accumulation by dispossession is a temporal or partial solution to over-accumulation. Because accumulation by dispossession makes raw materials cheaper, the profit rate can at least temporarily go up.\n\nHarvey's interpretation has been criticized by Brass,<ref name=\"Brass2001\">{{cite journal |author=journals.sagepub.com |title=Unfree labour as primitive accumulation? Capital & Class 35(1): 23\u201338. |journal=Capital & Class |volume=35 |pages=23\u201338 |doi=10.1177/0309816810392969 |year=2011 }}</ref> who disputes the view that what is described as present-day primitive accumulation, or accumulation by dispossession, entails proletarianization. Because the latter is equated by Harvey with the separation of the direct producer (mostly smallholders) from the means of production (land), Harvey assumes this results in the formation of a workforce that is free. By contrast, Brass points out that in many instances the process of depeasantization leads to workers who are unfree, because they are unable personally to commodify or recommodify their labour-power, by selling it to the highest bidder.\n\n==Schumpeter's critique of Marx's theory==\nThe economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] disagreed with the Marxist explanation of the origin of capital, because Schumpeter did not believe in [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]. In [[Liberalism|liberal economic theory]], the market returns to each person the exact value she added into it; capitalists are just people who are very adept at saving and whose contributions are especially magnificent, and they do not take anything away from other people or the environment. Liberals believe that capitalism has no internal flaws or contradictions; only outside threats. To liberals, the idea of the necessity of violent primitive accumulation to capital is particularly incendiary. Schumpeter wrote rather testily:\n\n\"[The problem of Original Accumulation] presented itself first to those authors, chiefly to Marx and the Marxists, who held an [[exploitation theory]] of interest and had, therefore, to face the question of how exploiters secured control of an initial stock of 'capital' (however defined) with which to exploit \u2013 a question which that theory ''per se'' is incapable of answering, and which may obviously be answered in a manner highly uncongenial to the idea of exploitation\" (Joseph Schumpeter, ''Business Cycles'', Vol. 1, New York; McGraw-Hill, 1939, p.&nbsp;229).\n\nSchumpeter argued that [[imperialism]] was not a necessary jump-start for capitalism, nor is it needed to bolster capitalism, because imperialism pre-existed capitalism. Schumpeter believed that, whatever the empirical evidence, capitalist world trade could in principle just expand peacefully. If imperialism occurred, Schumpeter asserted, it has nothing to do with the intrinsic nature of [[capitalism]] itself, or with capitalist market expansion. The distinction between Schumpeter and Marx here is subtle. Marx claimed that capitalism requires violence and imperialism\u2014first, to kick-start capitalism with a pile of booty and to dispossess a population to induce them to enter into capitalist relations as workers, and then to surmount the otherwise-fatal contradictions generated within capitalist relations over time. Schumpeter's view was that imperialism is an atavistic impulse pursued by a state independent of the interests of the economic ruling class.\n\n{{Quote|text = Imperialism is the object-less disposition of a state to expansion by force without assigned limits... Modern Imperialism is one of the heirlooms of the absolute monarchical state. The \"inner logic\" of capitalism would have never evolved it. Its sources come from the policy of the princes and the customs of a pre-capitalist milieu. But even export [[monopoly]] is not imperialism and it would never have developed to imperialism in the hands of the pacific bourgeoisie. This happened only because the war machine, its social atmosphere, and the martial will were inherited and because a martially oriented class (i.e., the nobility) maintained itself in a ruling position with which of all the varied interests of the bourgeoisie the martial ones could ally themselves. This alliance keeps alive fighting instincts and ideas of domination. It led to social relations which perhaps ultimately are to be explained by [[relations of production]] but not by the productive relations of capitalism alone.| author = Joseph A.

Its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone-by there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and, above all, frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, and more, in riotous living. (...) Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that, despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work. Such childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property.\"\n\nWhat has to be explained is how the capitalist [[relations of production]] are historically established.

Because accumulation by dispossession makes raw materials cheaper, the profit rate can at least temporarily go up.\n\nHarvey's interpretation has been criticized by Brass,<ref name=\"Brass2001\">{{cite journal |author=journals.sagepub.com |title=Unfree labour as primitive accumulation? Capital & Class 35(1): 23-38. |journal=Capital & Class |volume=35 |pages=23\u201338 |doi=10.1177/0309816810392969 |year=2011 }}</ref> who disputes the view that what is described as present-day primitive accumulation, or accumulation by dispossession, entails proletarianization. Because the latter is equated by Harvey with the separation of the direct producer (mostly smallholders) from the means of production (land), Harvey assumes this results in the formation of a workforce that is free. By contrast, Brass points out that in many instances the process of  depeasantization leads to workers who are unfree, because they are unable personally to commodify or recommodify their labour-power, by selling it to the highest bidder.\n\n==Schumpeter's critique of Marx's theory==\nThe economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] disagreed with the Marxist explanation of the origin of capital, because Schumpeter did not believe in [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]. In [[Liberalism|liberal economic theory]], the market returns to each person the exact value she added into it; capitalists are just people who are very adept at saving and whose contributions are especially magnificent, and they do not take anything away from other people or the environment. Liberals believe that capitalism has no internal flaws or contradictions; only outside threats. To liberals, the idea of the necessity of violent primitive accumulation to capital is particularly incendiary. Schumpeter wrote rather testily:\n\n\"[The problem of Original Accumulation] presented itself first to those authors, chiefly to Marx and the Marxists, who held an [[exploitation theory]] of interest and had, therefore, to face the question of how exploiters secured control of an initial stock of 'capital' (however defined) with which to exploit \u2013 a question which that theory ''per se'' is incapable of answering, and which may obviously be answered in a manner highly uncongenial to the idea of exploitation\" (Joseph Schumpeter, ''Business Cycles'', Vol. 1, New York; McGraw-Hill, 1939, p.&nbsp;229).\n\nSchumpeter argued that [[imperialism]] was not a necessary jump-start for capitalism, nor is it needed to bolster capitalism, because imperialism pre-existed capitalism. Schumpeter believed that, whatever the empirical evidence, capitalist world trade could in principle just expand peacefully. If imperialism occurred, Schumpeter asserted, it has nothing to do with the intrinsic nature of [[capitalism]] itself, or with capitalist market expansion. The distinction between Schumpeter and Marx here is subtle. Marx claimed that capitalism requires violence and imperialism\u2014first, to kick-start capitalism with a pile of booty and to dispossess a population to induce them to enter into capitalist relations as workers, and then to surmount the otherwise-fatal contradictions generated within capitalist relations over time. Schumpeter's view was that imperialism is an atavistic impulse pursued by a state independent of the interests of the economic ruling class.\n\n{{Quote|text = Imperialism is the object-less disposition of a state to expansion by force without assigned limits... Modern Imperialism is one of the heirlooms of the absolute monarchical state. The \"inner logic\" of capitalism would have never evolved it. Its sources come from the policy of the princes and the customs of a pre-capitalist milieu. But even export [[monopoly]] is not imperialism and it would never have developed to imperialism in the hands of the pacific bourgeoisie. This happened only because the war machine, its social atmosphere, and the martial will were inherited and because a martially oriented class (i.e., the nobility) maintained itself in a ruling position with which of all the varied interests of the bourgeoisie the martial ones could ally themselves. This alliance keeps alive fighting instincts and ideas of domination. It led to social relations which perhaps ultimately are to be explained by [[relations of production]] but not by the productive relations of capitalism alone.| author = Joseph A.

Although their conclusions surrounding the disease are outdated, Doctors Taliaferro and Huck discovered a [[wikt:latent|latent]] form of sickle cell anemia.  Their study on sickle cell anemia was the first of many to occur at Hopkins.  In 1940, Irving Sherman, a medical student at Johns Hopkins, correctly identified the [[deoxygenation]] of hemoglobin in sickle cell patients after he noted [[refraction]] patterns characteristic of deoxygenation when light was passed through the protein.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nslc.wustl.edu/sicklecell/part1/background.html|title=Discovery and Biological Basis|website=www.nslc.wustl.edu|access-date=2017-04-15}}</ref>  The deoxygenation of hemoglobin in sickle cell patients has severe implications on those who carry the mutation.

Dover, a pediatric hematologist and expert on [[fetal hemoglobin]], initiated the use of the protein as a way to treat sickle cell anemia in adults.\n\n== Medical implications ==\nThe Hopkins-2 variant of hemoglobin has an oxygen affinity within the body, meaning that there is an increase of oxygen spreading through the body due to the fact that Ho-2 carries a higher amount of oxygen.<ref>Huisman, Titus H. J, Marianne F. H. Carver, and Georgi Efremov. ''A Syllabus of Human Hemoglobin Variants (1996)''. Augusta, GA, USA: The Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, 1996. Print.{{pn|date=January 2019}}</ref> There is no red cell effect with Ho-2 compared to [[Hemoglobin S]], which changes the shape of the cell to become sickled. The Hopkins-2 variant of hemoglobin is not involved in forming [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cells]]. There is a lack of phenotypic expression of Ho-2 in terms of sickle cell, so a person with sickle cell and hemoglobin Hopkins-2 would be asymptomatic.\n\n== Genetic basis ==\nThe Hopkins 2 variant of [[hemoglobin]] is the result of a mutation.  Specifically, the mutated protein is composed of two alpha chains.  The mutation for the Hopkins-2 variant of hemoglobin is located on the surface of the molecule.  Within the Ho-2 variant, [[aspartic acid]] replaces [[histidine]] at position 112 on the alpha chain.<ref name=\":2\" /> Dr. [[Max Perutz]] examined the aspartic acid in alpha 112 claiming that the carboxyl group of the amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with phenolix hydroxyl, which in turn stabilizes the structure of the molecule and increases oxygen affinity.  Ho-2 hemoglobin has high levels of oxygen, which replaces the lack of oxygen within red blood cells.  Ho-2 is similar to [[Hemoglobin, alpha 1|Hemoglobin A]], which is normal hemoglobin and also contains two \u03b1-chains.  This provides an explanation as to how the Hopkins-2 variant of hemoglobin is related to the symptoms of [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell]].\n\nHopkins-2 can also interact specifically with Hemoglobin S.  [[Hemoglobin S]] is the most common abnormal hemoglobin variant.  Hemoglobin S is the variant that causes [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell]], which is a disorder in which red blood cells break down and become abnormally shaped.  Hemoglobin S has two beta chains, whereas hemoglobin Hopkins-2 has two alpha chains.  Hopkins-2 makes up 22% of hemolysates in single heterozygotes; therefore, there is the normal version of the gene in these patients.  Hemolysates are the products of the destruction of red blood cells.  Ho-2 also comprises 11% of hemolysates in \u2018double\u2019 heterozygotes, which are when the gene contains both Hopkins-2 and Hemoglobin S.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostertag W, von Ehrenstein G, Charache S | title = Duplicated alpha-chain genes in Hopkins-2 haemoglobin of man and evidence for unequal crossing over between them | journal = Nature | volume = 237 | issue = 72 | pages = 90\u20134 | date = May 1972 | pmid = 4503919 | doi = 10.1038/newbio237090a0 }}</ref>\n\nThere are currently multiple possible explanations as to how the Hemoglobin variant Hopkins-2 works. One explanation that scientists have come up with is that Ho-2 is created due to a point mutation causing the substitution of histidine by aspartic acid.<ref name=\":11\" /> The other explanation is that there is an unequal crossing over between two \u03b1 genes which explains the replacement of histidine by aspartic acid.<ref name=\":11\" /> This then led a deletion occurring within the chromosome housing Ho-2. This deletion removes the region where the N-terminus is located in the major \u03b1-chain and where the c-terminus is located on the minor \u03b1-chain.<ref name=\":11\" /> Deletion of the N-terminus inactivates enzymes and halting their ability to cut chains at certain areas, which inevitably damages the chain.\n\n== Case studies  ==\nCase studies were completed on some patients who carried the Hemoglobin Hopkins-2 genetic mutation by Samuel Charache and others. Researchers concluded after completing the studies that many of carriers of the mutation were asymptomatic to sickle cell and were overall quite healthy.  Any medical issues that occurred had no correlation to sickle cell.

Although their conclusions surrounding the disease are outdated, Doctors Taliaferro and Huck discovered a [[wikt:latent|latent]] form of sickle cell anemia.  Their study on sickle cell anemia was the first of many to occur at Hopkins.  In 1940, Irving Sherman, a medical student at Johns Hopkins, correctly identified the [[deoxygenation]] of hemoglobin in sickle cell patients after he noted [[refraction]] patterns characteristic of deoxygenation when light was passed through the protein.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nslc.wustl.edu/sicklecell/part1/background.html|title=Discovery and Biological Basis|website=www.nslc.wustl.edu|access-date=2017-04-15}}</ref>  The deoxygenation of hemoglobin in sickle cell patients has severe implications on those who carry the mutation.  The hemoglobin proteins, present in those with sickle cell disease, cannot carry oxygen to the organs and other tissues of the human body.

Dover and Samuel Charache studied sickle cell anemia's pathology at Johns Hopkins Hospital.<ref name=\":6\" />  Together, they implemented treatment of the disease through the use of a cancer drug, [[hydroxyurea]]; the drug was successful in alleviating some of the painful spurts associated with [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]], in addition to [[Lung|pulmonary]] symptoms associated with the disease.  Dover, a pediatric hematologist and expert on [[fetal hemoglobin]], initiated the use of the protein as a way to treat sickle cell anemia in adults.\n\n== Medical implications ==\nThe Hopkins-2 variant of hemoglobin has an oxygen affinity within the body, meaning that there is an increase of oxygen spreading though the body due to the fact that Ho-2 carries a higher amount of oxygen.<ref>Huisman, Titus H. J, Marianne F. H. Carver, and Georgi Efremov. ''A Syllabus of Human Hemoglobin Variants (1996)''. Augusta, GA, USA: The Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, 1996. Print.{{pn|date=January 2019}}</ref> There is no red cell effect with Ho-2 compared to [[Hemoglobin S]], which changes the shape of the cell to become sickled. The Hopkins-2 variant of hemoglobin is not involved in forming [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cells]]. There is a lack of phenotypic expression of Ho-2 in terms of sickle cell, so a person with sickle cell and hemoglobin Hopkins-2 would be asymptomatic.\n\n== Genetic basis ==\nThe Hopkins 2 variant of [[hemoglobin]] is the result of a mutation.  Specifically, the mutated protein is composed of two alpha chains.  The mutation for the Hopkins-2 variant of hemoglobin is located on the surface of the molecule.  Within the Ho-2 variant, [[aspartic acid]] replaces [[histidine]] at position 112 on the alpha chain.<ref name=\":2\" /> Dr. [[Max Perutz]] examined the aspartic acid in alpha 112 claiming that the carboxyl group of the amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with phenolix hydroxyl, which in turn stabilizes the structure of the molecule and increases oxygen affinity.  Ho-2 hemoglobin has high levels of oxygen, which replaces the lack of oxygen within red blood cells.  Ho-2 is similar to [[Hemoglobin, alpha 1|Hemoglobin A]], which is normal hemoglobin and also contains two \u03b1-chains.  This provides an explanation as to how the Hopkins-2 variant of hemoglobin is related to the symptoms of [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell]].\n\nHopkins-2 can also interact specifically with Hemoglobin S.  [[Hemoglobin S]] is the most common abnormal hemoglobin variant.  Hemoglobin S is the variant that causes [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell]], which is a disorder in which red blood cells break down and become abnormally shaped.  Hemoglobin S has two beta chains, whereas hemoglobin Hopkins-2 has two alpha chains.  Hopkins-2 makes up 22% of hemolysates in single heterozygotes; therefore, there is the normal version of the gene in these patients.  Hemolysates are the products of the destruction of red blood cells.  Ho-2 also comprises 11% of hemolysates in \u2018double\u2019 heterozygotes, which are when the gene contains both Hopkins-2 and Hemoglobin S.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostertag W, von Ehrenstein G, Charache S | title = Duplicated alpha-chain genes in Hopkins-2 haemoglobin of man and evidence for unequal crossing over between them | journal = Nature | volume = 237 | issue = 72 | pages = 90\u20134 | date = May 1972 | pmid = 4503919 | doi = 10.1038/newbio237090a0 }}</ref>\n\nThere are currently multiple possible explanations as to how the Hemoglobin variant Hopkins-2 works. One explanation that scientists have come up with is that Ho-2 is created due to a point mutation causing the substitution of histidine by aspartic acid.<ref name=\":11\" /> The other explanation is that there is an unequal crossing over between two \u03b1 genes which explains the replacement of histidine by aspartic acid.<ref name=\":11\" /> This then led a deletion occurring within the chromosome housing Ho-2. This deletion removes the region where the N-terminus is located in the major \u03b1-chain and where the c-terminus is located on the minor \u03b1-chain.<ref name=\":11\" /> Deletion of the N-terminus inactivates enzymes and halting their ability to cut chains at certain areas, which inevitably damages the chain.\n\n== Case studies  ==\nCase studies were completed on some patients who carried the Hemoglobin Hopkins-2 genetic mutation by Samuel Charache and others.
