They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Earlier on in 1993, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"Whispers Of The Dead\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}} </ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Riberinha, in Portuguese, literally means small \"ribeira\", or small river-valley owing to its location.  New settlers constructed their village two kilometers from the coast, due to several incursions by pirates. This distance allowed the inhabitants to monitor the coast and plan traps for the invaders.  One area, ''Poceir\u00e3o dos Mouros'', refers to one of these traps where the pirates (the ''Moors of the Canal'', as they were known) were ensnared.\n\nIn 1643, as recounted by [[friar]] [[Diogo das Chagas]], the parish consisted of 71 homes and 254 inhabitants. A quarter of a century later, the Church of S\u00e3o Mateus da Ribeirinha was constructed, and would remain the center of religious life in the parish until the violent earthquake of July 9, 1998.\n\nOne of the more colorful stories from Faial pertains to the end of the Iberian Union, when (in 1640) Spanish residents of Sal\u00e3o were expelled from their homes by their neighbors in Cedros.  Many escaped by way of their frontier with Ribeirinha bringing with them their clothes and possessions, which were lost during the violent events.  The area where their clothing was tossed in the ensuing scuffle was given the name \"Espalhafatos\", which means  \"scattered suits\", referring to the ornamented clothing found scattered along the route.\n\nOn May 21, 1932, a giant hydroplane, the Dornier Wall (DO-X) with twelve motors, on a trip to Vigo, Spain made port in front of the community.\n\nGenerally, the population of this region has shown a dramatic decrease between 1890 (1,112), 1940 (1,031) and the last census 2001 (439).  This primarily the consequences of immigration, economic upheavals and a shift from agricultural production (and its lower standard of living).\n\nOverlooking the canal, the Ribeirinha lighthouse was one of the more important landmarks on the island. It was mentioned in many works of the Portuguese writer [[Vitorino Nem\u00e9sio]], who wrote the ex-libris of the lighthouse in his work ''Mau Tempo no Canal''.  The lighthouse is a square form, covered in white azulejo (tiles); a rectangular base, featuring a central tower.  Construction began during the month of May, 1915m and inaugurated in the winter of 1919 (November 1).  Its optic (made from crystal) and lantern (partly red) distinguish it as a unique World Heritage artifact.  Following the earthquake of 1998, the building was abandoned due to major cracks and deterioration of the internal structure.  Following the earthquake, which was centered 5&nbsp;km off the coast of Ponta da Ribeirinha, the lighthouse was left in ruins.  A preemptive demolition of the building in 2001 was abandoned following a campaign of the ''Liga dos Amigos do Farol'' (the ''League of Friends of the Lighthouse'').  Their objective to preserve and reconstruct the lighthouse has not yet materialized.  Meanwhile, the older equipment has been placed in the possession of the Casa do Povo da Ribeirinha.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Igreja de Pedro Miguel, Pedro Miguel, concelho da Horta, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|170px|thumb|A partial view of the old destroyed Church of Ribeirinha in the river-valley]]\nRibeirinha lies within two morphological formations, the ancient ''Ribeirinha Volcanic Complex'',<ref>Serrelheiro et al. (1989)</ref> and the more recent ''Pedro Miguel Graben'' structure. The ancient Ribeirinha Volcanic Complex includes lava flows intermixed with heavily-altered pyroclastic deposits and, in the western part of the parish, covered in pumice and ash from more recent volcanic events produced by the central volcano.<ref name=\"Gaspar et al. 1989\">Gaspar et al.

Gaspar et al. (1998) consider the possibility of a structural fault, aligned northeast to southwest coincident with the Ribeirinha-Espalhafatos Fault that occurred during the 1998 earthquake.\n\n===Human geography===\nThe community itself is divided into areas located within the Ribeirinha river-valley, and portions that are situated on several mountains and escarpments overlooking the same: Ribeirinha and Espalhafatos. Administratively, Riberinha is divided by borders along ''Lomba Grande'' (543 metres) and ''Lomba da Ribeira'' (209 metres) oriented west to east (both covered with many endemic species of plants, shrubs and trees natural to the Azores).  Towards the interior, the plateau ''Tr\u00e1s-da-Serra'' is a feature of volcanic  origins, as well as a  protected countryside comprising many farmlands and diverse natural views.\n\nThe sheltered port of Boca da Ribeira is one of the oldest fishing ports found in the northernmost point of the [[Faial Channel]].\n\nOn 22 March 2012, a private day centre for seniors was inaugurated, to support a maximum of 30 people in the community of Espalhafatos, an area with access to both northern and eastern residents.<ref name=\"Tribuna\">{{citation |url=http://www.tribunadasilhas.pt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2968:ribeirinha-inaugura-centro-de-dia&catid=1:local&Itemid=2 |title=Ribeirinha inaugura Centro de Dia |language=Portuguese |location=Horta (Azores), Portugal |accessdate=22 March 2012 |date=22 March 2012 |first=Marla |last=Pinheiro}}</ref> Built in order to meet the local needs and remove seniors' dependency, the building was opened by ''Optimus Senium'', a local company that took advantage of a vacated restaurant in order to provide meals, transport of the elderly, care and comfort, medical support, nursing and physiotherapic care, as well as stimulating activities of a socio-cultural and psycho-social nature.<ref name=Tribuna/>\n\n==Architecture==\nThrough successive use and re-use Ribeirinha has maintained a small group of architecturally significant buildings.

Following the earthquake of 1998, the building was abandoned due to major cracks and deterioration of the internal structure.  Following the earthquake, which was centered 5&nbsp;km off the coast of Ponta da Ribeirinha, the lighthouse was left in ruins.  A preemptive demolition of the building in 2001 was abandoned following a campaign of the ''Liga dos Amigos do Farol'' (the ''League of Friends of the Lighthouse'').  Their objective to preserve and reconstruct the lighthouse has not yet materialized.  Meanwhile, the older equipment has been placed in the possession of the Casa do Povo da Ribeirinha.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Igreja de Pedro Miguel, Pedro Miguel, concelho da Horta, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|170px|thumb|A partial view of the old destroyed Church of Ribeirinha in the river-valley]]\nRibeirinha lies within two morphological formations, the ancient ''Ribeirinha Volcanic Complex'',<ref>Serrelheiro et al. (1989)</ref> and the more recent ''Pedro Miguel Graben'' structure. The ancient Ribeirinha Volcanic Complex includes lava flows intermixed with heavily-altered pyroclastic deposits and, in the western part of the parish, covered in pumice and ash from more recent volcanic events produced by the central volcano.<ref name=\"Gaspar et al. 1989\">Gaspar et al. (1989)</ref> Although there exist no volcanic structures, the region is vulnerable to the products from any central eruption on the island and peaks, such as [[Tambroso]].<ref name=\"Gaspar et al. 1989\"/><ref>Pacheco (2001)</ref> \n\nThe parish is crossed by important geological faults: ''Ch\u00e3 da Crus Fault'' (reactivated during the 9 July 1998 earthquake), the ''Ribeirinha-Espalhaftos Fault'' and the ''Carapeto Fault'' oriented along a north-northwest to south-southeast alignment. Gaspar et al. (1998) consider the possibility of a structural fault, aligned northeast to southwest coincident with the Ribeirinha-Espalhafatos Fault that occurred during the 1998 earthquake.\n\n===Human geography===\nThe community itself is divided into areas located within the Ribeirinha river-valley, and portions that are situated on several mountains and escarpments overlooking the same: Ribeirinha and Espalhafatos. Administratively, Riberinha is divided by borders along ''Lomba Grande'' (543 metres) and ''Lomba da Ribeira'' (209 metres) oriented west to east (both covered with many endemic species of plants, shrubs and trees natural to the Azores).  Towards the interior, the plateau ''Tr\u00e1s-da-Serra'' is a feature of volcanic  origins, as well as a  protected countryside comprising many farmlands and diverse natural views.\n\nThe sheltered port of Boca da Ribeira is one of the oldest fishing ports found in the northernmost point of the [[Faial Channel]].\n\nOn 22 March 2012, a private day centre for seniors was inaugurated, to support a maximum of 30 people in the community of Espalhafatos, an area with access to both northern and eastern residents.<ref name=\"Tribuna\">{{citation |url=http://www.tribunadasilhas.pt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2968:ribeirinha-inaugura-centro-de-dia&catid=1:local&Itemid=2 |title=Ribeirinha inaugura Centro de Dia |language=Portuguese |location=Horta (Azores), Portugal |accessdate=22 March 2012 |date=22 March 2012 |first=Marla |last=Pinheiro}}</ref> Built in order to meet the local needs and remove seniors' dependency, the building was opened by ''Optimus Senium'', a local company that took advantage of a vacated restaurant in order to provide meals, transport of the elderly, care and comfort, medical support, nursing and physiotherapic care, as well as stimulating activities of a socio-cultural and psycho-social nature.<ref name=Tribuna/>\n\n==Architecture==\nThrough successive use and re-use Ribeirinha has maintained a small group of architecturally significant buildings.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

These included ''[[Strike It Lucky]]'', ''[[My Kind of People]]'', ''[[My Kind of Music]]'' and ''[[Kids Say the Funniest Things]]''. In 1993 he headlined the ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]''.\n\nAt his peak Barrymore was voted the UK's favourite television star several times, and became one of the highest-paid stars on television. He presented the popular game-show ''Strike It Lucky'' as well as his own variety show ''[[Barrymore (TV series)|Barrymore]]''. He starred in ''[[Bob Martin (TV series)|Bob Martin]]'' from 2000 to 2001, a comedy drama in which he played the title role of a failing television game-show host.\n\nSince his peak of popularity in the mid-1990s, Barrymore has appeared on ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' and other shows including ''[[The Friday Night Project]]'', ''[[Graham Norton's Bigger Picture]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', ''[[The Sharon Osbourne Show]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Night Show]]''.\n\nHis television career effectively ended after the death of Stuart Lubbock in 2001 following a party at Barrymore's house in [[Essex]]. Barrymore was the subject of police investigations and legal action around the case over several years.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn Michael Ciaran Parker in [[Bermondsey]], he lived in the Dickens [[council estate|estate]] for the first 18 years of his life with his two elder siblings.<ref name=\"House\"/> His father left when Barrymore was 11 and they never saw each other again.

He had his own show between 1988 and 1989, produced for the BBC entitled ''Michael Barrymore's Saturday Night Out'';<ref name=\"Catch A Falling Star 70\">{{cite book|last=Barrymore|first=Cheryl|title=Catch A Falling Star|publisher=Robson Books|year=2002|page=70}}{{ISBN missing}}</ref> it was set in Jersey and the theme tune, \"Doin' the Crab\" had been released as a single in 1987.\n\nIn 1991, Barrymore was given his own show entitled ''Barrymore'' where he interviewed guests, performed his comedy routines and joined in with other performers on the show. The show lasted throughout the 1990s and was consistently nominated for awards over the years in the UK. Among the many famous guests that appeared on ''Barrymore'' were [[Cliff Richard]], [[Uri Geller]], and [[Spike Milligan]].\n\nFollowing his appearance on the 1993 ''Royal Variety Performance'', where he performed a version of \"[[Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow]]\" with soldiers, he became popular on television and on the stage. The Royal Variety Show performance brought the house down and cemented Barrymore's place at the heart of the British public. Following on from the success, Barrymore went into rehab due to his alcohol and drug addiction. He left after a couple of months and went on to write a best-selling book about his experiences and he also went on a stage tour called ''Back in Business'' in 1994.<ref name=\"Awight Now: Michael Barrymore 114\">{{cite book|last=Barrymore|first=Michael|title=Awight Now: Michael Barrymore|publisher=Simon Schuster Ltd.|year=2006|page=114}}{{ISBN missing}}</ref>\n\nBarrymore became well known through his catchphrases of \"Awight!\", on making his entrance, and on ''[[Strike It Lucky]]'', \"Top, middle or bottom?\" and  \"What is a hot spot not?\", to which the studio audience would reply \"Not a good spot\".  He had a very public battle with substance abuse in 1994 and wrote a book about his experience in rehab. He regained his former status and made another series of ''Barrymore'' and recorded a new series called ''My Kind of People''. He came out as gay in 1995 and split from his wife in 1996. He made a new series of ''Strike It Lucky'', now called ''Strike It Rich'' and another ''Barrymore'' series.

The show lasted throughout the 1990s and was consistently nominated for awards over the years in the UK. Among the many famous guests that appeared on ''Barrymore'' were [[Cliff Richard]], [[Uri Geller]], and [[Spike Milligan]].\n\nFollowing his appearance on the 1993 ''Royal Variety Performance'', where he performed a version of \"[[Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow]]\" with soldiers, he became popular on television and on the stage. The Royal Variety Show performance brought the house down and cemented Barrymore's place at the heart of the British public. Following on from the success, Barrymore went into rehab due to his alcohol and drug addiction. He left after a couple of months and went on to write a best-selling book about his experiences and he also went on a stage tour called ''Back in Business'' in 1994.<ref name=\"Awight Now: Michael Barrymore 114\">{{cite book|last=Barrymore|first=Michael|title=Awight Now: Michael Barrymore|publisher=Simon Schuster Ltd.|year=2006|page=114}}{{ISBN missing}}</ref>\n\nBarrymore became well known through his catchphrases of \"Awight!\", on making his entrance, and on ''[[Strike It Lucky]]'', \"Top, middle or bottom?\" and  \"What is a hot spot not?\", to which the studio audience would reply \"Not a good spot\".  He had a very public battle with substance abuse in 1994 and wrote a book about his experience in rehab. He regained his former status and made another series of ''Barrymore'' and recorded a new series called ''My Kind of People''. He came out as gay in 1995 and split from his wife in 1996. He made a new series of ''Strike It Lucky'', now called ''Strike It Rich'' and another ''Barrymore'' series.

The couple subsequently had no contact, and Cheryl at her request ceased to be Barrymore's agent or manager. Barrymore later suggested in his 2006 autobiography ''Awight Now: Setting the Record Straight'' that Cheryl was a control freak who controlled his every movement including his clothes, and she had created the character that was \"Michael Barrymore\", which consequently drove him to alcohol, drugs and gay affairs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/spectrum.cfm?id=58072007|title='If I See Insanity in the Street I Will Walk towards It'|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=14 January 2007|accessdate=26 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130202054526/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/spectrum.cfm?id=58072007|archivedate=2 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In an interview in 2002, Barrymore stated he had an alcohol addiction and was in recovery.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2287953.stm Barrymore's GMTV interview], bbc.co.uk; accessed 26 September 2014.</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2005, Cheryl died of [[lung cancer]], aged 55, at the [[Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth]] in [[St John's Wood]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4402321.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Barrymore Ex-Wife Dies of Cancer|date=1 April 2005|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Transmitted\n!Role\n!Channel\n!Notes\n|-\n|''Now Who Do You Do?''\n| 1976\n| Himself\n| BBC\n| Barrymore appeared and did impressions, as was the norm for this show.\n|-\n|''Seaside Special''\n| 1977\n| Performer\n| ITV\n|\n|-\n|''Russ Abbot's Madhouse''\n| 1981\u20131982\n| Various Characters\n| ITV\n|\n|-\n|''Give Us A Clue\n| 1982\n| Performer\n| BBC\n|\n|-\n|''[[Punchlines]]''\n| 1983\n| Performer\n|\n|\n|-\n| ''The Michael Barrymore Show''\n| 1983\n| Various Characters\n| ITV\n| Cancelled after Barrymore walked out of his contract with Thames\n|-\n|''Get Set Go!''\n| 1984\n| Presenter\n| BBC\n| Quiz show.

Henriques's]] early exploration fleets. One of the first settlements, Santa Cruz was an homage of faith to those fishers that returned successfully every year, after living off the sea, on long voyages, hunting whale, fishing for tuna and other species. Other settlers cultivated the patchwork of parcels, growing corn, constructing mills in many of the ravines, and raising cattle to support, initially, a subsistence lifestyle.

It consists of mountainous hills that slope into the Atlantic Ocean, and includes several ravines and river-valleys. Towards the interior, there are many craters and spatter cones that comprise the portions of the Achada Plain and the Topo Volcanic Complex. These lands are primarily peat-bogs and populated by scrub vegetation, as well as lake-filled depressions or cones, such as '''''Lagoa do Paul''''' (in the northeastern corner of the parish).\n\nThe first settlements were established in the semi-regular plain in the area of Santa Cruz (in the western part of the parish). As growth occurred, new settlements popped-up along the flanks of the mountain, around Arrife, expanding along the Caminho de Cima and Caminho de Baixo, and farther along the roads to the localities of Pontas Negras, Ribeira Seca and Ribeira Grande.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{url|http://www.jf-ribeiras.pt/}}, official site\n*[http://www.ribeiras.com Ribeiras.com, a website dedicated to the parish]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Parishes of Lajes do Pico]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Portuguese subdivision\n| type                    = parish\n| name                    = Ribeiras\n| image_skyline           = PIC LAJRibeiras.JPG\n| image_caption           = From the border with [[Lajes do Pico]], the vista of the parish of Ribeiras towards [[Piedade (Lajes do Pico)|Piedade]]\n| image_flag              = \n| image_shield            = \n| region                  = Azores\n| island                  = [[Pico Island|Pico]]\n| municipality            = [[Lajes do Pico]]\n| coordinates             = {{coord|38|24|15|N|28|11|23|W|display=inline,title}}\n| established_date        = Settlement: c. 1460\n| area_total_km2          = 34.17\n| elevation_m             = 9\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_total        = 925\n| postal_code             = 9930-308\n| area_code               = 292\n| patron                  = [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]\n| website                 = {{url|http://www.jf-ribeiras.pt/}}\n}}\n\n'''Ribeiras''' is a civil parish in the municipality of [[Lajes do Pico]] in the [[Azores]].

These lands are primarily peat-bogs and populated by scrub vegetation, as well as lake-filled depressions or cones, such as '''''Lagoa do Paul''''' (in the northeastern corner of the parish).\n\nThe first settlements were established in the semi-regular plain in the area of Santa Cruz (in the western part of the parish). As growth occurred, new settlements popped-up along the flanks of the mountain, around Arrife, expanding along the Caminho de Cima and Caminho de Baixo, and farther along the roads to the localities of Pontas Negras, Ribeira Seca and Ribeira Grande.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{url|http://www.jf-ribeiras.pt/}}, official site\n*[http://www.ribeiras.com Ribeiras.com, a website dedicated to the parish]\n\n[[Category:Parishes of Lajes do Pico]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribeiras"}
