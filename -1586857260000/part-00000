He also brought an antagonistic, almost [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel-like]] commentary, notably giving unfounded criticism of [[Terry Bradshaw]] when Cosell was introducing him in an interview.\n\nIn 1993, ''[[TV Guide]]'' named Howard Cosell The All-Time Best Sportscaster in its issue celebrating 40 years of television.<ref>{{cite book|title=''TV Guide''|issue=April 17\u201323|year=1993|pages=62|title-link=TV Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Early life, family, and education==\nCosell was born in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]],<ref name=obit/> to accountant Isidore Cohen and his wife Nellie (Rosenthal) Cohen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/77/Howard-Cosell.html|title=Howard Cosell Biography (1920-)|work=filmreference.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3436500123/cosell-howard.html|title=Cosell, Howard|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref> The grandson of a [[rabbi]],<ref>Leonard Shapiro.

He graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in English from [[New York University]], where he was a member of [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity and [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He then earned a law degree at [[New York University School of Law]], where he was a member of the law review.\n\nThe name of Cosell's grandfather was changed by immigration authorities when he entered the United States; Howard Cosell said he changed his name from \"Cohen\" to \"Cosell\" while a law student as a way to honor his father and grandfather by reverting to a version of his family's original [[Polish language|Polish]] name.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=John |date=2010 |title=There You Have it: The Life, Legacy, and Legend of Howard Cosell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRirlKfG3J0C&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=howard%20cosell%20changed%20name%20polish |location=Amherst, MA |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |page=67 |isbn=978-1-55849-837-2}}</ref>\n\n===Military service===\nCosell was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in the state of New York in 1941, but when the United States entered [[World War II]] at the end of that year he was commissioned in the [[United States Army]] as an officer with its [[United States Army Transportation Corps|Transportation Corps]]. In 1944 he married Mary Edith Abrams in a judge's chambers in [[Brooklyn]]. At the war's conclusion in 1945, he was discharged from the United States Army with the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]].\n\n===Early legal career===\nAfter the war, Cosell began practicing law in [[Manhattan]], primarily union law. Some of his clients were actors, and some were athletes, including [[Willie Mays]]. Cosell's own hero in athletics was [[Jackie Robinson]], who served as a personal and professional inspiration to him in his career.\n\n==Career==\n===Introduction to broadcasting===\nCosell represented the [[Little League]] of New York, when in 1953, Hal Neal (president ABC Radio), then an [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] manager, asked him to host a show on New York flagship [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] featuring Little League participants. The show marked the beginning of a relationship with WABC and ABC Radio that would last his entire broadcasting career.\n\nCosell hosted the Little League show for three years without pay, and then decided to leave the law to become a full-time broadcaster. He approached [[Robert Pauley]], President of ABC Radio, with a proposal for a weekly show. Pauley told him the network could not afford to develop untried talent, but he would be put on the air if he would get a sponsor. To Pauley's surprise, Cosell came back with a relative's shirt company as a sponsor, and \"Speaking of Sports\" was born.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/media/14pauley.html Robert Pauley, Former Head of ABC Radio, Dies at 85], ''The New York Times'', May 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nCosell took his \"tell it like it is\" approach when he teamed with the ex\u2013[[Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher \"Big ''Numba'' Thirteen\" [[Ralph Branca]] on WABC's pre- and post-game [[Radio programming|radio shows]] of the [[New York Mets]] in their nascent years beginning in 1962. He pulled no punches in taking members of the hapless [[expansion team]] to task.\n\nOtherwise on radio, Cosell did his show, ''Speaking of Sports'', as well as sports reports and updates for affiliated [[radio station]]s around the country; he continued his radio duties even after he became prominent on television. Cosell then became a sports anchor at [[WABC-TV]] in New York, where he served in that role from 1961 to 1974. He expanded his commentary beyond sports to a radio show entitled ''Speaking of Everything''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1987/09/02/cosell-gets-back-in-the-picture/61f7b279-6f64-442c-8e73-3af9caccf4e2/|title=COSELL GETS BACK IN THE PICTURE|first=Norman|last=Chad|date=September 2, 1987|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence, supports black athletes===\nCosell rose to prominence in the early 1960s, covering boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], beginning from the time he fought under his [[Name at birth|birth name]], Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell was also an outspoken supporter of Olympic sprinters [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]], after they raised their fists in a [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|\"black power\" salute during their 1968 medal ceremony]] in [[Mexico City]]. In a time when many sports broadcasters avoided touching social, racial, or other controversial issues, and kept a certain level of collegiality towards the sports figures they commented on, Cosell did not, and indeed built a reputation around his [[catchphrase]], \"I'm just telling it like it is.\"\n\nCosell's style of reporting transformed [[sports broadcasting]] in the United States. Whereas previous sportscasters had mostly been known for [[color commentary]] and lively [[play-by-play]], Cosell had an intellectual approach. His use of analysis and context brought television sports reporting closer to \"hard\" news reporting. However, his distinctive [[staccato]] voice, [[New York City English|accent]], [[syntax]], and [[cadence (music)|cadence]] were a form of color commentary all their own.\n\nCosell earned his greatest interest from the public when he backed Ali after the boxer's championship title was stripped from him for refusing military service during the [[Vietnam War]]. Cosell found vindication several years later when he was able to inform Ali that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] had unanimously ruled in favor of Ali in ''[[Clay v. United States]]''.\n\nCosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in October 1974 and the first [[Fight of the Century|Ali\u2013Joe Frazier bout]] in March 1971. Promoter [[Jerry Perenchio]] selected actor [[Burt Lancaster]], who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and former light-heavyweight champion [[Archie Moore]]. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a voiceover of that bout, when it was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] a few days before the second [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Ali-Frazier bout]] in January 1974.\n\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the [[George Foreman#The Sunshine Showdown vs. Joe Frazier|fight]] between [[Joe Frazier]] and [[George Foreman]] for the World Heavyweight Championship in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\n\n{{quote|Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!}}\n\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a TKO in the second round to win the [[World heavyweight boxing championship|World Heavyweight Championship]].\n\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early 1980s, including [[Ken Norton]]'s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of [[Leon Spinks]] in 1978 recapturing the Heavyweight title for the third time. His signature [[toupee]] was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between [[Scott LeDoux]] and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294873|title=Ali and Cosell, Irresistible Enigmas|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] on November 26, 1982. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\n\nCosell also was an ABC commentator for the television broadcast of the second of the two famous 1973 \"[[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battles of the Sexes]]\" tennis matches, this one between [[Bobby Riggs]] and [[Billie Jean King]].\n\n===Feuds===\nDuring Cosell's tenure as a sportscaster, he frequently clashed with longtime ''[[New York Daily News]]'' sports columnist [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], who rarely missed an opportunity to denigrate the broadcaster in print as an \"ass\", a \"shill\", or most often, \"Howie the Fraud\". Young would sometimes stand near Cosell and shout profanities so that the audio he was taping for his radio show would be unusable. Writing about Cosell, sportswriter [[Jimmy Cannon]] sniped, \"This is a guy who changed his name, put on a toupee and tried to convince the world that he tells it like it is.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105742,00.html |title=The Mouth That Roared|author=William Plummer|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> He further added, \"If Howard Cosell were a sport, he'd be [[roller derby]].\"<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006539/index.htm Nack, William. \"Telling It Like It Is\", ''Sports Illustrated'', May 1, 1995].</ref>\n\nCosell, according to longtime [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[racecaster]] [[Chris Economaki]], \"had an enormous and monumental ego, and may have been the most pompous man I've ever met.\" Cosell ripped Economaki for a miscue in an interview with [[Cale Yarborough]] for ABC \"(and he) never let me forget that\". At an ABC [[Christmas]] party Economaki's wife asked to be introduced to Cosell and Chris said, \"{{'}}Howard, for some inexplicable reason my wife wants to meet you...' and it (ticked) him off to no end. He really took it personally.\"<ref>Economaki, Chris (with Dave Argabright) (2006) ''LET 'EM ALL GO! The Story of Auto Racing by the Man Who Was There'' (Fisher, IN: Books By Dave Argabright), p. 191. {{ISBN|0-9719639-3-2}}.</ref>\n\n===''Monday Night Football''===\nIn [[1970 NFL season|1970]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[executive producer]] for sports [[Roone Arledge]] hired Cosell to be a [[color commentator|commentator]] for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', the first time in 15 years that [[American football]] was broadcast weekly in [[prime time]]. Cosell was accompanied most of the time by ex-football players [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Don Meredith|\"Dandy\" Don Meredith]].\n\nCosell was openly contemptuous of ex-athletes appointed to prominent sportscasting roles solely on account of their playing fame. He regularly clashed on-air with Meredith, whose laid-back style was in sharp contrast to Cosell's more critical approach to the games.\n\nThe Cosell-Meredith-Gifford dynamic helped make ''Monday Night Football'' a success; it frequently was the number one rated program in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. Cosell's inimitable style distinguished ''Monday Night Football'' from previous sports programming, and ushered in an era of more colorful broadcasters and 24/7 TV sports coverage.\n\nIt was during his ''MNF'' run that Cosell coined a phrase that came to be so identified with football that other announcers and spectators\u2014notably [[Chris Berman]]\u2014began to repeat it. An ordinary kickoff return began with Cosell giving commentary about a player's difficult life. It became extraordinary when he suddenly observed, \"He could go all the way!\" As evidenced by the thousands of websites that cite Cosell's quote, many sports commentators consider this to be one of the most famous sports quips of all time.\n\nAlso during his ''MNF'' run, after a 4 September 1978 NFL game, Cosell popularized the term \"[[nachos]]\".<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Munsey\n | last2 = Suppes\n | title = Arlington Stadium\n | work = Ballparks.com\n | url = http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/arling.htm\n | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Olympics===\nAlong with ''Monday Night Football'', Cosell worked the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]]. He played a key role on ABC's coverage of the [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terror]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]]'s [[mass murder]] of [[Israel]]i athletes in [[Munich massacre|Munich]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; providing reports directly from the [[Olympic Park|Olympic Village]] (his image can be seen and voice heard in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Munich (film)|film]] about the terror attack).\n\nIn the [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games in Montreal]], and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 games in Los Angeles]], Cosell was the main voice for boxing. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"I Never Played The Game\", by Howard Cosell, 1985</ref>\n\n===\"The Bronx is burning\"===\nCosell was widely attributed with saying the famous phrase \"the Bronx is burning\". Cosell is credited with saying the quote during Game 2 of the [[1977 World Series]], which took place in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South [[The Bronx|Bronx]], mostly due to owners of low-value properties burning their own real estate for [[insurance]] money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC aerial camera panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen, The Bronx is burning.\"<ref name=nypost>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/16/why-the-bronx-burned/ | work=New York Post | first=Joe | last=Flood | title=Why the Bronx Burned | date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> This was later picked up by presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]], who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.\n\nIn 2005, author Jonathan Mahler published ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning]]'', a book about New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with the title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire. [[ESPN]] produced a 2007 [[Miniseries|mini-series]] based on the book ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]''. Cosell's comment seemed to have captured the widespread view that New York City was in a state of decline.\n\nThe truth was discovered after Major League Baseball published a complete DVD set of all of the games of the 1977 World Series. Coverage of the fire began with [[Keith Jackson]]'s comments regarding the enormity of the blaze, while Cosell added that [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]] had visited that area just days before. At the top of the second inning, the fire was once again shown from a helicopter-mounted camera, and Cosell commented that the [[New York City Fire Department|New York Fire Department]] had a hard job to do in the Bronx as there were always numerous fires. In the bottom of the second, Cosell informed the audience that it was an abandoned building that was burning and no lives were in danger. There was no further comment on the fire, and Cosell appears to have never said \"The Bronx is Burning\" (at least not on camera) during Game 2.<ref name=nypost/>\n\nMahler's confusion could have arisen from a 1974 documentary entitled ''The Bronx Is Burning'': it is likely Mahler confused the documentary with his recollection of Cosell's comments when writing his book.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |title=Did Howard Cosell Really Say, \"The Bronx Is Burning\"?|accessdate=2009-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213023329/http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |archivedate=December 13, 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Reports the death of John Lennon===\n{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}\nOn the night of December 8, 1980, during a ''Monday Night Football'' game between the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], Cosell shocked the television audience by interrupting his regular commentary duties to deliver a news bulletin on the murder of [[John Lennon]] in the midst of a live broadcast. Word had been passed to Cosell and Frank Gifford by [[Roone Arledge]], who was president of ABC's news and sports divisions at the time, near the end of the game.\n\nCosell was initially apprehensive about announcing Lennon's death. Off the air, Cosell conferred with Gifford and others saying \"Fellas, I just don't know, I'd like your opinion. I can't see this game situation allowing for that news flash, can you?\" Gifford replied, \"Absolutely. I can see it.\" Gifford later told Cosell, \"Don't hang on it. It's a tragic moment and this is going to shake up the whole world.\"\n\nOn air, Gifford prefaced the announcement saying, \"And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, you have got to say what we know in the booth.\" Cosell then replied:<ref>{{cite web|title=John Lennon shot 12-8-80 Howard Cosell tells the world twice John Lennon was dead.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n73GFvAyIjs|work=YouTube|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Yes, we have to say it.

Hard to go back to the game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take.}}\n\nLennon had been shot four times and had not been pronounced dead on arrival, but the facts of the shooting were not clear at the time of the announcement. Lennon once appeared on ''Monday Night Football'', during the December 9, 1974 telecast of a 23\u201317 [[1974 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] win over the [[1974 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], and was interviewed for a short breakaway segment by Cosell.\n\nABC had obtained this scoop as a result of the coincidence of an ABC employee, Alan Weiss, being at the same emergency room that Lennon was brought to that night.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/behind-cosells-announcement-of-lennons-death|title=Behind Cosell's Announcement of Lennon's Death|author=Toni Monkovic |department=The Fifth Down: ''The New York Times'' N.F.L.

Sean, age 5, was not watching television at the time as it was near midnight, and Ono was able to break the news to him.<ref>[[ESPN]] ''[[Outside the Lines]] First Report'', December 8, 2010</ref> NBC beat ABC to the punch, however, interrupting ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' just minutes before Cosell's announcement with a \"breaking news\" segment.<ref name=LennonAnnouncement>{{cite web|title=NBC TV bulletin - John Lennon is dead|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvcydIVLthM|work=YouTube|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sports journalism and ''ABC SportsBeat'' magazine show===\nIn the fall of [[1981 in American television|1981]], Cosell debuted a serious investigative 30-minute magazine show, ''[[SportsBeat|ABC SportsBeat]]'' on ABC's weekend schedule.  He made news and covered topics that were not part of general sports coverage - including the first story about drugs in professional sports (the story of former [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Viking]] [[Carl Eller]]'s [[cocaine]] use), an in-depth look at how NFL owners negotiated tax breaks and incentives for building new stadiums, and together with [[Arthur Ashe]], an investigation into apartheid and sports. Though [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were low, Cosell and his staff earned three [[Emmy Award]]s for excellence in reporting, and broke new ground in sports journalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosell, Howard - 1993 Hall of Fame Inductee|url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/cosell.html|website=American Sportscasters Online|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref>  At the time, ''ABC SportsBeat'' was the first and only regularly scheduled network program devoted solely to sports journalism.\n\nTo produce this pioneering program, Cosell recruited a number of employees from outside the ranks of those that produced games, who he felt might be too invested in the success of the athletes and leagues to look at the hard news. He brought in Michael Marley, then a sportswriter for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lawrie Mifflin, a writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and a 20-year old researcher who quickly rose to an associate producer, Alexis Denny. As a sophomore at [[Yale University]], Ms. Denny had been a student in a seminar that Cosell taught on the \"Business of Big-Time Sports in America\", and was selected by the Director of ''Monday Night Football'' to join their production crew. She took her junior year off to join Cosell's staff at [[American Broadcasting Company#Facilities and studios|ABC Headquarters]] in New York City, and produced many segments, including in 1983 a half-hour special report previewing the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ribowsky|first1=Mark|title=Howard Cosell: The Man, The Myth and the Transformation of American Sports|url=https://archive.org/details/howardcosellmanm00ribo|url-access=registration|date=Nov 14, 2011|publisher=W.W.Horton}}</ref> Despite the games being one of ABC's biggest investments, with a record-breaking 225 million dollar rights fee at the time,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Murray R.|title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA947&lpg=PA947#v=onepage|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9780313397530}}</ref> the 30-minute documentary-style program produced by Denny showed many sides of the questions about the viability of the Games themselves - from concerns about traffic, pollution and terrorism, to a look at how the sponsorship deals were structured.\n\nIn his 1985 autobiography, Cosell reflected on his highly diverse work, and concluded that the ''SportsBeat'' series had been his favorite.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Non-sports-related appearances==\nCosell's colorful personality and distinctive voice were featured to fine comedic effect in several sports-themed episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.  His feuds with [[New York City]] [[sportswriter]] [[Oscar Madison]] ([[Jack Klugman]]) mirrored the real life feuds he had with some of New York's leading sportswriters.  He also appeared in the [[Woody Allen]] films ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' and ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]''. Such was his celebrity that while he never appeared on the show, Cosell's name was frequently used as an all-purpose answer on the popular 1970s [[game show]] ''[[Match Game]]''. Cosell also had a cameo in the 1988 movie ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' featuring [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]] and [[Uma Thurman]]. His particular speech pattern was also imitated by one of the characters in the film ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.\n\nCosell's national fame was further boosted in Fall 1975 when ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' aired on Saturday evenings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This was an hour-long [[variety show]], broadcast live from the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in [[New York City]] and hosted by Cosell, which is not to be confused with the NBC series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which coincidentally also premiered in 1975 under its original title of ''NBC's Saturday Night'', to avoid confusion with Cosell's show). Despite bringing a young comedian, [[Billy Crystal]], to national prominence and for showcasing the American TV debut of the [[Bay City Rollers]] (who later had a hit song by the name of \"[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]\"), Cosell's show was canceled after three months. Cosell later hosted the 1984-1985 [[season finale]] of ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\nCosell was the announcer of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1974 ABC television special ''[[Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event (TV program)|Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event]]''.<ref name=\"Terrace2013\">{{cite book|author=Vincent Terrace|title=Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936-2012, 2d ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of0QAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1240-9|page=157}}</ref>\n\nCosell appeared alongside Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, Richie Havens, and others on a 1976 spoken word novelty record, ''[[The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay]]''.<ref name=RSJun16>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/remembering-muhammad-alis-trippy-anti-cavity-kids-record-20160606|title=Remembering Muhammad Ali's Trippy, Anti-Cavity Kids' Record|author=Jason Heller|date=June 6, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1976, Cosell hosted a series of specials known as ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. The two-hour specials pitted stars from each of the three broadcast networks against each other in various physical and mental competitions. Cosell hosted all but one of the nineteen specials, including the final one airing in 1988.\n\n==Criticism of boxing==\nCosell denounced professional [[boxing]] during the broadcast of a November 26, 1982 WBC heavyweight championship bout between titleholder [[Larry Holmes]] and a clearly outmatched [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] at the [[Astrodome]]. The fight was held two weeks after the fatal fight between [[Ray Mancini]] and [[Duk Koo Kim]], when Kim died shortly after the fight. Cosell famously asked the [[rhetorical question]], \"I wonder if that referee [Steve Crosson] understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that he's a part of?\"<ref name=HolmesCobb>{{cite web|title=Larry Holmes vs Tex Cobb - 4/4|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xswSNKUj6qk#t=403|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>  Cosell, horrified over the brutality of the one-sided fight, said that if the referee did not stop the fight he would never broadcast a professional fight again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMajor boxing reforms were later implemented, the most important of which allows referees to stop clearly one-sided fights early in order to protect the health of the fighters. In amateur boxing, one-sided fights would be automatically stopped if one fighter had a score considerably higher than his opponent. Hitherto, only the ring physician had the authority to halt a bout. Another change was the reduction of championship bouts from fifteen rounds to twelve rounds by the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]. (The fatal blows to Kim were in Rounds thirteen and fourteen.) The [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] quickly followed suit, and the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] did so in 1988. Cosell did not cut off ties with the [[United States Amateur Boxing Federation]]. His 1984 broadcasts of the Olympic Trials, box-offs, and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics boxing tournament]], all of which were at the amateur level with much shorter fights, were his last professional calls of the sport.\n\n==''I Never Played the Game'', and reaction==\nAfter Cosell's memoir ''I Never Played the Game'', which, among other things, chronicled his disenchantment with fellow ABC commentators, was published in September 1985, Cosell was taken off scheduled announcing duties for that year's [[1985 World Series|World Series]] and was dismissed by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television]] shortly thereafter. Cosell's book was seen by many as a bitter \"hate rant\" against those who had offended him. ''[[TV Guide]]'' published excerpts of his memoirs and reported that they had never had as many viewers' responses and they were overwhelmingly negative towards Cosell. The magazine reported some of the \"printable\" ones saying things such as \"[[Will Rogers]] never met Howard Cosell\".\n\nIn ''I Never Played the Game'', Cosell popularized the word \"jockocracy\" (originally coined by author [[Robert Lipsyte]]), describing how athletes were given announcing jobs that they had not earned. Coincidentally, he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by [[Tim McCarver]], himself a former baseball player, to join [[Al Michaels]] and [[Jim Palmer]]. (The title of the book is a [[double entendre]], meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast as well as implying that he never played the \"game\" of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/08/02/cosell/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |first=Marky |last=Billson |title=As strange as it sounds, Howard Cosell has never won Rozelle award |date=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.sportsbroadcastjournal.com/missing-howard-cosell-has-still-not-won-pro-football-hofs-rozelle-award-for-broadcast-excellence/ Missing: Howard Cosell has still not won Pro Football Hall of Fame's Rozelle Award]</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Cosell briefly hosted his own television [[talk show]], ''Speaking of Everything'', authored his last book (''What's Wrong With Sports''), and continued to appear on radio and television, becoming more outspoken about his criticisms of sports in general.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1993, Cosell was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=22291|title=Howard Cosell|work=wwnorton.com}}</ref> A year later, in 1994, he was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]]. He was also the 1995 recipient of the [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]]. After his wife of 46 years, Mary Edith Abrams Cosell (known as \"Emmy\") died from a massive heart attack in 1990, Cosell largely withdrew from the public eye and his health began failing. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1991, and had surgery to remove a cancerous [[tumor]] in his chest. He also had several minor [[stroke]]s, and was diagnosed with [[Cardiovascular disease|heart]] and [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]].\n\n==Death==\nCosell died at [[Hospital for Joint Diseases]] in Manhattan on April 23, 1995 of a cardiac embolism at the age of 77.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Howard Cosell, Outspoken Sportscaster On Television and Radio, Is Dead at 77 |url=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/04.25.html|author=[[Robert McG.

The show marked the beginning of a relationship with WABC and ABC Radio that would last his entire broadcasting career.\n\nCosell hosted the Little League show for three years without pay, and then decided to leave the law field to become a full-time broadcaster. He approached [[Robert Pauley]], President of ABC Radio, with a proposal for a weekly show. Pauley told him the network could not afford to develop untried talent, but he would be put on the air if he would get a sponsor. To Pauley's surprise, Cosell came back with a relative's shirt company as a sponsor, and \"Speaking of Sports\" was born.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/media/14pauley.html Robert Pauley, Former Head of ABC Radio, Dies at 85], The New York Times, May 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nCosell took his \"tell it like it is\" approach when he teamed with the ex\u2013[[Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher \"Big ''Numba'' Thirteen\" [[Ralph Branca]] on WABC's pre- and post-game [[Radio programming|radio shows]] of the [[New York Mets]] in their nascent years beginning in 1962. He pulled no punches in taking members of the hapless [[expansion team]] to task.\n\nOtherwise on radio, Cosell did his show, ''Speaking of Sports'', as well as sports reports and updates for affiliated [[radio station]]s around the country; he continued his radio duties even after he became prominent on television. Cosell then became a sports anchor at [[WABC-TV]] in New York, where he served in that role from 1961 to 1974. He expanded his commentary beyond sports to a radio show entitled ''Speaking of Everything''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1987/09/02/cosell-gets-back-in-the-picture/61f7b279-6f64-442c-8e73-3af9caccf4e2/|title=COSELL GETS BACK IN THE PICTURE|first=Norman|last=Chad|date=September 2, 1987|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence, supports black athletes===\nCosell rose to prominence in the early 1960s, covering boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], beginning from the time he fought under his [[Name at birth|birth name]], Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell was also an outspoken supporter of Olympic sprinters [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]], after they raised their fists in a [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|\"black power\" salute during their 1968 medal ceremony]] in [[Mexico City]]. In a time when many sports broadcasters avoided touching social, racial, or other controversial issues, and kept a certain level of collegiality towards the sports figures they commented on, Cosell did not, and indeed built a reputation around his [[catchphrase]], \"I'm just telling it like it is.\"\n\nCosell's style of reporting transformed [[sports broadcasting]] in the United States. Whereas previous sportscasters had mostly been known for [[color commentary]] and lively [[play-by-play]], Cosell had an intellectual approach. His use of analysis and context brought television sports reporting closer to \"hard\" news reporting. However, his distinctive [[staccato]] voice, [[New York City English|accent]], [[syntax]], and [[cadence (music)|cadence]] were a form of color commentary all their own.\n\nCosell earned his greatest interest from the public when he backed Ali after the boxer's championship title was stripped from him for refusing military service during the [[Vietnam War]]. Cosell found vindication several years later when he was able to inform Ali that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] had unanimously ruled in favor of Ali in ''[[Clay v. United States]]''.\n\nCosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in October 1974 and the first [[Fight of the Century|Ali\u2013Joe Frazier bout]] in March 1971. Promoter [[Jerry Perenchio]] selected actor [[Burt Lancaster]], who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and former light-heavyweight champion [[Archie Moore]]. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a voiceover of that bout, when it was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] a few days before the second [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Ali-Frazier bout]] in January 1974.\n\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the [[George Foreman#The Sunshine Showdown vs. Joe Frazier|fight]] between [[Joe Frazier]] and [[George Foreman]] for the World Heavyweight Championship in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\n\n{{quote|Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!}}\n\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a TKO in the second round to win the [[World heavyweight boxing championship|World Heavyweight Championship]].\n\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early 1980s, including [[Ken Norton]]'s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of [[Leon Spinks]] in 1978 recapturing the Heavyweight title for the third time. His signature [[toupee]] was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between [[Scott LeDoux]] and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294873|title=Ali and Cosell, Irresistible Enigmas|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] on November 26, 1982. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\n\nCosell also was an ABC commentator for the television broadcast of the second of the two famous 1973 \"[[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battles of the Sexes]]\" tennis matches, this one between [[Bobby Riggs]] and [[Billie Jean King]].\n\n===Feuds===\nDuring Cosell's tenure as a sportscaster, he frequently clashed with longtime ''[[New York Daily News]]'' sports columnist [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], who rarely missed an opportunity to denigrate the broadcaster in print as an \"ass\", a \"shill\", or most often, \"Howie the Fraud\". Young would sometimes stand near Cosell and shout profanities so that the audio he was taping for his radio show would be unusable. Writing about Cosell, sportswriter [[Jimmy Cannon]] sniped, \"This is a guy who changed his name, put on a toupee and tried to convince the world that he tells it like it is.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105742,00.html |title=The Mouth That Roared|author=William Plummer|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> He further added, \"If Howard Cosell were a sport, he'd be [[roller derby]].\"<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006539/index.htm Nack, William. \"Telling It Like It Is\", ''Sports Illustrated'', May 1, 1995].</ref>\n\nCosell, according to longtime [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[racecaster]] [[Chris Economaki]], \"had an enormous and monumental ego, and may have been the most pompous man I've ever met.\" Cosell ripped Economaki for a miscue in an interview with [[Cale Yarborough]] for ABC \"(and he) never let me forget that\". At an ABC [[Christmas]] party Economaki's wife asked to be introduced to Cosell and Chris said, \"{{'}}Howard, for some inexplicable reason my wife wants to meet you...' and it (ticked) him off to no end. He really took it personally.\"<ref>Economaki, Chris (with Dave Argabright) (2006) ''LET 'EM ALL GO! The Story of Auto Racing by the Man Who Was There'' (Fisher, IN: Books By Dave Argabright), p. 191. {{ISBN|0-9719639-3-2}}.</ref>\n\n===''Monday Night Football''===\nIn [[1970 NFL season|1970]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[executive producer]] for sports [[Roone Arledge]] hired Cosell to be a [[color commentator|commentator]] for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', the first time in 15 years that [[American football]] was broadcast weekly in [[prime time]]. Cosell was accompanied most of the time by ex-football players [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Don Meredith|\"Dandy\" Don Meredith]].\n\nCosell was openly contemptuous of ex-athletes appointed to prominent sportscasting roles solely on account of their playing fame. He regularly clashed on-air with Meredith, whose laid-back style was in sharp contrast to Cosell's more critical approach to the games.\n\nThe Cosell-Meredith-Gifford dynamic helped make ''Monday Night Football'' a success; it frequently was the number one rated program in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. Cosell's inimitable style distinguished ''Monday Night Football'' from previous sports programming, and ushered in an era of more colorful broadcasters and 24/7 TV sports coverage.\n\nIt was during his ''MNF'' run that Cosell coined a phrase that came to be so identified with football that other announcers and spectators\u2014notably [[Chris Berman]]\u2014began to repeat it. An ordinary kickoff return began with Cosell giving commentary about a player's difficult life. It became extraordinary when he suddenly observed, \"He could go all the way!\" As evidenced by the thousands of websites that cite Cosell's quote, many sports commentators consider this to be one of the most famous sports quips of all time.\n\nAlso during his ''MNF'' run, after a 4 September 1978 NFL game, Cosell popularized the term \"[[nachos]]\".<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Munsey\n | last2 = Suppes\n | title = Arlington Stadium\n | work = Ballparks.com\n | url = http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/arling.htm\n | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Olympics===\nAlong with ''Monday Night Football'', Cosell worked the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]]. He played a key role on ABC's coverage of the [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terror]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]]'s [[mass murder]] of [[Israel]]i athletes in [[Munich massacre|Munich]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; providing reports directly from the [[Olympic Park|Olympic Village]] (his image can be seen and voice heard in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Munich (film)|film]] about the terror attack).\n\nIn the [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games in Montreal]], and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 games in Los Angeles]], Cosell was the main voice for boxing. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"I Never Played The Game\", by Howard Cosell, 1985</ref>\n\n===\"The Bronx is burning\"===\nCosell was widely attributed with saying the famous phrase \"the Bronx is burning\". Cosell is credited with saying the quote during Game 2 of the [[1977 World Series]], which took place in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South [[The Bronx|Bronx]], mostly due to owners of low-value properties burning their own real estate for [[insurance]] money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC aerial camera panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen, The Bronx is burning.\"<ref name=nypost>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/16/why-the-bronx-burned/ | work=New York Post | first=Joe | last=Flood | title=Why the Bronx Burned | date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> This was later picked up by presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]], who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.\n\nIn 2005, author Jonathan Mahler published ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning]]'', a book about New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with the title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire. [[ESPN]] produced a 2007 [[Miniseries|mini-series]] based on the book ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]''. Cosell's comment seemed to have captured the widespread view that New York City was in a state of decline.\n\nThe truth was discovered after Major League Baseball published a complete DVD set of all of the games of the 1977 World Series. Coverage of the fire began with [[Keith Jackson]]'s comments regarding the enormity of the blaze, while Cosell added that [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]] had visited that area just days before. At the top of the second inning, the fire was once again shown from a helicopter-mounted camera, and Cosell commented that the [[New York City Fire Department|New York Fire Department]] had a hard job to do in the Bronx as there were always numerous fires. In the bottom of the second, Cosell informed the audience that it was an abandoned building that was burning and no lives were in danger. There was no further comment on the fire, and Cosell appears to have never said \"The Bronx is Burning\" (at least not on camera) during Game 2.<ref name=nypost/>\n\nMahler's confusion could have arisen from a 1974 documentary entitled ''The Bronx Is Burning'': it is likely Mahler confused the documentary with his recollection of Cosell's comments when writing his book.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |title=Did Howard Cosell Really Say, \"The Bronx Is Burning\"?|accessdate=2009-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213023329/http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |archivedate=December 13, 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Reports the death of John Lennon===\n{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}\nOn the night of December 8, 1980, during a ''Monday Night Football'' game between the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], Cosell shocked the television audience by interrupting his regular commentary duties to deliver a news bulletin on the murder of [[John Lennon]] in the midst of a live broadcast. Word had been passed to Cosell and Frank Gifford by [[Roone Arledge]], who was president of ABC's news and sports divisions at the time, near the end of the game.\n\nCosell was initially apprehensive about announcing Lennon's death. Off the air, Cosell conferred with Gifford and others saying \"Fellas, I just don't know, I'd like your opinion. I can't see this game situation allowing for that news flash, can you?\" Gifford replied, \"Absolutely. I can see it.\" Gifford later told Cosell, \"Don't hang on it. It's a tragic moment and this is going to shake up the whole world.\"\n\nOn air, Gifford prefaced the announcement saying, \"And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, you have got to say what we know in the booth.\" Cosell then replied:<ref>{{cite web|title=John Lennon shot 12-8-80 Howard Cosell tells the world twice John Lennon was dead.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n73GFvAyIjs|work=YouTube|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Yes, we have to say it.

He made news and covered topics that were not part of general sports coverage - including the first story about drugs in professional sports (the story of former [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Viking]] [[Carl Eller]]'s [[cocaine]] use), an in-depth look at how NFL owners negotiated tax breaks and incentives for building new stadiums, and together with [[Arthur Ashe]], an investigation into apartheid and sports. Though [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were low, Cosell and his staff earned three [[Emmy Award]]s for excellence in reporting, and broke new ground in sports journalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosell, Howard - 1993 Hall of Fame Inductee|url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/cosell.html|website=American Sportscasters Online|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref>  At the time, ''ABC SportsBeat'' was the first and only regularly scheduled network program devoted solely to sports journalism.\n\nTo produce this pioneering program, Cosell recruited a number of employees from outside the ranks of those that produced games, who he felt might be too invested in the success of the athletes and leagues to look at the hard news. He brought in Michael Marley, then a sportswriter for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lawrie Mifflin, a writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and a 20-year old researcher who quickly rose to an associate producer, Alexis Denny. As a sophomore at [[Yale University]], Ms. Denny had been a student in a seminar that Cosell taught on the \"Business of Big-Time Sports in America\", and was selected by the Director of ''Monday Night Football'' to join their production crew. She took her junior year off to join Cosell's staff at [[American Broadcasting Company#Facilities and studios|ABC Headquarters]] in New York City, and produced many segments, including in 1983 a half-hour special report previewing the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ribowsky|first1=Mark|title=Howard Cosell: The Man, The Myth and the Transformation of American Sports|url=https://archive.org/details/howardcosellmanm00ribo|url-access=registration|date=Nov 14, 2011|publisher=W.W.Horton}}</ref> Despite the games being one of ABC's biggest investments, with a record-breaking 225 million dollar rights fee at the time,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Murray R.|title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA947&lpg=PA947#v=onepage|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9780313397530}}</ref> the 30-minute documentary-style program produced by Denny showed many sides of the questions about the viability of the Games themselves - from concerns about traffic, pollution and terrorism, to a look at how the sponsorship deals were structured.\n\nIn his 1985 autobiography, Cosell reflected on his highly diverse work, and concluded that the ''SportsBeat'' series had been his favorite.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Non-sports-related appearances==\nCosell's colorful personality and distinctive voice were featured to fine comedic effect in several sports-themed episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.  His feuds with [[New York City]] [[sportswriter]] [[Oscar Madison]] ([[Jack Klugman]]) mirrored the real life feuds he had with some of New York's leading sportswriters.  He also appeared in the [[Woody Allen]] films ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' and ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]''. Such was his celebrity that while he never appeared on the show, Cosell's name was frequently used as an all-purpose answer on the popular 1970s [[game show]] ''[[Match Game]]''. Cosell also had a cameo in the 1988 movie ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' featuring [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]] and [[Uma Thurman]]. His particular speech pattern was also imitated by one of the characters in the film ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.\n\nCosell's national fame was further boosted in Fall 1975 when ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' aired on Saturday evenings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This was an hour-long [[variety show]], broadcast live from the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in [[New York City]] and hosted by Cosell, which is not to be confused with the NBC series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which coincidentally also premiered in 1975 under its original title of ''NBC's Saturday Night'', to avoid confusion with Cosell's show). Despite bringing a young comedian, [[Billy Crystal]], to national prominence and for showcasing the American TV debut of the [[Bay City Rollers]] (who later had a hit song by the name of \"[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]\"), Cosell's show was canceled after three months. Cosell later hosted the 1984-1985 [[season finale]] of ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\nCosell was the announcer of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1974 ABC television special ''[[Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event (TV program)|Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event]]''.<ref name=\"Terrace2013\">{{cite book|author=Vincent Terrace|title=Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936-2012, 2d ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of0QAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1240-9|page=157}}</ref>\n\nCosell appeared alongside Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, Richie Havens, and others on a 1976 spoken word novelty record, ''[[The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay]]''.<ref name=RSJun16>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/remembering-muhammad-alis-trippy-anti-cavity-kids-record-20160606|title=Remembering Muhammad Ali's Trippy, Anti-Cavity Kids' Record|author=Jason Heller|date=June 6, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1976, Cosell hosted a series of specials known as ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. The two-hour specials pitted stars from each of the three broadcast networks against each other in various physical and mental competitions. Cosell hosted all but one of the nineteen specials, including the final one airing in 1988.\n\n==Criticism of boxing==\nCosell denounced professional [[boxing]] during the broadcast of a November 26, 1982 WBC heavyweight championship bout between titleholder [[Larry Holmes]] and a clearly outmatched [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] at the [[Astrodome]]. The fight was held two weeks after the fatal fight between [[Ray Mancini]] and [[Duk Koo Kim]], when Kim died shortly after the fight. Cosell famously asked the [[rhetorical question]], \"I wonder if that referee [Steve Crosson] understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that he's a part of?\"<ref name=HolmesCobb>{{cite web|title=Larry Holmes vs Tex Cobb - 4/4|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xswSNKUj6qk#t=403|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>  Cosell, horrified over the brutality of the one-sided fight, said that if the referee did not stop the fight he would never broadcast a professional fight again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMajor boxing reforms were later implemented, the most important of which allows referees to stop clearly one-sided fights early in order to protect the health of the fighters. In amateur boxing, one-sided fights would be automatically stopped if one fighter had a score considerably higher than his opponent. Hitherto, only the ring physician had the authority to halt a bout. Another change was the reduction of championship bouts from fifteen rounds to twelve rounds by the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]. (The fatal blows to Kim were in Rounds thirteen and fourteen.) The [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] quickly followed suit, and the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] did so in 1988. Cosell did not cut off ties with the [[United States Amateur Boxing Federation]]. His 1984 broadcasts of the Olympic Trials, box-offs, and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics boxing tournament]], all of which were at the amateur level with much shorter fights, were his last professional calls of the sport.\n\n==''I Never Played the Game'', and reaction==\nAfter Cosell's memoir ''I Never Played the Game'', which, among other things, chronicled his disenchantment with fellow ABC commentators, was published in September 1985, Cosell was taken off scheduled announcing duties for that year's [[1985 World Series|World Series]] and was dismissed by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television]] shortly thereafter. Cosell's book was seen by many as a bitter \"hate rant\" against those who had offended him. ''[[TV Guide]]'' published excerpts of his memoirs and reported that they had never had as many viewers' responses and they were overwhelmingly negative towards Cosell. The magazine reported some of the \"printable\" ones saying things such as \"[[Will Rogers]] never met Howard Cosell\".\n\nIn ''I Never Played the Game'', Cosell popularized the word \"jockocracy\" (originally coined by author [[Robert Lipsyte]]), describing how athletes were given announcing jobs that they had not earned. Coincidentally, he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by [[Tim McCarver]], himself a former baseball player, to join [[Al Michaels]] and [[Jim Palmer]]. (The title of the book is a [[double entendre]], meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast as well as implying that he never played the \"game\" of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/08/02/cosell/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |first=Marky |last=Billson |title=As strange as it sounds, Howard Cosell has never won Rozelle award |date=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.sportsbroadcastjournal.com/missing-howard-cosell-has-still-not-won-pro-football-hofs-rozelle-award-for-broadcast-excellence/ Missing: Howard Cosell has still not won Pro Football Hall of Fame's Rozelle Award]</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Cosell briefly hosted his own television [[talk show]], ''Speaking of Everything'', authored his last book (''What's Wrong With Sports''), and continued to appear on radio and television, becoming more outspoken about his criticisms of sports in general.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1993, Cosell was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=22291|title=Howard Cosell|work=wwnorton.com}}</ref> A year later, in 1994, he was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]]. He was also the 1995 recipient of the [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]]. After his wife of 46 years, Mary Edith Abrams Cosell (known as \"Emmy\") died from a massive heart attack in 1990, Cosell largely withdrew from the public eye and his health began failing. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1991, and had surgery to remove a cancerous [[tumor]] in his chest. He also had several minor [[stroke]]s, and was diagnosed with [[Cardiovascular disease|heart]] and [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]].\n\n==Death==\nCosell died at [[Hospital for Joint Diseases]] in Manhattan on April 23, 1995 of a cardiac embolism at the age of 77.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Howard Cosell, Outspoken Sportscaster On Television and Radio, Is Dead at 77 |url=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/04.25.html|author=[[Robert McG.

{"title_page": "Iranian Land Reform", "text_new": "'''Iranian Land Reform''' was a major [[land reform]] in [[Iran]] and one of the main concerns of the [[White Revolution]] of 1963. It was a significant part of the reform program of [[Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and occurred when the existing feudal system was abolished and the arable land redistributed from large landowners to smaller agricultural workers.\n\n==History==\n===Preconditions===\nReforms to improve the economic situation of the Iranian population had to be started in the agricultural sector. A main element of this was the implementation of a land reform programs designed to change the ownership structure of agricultural land. The first step in land reform started in the early 1950s. The Shah gave over 500,000 hectares of land to about 30,000 homeless families<ref>{{Cite book |title=Der Schah. Die Macht und die Herrlichkeit des Kaisers auf dem Pfauenthron |first=G\u00e9rard de |last=Villiers |year=1976 |isbn=3453006321 |location=M\u00fcnchen  |pages=460}}</ref>. Before the land reform, 70% of the arable land was owned by a small elite of large landowners or religious foundations. There was no official land register yet rather the land ownership was documented by means of title deeds whereby the document did not represent a specific measured area of land but a village and the land belonging to the village. Before the land reform 50% of Iranian agricultural land was in the hands of large landowners, 20% belonged to charitable or religious foundations, 10% was owned by the state or owned by the crown and only 20% belonged to free farmers. Before the land reform began 18,000 villages had been recorded of which the land would be divided among the farmers living in the village<ref>{{Cite book |last=Diba-Pahlavi |first=Farah |publisher=Bergisch-Gladbach |year=2004 |pages=135}}</ref>.\n\n[[File:WhiteRevolution.jpg|thumb|right|The Shah distributed land titles as part of the White Revolution]]\n\n===First Attempts===\nShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had spoken of the need for land reform for many years but the clergy resistance had repeatedly led him to postpone the reform. At the end of the reign of Prime Minister [[Manouchehr Eghbal]] the then Minister of Agriculture, Jamshid Amusegar, submitted a bill on land reform to the parliament. It was, however, diluted by the representatives of the big landowners in Parliament. Despite this the measure was adopted on the 6 June 1960 and was the first attempt at land reform. It though did not lead to a fundamental redistribution of land ownership in Iran. On 11 November 11 1961 the Shah commissioned Prime Minister [[Ali Amini]] to develop proposals for the implementation of the planned land reform program. On 14 November 14 1961 Amini declared that the Shah had given him special powers to implement the reform program. [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] MPs massively criticized Amini so Amini ultimately arrested the leaders of the reform critics. In January 1962 he assigned his Minister of Agriculture Hassan Arsanjanito to revise the 1960 Land Reform Act. From now on the large landowners were only allowed to own one village. They had to sell the rest of their land to the state which in turn was to sell it to the landless farmers at a significantly lower price. The state also granted farmers cheap loans when they formed agricultural cooperatives<ref>{{Cite book |title=The U.S.-Soviet confrontation in Iran, 1945\u20131962 |last=Kristen  |first=Blake |publisher=University Press of America |year=2009 |pages=155}}</ref>..\n\n===White Revolution===\nMohammad Reza Schah wanted to promote Iranian economic and social reform in a coordinated reform project which become the [[White Revolution]]. After Amini's resignation, the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Asadollah Alam]] was commissioned to legislate the reforms. In January 1963 the Minister of Agriculture, Arsanjani, drafted an amendment to the Land Reform Law which was intended to put an end to the Iranian feudal system which still existed during the Qajar period. Critics of land reform from the ranks of large landowners accused Arsanjani that the reform law would violate the constitution, the laws of Islam, and the country's existing laws<ref>{{Cite book |title=Eminent Persians |last=Abbas |first=Milani |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2008 |pages=88}}</ref>. It became clear that the White Revolution program, and especially land reform, against the resistance of the large landowners and the clergy could only be implemented if it were supported by the vast majority of the Iranian population.

It was a significant part of the reform program of [[Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and occurred when the existing feudal system was abolished and the arable land redistributed from large landowners to smaller agricultural workers.\n\n==History==\n===Preconditions===\nReforms to improve the economic situation of the Iranian population had to be started in the agricultural sector. A main element of this was the implementation of a land reform programs designed to change the ownership structure of agricultural land. The first step in land reform started in the early 1950s. The Shah gave over 500,000 hectares of land to about 30,000 homeless families<ref>{{Cite book |title=Der Schah. Die Macht und die Herrlichkeit des Kaisers auf dem Pfauenthron |first=G\u00e9rard de |last=Villiers |year=1976 |isbn=3453006321 |location=M\u00fcnchen  |pages=460}}</ref>. Before the land reform, 70% of the arable land was owned by a small elite of large landowners or religious foundations. There was no official land register yet rather the land ownership was documented by means of title deeds whereby the document did not represent a specific measured area of land but a village and the land belonging to the village. Before the land reform 50% of Iranian agricultural land was in the hands of large landowners, 20% belonged to charitable or religious foundations, 10% was owned by the state or owned by the crown and only 20% belonged to free farmers. Before the land reform began 18,000 villages had been recorded of which the land would be divided among the farmers living in the village<ref>{{Cite book |last=Diba-Pahlavi |first=Farah |publisher=Bergisch-Gladbach |year=2004 |pages=135}</ref>.\n\n[[File:WhiteRevolution.jpg|thumb|right|The Shah distributed land titles as part of the White Revolution]]\n\n===First Attempts===\nShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had spoken of the need for land reform for many years but the clergy resistance had repeatedly led him to postpone the reform. At the end of the reign of Prime Minister [[Manouchehr Eghbal]] the then Minister of Agriculture, Jamshid Amusegar, submitted a bill on land reform to the parliament. It was, however, diluted by the representatives of the big landowners in Parliament. Despite this the measure was adopted on the 6 June 1960 and was the first attempt at land reform. It though did not lead to a fundamental redistribution of land ownership in Iran. On 11 November 11 1961 the Shah commissioned Prime Minister [[Ali Amini]] to develop proposals for the implementation of the planned land reform program. On 14 November 14 1961 Amini declared that the Shah had given him special powers to implement the reform program. [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] MPs massively criticized Amini so Amini ultimately arrested the leaders of the reform critics. In January 1962 he assigned his Minister of Agriculture Hassan Arsanjanito to revise the 1960 Land Reform Act. From now on the large landowners were only allowed to own one village. They had to sell the rest of their land to the state which in turn was to sell it to the landless farmers at a significantly lower price. The state also granted farmers cheap loans when they formed agricultural cooperatives<ref>{{Cite book |title=The U.S.-Soviet confrontation in Iran, 1945\u20131962 |last=Kristen  |first=Blake |publisher=University Press of America |year=2009 |pages=155}}</ref>..\n\n===White Revolution===\nMohammad Reza Schah wanted to promote Iranian economic and social reform in a coordinated reform project which become the [[White Revolution]]. After Amini's resignation, the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Asadollah Alam]] was commissioned to legislate the reforms. In January 1963 the Minister of Agriculture, Arsanjani, drafted an amendment to the Land Reform Law which was intended to put an end to the Iranian feudal system which still existed during the Qajar period. Critics of land reform from the ranks of large landowners accused Arsanjani that the reform law would violate the constitution, the laws of Islam, and the country's existing laws<ref>{{Cite book |title=Eminent Persians |last=Abbas |first=Milani |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2008 |pages=88}}</ref>. It became clear that the White Revolution program, and especially land reform, against the resistance of the large landowners and the clergy could only be implemented if it were supported by the vast majority of the Iranian population. For this reason the Shah planned a referendum in which Iranian citizens should vote on whether they would approve or reject the reform plans. Although [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] branded the referendum an anti-God project and called on all believers not to vote 5,598,711 Iranians voted in favor and only 4,115 opposed.
