Directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, the film was written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], [[Colin Woodell]] and [[Terry Notary]]. Set during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the film follows a [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]] hybrid named Buck who is kidnapped and stolen from his home in California where he is sent to the Yukon. There, he befriends an old outdoorsman and starts to begin a new life-altering adventure in the wild.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood in for the CGI-created Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing a new film adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]].

Directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, the film was written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the film follows a dog named Buck as he is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old outdoorsman and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood in for the CGI-created Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing a new film adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]].

It is usually a series of combined and joint training exercises led by [[United States]] and [[Egypt]]ian military forces. The exercises began in 1980, after the [[Camp David Accords]] were signed \u2013 the military forces of Egypt and the United States agreed to conduct coalition training in Egypt.<ref name=\"africatime.com\">{{cite web|url=http://en.africatime.com/egypte/articles/egypt-host-operation-bright-star-2017-military-drill-us-army|title=Egypt to host 'Operation Bright Star 2017' military drill with US Army|website=en.africatime.com}}</ref> \n\nBright Star is designed to strengthen ties between the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] and the [[United States Central Command]] and demonstrate and enhance the ability of the Americans to reinforce their allies in the Middle East in the event of war. These deployments usually are centered at the large [[Cairo West Air Base]]. Since the liberation of Kuwait in [[Operation Desert Storm]], the exercises have grown  to include as many as 11 countries and 70,000 personnel. Nations joining Bright Star exercises  have included the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, Jordan, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe exercises begin with coalition interoperability training on how to operate with one another in a wartime environment. They then continue with a command post exercise (CPX) designed to help standardize command and control procedures, and a large-scale field training exercise (FTX) to practice everything together.\n\n==Early exercises==\n[[File:Somali soldier 1983.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Somali Armed Forces|Somali soldier]] poses for a photograph during Operation Bright Star '85.]]\n[[File:Egyptian marine DF-ST-86-08092.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Egyptian marine]] aiming a [[RPD machine gun|RPD]] [[light machine gun]] during the Operation Bright Star '85.]]\n[[File:SG DF-ST-86-08093.jpg|thumb|[[Egyptian marines]] aiming a [[SG-43 Goryunov|SG43]] [[medium machine gun]] during Operation Bright Star '85]]\nThe first exercise, Bright Star '81, was conducted from October to December 1980 (fiscal year 1981). U.S. Army's rapid-deployment unit (Task Force \"Strike\", 1st Battalion, [[502nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|502nd Infantry Regiment]]) of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault) and U.S. Air Force personnel were deployed to [[Cairo West Air Base]] in Egypt for the exercise. This operation was the first deployment of combat soldiers into the region since World War II.  Bright Star '81 was initiated by the [[Carter Administration]] in response to the [[Iranian hostage crisis]] as well as Russia's entry into Afghanistan. But the U.S. armed forces were partially unprepared for the exercise.  Soldiers were issued jungle fatigues in lieu of desert camouflage (which was not in the U.S. Army inventory in 1980) and hastily-established air traffic control systems caused the loss of 14 U.S. Air Force personnel when a [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]] crashed attempting to land.  Post-operation briefings affected positive change for future readiness and successful exercises thereafter, said MSG Keefer (retired), the only enlisted member of the debriefing team for Bright Star '81.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe following year, a similar exercise was held using the same ground rules. {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43}} took part in 1982. After Exercise Eastern Wind \u201983, the amphibious portion of Bright Star '83, the [[Los Angeles Times]] was told that \u201cthe exercise failed dismally.\u2026The Somali army did not perform up to any standard,\u201d one diplomat said. \u2026 \u201cThe inefficiency of the Somali armed forces is legendary among foreign military men.\u201d<ref>Charles Mitchell (UPI), \u2018U.S. Losing Interest in Military Bases in Somalia: Port, Airstrip No Longer a Key Part of Plans for Gulf of Aden Emergency\u2019, Los Angeles Times, March 17, 1985.</ref> \n\nBy 1983, the size of the forces involved prompted planners to hold the event every two years rather than annually. The exercise went under further evolution in 1985 with the inclusion of the [[United States Air Force|U.S.]] and [[Egyptian Air Force]]s. The two nations' respective [[Navy|navies]] and [[special forces]] joined the exercise in 1987.\n\nThe Associated Press, in a story dated August 4, 1985, said that U.S. forces would begin their largest exercise in the Middle East ever that day. Egypt, Somalia, Jordan, and Oman were reported as participating.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/05/world/around-the-world-gi-s-in-the-mideast-start-big-war-games.html GI's in the Mideast Start Big War Games], Associated Press, The New York Times, August 5, 1985</ref>\n\n<blockquote> Egypt's Information Ministry confirmed that Bright Star began in Egypt on schedule with activation of command centers and some movement of troops into maneuver areas.\nA Pentagon spokesman in Washington said about 9,000 Americans would take part in the weeklong Egyptian phase, the main part of the exercise. The spokesman said an unspecified smaller number of American soldiers would take part in Somalia and about 520 would join in the Jordanian portion.

It is usually a series of combined and joint training exercises led by [[United States]] and [[Egypt]]ian military forces. The exercises began in 1980, after the [[Camp David Accords]] were signed \u2013 the military forces of Egypt and the United States agreed to conduct coalition training in Egypt.<ref name=\"africatime.com\">{{cite web|url=http://en.africatime.com/egypte/articles/egypt-host-operation-bright-star-2017-military-drill-us-army|title=Egypt to host 'Operation Bright Star 2017' military drill with US Army|website=en.africatime.com}}</ref> \n\nBright Star is designed to strengthen ties between the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] and the [[United States Central Command]] and demonstrate and enhance the ability of the Americans to reinforce their allies in the Middle East in the event of war. These deployments usually are centered at the large [[Cairo West Air Base]]. Since the liberation of Kuwait in [[Operation Desert Storm]], the exercises have grown  to include as many as 11 countries and 70,000 personnel. Nations joining Bright Star exercises  have included the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, Jordan, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe exercises begin with coalition interoperability training on how to operate with one another in a wartime environment. They then continue with a command post exercise (CPX) designed to help standardize command and control procedures, and a large-scale field training exercise (FTX) to practice everything together.\n\n==Early exercises==\n[[File:Somali soldier 1983.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Somali Armed Forces|Somali soldier]] poses for a photograph during Operation Bright Star '85.]]\n[[File:Egyptian marine DF-ST-86-08092.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Egyptian marine]] aiming a [[RPD machine gun|RPD]] [[light machine gun]] during the Operation Bright Star '85.]]\n[[File:SG DF-ST-86-08093.jpg|thumb|[[Egyptian marines]] aiming a [[SG-43 Goryunov|SG43]] [[medium machine gun]] during Operation Bright Star '85]]\nThe first exercise, Bright Star '81, was conducted from October to December 1980 (fiscal year 1981). U.S. Army's rapid-deployment unit (Task Force \"Strike\", 1st Battalion, [[502nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|502nd Infantry Regiment]]) of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault) and U.S. Air Force personnel were deployed to [[Cairo West Air Base]] in Egypt for the exercise. This operation was the first deployment of combat soldiers into the region since World War II.  Bright Star '81 was initiated by the [[Carter Administration]] in response to the [[Iranian hostage crisis]] as well as Russia's entry into Afghanistan. But the U.S. armed forces were partially unprepared for the exercise.  Soldiers were issued jungle fatigues in lieu of desert camouflage (which was not in the U.S. Army inventory in 1980) and hastily-established air traffic control systems caused the loss of 14 U.S. Air Force personnel when a [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]] crashed attempting to land.  Post-operation briefings affected positive change for future readiness and successful exercises thereafter, said MSG Keefer (retired), the only enlisted member of the debriefing team for Bright Star '81.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe following year, a similar exercise was held using the same ground rules. {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43}} took part in 1982. After Exercise Eastern Wind \u201983, the amphibious portion of Bright Star '83, the [[Los Angeles Times]] was told that \u201cthe exercise failed dismally.\u2026The Somali army did not perform up to any standard,\u201d one diplomat said. \u2026 \u201cThe inefficiency of the Somali armed forces is legendary among foreign military men.\u201d<ref>Charles Mitchell (UPI), \u2018U.S. Losing Interest in Military Bases in Somalia: Port, Airstrip No Longer a Key Part of Plans for Gulf of Aden Emergency\u2019, Los Angeles Times, March 17, 1985.</ref> \n\nBy 1983, the size of the forces involved prompted planners to hold the event every two years rather than annually. The exercise went under further evolution in 1985 with the inclusion of the [[United States Air Force|U.S.]] and [[Egyptian Air Force]]s. The two nations' respective [[Navy|navies]] and [[special forces]] joined the exercise in 1987.\n\nThe Associated Press, in a story dated August 4, 1985, said that U.S. forces would begin their largest exercise in the Middle East ever that day. Egypt, Somalia, Jordan, and Oman were reported as participating.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/05/world/around-the-world-gi-s-in-the-mideast-start-big-war-games.html GI's in the Mideast Start Big War Games], Associated Press, The New York Times, August 5, 1985</ref>\n\n<blockquote> Egypt's Information Ministry confirmed that Bright Star began in Egypt on schedule with activation of command centers and some movement of troops into maneuver areas.\nA Pentagon spokesman in Washington said about 9,000 Americans would take part in the weeklong Egyptian phase, the main part of the exercise. The spokesman said an unspecified smaller number of American soldiers would take part in Somalia and about 520 would join in the Jordanian portion.

His visit to [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]] during then became an embarrassment, where according to [[Hashim Qureshi]], he shared a platform with JKLF . Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of [[Indira Gandhi]] and his father, so that sentiments there could \"be known first hand\", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed [[Khalistan movement|Khalistan]] terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On 2 July 1984, [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah|G. M.

Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Hindus were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged.<ref name=\"Tikoo\">{{cite book|author=Colonel Tej K Tikoo|title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&pg=PT397|publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC|isbn=978-1-935501-58-9|pages=397\u2013}}</ref> An investigation of Anantnag riots revealed that members of the 'secular parties' in the state, rather than the Islamists, had played a key role in organising the violence to gain political mileage through religious sentiments. Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on 12 March 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly.

Many Hindu families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Hindus faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Hindus to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

His visit to [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]] during then became an embarrassment, where according to [[Hashim Qureshi]], he shared a platform with JKLF . Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of [[Indira Gandhi]] and his father, so that sentiments there could \"be known first hand\", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed [[Khalistan movement|Khalistan]] terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On 2 July 1984, [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah|G. M.

Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Hindus were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged.<ref name=\"Tikoo\">{{cite book|author=Colonel Tej K Tikoo|title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&pg=PT397|publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC|isbn=978-1-935501-58-9|pages=397\u2013}}</ref> An investigation of Anantnag riots revealed that members of the 'secular parties' in the state, rather than the Islamists, had played a key role in organising the violence to gain political mileage through religious sentiments. Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on 12 March 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly.

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Hindu families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Hindus faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Hindus to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977.

1943&nbsp;\u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Arias]], with whom he had a son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]]. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.

This important football [[List of association football club rivalries by country|rivalry]] traces its origin back to the later half of the 1910s{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} but did not reach relevance until the 1950s and 60s.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThere is a certain social aspect in the Hammarby - Djurg\u00e5rden rivalry. Hammarby consider [[S\u00f6dermalm]], the southern, originally working-class, district of [[Stockholm City Centre]] where the club was founded, as well as the [[S\u00f6derort|boroughs just south of said district]], their heartland. Djurg\u00e5rden counts [[\u00d6stermalm]], the affluent district that forms the eastern part of the [[Stockholm City Centre|city centre]], and where their former home ground [[Stockholms Stadion|Stadion]] is situated, as their stronghold. (Both clubs also maintain a cross-town rivalry with [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], whose stronghold is the northwestern [[Stockholm urban area]], where their home ground is situated.)\n\nThe two teams did not meet for five years (2010-2014) when Hammarby played in the second tier [[Superettan]] with Djurg\u00e5rden remaining in Allsvenskan. In 2013, both Djurg\u00e5rden and Hammarby moved into the newly built [[Tele2 Arena]] located in [[Johanneshov]], just south of the city centre. This increased tensions significantly between the two sets of fans.\n\nSince the return of Hammarby to the Swedish first tier, [[Allsvenskan]] in 2015, Djurg\u00e5rden has so far recorded one win, two draws and seven losses against Hammarby. A similar dismal performance in the [[Tvillingderbyt|Djurg\u00e5rden \u2013 AIK Derby rivalry]] since 2011 was broken only in the [[Svenska cupen]] semi final in March 2018. This has generated an infected debate among Djurg\u00e5rden fans about the team being affected by a Derby\u2019s Curse (\u201cDerbysp\u00f6ket\u201d, literally \u201cThe Derby ghost\u201d).\n\n==Matches==\n{{Updated|24 September 2017|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/sport/samtliga-derbyresultat-bajen-dif_109382.svd|title=Samtliga derbyresultat Bajen-Dif|website=svd.se|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=773&team2_id=1255&teamTabs=h2h|title=Djurgaardens's Head To Head Stats Against Any Team - Soccer Base|website=www.soccerbase.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bolletinen.se/sfs/java/svcup.htm|title=Matcher i svenska cupen genom tiderna|website=www.bolletinen.se|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://svenskfotboll.se/cuper-och-serier/svenska-cupen-herrar/grupp-6/|title=Tabell och resultat - Svenska Cupen, Grupp 6 \u2014 svenskfotboll.se|website=svenskfotboll.se|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align: center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Matches\n! colspan=\"2\" | Wins\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Draws\n! colspan=\"2\" | Goals\n! rowspan=\"10\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | Home wins\n! colspan=\"2\" | Home draws\n! colspan=\"2\" | Away wins\n|-\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n|-\n| Allsvenskan || 78 || 36 || 31 || 12 || 134 || 115 || 20 || 21 || 10 || 2 || 16 || 10\n|-\n| Division 1 || 4 || 0 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 9 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 2 \n|-\n| Division 2 || 26 || 10 || 7 || 9 || 38 || 37 || 5 || 6 || 5 || 3 || 5 || 3 \n|-\n| Svenska Serien || 6 || 1 || 3 || 2 || 6 || 12 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 0 || 2 \n|-\n| Svenska Cupen || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 4 || 5 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 \n|-\n| Svenska M\u00e4sterskapet || 3 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 10 || 3 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n!

IF]] (9\u20131)\n}}\nThe fixture between [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rdens IF]] and [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]] is a [[local derby]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. This important football [[List of association football club rivalries by country|rivalry]] traces its origin back to the later half of the 1910s{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} but did not reach relevance until the 1950s and 60s.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThere is a certain social aspect in the Hammarby - Djurg\u00e5rden rivalry. Hammarby consider [[S\u00f6dermalm]], the southern, originally working-class, district of [[Stockholm City Centre]] where the club was founded, as well as the [[S\u00f6derort|boroughs just south of said district]], their heartland. Djurg\u00e5rden counts [[\u00d6stermalm]], the affluent district that forms the eastern part of the [[Stockholm City Centre|city centre]], and where their former home ground [[Stockholms Stadion|Stadion]] is situated, as their stronghold. (Both clubs also maintain a cross-town rivalry with [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], whose stronghold is the northwestern [[Stockholm urban area]], where their home ground is situated.)\n\nThe two teams did not meet for five years (2010-2014) when Hammarby played in the second tier [[Superettan]] with Djurg\u00e5rden remaining in Allsvenskan. In 2013, both Djurg\u00e5rden and Hammarby moved into the newly built [[Tele2 Arena]] located in [[Johanneshov]], just south of the city centre. This increased tensions significantly between the two sets of fans.\n\nSince the return of Hammarby to the Swedish first tier, [[Allsvenskan]] in 2015, Djurg\u00e5rden has so far recorded one win, two draws and seven losses against Hammarby. A similar dismal performance in the [[Tvillingderbyt|Djurg\u00e5rden \u2013 AIK Derby rivalry]] since 2011 was broken only in the [[Svenska cupen]] semi final in March 2018. This has generated an infected debate among Djurg\u00e5rden fans about the team being affected by a Derby\u2019s Curse (\u201cDerbysp\u00f6ket\u201d, literally \u201cThe Derby ghost\u201d).\n\n==Matches==\n{{Updated|24 September 2017|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/sport/samtliga-derbyresultat-bajen-dif_109382.svd|title=Samtliga derbyresultat Bajen-Dif|website=svd.se|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=773&team2_id=1255&teamTabs=h2h|title=Djurgaardens's Head To Head Stats Against Any Team - Soccer Base|website=www.soccerbase.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bolletinen.se/sfs/java/svcup.htm|title=Matcher i svenska cupen genom tiderna|website=www.bolletinen.se|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://svenskfotboll.se/cuper-och-serier/svenska-cupen-herrar/grupp-6/|title=Tabell och resultat - Svenska Cupen, Grupp 6 \u2014 svenskfotboll.se|website=svenskfotboll.se|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align: center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Matches\n! colspan=\"2\" | Wins\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Draws\n! colspan=\"2\" | Goals\n! rowspan=\"10\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | Home wins\n! colspan=\"2\" | Home draws\n! colspan=\"2\" | Away wins\n|-\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n! style=\"color:#000080; background:#7EC0EE;\"| Djurg\u00e5rden\n! style=\"color:white; background:#007640;\"| Hammarby\n|-\n| Allsvenskan || 78 || 36 || 31 || 12 || 134 || 115 || 20 || 21 || 10 || 2 || 16 || 10\n|-\n| Division 1 || 4 || 0 || 3 || 1 || 3 || 9 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 2 \n|-\n| Division 2 || 26 || 10 || 7 || 9 || 38 || 37 || 5 || 6 || 5 || 3 || 5 || 3 \n|-\n| Svenska Serien || 6 || 1 || 3 || 2 || 6 || 12 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 0 || 2 \n|-\n| Svenska Cupen || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 4 || 5 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 \n|-\n| Svenska M\u00e4sterskapet || 3 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 10 || 3 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n!

It was first published in 2006 by the Broadway division of [[Random House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Afghan-Campaign-novel-Steven-Pressfield/dp/038551641X|title=Amazon.com: The Afghan Campaign: A novel (9780385516419): Steven Pressfield: Books|publisher=www.amazon.com|accessdate=2009-09-01|last=|first=}}</ref> It is the story of [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of the Afghan kingdoms (the [[Afghanistan]] of today) in 330&nbsp;BC through the eyes of Matthias (\u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 in Greek), a young soldier from [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], who narrates the adventures of the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] army against the [[Orient|Eastern]] warriors. Matthias fights for Alexander the Great's infantry confronting ferocious people who, determined to defend their homeland, follow tough war methods.\n\nMany pages of the book are dedicated to Alexander's army's fight against the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Spitamenes]] (\u03a3\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 in Greek), the ''Wolf of the Desert'', whose army follows the barbarian war method contrary to their rivals who make war in array. Pressfield presents the brutalities and ferocities of both parties while he does not omit to refer to the vanity and voraciousness of [[Alexander the Great]] who in the last pages of the novel marries the [[Bactria]]n [[Roxana|Roxanne]] (\u03a1\u03c9\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 in Greek), daughter of [[Oxyartes]]. Having thus safeguarded his rights in the kingdoms of [[Orient]], he sets off to conquer India crossing the mountains of Indian Caucasus. He leaves behind him many thousands of footmen and horsemen (one fifth of his army) to deter the indigenous people from possible insurrections and outbreaks within the conquered land.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung Matthias from [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] follows his two older brothers\u2019 example and enrolls in Alexander's cavalry together with his close friend Lygaios/Lucas (\u039b\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 in Greek).<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385516419 The Afghan Campaign by Steven Pressfield - Hardcover - Random House], www.randomhouse.com, accessed 1 September 2009</ref> This special convoy departs from [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] and after 125 days of marching meets the rear of Alexander's army. The hero takes part into his first battle and is shocked by the atrocities of his adversaries and his own people as well. Noteworthy is the fact that the enemy, apart from its guerilla methods, recruits women and children to fight for their freedom.\n\nWhile marching, Matthias meets Shinar, an Afghan woman who, having abandoned her own people, offers her services as carrier of the Greek army's supplies. [[Nanguali]] is the [[barbarian]] warrior's code; its three elements are: honour, revenge and hospitality. Their women's honour, if blackened, could be redeemed (turn back into white) only by death.

Matthias fights for Alexander the Great's infantry confronting ferocious people who, determined to defend their homeland, follow tough war methods.\n\nMany pages of the book are dedicated to Alexander's army's fight against the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Spitamenes]] (\u03a3\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 in Greek), the ''Wolf of the Desert'', whose army follows the barbarian war method contrary to their rivals who make war in array. Pressfield presents the brutalities and ferocities of both parties while he does not omit to refer to the vanity and voraciousness of [[Alexander the Great]] who in the last pages of the novel gets married to the [[Bactria]]n [[Roxana|Roxanne]] (\u03a1\u03c9\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 in Greek), daughter of [[Oxyartes]]. Having thus safeguarded his rights in the kingdoms of [[Orient]], he sets off to conquer India crossing the mountains of Indian Caucasus. He leaves behind him many thousands of footmen and horsemen (one fifth of his army) to deter the indigenous people from possible insurrections and outbreaks within the conquered land.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung Matthias from [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] follows his two older brothers\u2019 example and enrolls in Alexander's cavalry together with his close friend Lygaios/Lucas (\u039b\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 in Greek).<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385516419 The Afghan Campaign by Steven Pressfield - Hardcover - Random House], www.randomhouse.com, accessed 1 September 2009</ref> This special convoy departs from [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] and after 125 days of marching meets the rear of Alexander's army.

[[Nanguali]] is the [[barbarian]] warrior's code; its three elements are: honour, revenge and hospitality. Their women's honour, if blackened, could be redeemed (turn back into white) only by death.

An American force supported by a naval flotilla landed on the lake shore to the west and advanced against the town, which was defended by an outnumbered force of regulars, militia and [[Ojibwe|Ojibway]] natives under the overall command of Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]], the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada.\n\nSheaffe's forces were defeated and Sheaffe retreated with his surviving regulars to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], abandoning the militia and civilians. The Americans captured the fort, town and the dockyard. They themselves suffered heavy casualties, including force leader Brigadier General [[Zebulon Pike]] and others killed when the retreating British blew up the fort's magazine.<ref name=peppiatt>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 31B: Fort York|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto|access-date=August 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606040800/http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|archive-date=June 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The American forces subsequently carried out several acts of arson and looting in the town before withdrawing.\n\nThough the Americans won a clear victory, it did not have decisive strategic results as York was a less important objective in military terms than Kingston, where the British armed vessels on Lake Ontario were based.\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:H. M. Sloop of War \u201cSir Isaac Brock\u201d, on the stocks (April, 1813).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Sir Issac Brock}} being built in York. Both sides engaged in building freshwater fleets in an effort to gain [[Engagements on Lake Ontario|naval supremacy in Lake Ontario]].]]\nYork, the capital of [[Upper Canada]], stood on the north shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. During the War of 1812, the lake was both the front line between Upper Canada and the United States, and served as the principal British supply line from [[Quebec City|Quebec]] to the various forces and outposts to the west. At the start of the war, the British had a small naval force, the [[Provincial Marine]], with which they seized control of the Lake Ontario, and [[Lake Erie]]. This made it possible because of Major General [[Isaac Brock]], who led British forces in Upper Canada to several important victories in 1812 by shifting his small force rapidly between threatened points to defeat disjointed American attacks individually.\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] appointed Commodore [[Isaac Chauncey]] to regain control of the lakes. He created a squadron of fighting ships at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]] by purchasing and arming several lake schooners and laying down new purpose-built fighting vessels. However, no decisive action was possible before the onset of winter, during which the ships of both sides were confined to harbour by ice. To match Chauncey's shipbuilding efforts, the British laid down the [[sloop of war]], {{HMS|Wolfe|1813|2}}, at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]; and {{HMS|Sir Isaac Brock}}, at [[Naval Shipyards, York (Upper Canada)|York Naval Shipyards]].\n\n==Prelude==\n===American planning===\nOn January 13, 1813, [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] was appointed [[United States Secretary of War]]. Having been a serving soldier, he quickly appreciated the situation on Lake Ontario, and devised a plan by which a force of 7,000 regular soldiers would be concentrated at Sackett's Harbor on April 1. Working together with Chauncey's squadron, this force would capture Kingston before the [[Saint Lawrence River]] thawed and substantial British reinforcements could arrive in Upper Canada. The capture of Kingston and the destruction of the [[Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard]] together with most of the vessels of the Provincial Marine, would make almost every British post west of Kingston vulnerable if not untenable.<ref>Hitsman, p. 136</ref> After Kingston was captured, the Americans would then capture the British positions at York and [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]], at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]].\n[[File:John Armstrong Jr Rembrandt Peale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[United States Secretary of War]] [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] originally planned for an attack on [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], but later acquiesced to changes that made [[York, Upper Canada|York]] the attack's target.]]\nArmstrong conferred with Major General [[Henry Dearborn]], commander of the American ''Army of the North'', at [[Albany, New York]] during February. Both Dearborn and Chauncey agreed with Armstrong's plan at this point, but they subsequently had second thoughts. That month, Lieutenant General Sir [[George Pr\u00e9vost]], the British [[Governor General of Canada]], travelled up the frozen Saint Lawrence to visit Upper Canada. This visit was made necessary because Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]], who had succeeded Brock as [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]], was ill and unable to perform his various duties. Pr\u00e9vost was accompanied only by a few small detachments of reinforcements, which participated in the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]] en route. Nevertheless, both Chauncey and Dearborn believed that Pr\u00e9vost's arrival indicated an imminent attack on Sackett's Harbor, and reported that Kingston now had a garrison of 6,000 or more British regulars.\n\nEven though Pr\u00e9vost soon returned to Lower Canada, and deserters and pro-American Canadian civilians reported that the true size of Kingston's garrison was 600 regulars and 1,400 militia,<ref name=Humphries254>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 254</ref> Chauncey and Dearborn chose to accept the earlier inflated figure. Furthermore, even after two brigades of troops under Brigadier General [[Zebulon Pike]] reinforced the troops at Sackett's Harbor after a gruelling winter march from [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]], the number of effective troops available to Dearborn fell far short of the 7,000 planned, mainly as a result of sickness and exposure. During March, Chauncey and Dearborn recommended to Armstrong that when the ice on the lake thawed, they should attack the less well-defended town of York instead of Kingston. Although York was the Provincial capital of Upper Canada, it was far less important than Kingston as a military objective. Historians such as John R. Elting have pointed out that this change of plan effectively reversed Armstrong's original strategy, and by committing the bulk of the American forces at the western end of Lake Ontario, it left Sackett's Harbor vulnerable to an attack by British reinforcements arriving from Lower Canada.\n\nArmstrong, by now back in Washington, nevertheless acquiesced in this change of plan as Dearborn might well have better local information.<ref>Elting, p. 94</ref> Armstrong also believed that an easy victory at York would provide the government with a significant propaganda coup, as well as bolster support for the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] for the gubernational election in New York.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}}\n\nThe attack was originally planned to commence in early April, although a long winter delayed the attack on York by several weeks, threatening the political value of such an attack. In an attempt to overcome these delays, Democratic-Republicans supporters circulated proclamations of victory prior to the battle to the New York electorate.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}} The American naval squadron first attempted to depart from Sackets Harbor on April 23, 1813, although an incoming storm forced the squadron back to harbour, in order to wait out the storm. The squadron finally departed on April 24, 1813.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}}\n\n===British preparations===\nThe town was not heavily fortified, with insufficient resources preventing the construction of necessary works needed to adequately defend it.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}} As a result, Sheaffe had instructed government officials in early April 1813 to hide legislative papers in the forest and fields behind York, to ensure they would not be seized in the event of an attack.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}}\n[[File:Design of the town of York blockhouses, 1799 -a.jpg|thumb|left|Designs of the [[blockhouse]]s that were built to defend York, c. 1799.]]\nYork's defences included the town's [[blockhouse]] situated near the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]], blockhouses at [[Fort York]] garrison to the west of the town, and another [[Gibraltar Point Blockhouse|blockhouse at Gibraltar Point]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} The settlement was also defended by three batteries at the fort and the nearby \"Government House Battery\" which mounted two 12-pounder guns. Another battery, known as the Western Battery was located {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1}} west of the fort, in present day [[Exhibition Place]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} The crude Western Battery had two obsolete 18-pounder [[artillery|guns]]. These guns originated from earlier conflicts, and had been disabled by having their [[trunnion]]s removed, but they were fixed to crude log carriages and could still be fired.<ref name=Hitsman138>Hitsman, p. 138</ref>\n\nFort York was also defended by a western wall, and a small unarmed [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] between the fort and the Western Battery.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} About a dozen cannons, including older condemned models, were mounted in these positions, in addition to two-6-pounders on field carriages.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} Further west were the ruins of [[Fort Rouill\u00e9]], and the Half Moon Battery, neither of which was in use.<ref name=Humphries254/>\n\nSheaffe was at York to conduct public business. He was originally scheduled to leave the settlement for [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] but had postponed his departure due to suspicions of an American assault on York.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=41\u201342}} His regulars, most of whom were also passing through York en route to other posts,{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=41\u201342}} consisted of two companies (including the grenadier company) of the 1st battalion [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th Regiment of Foot]], a company of the [[Glengarry Light Infantry|Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles]], a company-sized detachment of the [[Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Royal Newfoundland Fencibles]],{{sfn|Hitsman|1995|p=138}} a small squad from the [[49th Regiment of Foot]], and thirteen soldiers from the [[Royal Artillery]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} There were also 40 or 50 [[Mississaugas]] and [[Ojibwe]] warriors, and the [[Canadian militia]]. The Militia was ordered to assemble, but only 300 of the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the [[York Militia]], and the Incorporated Militia,{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} could be mustered at short notice.\n[[File:Battle of York.jpg|thumb|The blockhouse near the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] in 1813. Most of the militia, and the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th Regiment of Foot]] were positioned there prior to the battle.]]\nThe American naval squadron was spotted by British sentries posted at the [[Scarborough Bluffs]] on April 26, who alerted the town and its defenders using [[flag signals]] and signal guns.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} Sheaffe expected the Americans to launch a two-pronged attack, with the main American landing to the west of Fort York, and another landing in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] to cut off a potential retreat to Kingston. To counteract this, Sheaffe concentrated his forces at Fort York, and the town's blockhouse. Most of his [[regular army|regulars]], [[Fencibles]], [[First Nations|Native]] warriors, and a small number of militiamen assembled at the fort, while most of the militia and the companies of the 8th Regiment of Foot positioned themselves at the town's blockhouse.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n\n==Battle==\nThe Americans appeared off York late on April 26. Chauncey's squadron consisted of a ship-rigged [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and twelve [[schooner]]s. The embarked force commanded by Brigadier General Zebulon Pike numbered between 1,600 and 1,800, mainly from the 6th, 15th, 16th and 21st U.S. Infantry, and the 3rd U.S. Artillery fighting as infantry.<ref>Colonel [[Ichabod Crane (Colonel)|Ichabod Crane]] commanded Company B, 3rd U.S. Artillery.</ref> Dearborn, the overall army commander, remained aboard the corvette ''[[USS Madison (1812)|Madison]]'' during the action. \n\nEarly on April 27, the first American wave of boats, carrying 300 soldiers of Major [[Benjamin Forsyth]]'s company of the [[1st Regiment of Riflemen|U.S. 1st Rifle Regiment]], landed about {{convert|6.4|km|mi|0}} west of the town, supported by some of Chauncey's schooners firing [[grapeshot]]. The American force intended to land at a clear field, west of Fort York, although strong winds pushed their landing craft {{convert|3.2|km|mi|0}} west of their desired landing site, towards a wooded coastline.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} Forsyth's riflemen were opposed only by Native warriors, led by [[Indian Agent (Canada)|Indian Agent]] [[James Givins]], as well as the grenadier company of the 8th Regiment of Foot, who were dispatched to the area by Sheaffe.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} The Native force was the only force that initially engaged the American landing. With American cannon fire threatening the roads on the waterfront, the British units dispatched from Fort York had to traverse through the forest behind the waterfront; and were unable to reach the landing site before the Americans started their landings.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n[[File:Battle of York II.jpg|thumb|left|330px|Position of the American and British forces at York during the American landing.<ref name=Lossing>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=590}}</ref>]]\nSheaffe had also ordered a company of the Glengarry Light Infantry to support the Native force at the landing, but they became lost in the outskirts of the town, having been misdirected by Major-General [[\u00c6neas Shaw]], the [[Adjutant General]] of the Canadian Militia, who took some of the militia north onto [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] to prevent any wide American [[flanking maneuver]].<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 255</ref> After it became apparent that no landing would occur east of the settlement, Sheaffe recalled the companies of the 8th Regiment of Foot from the town's blockhouse.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n\nAs the landings progressed, the British-Native force was outflanked and began to fall back into the woods. The US 15th Infantry Regiment was the second American unit to land, with bayonets fixed, under a hail of fire, shortly followed by Pike, who assumed personal command of the landing.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Sheaffe arrived with the rest of the 8th Regiment of Foot, the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, and a few dozen militiamen, after the US 15th Infantry Regiment's had landed.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} The grenadier company of the 8th Regiment of Foot charged them with the [[bayonet]].<ref name=Hitsman138/> The grenadiers were already outnumbered and were repulsed with heavy loss. Pike ordered an advance by platoons, supported by two 6-pounder field guns, which steadily drove back Sheaffe's force. After Sheaffe failed to get the Fenicibles to renew their advance, the British force began to withdraw, with the newly arrived Glengarry Light Infantry covering the retreat.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}}\n\nDuring these landings, the American naval squadron bombarded the four gun batteries defending York.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Chauncey's schooners, most of which carried a long 24-pounder or 32-pounder cannon, also bombarded the fort and Government House battery; with Chauncey himself was directing them from a small boat. British return fire was ineffective.\n[[File:Death of General Pike at the Battle of York.jpg|right|thumb|Brig. Gen.

The majority of American casualties originated from the explosion at the fort's powder magazine. An archaeological dig in 2012 unearthed evidence that the destruction of the magazine and the impact it had on American soldiers was a result of poor position, and bad luck. The Americans just happened to be at the exact distance of the shock wave and its debris field.<ref name=expl>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/16/war-of-1812-explodes-on-tv/|title=War of 1812 explodes on TV|date=June 16, 2012|website=News.nationalpost.com|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe British loss was officially reported by Sheaffe as 59 killed, 34 wounded, 43 wounded prisoners, 10 captured and 7 missing, for a total of 153 casualties.<ref name=\"Cruikshank215-216\">Cruikshank, pp. 215\u2013216</ref> However, historian Robert Malcomson has found this return to be inaccurate: it did not include militia, sailors, dockyard workers or Native Americans and was incorrect even as to the casualties of the regulars.

Robinson assisted two other officers from the militia during their negotiations for surrender.]]\nColonel William Chewett and Major William Allen of the 3rd York Regiment of militia tried to arrange a capitulation, assisted by Captain [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Beverley Robinson]], the acting [[Attorney General of Ontario|Attorney General of Upper Canada]]. The process took time. The Americans were angry over their losses, particularly because they believed that the ship and fort had been destroyed after negotiations for surrender had already begun.{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=118}} Nevertheless, Colonel Mitchell of the 3rd U.S. Artillery agreed to terms. While they waited for Dearborn and Chauncey to ratify the terms, the surrendered militia were held prisoner in a blockhouse without food or medical attention for the few wounded. Forsyth's company of the 1st U.S. Rifle Regiment was left as guard in the town. At this stage, few Americans had entered the town.\n\nThe next morning, the terms had still not been ratified, since Dearborn had refused to leave the corvette ''[[USS Madison (1812)|Madison]]''. When he eventually did, Reverend [[John Strachan]] (who held no official position other than [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of York at the time) first brusquely tried to force him to sign the articles for capitulation on the spot, then accused Chauncey to his face of delaying the capitulation to allow the American troops licence to commit outrages.<ref name=Humphries261>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 261</ref> Eventually, Dearborn formally agreed to the articles for surrender. The official terms of surrender permitted civil servants to continue carrying out their duties, and surgeons to treat British wounded.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=58}} As a part of the terms of surrender, any troops remaining in York became [[prisoners of war]], although those serving in the militia were \"paroled,\" allowing them to return home, so long as they not rejoin the conflict until an official prisoner exchange had secured their \"release\".{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=58}} Members of the York Militia were ordered to relinquish their arms, and proceed to Fort York garrison. The officers of the militia were subsequently released on \"parole,\" although the rest of the militia remained imprisoned for two days.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=60}} Kept without food, water, or medical attention, the imprisoned militia was eventually released at the behest of Strachan.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=60}}\n\nThe Americans took over the dockyard, where they captured a brig ({{HMS|Duke of Gloucester|1807|2}}) in poor state of repair, and twenty 24-pounder [[carronade]]s and other stores intended for the British squadron on [[Lake Erie]]. ''Sir Isaac Brock'' was beyond salvage. The Americans had missed another ship-rigged vessel, {{ship||Prince Regent|1812 schooner|2}}, which carried 16 guns, as she sailed for Kingston to collect ordnance two days before the Americans had been sighted.<ref>Forester, p. 124</ref> The Americans also demanded and received several thousand pounds in Army Bills, which had been in the keeping of [[Prideaux Selby]], the Receiver General of Upper Canada, who was mortally ill.\n\n===Burning of York===\n[[File:First Upper Canada Parliament, destroyed in the war of 1812 -b.jpg|thumb|The first [[Ontario Legislative Building|building]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]], along with a number of other buildings was set ablaze in the days after the battle.]]\nBetween April 28 and 30, American troops carried out many acts of plunder. Some of them set fire to the [[Ontario Legislative Building#History|buildings]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|Legislative Assembly]], and [[Government House (Ontario)|Government House]], home to the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. It was alleged that the American troops had found a scalp there,<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 264</ref> though folklore had it that the \"scalp\" was actually the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker]]'s wig.

Other Americans looted empty houses on the pretext that their absent owners were militia who had not given their parole as required by the articles of capitulation. The homes of Canadians connected with the Natives, including that of James Givins, were also looted regardless of their owners' status.<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 265</ref> Sheaffe was later to allege that local settlers had unlawfully come into possession of Government-owned farming tools or other stores looted and discarded by the Americans, and demanded that they be handed back.<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, pp. 267\u2013268</ref>\n\nDuring the looting, several officers under Chauncey's command took books from York's first subscription library. After finding out his officers were in possession of looted library books, Chauncey had the books packed in two crates, and returned to York. However, by the time the books arrived, the library had closed, and the books were auctioned off in 1822.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/local-history-genealogy/2018/11/the-battle-of-york-april-1813.html|title=War of 1812: The Battle of York|publisher=Toronto Public Library|year=2019|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe looting of York occurred in spite of Pike's earlier orders that outlined all civilian property be respected, with any soldier convicted of such transgressions be executed.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} Dearborn similarly emphatically denied giving orders for any buildings to be destroyed and deplored the worst of the atrocities in his letters, but he was nonetheless unable or unwilling to rein in his soldiers. Dearborn himself was embarrassed by the looting, as it made a mockery of the terms of surrender he arranged. His soldiers' disregard for the terms he arranged, and local civil leaders' continued protest against them, made Dearborn eager to leave York as soon as all the captured stores were transported.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=59}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Americans occupied the town for nearly two weeks. They sent the captured military stores, including 20 artillery pieces,{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=84}} away on May 2 but were then penned in [[Toronto Harbour|York harbour]] by a gale. Chauncey's vessels were so overcrowded with troops that only half of them could go below decks to escape the rain at any time.{{sfn|Hitsman|1995|p=141}} They left York on May 8, departing for the [[Niagara peninsula]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}} where they required several weeks to recuperate. Sheaffe's troops endured an equally miserable fourteen-day retreat overland to Kingston.{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=118}}\n\nAround 300 to 400 [[Iroquois]] warriors assembled and marched towards York shortly after the battle, to launch an attack on the American garrison.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}} They were only {{convert|50|km|mi}} west of York, in present day [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], when they learned that the Americans had departed York, and the expedition was called off.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}}\n\n===Effects on the war===\n[[File:Rogerhalesheaffe.jpg|thumb|upright|As a result of the battle, Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]] was relieved of his military command in [[Upper Canada]].]]\nMany members of the Provincial Assembly and other prominent citizens severely criticized Sheaffe, both for his conduct generally and during the fighting at York. For example, Militia officers Chewitt and Allan, the Reverend Strachan and others wrote to Governor General Pr\u00e9vost on May 8, that Sheaffe \"...kept too far from his troops after retreating from the woods, never cheered or animated them, nor showed by his personal conduct that he was hearty in the cause.\"<ref>Hitsman, pp. 140, 333(en)</ref> Sheaffe lost his military and public offices in Upper Canada as the result of his defeat.\n\nHowever, the Americans had not inflicted crippling damage on the Provincial Marine on Lake Ontario, and they admitted that by preserving his small force of regulars rather than sacrificing them in a fight against heavy odds, Sheaffe had robbed them of decisive victory. Secretary of War Armstrong wrote, \"...we cannot doubt but that in all cases in which a British commander is compelled to act defensively, his policy will be that adopted by Sheaffe \u2013 to prefer the preservation of his troops to that of his post, and thus carrying off the kernel leave us the shell.\"<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 269</ref>\n\nThe effects of the capture of York were probably most significant on [[Lake Erie]], since the capture of the ordnance and supplies destined for the British squadron there contributed to the defeat of the British squadron at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]].{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=59}} However, most of the naval supplies captured were not used by the Americans, who abandoned a portion of the captured goods before they departed from York, while the remaining supplies were set on fire during the [[Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor]] in May 1813.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=64}}\n\n====Societal consequences====\nAs the American attack on York occurred on the first of New York's three-day election period, the battle did not directly benefit the Democratic-Republic Party as Armstrong had originally envisioned.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=63}} However, early proclamations of victory issued prior to the battle, did contribute to the reelection of [[Daniel D. Tompkins]], the Democratic-Republican candidate for the [[Governor of New York]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=63}}\n\nAccording to [[Pierre Berton]], the battle, and occupation of York served as a watershed moment for the settlers of York. Those who fought the Americans became celebrated in the local community, while those who aided the occupation were viewed by the community as traitors.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=60}} The documentary film ''Explosion 1812'' argues that the battle had a much greater impact than previously assumed. The mistreatment by US forces of the civilian Canadian population, dogged resistance by militia and the burning of British symbols and buildings after the battle led to a hardening of Canadian popular opinion.<ref name=expl/>\n\nSeveral commentators viewed the American transgressions at York as justification for the British [[Burning of Washington]] later in the war. Pr\u00e9vost wrote that \"as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate\".{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=220}} Strachan wrote to [[Thomas Jefferson]] that the damage to Washington \"was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada\".{{sfn|Hitsman|Graves|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\n==Later attacks==\n===Second incursion, July 1813===\nChauncey and Dearborn subsequently won the [[Battle of Fort George]] on the Niagara peninsula, but they had left Sacket's Harbor defended only by a few troops, mainly militia. When reinforcements from the [[Royal Navy]] commanded by Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] arrived in Kingston, Yeo almost immediately embarked some troops commanded by Pr\u00e9vost and attacked Sackett's Harbor. Although the British were repelled by the defenders at the [[Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor]], Chauncey immediately withdrew into Sacket's Harbor until mid-July, when a new heavy [[sloop of war]] had been completed.\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott, ca.

The plaque reads:\n\n<blockquote>On the morning of July 31, 1813, a U.S. invasion fleet appeared off York (Toronto) after having withdrawn from a planned attack on British positions at Burlington Heights. That afternoon 300 American soldiers came ashore near here. Their landing was unopposed: there were no British regulars in town, and York's militia had withdrawn from further combat in return for its freedom during the American invasion three months earlier. The invaders seized food and military supplies, then re-embarked. The next day they returned to investigate collaborators' reports that valuable stores were concealed up the Don River. Unsuccessful in their search, the Americans contented themselves with burning military installations on nearby Gibraltar Point before they departed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=4534|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090950/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=4534|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015|title=DHH - Memorials Details Search Results|date=April 2, 2015|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Third incursion, August 1814===\nIn the months after the second American incursion into York, the defences around the harbour were significantly improved, as the British needed to protect a four-vessel squadron that would be stationed at the town's harbour.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}} On August 6, 1814, the American Lake Ontario squadron pursued [[Governor Simcoe (1793 ship)|HMS ''Magnet'']], before its captain set fire to the ship, preventing its capture.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}} Suspecting the ship sailed from York, the American naval squadron made its way to the settlement in order to evaluate the situation, and if any more ships may be captured there.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}}\n\nArriving near York's harbour, the American squadron dispatched {{USS|Lady of the Lake|1813|6}} to negotiate under a [[white flag]], in a ploy to evaluate the town's defences. However, the militia stationed at Fort York opened fire at the schooner, who returned fire, before withdrawing to rejoin the American squadron.{{sfn|Benn|1993|73}} The 8th Regiment of Foot, and the [[82nd Regiment of Foot]] were sent to York in an effort to bolster the town's defences.

An American force supported by a naval flotilla landed on the lake shore to the west and advanced against the town, which was defended by an outnumbered force of regulars, militia and [[Ojibwe|Ojibway]] natives under the overall command of Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]], the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada.\n\nSheaffe's forces were defeated and Sheaffe retreated with his surviving regulars to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], abandoning the militia and civilians. The Americans captured the fort, town and the dockyard. They themselves suffered heavy casualties, including force leader Brigadier General [[Zebulon Pike]] and others killed when the retreating British blew up the fort's magazine.<ref name=peppiatt>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 31B: Fort York|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto|access-date=August 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606040800/http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|archive-date=June 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The American forces subsequently carried out several acts of arson and looting in the town before withdrawing.\n\nThough the Americans won a clear victory, it did not have decisive strategic results as York was a less important objective in military terms than Kingston, where the British armed vessels on Lake Ontario were based.\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:H. M. Sloop of War \u201cSir Isaac Brock\u201d, on the stocks (April, 1813).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Sir Issac Brock}} being built in York. Both sides engaged in building freshwater fleets in an effort to gain [[Engagements on Lake Ontario|naval supremacy in Lake Ontario]].]]\nYork, the capital of [[Upper Canada]], stood on the north shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. During the War of 1812, the lake was both the front line between Upper Canada and the United States, and served as the principal British supply line from [[Quebec City|Quebec]] to the various forces and outposts to the west. At the start of the war, the British had a small naval force, the [[Provincial Marine]], with which they seized control of the Lake Ontario, and [[Lake Erie]]. This made it possible because of Major General [[Isaac Brock]], who led British forces in Upper Canada to several important victories in 1812 by shifting his small force rapidly between threatened points to defeat disjointed American attacks individually.\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] appointed Commodore [[Isaac Chauncey]] to regain control of the lakes. He created a squadron of fighting ships at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]] by purchasing and arming several lake schooners and laying down new purpose-built fighting vessels. However, no decisive action was possible before the onset of winter, during which the ships of both sides were confined to harbour by ice. To match Chauncey's shipbuilding efforts, the British laid down the [[sloop of war]], {{HMS|Wolfe|1813|2}}, at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]; and {{HMS|Sir Isaac Brock}}, at [[Naval Shipyards, York (Upper Canada)|York Naval Shipyards]].\n\n==Prelude==\n===American planning===\nOn January 13, 1813, [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] was appointed [[United States Secretary of War]]. Having been a serving soldier, he quickly appreciated the situation on Lake Ontario, and devised a plan by which a force of 7,000 regular soldiers would be concentrated at Sackett's Harbor on April 1. Working together with Chauncey's squadron, this force would capture Kingston before the [[Saint Lawrence River]] thawed and substantial British reinforcements could arrive in Upper Canada. The capture of Kingston and the destruction of the [[Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard]] together with most of the vessels of the Provincial Marine, would make almost every British post west of Kingston vulnerable if not untenable.<ref>Hitsman, p. 136</ref> After Kingston was captured, the Americans would then capture the British positions at York and [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]], at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]].\n[[File:John Armstrong Jr Rembrandt Peale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[United States Secretary of War]] [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] originally planned for an attack on [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], but later acquiesced to changes that made [[York, Upper Canada|York]] the attack's target.]]\nArmstrong conferred with Major General [[Henry Dearborn]], commander of the American ''Army of the North'', at [[Albany, New York]] during February. Both Dearborn and Chauncey agreed with Armstrong's plan at this point, but they subsequently had second thoughts. That month, Lieutenant General Sir [[George Pr\u00e9vost]], the British [[Governor General of Canada]], travelled up the frozen Saint Lawrence to visit Upper Canada. This visit was made necessary because Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]], who had succeeded Brock as [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]], was ill and unable to perform his various duties. Pr\u00e9vost was accompanied only by a few small detachments of reinforcements, which participated in the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]] en route. Nevertheless, both Chauncey and Dearborn believed that Pr\u00e9vost's arrival indicated an imminent attack on Sackett's Harbor, and reported that Kingston now had a garrison of 6,000 or more British regulars.\n\nEven though Pr\u00e9vost soon returned to Lower Canada, and deserters and pro-American Canadian civilians reported that the true size of Kingston's garrison was 600 regulars and 1,400 militia,<ref name=Humphries254>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 254</ref> Chauncey and Dearborn chose to accept the earlier inflated figure. Furthermore, even after two brigades of troops under Brigadier General [[Zebulon Pike]] reinforced the troops at Sackett's Harbor after a gruelling winter march from [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]], the number of effective troops available to Dearborn fell far short of the 7,000 planned, mainly as a result of sickness and exposure. During March, Chauncey and Dearborn recommended to Armstrong that when the ice on the lake thawed, they should attack the less well-defended town of York instead of Kingston. Although York was the Provincial capital of Upper Canada, it was far less important than Kingston as a military objective. Historians such as John R. Elting have pointed out that this change of plan effectively reversed Armstrong's original strategy, and by committing the bulk of the American forces at the western end of Lake Ontario, it left Sackett's Harbor vulnerable to an attack by British reinforcements arriving from Lower Canada.\n\nArmstrong, by now back in Washington, nevertheless acquiesced in this change of plan as Dearborn might well have better local information.<ref>Elting, p. 94</ref> Armstrong also believed that an easy victory at York would provide the government with a significant propaganda coup, as well as bolster support for the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] for the gubernational election in New York.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}}\n\nThe attack was originally planned to commence in early April, although a long winter delayed the attack on York by several weeks, threatening the political value of such an attack. In an attempt to overcome these delays, Democratic-Republicans supporters circulated proclamations of victory prior to the battle to the New York electorate.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}} The American naval squadron first attempted to depart from Sackets Harbor on April 23, 1813, although an incoming storm forced the squadron back to harbour, in order to wait out the storm. The squadron finally departed on April 24, 1813.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}}\n\n===British preparations===\nThe town was not heavily fortified, with insufficient resources preventing the construction of necessary works needed to adequately defend it.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}} As a result, Sheaffe had instructed government officials in early April 1813 to hide legislative papers in the forest and fields behind York, to ensure they would not be seized in the event of an attack.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}}\n[[File:Design of the town of York blockhouses, 1799 -a.jpg|thumb|left|Designs of the [[blockhouse]]s that were built to defend York, c. 1799.]]\nYork's defences included the town's [[blockhouse]] situated near the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]], blockhouses at [[Fort York]] garrison to the west of the town, and another [[Gibraltar Point Blockhouse|blockhouse at Gibraltar Point]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} The settlement was also defended by three batteries at the fort and the nearby \"Government House Battery\" which mounted two 12-pounder guns. Another battery, known as the Western Battery was located {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1}} west of the fort, in present day [[Exhibition Place]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} The crude Western Battery had two obsolete 18-pounder [[artillery|guns]]. These guns originated from earlier conflicts, and had been disabled by having their [[trunnion]]s removed, but they were fixed to crude log carriages and could still be fired.<ref name=Hitsman138>Hitsman, p. 138</ref>\n\nFort York was also defended by a western wall, and a small unarmed [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] between the fort and the Western Battery.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} About a dozen cannons, including older condemned models, were mounted in these positions, in addition to two-6-pounders on field carriages.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} Further west were the ruins of [[Fort Rouill\u00e9]], and the Half Moon Battery, neither of which was in use.<ref name=Humphries254/>\n\nSheaffe was at York to conduct public business. He was originally scheduled to leave the settlement for [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] but had postponed his departure due to suspicions of an American assault on York.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=41\u201342}} His regulars, most of whom were also passing through York en route to other posts,{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=41\u201342}} consisted of two companies (including the grenadier company) of the 1st battalion [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th Regiment of Foot]], a company of the [[Glengarry Light Infantry|Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles]], a company-sized detachment of the [[Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Royal Newfoundland Fencibles]],{{sfn|Hitsman|1995|p=138}} a small squad from the [[49th Regiment of Foot]], and thirteen soldiers from the [[Royal Artillery]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} There were also 40 or 50 [[Mississaugas]] and [[Ojibwe]] warriors, and the [[Canadian militia]]. The Militia was ordered to assemble, but only 300 of the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the [[York Militia]], and the Incorporated Militia,{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} could be mustered at short notice.\n[[File:Battle of York.jpg|thumb|The blockhouse near the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] in 1813. Most of the militia, and the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th Regiment of Foot]] were positioned there prior to the battle.]]\nThe American naval squadron was spotted by British sentries posted at the [[Scarborough Bluffs]] on April 26, who alerted the town and its defenders using [[flag signals]] and signal guns.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} Sheaffe expected the Americans to launch a two-pronged attack, with the main American landing to the west of Fort York, and another landing in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] to cut off a potential retreat to Kingston. To counteract this, Sheaffe concentrated his forces at Fort York, and the town's blockhouse. Most of his [[regular army|regulars]], [[Fencibles]], [[First Nations|Native]] warriors, and a small number of militiamen assembled at the fort, while most of the militia and the companies of the 8th Regiment of Foot positioned themselves at the town's blockhouse.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n\n==Battle==\nThe Americans appeared off York late on April 26. Chauncey's squadron consisted of a ship-rigged [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and twelve [[schooner]]s. The embarked force commanded by Brigadier General Zebulon Pike numbered between 1,600 and 1,800, mainly from the 6th, 15th, 16th and 21st U.S. Infantry, and the 3rd U.S. Artillery fighting as infantry.<ref>Colonel [[Ichabod Crane (Colonel)|Ichabod Crane]] commanded Company B, 3rd U.S. Artillery.</ref> Dearborn, the overall army commander, remained aboard the corvette ''[[USS Madison (1812)|Madison]]'' during the action. \n\nEarly on April 27, the first American wave of boats, carrying 300 soldiers of Major [[Benjamin Forsyth]]'s company of the [[1st Regiment of Riflemen|U.S. 1st Rifle Regiment]], landed about {{convert|6.4|km|mi|0}} west of the town, supported by some of Chauncey's schooners firing [[grapeshot]]. The American force intended to land at a clear field, west of Fort York, although strong winds pushed their landing crafts {{convert|3.2|km|mi|0}} west of their desired landing site, towards a wooded coastline.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} Forsyth's riflemen were opposed only by Native warriors, led by [[Indian Agent (Canada)|Indian Agent]] [[James Givins]], as well as the grenadier company of the 8th Regiment of Foot, who were dispatched to the area by Sheaffe.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} The Native force was the only force that initially engaged the American landing. With American cannon fire threatening the roads on the waterfront, the British units dispatched from Fort York had to traverse through the forest behind the waterfront; and were unable to reach the landing site before the Americans started their landings.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n[[File:Battle of York II.jpg|thumb|left|330px|Position of the American and British forces at York during the American landing.<ref name=Lossing>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=590}}</ref>]]\nSheaffe had also ordered a company of the Glengarry Light Infantry to support the Native force at the landing, but they became lost in the outskirts of the town, having been misdirected by Major-General [[\u00c6neas Shaw]], the [[Adjutant General]] of the Canadian Militia, who took some of the militia north onto [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] to prevent any wide American [[flanking maneuver]].<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 255</ref> After it became apparent that no landing would occur east of the settlement, Sheaffe recalled the companies of the 8th Regiment of Foot from the town's blockhouse.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n\nAs the landings progressed, the British-Native force was outflanked and began to fall back into the woods. The US 15th Infantry Regiment was the second American unit to land, with bayonets fixed, under a hail of fire, shortly followed by Pike, who assumed personal command of the landing.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Sheaffe arrived with the rest of the 8th Regiment of Foot, the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, and a few dozen militiamen, after the US 15th Infantry Regiment's had landed.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} The grenadier company of the 8th Regiment of Foot charged them with the [[bayonet]].<ref name=Hitsman138/> The grenadiers were already outnumbered and were repulsed with heavy loss. Pike ordered an advance by platoons, supported by two 6-pounder field guns, which steadily drove back Sheaffe's force. After Sheaffe failed to get the Fenicibles to renew their advance, the British force began to withdraw, with the newly arrived Glengarry Light Infantry covering the retreat.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}}\n\nDuring these landings, the American naval squadron bombarded the four gun batteries defending York.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Chauncey's schooners, most of which carried a long 24-pounder or 32-pounder cannon, also bombarded the fort and Government House battery; with Chauncey himself was directing them from a small boat. British return fire was ineffective.\n[[File:Death of General Pike at the Battle of York.jpg|right|thumb|Brig. Gen. [[Zebulon Pike]] was mortally wounded near the end of the battle, struck by debris from an explosion set off at the [[Fort York|fort]]'s magazine.]]\n\nThe British tried to rally around the Western battery, but the battery's travelling magazine (a portable chest containing cartridges) exploded, apparently as the result of an accident.<ref>Hitsman, p. 332, fn</ref> This caused further loss (including 20 killed) and confusion among the British regulars, and they fell back to a ravine north of the fort, where the militia were forming up at [[Garrison Creek (Ontario)|Garrison Creek]].{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Sheaffe decided that the battle was lost and ordered the regulars to retreat, setting fire to the wooden bridge over the River Don east of the town to thwart pursuit. The militia and several prominent citizens were left ''\"standing in the street like a parcel of sheep\"''.<ref name=Humphries258>John Beikie, Sheriff of York, quoted in Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 258</ref> Sheaffe instructed the militia to make the best terms they could with the Americans, but without informing the senior militia officers or any official of the legislature, he also dispatched Captain Tito LeLi\u00e8vre of the Royal Newfoundland<ref name=Malcomson215>Malcomson, ''Capital in Flames'', p. 215</ref> to set fire to the sloop of war HMS ''Sir Isaac Brock'' under construction at York's Naval Shipyard, and to blow up the fort's magazine.<ref name=Hitsman140>Hitsman, p. 140</ref><ref name=Malcomson225>Malcomson, ''Capital in Flames'', p. 225</ref>\n\nBy 1:00 pm, the Americans were {{convert|200|yd|m|0}} from the fort, and preparing to bombard the fort, in conjunction with the naval squadron.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} The British had left the flag flying over the fort as a ruse, and Pike was questioning a prisoner as to how many troops were defending it. However, shortly after the bombardment began, the 300 barrels of gunpowder from the fort's magazine exploded.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=84}} Rigged to explode by the retreating British, the resulting explosion threw debris over a {{convert|500|yd|m|1}} radius.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=84}} Pike was mortally injured by flying stones and debris. The explosion also killed 37 other American soldiers, and wounded 222.<ref>Malcomson, ''Lords of the Lake'', p. 107</ref>\n\n===Casualties===\nThe American loss for the entire battle was officially reported as 52 killed and 254 wounded for the Army and 3 killed and 11 wounded for the Navy, for a total of 55 killed and 265 wounded. The majority of American casualties originated from the explosion at the fort's powder magazine. An archaeological dig in 2012 unearthed evidence that the destruction of the magazine and the impact it had on American soldiers was a result of poor position, and bad luck. The Americans just happened to be at the exact distance of the shock wave and its debris field.<ref name=expl>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/16/war-of-1812-explodes-on-tv/|title=War of 1812 explodes on TV|date=June 16, 2012|website=News.nationalpost.com|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe British loss was officially reported by Sheaffe as 59 killed, 34 wounded, 43 wounded prisoners, 10 captured and 7 missing, for a total of 153 casualties.<ref name=\"Cruikshank215-216\">Cruikshank, pp. 215\u2013216</ref> However, historian Robert Malcomson has found this return to be inaccurate: it did not include militia, sailors, dockyard workers or Native Americans and was incorrect even as to the casualties of the regulars. Malcomson demonstrates that the actual British loss was 82 killed, 43 wounded, 69 wounded prisoners, 274 captured and 7 missing, for a total of 475 casualties.<ref name=Malcomson393/>\n\n==Surrender==\n[[File:Sir John Beverley Robinson.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Captain [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Robinson]] of the [[York Militia]].

The process took time. The Americans were angry over their losses, particularly because they believed that the ship and fort had been destroyed after negotiations for surrender had already begun.{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=118}} Nevertheless, Colonel Mitchell of the 3rd U.S. Artillery agreed to terms. While they waited for Dearborn and Chauncey to ratify the terms, the surrendered militia were held prisoner in a blockhouse without food or medical attention for the few wounded. Forsyth's company of the 1st U.S. Rifle Regiment was left as guard in the town. At this stage, few Americans had entered the town.\n\nThe next morning, the terms had still not been ratified, since Dearborn had refused to leave the corvette ''[[USS Madison (1812)|Madison]]''. When he eventually did, Reverend [[John Strachan]] (who held no official position other than [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of York at the time) first brusquely tried to force him to sign the articles for capitulation on the spot, then accused Chauncey to his face of delaying the capitulation to allow the American troops licence to commit outrages.<ref name=Humphries261>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 261</ref> Eventually, Dearborn formally agreed to the articles for surrender. The official terms of surrender permitted civil servants to continue carrying out their duties, and surgeons to treat British wounded.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=58}} As a part of the terms of surrender, any troops remaining in York became [[prisoners of war]], although those serving in the militia were \"paroled,\" allowing them to return home, so long as they not rejoin the conflict until an official prisoner exchange had secured their \"release\".{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=58}} Members of the York Militia were ordered to relinquish their arms, and proceed to Fort York garrison. The officers of the militia were subsequently released on \"parole,\" although the rest of the militia remained imprisoned for two days.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=60}} Kept without food, water, or medical attention, the imprisoned militia was eventually released at the behest of Strachan.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=60}}\n\nThe Americans took over the dockyard, where they captured a brig ({{HMS|Duke of Gloucester|1807|2}}) in poor state of repair, and twenty 24-pounder [[carronade]]s and other stores intended for the British squadron on [[Lake Erie]]. ''Sir Isaac Brock'' was beyond salvage. The Americans had missed another ship-rigged vessel, {{ship||Prince Regent|1812 schooner|2}}, which carried 16 guns, as she sailed for Kingston to collect ordnance two days before the Americans had been sighted.<ref>Forester, p. 124</ref> The Americans also demanded and received several thousand pounds in Army Bills, which had been in the keeping of [[Prideaux Selby]], the Receiver General of Upper Canada, who was mortally ill.\n\n===Burning of York===\n[[File:First Upper Canada Parliament, destroyed in the war of 1812 -b.jpg|thumb|The first [[Ontario Legislative Building|building]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]], along with a number of other buildings was set ablaze in the days after the battle.]]\nBetween April 28 and 30, American troops carried out many acts of plunder.

Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, pp. 267\u2013268</ref>\n\nDuring the looting, several officers under Chauncey's command took books from York's first subscription library. After finding out his officers were in possession of looted library books, Chauncey had the books packed in two crates, and returned to York. However, by the time the books arrived, the library had closed, and the books were auctioned off in 1822.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/local-history-genealogy/2018/11/the-battle-of-york-april-1813.html|title=War of 1812: The Battle of York|publisher=Toronto Public Library|year=2019|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe looting of York occurred in spite of Pike's earlier orders that outlined all civilian property be respected, with any soldier convicted of such transgressions be executed.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} Dearborn similarly emphatically denied giving orders for any buildings to be destroyed and deplored the worst of the atrocities in his letters, but he was nonetheless unable or unwilling to rein in his soldiers. Dearborn himself was embarrassed by the looting, as it made a mockery of the terms of surrender he arranged. His soldiers' disregard for the terms he arranged, and local civil leaders' continued protest against them, made Dearborn eager to leave York as soon as all the captured stores were transported.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=59}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Americans occupied the town for nearly two weeks. They sent the captured military stores, including 20 artillery pieces,{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=84}} away on May 2 but were then penned in [[Toronto Harbour|York harbour]] by a gale. Chauncey's vessels were so overcrowded with troops that only half of them could go below decks to escape the rain at any time.{{sfn|Hitsman|1995|p=141}} They left York on May 8, departing for the [[Niagara peninsula]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}} where they required several weeks to recuperate. Sheaffe's troops endured an equally miserable fourteen-day retreat overland to Kingston.{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=118}}\n\nAround 300 to 400 [[Iroquois]] warriors assembled and marched towards York shortly after the battle, to launch an attack on the American garrison.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}} They were only {{convert|50|km|mi}} west of York, in present day [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], when they learned that the Americans had departed York, and the expedition was called off.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}}\n\n===Effects on the war===\n[[File:Rogerhalesheaffe.jpg|thumb|upright|As a result of the battle, Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]] was relieved of his military command in [[Upper Canada]].]]\nMany members of the Provincial Assembly and other prominent citizens severely criticized Sheaffe, both for his conduct generally and during the fighting at York. For example, Militia officers Chewitt and Allan, the Reverend Strachan and others wrote to Governor General Pr\u00e9vost on May 8, that Sheaffe \"...kept too far from his troops after retreating from the woods, never cheered or animated them, nor showed by his personal conduct that he was hearty in the cause.\"<ref>Hitsman, pp. 140, 333(en)</ref> Sheaffe lost his military and public offices in Upper Canada as the result of his defeat.\n\nHowever, the Americans had not inflicted crippling damage on the Provincial Marine on Lake Ontario, and they admitted that by preserving his small force of regulars rather than sacrificing them in a fight against heavy odds, Sheaffe had robbed them of decisive victory. Secretary of War Armstrong wrote, \"...we cannot doubt but that in all cases in which a British commander is compelled to act defensively, his policy will be that adopted by Sheaffe \u2013 to prefer the preservation of his troops to that of his post, and thus carrying off the kernel leave us the shell.\"<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 269</ref>\n\nThe effects of the capture of York were probably most significant on [[Lake Erie]], since the capture of the ordnance and supplies destined for the British squadron there contributed to the defeat of the British squadron at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]].{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=59}} However, most of the naval supplies captured were not used by the Americans, who abandoned a portion of the captured goods before they departed from York, while the remaining supplies were set on fire during the [[Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor]] in May 1813.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=64}}\n\n====Societal consequences====\nAs the American attack on York occurred on the first of New York's three-day election period, the battle did not directly benefit the Democratic-Republic Party as Armstrong had originally envisioned.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=63}} However, early proclamations of victory issued prior to the battle, did contribute to the reelection of [[Daniel D. Tompkins]], the Democratic-Republican candidate for the [[Governor of New York]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=63}}\n\nAccording to [[Pierre Berton]], the battle, and occupation of York served as a watershed moment for the settlers of York. Those who fought the Americans became celebrated in the local community, while those who aided the occupation were viewed by the community as traitors.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=60}} The documentary film ''Explosion 1812'' argues that the battle had a much greater impact than previously assumed. The mistreatment by US forces of the civilian Canadian population, dogged resistance by militia and the burning of British symbols and buildings after the battle led to a hardening of Canadian popular opinion.<ref name=expl/>\n\nSeveral commentators viewed the American transgressions at York as justification for the British [[Burning of Washington]] later in the war. Pr\u00e9vost wrote that \"as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate\".{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=220}} Strachan wrote to [[Thomas Jefferson]] that the damage to Washington \"was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada\".{{sfn|Hitsman|Graves|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\n==Later attacks==\n===Second incursion, July 1813===\nChauncey and Dearborn subsequently won the [[Battle of Fort George]] on the Niagara peninsula, but they had left Sacket's Harbor defended only by a few troops, mainly militia. When reinforcements from the [[Royal Navy]] commanded by Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] arrived in Kingston, Yeo almost immediately embarked some troops commanded by Pr\u00e9vost and attacked Sackett's Harbor. Although the British were repelled by the defenders at the [[Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor]], Chauncey immediately withdrew into Sacket's Harbor until mid-July, when a new heavy [[sloop of war]] had been completed.\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott, ca.

The last remaining troop in York, members of the [[19th Light Dragoons]], collected the military supplies they could carry, and withdrew along the Don River.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=68}} The American landing of 340 men at York was unopposed, with the American force burning the barracks at the fort, the military fuel yards, and looted several properties.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=68}} They also seized 11 [[bateau|batteaux]], 5 cannons and some flour, before reembarking on their ships, leaving the settlement later that night.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=68}} The library books that were looted from the battle in April 1813, were returned to the settlement during the second incursion into York.\n\nThe Ontario Heritage Foundation erected a plaque in 1968 near the entrance to Coronation Park, Exhibition Place, [[Lake Shore Boulevard]], in commemoration of the event. The plaque reads:\n\n<blockquote>On the morning of July 31, 1813, a U.S. invasion fleet appeared off York (Toronto) after having withdrawn from a planned attack on British positions at Burlington Heights. That afternoon 300 American soldiers came ashore near here. Their landing was unopposed: there were no British regulars in town, and York's militia had withdrawn from further combat in return for its freedom during the American invasion three months earlier. The invaders seized food and military supplies, then re-embarked. The next day they returned to investigate collaborators' reports that valuable stores were concealed up the Don River. Unsuccessful in their search, the Americans contented themselves with burning military installations on nearby Gibraltar Point before they departed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=4534|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090950/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=4534|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015|title=DHH - Memorials Details Search Results|date=April 2, 2015|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Third incursion, August 1814===\nIn the months after the second American incursion into York, the defences around the harbour were significantly improved, as the British needed to protect a four-vessel squadron that would be stationed at the town's harbour.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}} On August 6, 1814, the American Lake Ontario squadron pursued [[Governor Simcoe (1793 ship)|HMS ''Magnet'']], before its captain set fire to the ship, preventing its capture.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}} Suspecting the ship sailed from York, the American naval squadron made its way to the settlement in order to evaluate the situation, and if any more ships may be captured there.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}}\n\nArriving near York's harbour, the American squadron dispatched {{USS|Lady of the Lake|1813|6}} to negotiate under a [[white flag]], in a ploy to evaluate the town's defences. However, the militia stationed at Fort York opened fire at the schooner, who returned fire, before withdrawing to rejoin the American squadron.{{sfn|Benn|1993|73}} The 8th Regiment of Foot, and the [[82nd Regiment of Foot]] were sent to York in an effort to bolster the town's defences. The American squadron did not attempt to engage the newly built defences, although they remained outside York's harbour for the next three days before sailing away.{{sfn|Benn|1993|73}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe burning and looting of York after the battle, along with the destruction of other Upper Canadian settlements during the war, saw public opinions on Americans shift among the residents of Upper Canada.
