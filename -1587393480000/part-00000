The move was controversial however, because after he had verbally agreed to return to Denver, he reconsidered an offer to return to Phoenix. According to ''Sports Illustrated'', [[Jason Kidd]], [[Rex Chapman]], and [[George McCloud]] flew through a blizzard to Denver in hopes of convincing him to re-sign with the Suns. McDyess was attending a [[Colorado Avalanche]] game with Nuggets President and General Manager [[Dan Issel]], and Issel told security to not let the three Suns players into the building. Without any further consultation, he re-signed with the Nuggets. \n\nConsidered an up and comer, he was selected to be a part of the gold medal-winning [[Dream Team (basketball)#Dream Team IV|U.S. Olympic men's basketball team]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]. In 2000\u201301, McDyess was named an [[2001 NBA All-Star Game|All\u2013Star]] and became just the third Nugget to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds for a season, after Dan Issel in 1977\u201378 and George McGinnis in 1978\u201379. Early in the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]] McDyess suffered a serious knee injury, a [[Patellar tendon rupture]], that required season-ending surgery. McDyess struggled to play through the injury, re-aggravating it several times and going through additional surgeries over the next few seasons. He was sidelined due to injury for the remainder of the 2001\u201302 season as well as the entire 2002\u201303 NBA season. \n\n[[File:Mcdyess free throw.jpg|thumb|left|McDyess with the Pistons in 2008]]\nMcDyess was traded to the Knicks on June 26, 2002<ref>[http://www.nba.com/knicks/news/Knicks_Acquire_NBA_AllStar_An-47913-65.html Knicks Acquire NBA All\u2013Star Antonio McDyess]</ref> in exchange for [[Marcus Camby]], [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]] and the draft rights to [[Nen\u00ea]], the seventh overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. McDyess began the 2002\u201303 season as a highly anticipated addition to the New York Knicks. But on October 8, 2002, with 1 minute 55 seconds left in an exhibition game against Phoenix, McDyess reinjured the knee while dunking a rebound.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E4DF143AF93BA25757C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all PRO BASKETBALL; Grim News for Knicks: More Surgery for McDyess - New York Times], Query.nytimes.com.

That off-season, his knee was declared healthy and the [[Detroit Pistons]] signed him for the full [[NBA Salary Cap#Mid-level exception|mid-level exception]].\n\nAs a member of the Pistons, McDyess was successful in reinventing his game. In his first season with the Pistons, averaged 9.6 points and 6.3 rebounds per 23.3 minutes. He relied mostly on mid\u2013range and turn\u2013around jumpers, but remained an efficient scorer, with a 51.3% FG% (ranked 13th in the NBA), helping the Pistons to an Eastern Conference Championship, though they lost to the Spurs in the [[2005 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. He was a dependable sixth man for Detroit, playing in all 82 games in each of the next two seasons.

The move was controversial however, because after he had verbally agreed to return to Denver, he reconsidered an offer to return to Phoenix. According to ''Sports Illustrated'', [[Jason Kidd]], [[Rex Chapman]], and [[George McCloud]] flew through a blizzard to Denver in hopes of convincing him to re-sign with the Suns. McDyess was attending a [[Colorado Avalanche]] game with Nuggets President and General Manager [[Dan Issel]], and Issel told security to not let the three Suns players into the building. Without any further consultation, he re-signed with the Nuggets. \n\nConsidered an up and comer, he was selected to be a part of the gold medal-winning [[Dream Team (basketball)#Dream Team IV|U.S. Olympic men's basketball team]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]. In 2000\u201301, McDyess was named an [[2001 NBA All-Star Game|All\u2013Star]] and became just the third Nugget to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds for a season, after Dan Issel in 1977\u201378 and George McGinnis in 1978\u201379. Early in the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]] McDyess suffered a serious knee injury, a [[Patellar tendon rupture]], that required season-ending surgery. McDyess struggled to play through the injury, re-aggravating it several times and going through additional surgeries over the next few seasons. He was sidelined due to injury for the remainder of the 2001\u201302 season as well as the entire 2002\u201303 NBA season. \n\n[[File:Mcdyess free throw.jpg|thumb|left|McDyess in 2008]]\nMcDyess was traded to the Knicks on June 26, 2002<ref>[http://www.nba.com/knicks/news/Knicks_Acquire_NBA_AllStar_An-47913-65.html Knicks Acquire NBA All\u2013Star Antonio McDyess]</ref> in exchange for [[Marcus Camby]], [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]] and the draft rights to [[Nen\u00ea]], the seventh overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. McDyess began the 2002\u201303 season as a highly anticipated addition to the New York Knicks. But on October 8, 2002, with 1 minute 55 seconds left in an exhibition game against Phoenix, McDyess reinjured the knee while dunking a rebound.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E4DF143AF93BA25757C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all PRO BASKETBALL; Grim News for Knicks: More Surgery for McDyess - New York Times], Query.nytimes.com.
