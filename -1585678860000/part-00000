[[Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney]] disease (ADPKD) is most often diagnosed in adulthood.<ref name=\"etal 2007 26-56\"/>\n\nAnother example of cystic kidney disease is [[Medullary sponge kidney]].\n\n==Types==\n===More Cystic Kidney Diseases===\nCystic kidney disease refers to various conditions relating to the formation of cystic in the kidney or kidneys. The most common subset of cystic kidney disease is polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic anomaly, PKD has two subsets, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The causation of cystic kidney disease can be genetic, developmental, cysts with systemic disease association can be acquired, or malignant. Examples of acquired cystic kidney disease include simple cysts, acquired the renal disease, and medullary sponge kidney (MSK). Other types of genetic cystic kidney disease are juvenile nephronophthisis (JNPHP), medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD), and glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD).\n\n===Polycystic Kidney Disease===\nPKD causes numerous cysts to grow in the kidneys, the cysts are filled with fluid and if they grow excessively this will lead to kidney damage. Mutations in genes PKD1 and PKD2 are responsible for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Those genes encode for polycystic proteins, mutations regarding those genes are inherited are responsible for the disorders of autosomal recessive or dominant cystic kidney disease. In the United States, more than half of million people have PKD, making it the fourth leading cause of kidney failure. PKD affects all races and genders equally. People with PKD have a possibility of developing cysts in other organs like in the liver, pancreas, sleep, ovaries, and large bowel. Usually, a cyst in those organs does not impose a problem. Half of the patients have no manifestation of symptoms, but symptoms may include: hematuria, back or abdominal pain, or can develop hypertension. The disease is usually manifested before age 30, but 45% develop [[kidney failure]] by age 60.\n\n==Cause==\nThe prefer formation site for the cysts is the renal tubule segments, after they grow into a few millimeters they detach from the parent tubule, induced by excessive proliferation of tubular epithelium or excessive fluid secretions.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nMethods of diagnosis include ultrasounds, CT scan, and MRI scan. The least expensive, non-invasive, and most reliable method of diagnosis is an ultrasound. Ultrasounds are the best method for diagnosis but might not detect the smaller cysts in the kidneys. CT scans and MRI scans are able to capture the smaller cysts that cannot be see in an ultrasound, but normal CT scans and MRI scans would only be used as a diagnostic tool for someone at high risk. MRI are used to monitor the development of the cysts and growth of kidneys. Genetic test can be applicable to those who have family history of PKD. Genetic testing is very expensive and sometimes it fails to detect PKD in 15% of people who have it. \n\n=== Antenatal scans ===\nMany forms of cystic kidney disease can be detected in children prior to birth. Abnormalities which only affect one kidney are unlikely to cause a problem with the healthy arrival of a baby. Abnormalities which affect both kidneys can have an effect on the baby's amniotic fluid volume which can in turn lead to problems with lung development. Some forms of obstruction can be very hard to differentiate from cystic renal disease on early scans.<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\">\nFile:Multicystic Dysplastic kidney.svg|Multicystic dysplastic kidney - affects only one side; the other kidney is usually healthy.\nFile:Cystic dysplastic kidney.svg|Cystic dysplasia - can affect one or both kidneys\nFile:Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.svg|Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease\nFile:Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.svg|Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease\nFile:Posterior Urethral Valve.svg|Posterior urethral valves - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans; appearances are due to obstruction not cysts\nFile:Grade 5 Vesico Ureteric Reflux.svg|High grade vesico-ureteric reflux - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans\nFile:Severe pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction.svg|Pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans\n</gallery>\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment is essential to manage the disease and symptoms, therefore to avoid complications. Some of the treatment options include pain medication (except ibuprofen since it worsens kidney disease), low protein and sodium diet, diuretics, antibiotics to treat UTIs, or surgery to drain cysts. In advance, cystic kidney disease renal transplant or dialysis might be necessary.\n\n==Prognosis==\nBy late 70s, almost 50-75% of patients with CKD require dialysis or a kidney transplant. If the patient requires a kidney transplant, kidneys are usually not taken from children due to this disease being hereditary. The cysts and kidney volume is a predictor of the progression of CKD and end-stage renal disease. PKD does not increase the risk for renal cancer, but if renal cancer is developed it is mostly to be bilateral. The most probable cause of death is heart disease, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, or disseminated infection. Some factors that can affect life expectancy are mutated gene type, gender, the age of onset, high blood pressure, proteinuria, hematuria, UTI, hormones, pregnancies, and size of cysts. If risk factors are controlled and the disease is stabilized then the patient's life expectancy can be prolonged greatly.\n\n==References==\n<ref>\"Average Life Expectancy For People With PKD.\" PKD Clinic, www.pkdclinic.org/pkd-prognosis/342.html</ref>\n<ref>\"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) - Genitourinary Disorders.\" Merck Manuals Professional Edition</ref>\n<ref>\"Polycystic Kidney Disease.\" Mayo Clinic, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 6 Mar. 2018</ref>\n<ref>\"Polycystic Kidney Disease.\" The National Kidney Foundation, 3 Feb. 2017</ref>\n<ref>''\"Polycystic Kidney Disease.\" American Kidney Fund, www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/other-kidney-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease.html#what_causes_polycystic_kidney_disease_pkd.''</ref>\n<ref>\"Cystic Diseases of the Kidney Treatment & Management.\" Cystic Diseases of the Kidney Treatment & Management: Medical Care, Surgical Care, 28 Mar. 2017</ref>\n<references>\n<ref name=\"etal 2007 26-56\">{{cite journal|last=Bisceglia|first=M|title=Renal cystic diseases: a review|journal=Advanced Anatomic Pathology|year=2007|issue=13|pages=26\u201356|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Neoplasms 1575-1582\">{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=SC|title=Neoplasms of the upper urinary tract|year=2007|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|pages=1575\u20131582|edition=9|author2=Novick AC |author3=Bukowski RM |editor=Campbell-Walsh Urology}}</ref>\n</references>\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = \n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|Q|61||q|60}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|753.1}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = med\n| eMedicineTopic  = 3189\n| MeshID          = D052177\n| SNOMED CT       = 236439005\n}}\n{{Congenital malformations of urinary system}}\n\n[[Category:Kidney diseases]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new) \n| name            = Cystic kidney disease \n| image           = Simple renal cyst.jpg \n| caption         = Renal cyst \n| \n| pronounce       =  \n| field           =  \n| synonyms        =  \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Cystic kidney disease''' refers to a wide range of [[heredity|hereditary]], developmental, and [[adaptation|acquired conditions]].<ref name=\"etal 2007 26-56\"/> With the inclusion of neoplasms with cystic changes, over 40 classifications and subtypes have been identified.

Their units (''compa\u00f1ia'') would often specialize in forms of combat that required long periods of training that were too costly for informal groups. Their armies were mostly composed of Iberian and other European soldiers.\n\nNative allied troops were largely infantry equipped with armament and armour that varied geographically. Some groups consisted of young men without military experience, [[Catholic clergy]] which helped with administrative duties, and soldiers with military training. These native forces often included African slaves and Native Americans. They not only fought in the battlefield but served as interpreters, informants, servants, teachers, physicians, and scribes. [[India Catalina]] and [[La Malinche|Malintzin]] were Native American women slaves who worked for the Spaniards.\n\nCastilian law prohibited foreigners and non-Catholics from settling in the New World. However, not all conquistadors were Castilian. Many foreigners Hispanicised their names and/or converted to Catholicism to serve the Castilian Crown. For example, [[Juan de Fuca|Io\u00e1nnis Fok\u00e1s]] (known as Juan de Fuca) was a Castilian of Greek origin who discovered the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|strait that bears his name]] between [[Vancouver Island]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] in 1592. German-born [[Nikolaus Federmann]], Hispanicised as Nicol\u00e1s de Federm\u00e1n, was a ''conquistador'' in Venezuela and Colombia. The Venetian [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastiano Caboto]] was Sebasti\u00e1n Caboto, [[Georg von Speyer]] Hispanicised as Jorge de la Espira, Eusebio Francesco Chini Hispanicised as [[Eusebio Kino]], [[Wenceslaus Linck]] was Wenceslao Linck, [[Ferdinand Kon\u0161\u010dak]], was Fernando Consag, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] was Am\u00e9rico Vespucio, and the Portuguese [[Aleixo Garcia]] was known as Alejo Garc\u00eda in the Castilian army.\n\nThe origin of many people in mixed expeditions was not always distinguished. Various occupations, such as sailors, fishermen, soldiers and nobles employed different languages (even from unrelated language groups), so that crew and settlers of Iberian empires recorded as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicians]] from Spain were actually using Portuguese, Basque, Catalan, Italian and [[Occitan|Languedoc]] languages, which were wrongly identified.\n\nCastilian law banned Spanish women from travelling to America unless they were married and accompanied by a husband. Women who travelled thus include Mar\u00eda de Escobar, [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]], Marina V\u00e9lez de Ortega, Marina de la Caballer\u00eda, Francisca de Valenzuela, Catalina de Salazar. Some conquistadors married Native American women or had illegitimate children.\n[[File:ROHM D195 The conquistadors pray before entry to tenochtitlan.jpg|upright|thumb|Conquistadors praying before a battle at [[Tenochtitlan]]]]\nEuropean young men enlisted in the army because it was one way out of poverty. Catholic priests instructed the soldiers in mathematics, writing, theology, Latin, Greek, and history, and wrote letters and official documents for them. King's army officers taught military arts. An uneducated young recruit could become a military leader, elected by their fellow professional soldiers, perhaps based on merit. Others were born into [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]] families, and as such they were members of the Spanish [[nobility]] with some studies but without economic resources. Even some rich nobility families' members became soldiers or missionaries, but mostly not the firstborn heirs.\n\nThe two most famous conquistadors were [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] who conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] who led the conquest of the [[Incan Empire]]. They were second cousins born in [[Extremadura]], where many of the Spanish conquerors were born.\nCatholic religious orders that participated and supported the exploration, evangelizing and pacifying, were mostly [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], [[Franciscan Order|Franciscans]] and [[Jesuit Order|Jesuits]], for example [[Francis Xavier]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], [[Eusebio Kino]], [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] or [[Gaspar da Cruz]]. In 1536, Dominican friar Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas went to [[Oaxaca]] to participate in a series of discussions and debates among the Bishops of the Dominican and Franciscan orders. The two orders had very different approaches to the conversion of the Indians. The Franciscans used a method of mass conversion, sometimes baptizing many thousands of Indians in a day. This method was championed by prominent Franciscans such as [[Toribio de Benavente]].\n\nThe conquistadors took many different roles, including religious leader, [[harem]] keeper, King or Emperor, deserter and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] warrior. ''[[Caramuru]]'' was a Portuguese settler in the [[Tupi people|Tupinamb\u00e1]] Indians. [[Gonzalo Guerrero]] was a Mayan war leader for Nachan can, Lord of [[Chactemal]]. [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]], who had taken holy orders in his native Spain was captured by Mayan lords too, and later was a soldier with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Francisco Pizarro had children with more than 40 women. The [[chronicler]]s [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo]], [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]], [[Juan de Castellanos]] and friar [[Pedro Sim\u00f3n]] wrote about the Americas.\n[[File:Atawallpa Pizarro tinkuy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco Pizarro]] meets with the Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]], 1532]]\n\nAfter Mexico fell, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's enemies, [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], [[Diego Columbus]] and [[Francisco Garay]]<ref>p30-31 of J.H.

After present-day Peruvian territories fell to Spain, [[Francisco Pizarro]] dispatched ''El Adelantado'', [[Diego de Almagro]], before they became enemies to the Inca Empire's northern city of [[Quito]] to claim it. Their fellow conquistador [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]], who had gone forth without Pizarro's approval, had already reached Quito. The arrival of [[Pedro de Alvarado]] from the lands known today as [[Mexico]] in search of Inca gold further complicated the situation for De Almagro and Belalc\u00e1zar. De Alvarado left South America in exchange for monetary compensation from Pizarro. De Almagro was executed in 1538, by [[Hernando Pizarro]]'s orders. In 1541 Lima, supporters of [[Diego Almagro II]] assassinated Francisco Pizarro. In 1546, De Belalc\u00e1zar ordered the execution of [[Jorge Robledo (conquistador)|Jorge Robledo]], who governed a neighbouring province in yet another land-related vendetta. De Belalc\u00e1zar was tried in absentia, convicted and condemned for killing Robledo and other offenses pertaining to his involvement in the wars between armies of conquistadors. [[Pedro de Urs\u00faa]] was killed by his subordinate [[Lope de Aguirre]] who crowned himself king while searching for ''[[El Dorado]]''. In 1544, Lope de Aguirre and [[Melchor Verdugo]] (a ''[[converso]]'' Jew) were at the side of Peru's first viceroy Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, who had arrived from Spain with orders to implement the [[New Laws]] and suppress the [[encomienda]]s. [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], [[Pizarro brothers|another brother]] of Francisco Pizarro, rose in revolt, killed viceroy [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]] and most of his Spanish army in the battle in 1546, and Gonzalo attempted to have himself crowned king.\n\nThe Emperor commissioned bishop [[Pedro de la Gasca]] to restore the peace, naming him president of the ''[[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]]'' and providing him with unlimited authority to punish and pardon the rebels. Gasca repealed the [[New Laws]], the issue around which the rebellion had been organized. Gasca convinced [[Pedro de Valdivia]], explorer of Chile, [[Alonso de Alvarado]] another searcher for ''El Dorado'', and others that if he were unsuccessful, a royal fleet of 40 ships and 15,000 men was preparing to sail from [[Seville]] in June.{{clarify|what year??|date=June 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Portrait of Francisco Pizarro.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Francisco Pizarro]]\n\n===Early Portuguese period===\n[[File:Cortez & La Malinche.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and his counsellor, the Indian woman [[La Malinche]] meet [[Moctezuma II]] in [[Tenochtitlan]], 8 November 1519.

In 1415, Portugal conquered [[Ceuta]], its first overseas colony.\n\nThroughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese explorers|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#15th century|tradable commodities]] such as firearms, spices, silver, gold, and [[slavery|slaves]] crossing Africa and India. In 1434 the first consignment of [[slaves]] was brought to [[Lisbon]]; slave trading was the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce until the Indian subcontinent was reached.\n\n===Birth of the Spanish Kingdom===\nAfter his father's death in 1479, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II of Arag\u00f3n]] unified Castile with Arag\u00f3n, creating the [[Kingdom of Spain]].

Ferdinand notably supported Columbus's first voyage that launched the conquistadors into action.\n\n===Treaties===\nThe 1492 discovery of the [[New World]] by Spain rendered desirable a [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of the Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exploration. Thus dividing the world into two exploration and colonizing areas seemed appropriate. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (7 June 1494) which modified the delimitation authorized by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in two [[papal bull|bulls]] issued on 4 May 1493. The treaty gave to Portugal all lands which might be discovered east of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] drawn from the [[Arctic]] Pole to the [[Antarctic]], at a distance of {{convert|370|league}} west of [[Cape Verde]]. Spain received the lands west of this line.\n\nThe known means of measuring [[longitude]] were so inexact that the line of demarcation could not in practice be determined,<ref>J. de Andrade Corvo in ''Journal das Ci\u00eancias Matem\u00e1ticas'', xxxi.147\u2013176, Lisbon, 1881</ref> subjecting the treaty to diverse interpretations.

The [[Seventeen Provinces]] captured a large portion of the Brazilian coast including the provinces of [[Bahia]], Pernambuco, [[Para\u00edba]], Rio Grande do Norte, [[Cear\u00e1]], and [[Sergipe]], while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The large area of Bahia and its city, the strategically important Salvador, was recovered quickly by an Iberian military expedition in 1625.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal re-established authority over its lost territories including remaining Dutch controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions.\n\n[[Spanish Formosa]] was established in Taiwan, first by Portugal in 1544 and later renamed and repositioned by Spain in [[Keelung]]. It became a natural defence site for the Iberian Union. The colony was designed to protect Spanish and Portuguese trade from interference by the Dutch base in the south of Taiwan. The Spanish colony was short-lived due to the unwillingness of Spanish colonial authorities in [[Manila]] to defend it.\n\n==Disease in the Americas==\n[[File:Florentinoviruela.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Aztecs dying of smallpox, (\"[[Florentine Codex|The Florentine Codex]]\" 1540\u201385)]]\nWhile technological superiority, cultural factors and local allies played an important role in the victories of the conquistadors in the Americas, their conquest was greatly facilitated by old world diseases: [[smallpox]], [[chicken pox]], [[diphtheria]], [[typhus]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]].

They found other [[precious metals]] such as silver, which was particularly abundant in [[Potos\u00ed]], in modern-day Bolivia. They discovered new routes, [[ocean current]]s, [[trade winds]], crops, spices and other products. In the sail era knowledge of winds and currents was essential, for example, the [[Agulhas current]] long prevented Portuguese sailors from reaching India. Various places in Africa and the Americas have been named after the imagined cities made of gold, rivers of gold and precious stones.\n\nShipwrecked off [[Santa Catarina (island)|Santa Catarina island]] in present-day Brazil, [[Aleixo Garcia]] living among the Guaran\u00eds heard tales of a \"White King\" who lived to the west, ruling cities of incomparable riches and splendour.

He discovered a great waterfall{{clarify|where?|date=July 2012}} and the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco Plain]]. He managed to penetrate the outer defences of the [[Inca Empire]] on the hills of the [[Andes]], in present-day [[Bolivia]], the first European to do so, eight years before Francisco Pizarro.\nGarcia looted a booty of silver. When the army of [[Huayna C\u00e1pac]] arrived to challenge him, Garcia then retreated with the spoils, only to be assassinated by his Indian allies near [[San Pedro, Paraguay|San Pedro]] on the [[Paraguay River]].\n\n==Secrecy and disinformation==\n[[File:California island Vinckeboons5.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|Map of the [[Island of California]], circa 1650; restored.]]\nThe Spanish discovery of what they thought at that time was India, and the constant competition of Portugal and Spain led to a desire for secrecy about every trade route and every colony. As a consequence, many documents that could reach other European countries included fake dates and faked facts, to mislead any other nation's possible efforts. For example, the [[Island of California]] refers to a famous [[cartography|cartographic]] error propagated on many maps during the 17th and 18th centuries, despite contradictory evidence from various explorers. The legend was initially infused with the idea that California was a terrestrial paradise, peopled by black women [[Amazons]].\n\nThe tendency to secrecy and falsification of dates casts doubts about the authenticity of many [[primary sources]]. Several historians have hypothesized that John II may have known of the existence of Brazil and North America as early as 1480, thus explaining his wish in 1494 at the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], to push the line of influence further west. Many historians suspect that the real documents{{clarify|which real documents?|date=July 2012}} would have been placed in the Library of Lisbon. Unfortunately, a fire following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] destroyed nearly all of the library's records, but an extra copy{{clarify|copy of what?|date=July 2012}} available in Goa was transferred to Lisbon's Tower of Tombo, during the following 100 years.

He established direct royal control with the [[Council of the Indies]], the most important administrative organ of the [[Spanish Empire]], both in the Americas and in Asia. After unifying Castile, Ferdinand introduced to Castile many laws, regulations and institutions such as the [[Inquisition]], that were typical in Aragon. These laws were later used in the new lands.\n\nThe [[Laws of Burgos]], created in 1512\u20131513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of settlers in Spanish colonial America, particularly with regards to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. They forbade the maltreatment of indigenous people, and endorsed their conversion to Catholicism.\n\nThe evolving structure of colonial government was not fully formed until the third quarter of the 16th century; however, ''[[Catholic Monarchs|los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'' designated [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca]] to study the problems related to the colonization process. Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca effectively became minister for the Indies and laid the foundations for the creation of a colonial bureaucracy, combining legislative, executive and judicial functions. Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca presided over the council, which contained a number of members of the [[Council of Castile]] (''Consejo de Castilla''), and formed a ''Junta de Indias'' of about eight counsellors. Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was already using the term \"[[Council of the Indies]]\" in 1519.\n[[File:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Philip II of Spain]] (1527\u20131598).]]\n\nThe Crown reserved for itself important tools of intervention. The \"capitulacion\" clearly stated that the conquered territories belonged to the Crown, not to the individual. On the other hand, ''concessions'' allowed the Crown to guide the Companies conquests to certain territories, depending on their interests. In addition, the leader of the expedition received clear instructions about their duties towards the army, the native population, the type of military action. A written report about the results was mandatory. The army had a royal official, the \"veedor\". The \"veedor\" or notary, ensured they complied with orders and instructions and preserved the King's share of the booty.\n\nIn practice the Capit\u00e1n had almost unlimited power. Besides the Crown and the conquistador, they were very important the backers who were charged with anticipating the money to the Capit\u00e1n and guarantee payment of obligations.\n\nArmed groups sought supplies and funds in various ways. Financing was requested from the King, delegates of the Crown, the nobility, rich merchants or the troops themselves. The more professional campaigns were funded by the Crown. Campaigns were sometimes initiated by inexperienced governors, because in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Colonial America]], offices were bought or handed to relatives or cronies. Sometimes, an expedition of conquistadors were a group of influential men who had recruited and equipped their fighters, by promising a share of the booty.\n\nThe conquistador borrowed as little as possible, preferring to invest all their belongings. Sometimes, every soldier brought his own equipment and supplies, other times the soldiers received gear as an advance from the conquistador.\n\nThe [[Pinz\u00f3n brothers]], seamen of the [[R\u00edo Tinto (river)|Tinto]]\u2013[[Odiel]] participated in Columbus's undertaking.<ref name = \"ortegamartin\">{{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|loc=Tomo III, p. 37-110}}</ref> They also supported the project economically, supplying money from their personal fortunes.<ref name = \"LascasasPinz\u00f3n\">{{cite book |last= de las Casas|first= Bartolom\u00e9|authorlink= Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas|title= Historia de las Indias| url = http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12033856617830495876213/index.htm|accessdate= 18 October 2008|chapter= Tomo I.

The contribution of each individual conditioned the subsequent division of the booty, receiving a portion the pawn (lancero, piquero, alabardero, rodelero) and twice a man on horseback (caballero) owner of a horse.{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Sometimes part of the booty consisted of women and/or slaves. Even the dogs, important weapons of war in their own right, were in some cases rewarded. The division of the booty produced conflicts, such as the one between Pizarro and Almagro.\n\n==Military advantages==\n[[File:Mendoza, Villagra y Quiroga segun Ovalle.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alonso de Ovalle]]'s 1646 engraving of the conquistadors [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Pedro de Villagra]] and [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]]]] \n[[File:Cabeza reducida J\u00edbaro (M.

In 1599, the Jivaro destroyed Spanish settlements in eastern Ecuador and killed all the men.]]\n\nConquistadors had overwhelming military advantages over the native peoples. They belonged to a more militarily advanced civilization with better techniques, tools, firearms, artillery, iron, steel and domesticated animals. Horses and mules carried them, pigs fed them and dogs fought for them. The indigenous peoples had the advantage of established settlements, determination to remain independent and large numerical superiority. European diseases and [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]] tactics contributed to the defeat of the native populations.\n[[File:Los 13 de la Isla del Gallo.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish soldiers]]\nIn the Iberian peninsula, in a situation of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly interlinked. Small, lightly equipped armies were maintained at all times. The state of war continued intermittently for centuries and created a very warlike culture in Iberia.\n\n===Strategy===\nAnother factor was the ability of the conquistadors to manipulate the political situation between indigenous peoples. To beat the [[Inca]] civilization, they supported one side of a civil war. They overthrew the [[Aztec]] civilization by allying with natives who had been subjugated by more powerful neighbouring tribes and kingdoms. These tactics had been used since antiquity, for example, in the [[Granada War]], the [[conquest of the Canary Islands]] and [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|conquest of Navarre]]. Throughout the conquest, the indigenous people greatly outnumbered the conquistadors; the conquistador troops never exceeded 2% of the native population. The army with which [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] besieged [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|Tenochtitlan]] was composed of 200,000 soldiers, of which fewer than 1% were Spaniards.<ref name=Mann/>{{rp|178}}\n\nThe Europeans practiced war within the terms and laws of their concept of a ''[[just war]]''. While Spanish soldiers went to the battlefield to kill their enemies, the Aztecs and [[Maya peoples|Mayas]] captured their enemies for use as sacrificial victims to their gods\u2014a process called \"[[flower war]]\" by Spanish historians.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn traditional cultures of the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies the warfare was mostly 'endemic', long duration, low intensity, usually evolving into almost a ritualized form. By contrast, Europe had moved to 'sporadic' warfare in the Middle Ages due to the availability of professionally mercenary armies.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} When Italy was ransacked by French and Spanish Armies in the early 1500s, most Italian states were easily defeated by armies practicing sporadic-warfare. Aztec and other native peoples practiced an endemic system of warfare as well, and so were easily defeated by Spanish and Portuguese sporadic-warfare armies in the early 1500s.\n\n===Tactics===\nThese forces were capable of quickly moving long distances, allowing a quick return home after battle. Wars were mainly between clans, expelling intruders. On land, these wars combined some European methods with techniques from Muslim bandits in [[Al-Andalus]]. These tactics consisted of small groups who attempted to catch their opponents by surprise, through an ambush.\n\nIn [[Mombasa]], [[Vasco da Gama|Dom Vasco da Gama]] resorted to [[piracy]], looting Arab merchant ships, which were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons.\n\n===Equipment and animals===\n\n====Firearms and crossbows====\nEuropean conquistadors in the Americas made extensive use of [[crossbow]]s, with firearms becoming widespread only from the 1570s.<ref name=Espino2012>{{cite journal |last1=Espino L\u00f3pez |first1=Antonio |date=2012 |title=El uso t\u00e1ctico de las armas de fuego en las guerras civiles peruanas (1538-1547) |journal=Historica|language=Spanish |volume=XXXVI |issue=2 |pages=7\u201348 |access-date= }}</ref> A scarcity of firearms did not prevent conquistadors to pioneer the use mounted arquebusiers, an early form of [[dragoon]].<ref name=Espino2012/> In the 1540s [[Francisco de Carvajal]]'s use of firearms in the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish civil war in Peru]] prefigured the [[volley fire]] technique that developed in Europe many decades after.<ref name=Espino2012/>\n\n====Animals====\n[[File:1898 urtoko pottoka eta artzanora.jpg|thumb|left|Basque Countrymen near the France\u2013Spain border in 1898, with characteristic horse, donkey and dogs. These were the type of animals introduced to America.]]\n[[File:Mastspagn3.jpg|thumb|Spanish Mastiff used in expeditions and guard]] \nAnimals were another important factor for Spanish triumph. On the one hand, the introduction of the horse and other domesticated pack animals allowed them greater mobility unknown to the Indian cultures. However, in the mountains and jungles, the Spaniards were less able to use narrow Amerindian roads and bridges made for pedestrian traffic, which were sometimes no wider than a few feet. In places such as [[History of Argentina#Spanish colonial era|Argentina]], [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|New Mexico]] and [[History of California to 1899#Spanish colonization and governance (1697\u20131821)|California]], the indigenous people learned horsemanship, cattle raising, and sheep herding. The use of the new techniques by indigenous groups later became a disputed factor in native resistance to the colonial and American governments.\n\nThe Spaniards were also skilled at breeding dogs for war, hunting and protection. The [[Molosser]]s, [[Alano Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish war dogs]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Derr | first = Mark | title = A Dog's History of America | publisher = North Point Press | year = 2004 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/dogshistoryofame00mark/page/23 23\u201345] | isbn = 978-0-86547-631-8 | lay-url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57784-2004Sep2.html | url = https://archive.org/details/dogshistoryofame00mark/page/23 }}</ref> and [[Livestock guardian dog|sheep dogs]] they used in battle were effective as a psychological weapon against the natives, who, in many cases, had never seen domesticated dogs. Although some indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere did have domestic dogs, including the current Southwestern US, Aztec and other Central American peoples, the inhabitants of the Arctic/Tundra regions (Inuit, Aleut, Cree), and possibly some South American groups similar to South American fox (''[[Pseudalopex culpaeus]]'') or Yagan dog,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theobligatescientist.blogspot.com/2010/07/monday-mammal-10-yagan-dog.html|title=Monday Mammal #10: Yag\u00e1n \"dog\"|last=Paul|website=TheObligateScientist.Blogspot.com|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> during the conquest of the Americas, Spanish conquistadors used [[Spanish Mastiff]]s and other [[Molossers]] in battle against the [[Ta\u00ednos]], [[Aztecs]] and [[Mayans]]. These specially trained dogs were feared because of their strength and ferocity. The strongest big breeds of broad-mouthed dogs were [[Attack dog|specifically trained]] for battle. These [[Dogs in warfare|war dogs]] were used against barely clothed troops. They were armoured dogs trained to kill and disembowel.<ref name=Stannard>{{cite book|title=American holocaust: the conquest of the New World|first=David |last=Stannard}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous of these dogs of war was a mascot of [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n|Ponce de Leon]] called ''Becerrillo'', the first European dog known to reach North America;{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} another famous dog called ''Leoncico'', the son of ''Becerillo'', and the first European dog known to see the Pacific Ocean, was a mascot of [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] and accompanied him on several expeditions.\n\n==Nautical science==\n[[File:AlmanachPerpetuum.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ephemeris]] by [[Abraham Zacuto]] in Almanach Perpetuum, 1496]]\n\nThe successive expeditions and experience of the Portuguese pilots led to a rapid evolution of Portuguese nautical science.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\nIn the thirteenth century they were guided by the sun position. For [[celestial navigation]] like other Europeans, they used Greek tools, like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], which they made easier and simpler. They also created the [[cross-staff]], or ''cane of Jacob'', for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The [[Southern Cross]] became a reference upon the arrival of [[Jo\u00e3o de Santar\u00e9m]] and [[Pedro Escobar]] in the Southern hemisphere in 1471, starting its use in celestial navigation. The results varied throughout the year, which required corrections. To address this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables ([[Ephemeris]]), a precious tool for oceanic navigation, which spread widely in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, enabling [[latitude]] calculations. The tables of the [[Almanach Perpetuum]], by astronomer [[Abraham Zacuto]], published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]].\n\n===Ship design===\n{{Main|Iberian ship development, 1400\u20131600}}\n[[File:Caravel Boa Esperanca Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|A Portuguese [[caravel]]]]\nThe ship that truly launched the first phase of the discoveries along the African coast was the Portuguese [[caravel]]. Iberians quickly adopted it for their merchant navy. It was a development based on African fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and one to three masts, with [[lateen]] triangular sails allowing [[luffing]]. The caravel particularly benefited from a greater capacity to [[tack (sailing)|tack]]. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Limited crew and cargo space was acceptable, initially, because as exploratory ships, their \"cargo\" was what was in the explorer's discoveries about a new territory, which only took up the space of one person.<ref>[[Roger Smith (journalist)|Roger Smith]], \"Vanguard of the Empire\", Oxford University Press, 1993, p.30</ref> Among the famous caravels are ''Berrio'' and ''Caravela Annunciation''. Columbus also used them in his travels.\n\nLong oceanic voyages led to larger ships. \"Nau\" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily [[merchant ship]]s. Due to the piracy that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the navy and were provided with cannon windows, which led to the classification of \"naus\" according to the power of its artillery. The [[carrack]] or nau was a three- or four-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] ship. It had a high rounded [[stern]] with large [[aftcastle]], [[forecastle]] and [[bowsprit]] at the stem. It was first used by the Portuguese, and later by the Spanish. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade. They grew from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500. In the 16th century they usually had two [[deck (ship)|decks]], stern castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century used carracks, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2,000 tons.\n\n===Winds and currents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major [[oceanic gyre]]s]]\nBesides coastal exploration, Portuguese ships also made trips further out to gather [[meteorological]] and [[oceanographic]] information. These voyages revealed the archipelagos of [[Bissagos Islands]] where the Portuguese were defeated by native people in 1535, Madeira, the Azores, Cape Verde, Sao Tome, [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], [[Elobey Chico]] [[Annobon Island]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Bioko Island]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Principe Island]], [[Saint Helena|Saint Helena Island]], [[Tristan da Cunha]] Island and [[Sargasso Sea]].\n\nThe knowledge of wind patterns and [[ocean current|currents]], the [[trade winds]] and the [[oceanic gyre]]s in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the Azores, using the winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of [[atmospheric circulation]] and the effect of [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]], facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese to venture farther from shore, a manoeuvre that became known as the ''\"volta do mar\"'' (''return of the sea''). In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish discovering the [[Manila Galleon]] trade route.\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Map of Angelino Dulcert cropped.jpg|thumb| Portolan of [[Angelino Dulcert]] (1339) showing [[Lanzarote]] island]]\n\nIn 1339 [[Angelino Dulcert]] of Majorca produced the [[portolan chart]] map. Evidently drawing from the information provided in 1336 by [[Lanceloto Malocello]] sponsored by King [[Dinis of Portugal]]. It showed [[Lanzarote]] island, named ''Insula de Lanzarotus Marocelus'' and marked by a Genoese shield, as well as the island of ''Forte Vetura'' ([[Fuerteventura]]) and ''Vegi Mari'' ([[Lobos Island|Lobos]]), although Dulcert also included some imaginary islands himself, notably [[Saint Brendan's Island]], and three islands he names ''Primaria'', ''Capraria'' and ''Canaria''.<ref name=\"Meli\u00e1 p.45\">Meli\u00e1 (p. 45)</ref>\n\nMestre Jacome was a Majorcan cartographer induced by Portuguese prince [[Henry the Navigator]] to move to Portugal in the 1420s to train Portuguese map-makers in Majorcan-style cartography.<ref>\"Mestre Jacome\" the Majorcan cartographer is first mentioned by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de situ Orbis'' (c. 1507, [https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog p. 58]). [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], in his ''Decadas de Asia'' (1552: I.16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA133 p. 133]) adds that he was also a master instrument-maker.</ref> 'Jacome of Majorca' is even sometimes described as the head of Henry's observatory and \"school\" at [[Sagres (Vila do Bispo)|Sagres]].<ref>\"He also from Majorca caused one Master James, a man skilfull (sic) in Navigation and in Cards and Sea Instruments, to be brought into Portugall, there at his charge as it were, to erect a Schoole of Marinership, and to instruct his Countreymen in that Mysterie.\"\n[[Samuel Purchas]], ''Hakluytus Posthumus'', (1625, vol. 2, pt.2 [https://archive.org/details/hakluytusposthu92purcgoog/page/n103 p.11])</ref>\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-mercator navigation chart of the Coast of Africa (1571), by [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] ([[Torre do Tombo National Archive|Torre do Tombo]], [[Lisbon]])]]\n\nIt is thought that [[Jehuda Cresques]], son of Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques of [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] in Majorca, and Italian-Majorcan [[Angelino Dulcert]] were cartographers at the service of Prince Henry. Majorca had many skilled Jewish cartographers. However, the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by [[Pedro Reinel]] in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]]. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of latitudes in 1504 and the first representation of a [[wind rose]].\n\nWith his son, cartographer [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Lopo Homem]], they participated in the making of the atlas known as \"Lopo Homem-Rein\u00e9s Atlas\" or \"[[Miller Atlas]]\", in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time. Emperor Charles V wanted them to work for him. In 1517 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] handed Lopo Homem a charter giving him the privilege to certify and amend all [[compass]] needles in vessels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe third phase of nautical cartography was characterized by the abandonment of [[Ptolemy]]'s representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents. [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (Goa \u22481520 \u2013 \u22481580), produced work of extraordinary quality and beauty, giving him a reputation as one of the best cartographers of the time.

Their units (''compa\u00f1ia'') would often specialize in forms of combat that required long periods of training that were too costly for informal groups. Their armies were mostly composed of Iberian and other European soldiers.\n\nNative allied troops were largely infantry equipped with armament and armour that varied geographically. Some groups consisted of young men without military experience, [[Catholic clergy]] which helped with administrative duties, and soldiers with military training. These native forces often included African slaves and Native Americans. They not only fought in the battlefield but served as interpreters, informants, servants, teachers, physicians, and scribes. [[India Catalina]] and [[La Malinche|Malintzin]] were Native American women slaves who worked for the Spaniards.\n\nCastilian law prohibited foreigners and non-Catholics from settling in the New World. However, not all conquistadors were Castilian. Many foreigners Hispanicised their names and/or converted to Catholicism to serve the Castilian Crown. For example, [[Juan de Fuca|Io\u00e1nnis Fok\u00e1s]] (known as Juan de Fuca) was a Castilian of Greek origin who discovered the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|strait that bears his name]] between [[Vancouver Island]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] in 1592. German-born [[Nikolaus Federmann]], Hispanicised as Nicol\u00e1s de Federm\u00e1n, was a ''conquistador'' in Venezuela and Colombia. The Venetian [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastiano Caboto]] was Sebasti\u00e1n Caboto, [[Georg von Speyer]] Hispanicised as Jorge de la Espira, Eusebio Francesco Chini Hispanicised as [[Eusebio Kino]], [[Wenceslaus Linck]] was Wenceslao Linck, [[Ferdinand Kon\u0161\u010dak]], was Fernando Consag, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] was Am\u00e9rico Vespucio, and the Portuguese [[Aleixo Garcia]] was known as Alejo Garc\u00eda in the Castilian army.\n\nThe origin of many people in mixed expeditions was not always distinguished. Various occupations, such as sailors, fishermen, soldiers and nobles employed different languages (even from unrelated language groups), so that crew and settlers of Iberian empires recorded as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicians]] from Spain were actually using Portuguese, Basque, Catalan, Italian and [[Occitan|Languedoc]] languages, which were wrongly identified.\n\nCastilian law banned Spanish women from travelling to America unless they were married and accompanied by a husband. Women who travelled thus include Mar\u00eda de Escobar, [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]], Marina V\u00e9lez de Ortega, Marina de la Caballer\u00eda, Francisca de Valenzuela, Catalina de Salazar. Some conquistadors married Native American women or had illegitimate children.\n[[File:ROHM D195 The conquistadors pray before entry to tenochtitlan.jpg|upright|thumb|Conquistadors praying before a battle at [[Tenochtitlan]]]]\nEuropean young men enlisted in the army because it was one way out of poverty. Catholic priests instructed the soldiers in mathematics, writing, theology, Latin, Greek, and history, and wrote letters and official documents for them. King's army officers taught military arts. An uneducated young recruit could become a military leader, elected by their fellow professional soldiers, perhaps based on merit. Others were born into [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]] families, and as such they were members of the Spanish [[nobility]] with some studies but without economic resources. Even some rich nobility families' members became soldiers or missionaries, but mostly not the firstborn heirs.\n\nThe two most famous conquistadors were [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] who conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] who led the conquest of the [[Incan Empire]]. They were second cousins born in [[Extremadura]], where many of the Spanish conquerors were born.\nCatholic religious orders that participated and supported the exploration, evangelizing and pacifying, were mostly [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], [[Franciscan Order|Franciscans]] and [[Jesuit Order|Jesuits]], for example [[Francis Xavier]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], [[Eusebio Kino]], [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] or [[Gaspar da Cruz]]. In 1536, Dominican friar Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas went to [[Oaxaca]] to participate in a series of discussions and debates among the Bishops of the Dominican and Franciscan orders. The two orders had very different approaches to the conversion of the Indians. The Franciscans used a method of mass conversion, sometimes baptizing many thousands of Indians in a day. This method was championed by prominent Franciscans such as [[Toribio de Benavente]].\n\nThe conquistadors took many different roles, including religious leader, [[harem]] keeper, King or Emperor, deserter and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] warrior. ''[[Caramuru]]'' was a Portuguese settler in the [[Tupi people|Tupinamb\u00e1]] Indians. [[Gonzalo Guerrero]] was a Mayan war leader for Nachan can, Lord of [[Chactemal]]. [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]], who had taken holy orders in his native Spain was captured by Mayan lords too, and later was a soldier with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Francisco Pizarro had children with more than 40 women. The [[chronicler]]s [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo]], [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]], [[Juan de Castellanos]] and friar [[Pedro Sim\u00f3n]] wrote about the Americas.\n[[File:Atawallpa Pizarro tinkuy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco Pizarro]] meets with the Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]], 1532]]\n\nAfter Mexico fell, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's enemies, [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], [[Diego Columbus]] and [[Francisco Garay]]<ref>p30-31 of J.H.

After present-day Peruvian territories fell to Spain, [[Francisco Pizarro]] dispatched ''El Adelantado'', [[Diego de Almagro]], before they became enemies to the Inca Empire's northern city of [[Quito]] to claim it. Their fellow conquistador [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]], who had gone forth without Pizarro's approval, had already reached Quito. The arrival of [[Pedro de Alvarado]] from the lands known today as [[Mexico]] in search of Inca gold further complicated the situation for De Almagro and Belalc\u00e1zar. De Alvarado left South America in exchange for monetary compensation from Pizarro. De Almagro was executed in 1538, by [[Hernando Pizarro]]'s orders. In 1541 Lima, supporters of [[Diego Almagro II]] assassinated Francisco Pizarro. In 1546, De Belalc\u00e1zar ordered the execution of [[Jorge Robledo (conquistador)|Jorge Robledo]], who governed a neighbouring province in yet another land-related vendetta. De Belalc\u00e1zar was tried in absentia, convicted and condemned for killing Robledo and other offenses pertaining to his involvement in the wars between armies of conquistadors. [[Pedro de Urs\u00faa]] was killed by his subordinate [[Lope de Aguirre]] who crowned himself king while searching for ''[[El Dorado]]''. In 1544, Lope de Aguirre and [[Melchor Verdugo]] (a ''[[converso]]'' Jew) were at the side of Peru's first viceroy Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, who had arrived from Spain with orders to implement the [[New Laws]] and suppress the [[encomienda]]s. [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], [[Pizarro brothers|another brother]] of Francisco Pizarro, rose in revolt, killed viceroy [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]] and most of his Spanish army in the battle in 1546, and Gonzalo attempted to have himself crowned king.\n\nThe Emperor commissioned bishop [[Pedro de la Gasca]] to restore the peace, naming him president of the ''[[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]]'' and providing him with unlimited authority to punish and pardon the rebels. Gasca repealed the [[New Laws]], the issue around which the rebellion had been organized. Gasca convinced [[Pedro de Valdivia]], explorer of Chile, [[Alonso de Alvarado]] another searcher for ''El Dorado'', and others that if he were unsuccessful, a royal fleet of 40 ships and 15,000 men was preparing to sail from [[Seville]] in June.{{clarify|what year??|date=June 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Portrait of Francisco Pizarro.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Francisco Pizarro]]\n\n===Early Portuguese period===\n[[File:Cortez & La Malinche.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and his counsellor, the Indian woman [[La Malinche]] meet [[Moctezuma II]] in [[Tenochtitlan]], 8 November 1519.

In 1415, Portugal conquered [[Ceuta]], its first overseas colony.\n\nThroughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese explorers|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#15th century|tradable commodities]] such as firearms, spices, silver, gold, and [[slavery|slaves]] crossing Africa and India. In 1434 the first consignment of [[slaves]] was brought to [[Lisbon]]; slave trading was the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce until the Indian subcontinent was reached.\n\n===Birth of the Spanish Kingdom===\nAfter his father's death in 1479, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II of Arag\u00f3n]] unified Castile with Arag\u00f3n, creating the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. He later tried to incorporate by marriage the kingdom of Portugal. Ferdinand notably supported Columbus's first voyage that launched the conquistadors into action.\n\n===Treaties===\nThe 1492 discovery of the [[New World]] by Spain rendered desirable a [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of the Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exploration. Thus dividing the world into two exploration and colonizing areas seemed appropriate. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (7 June 1494) which modified the delimitation authorized by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in two [[papal bull|bulls]] issued on 4 May 1493. The treaty gave to Portugal all lands which might be discovered east of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] drawn from the [[Arctic]] Pole to the [[Antarctic]], at a distance of {{convert|370|league}} west of [[Cape Verde]]. Spain received the lands west of this line.\n\nThe known means of measuring [[longitude]] were so inexact that the line of demarcation could not in practice be determined,<ref>J. de Andrade Corvo in ''Journal das Ci\u00eancias Matem\u00e1ticas'', xxxi.147\u2013176, Lisbon, 1881</ref> subjecting the treaty to diverse interpretations.

The [[Seventeen Provinces]] captured a large portion of the Brazilian coast including the provinces of [[Bahia]], Pernambuco, [[Para\u00edba]], Rio Grande do Norte, [[Cear\u00e1]], and [[Sergipe]], while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The large area of Bahia and its city, the strategically important Salvador, was recovered quickly by an Iberian military expedition in 1625.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal re-established authority over its lost territories including remaining Dutch controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions.\n\n[[Spanish Formosa]] was established in Taiwan, first by Portugal in 1544 and later renamed and repositioned by Spain in [[Keelung]]. It became a natural defence site for the Iberian Union. The colony was designed to protect Spanish and Portuguese trade from interference by the Dutch base in the south of Taiwan. The Spanish colony was short-lived due to the unwillingness of Spanish colonial authorities in [[Manila]] to defend it.\n\n==Disease in the Americas==\n[[File:Florentinoviruela.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Aztecs dying of smallpox, (\"[[Florentine Codex|The Florentine Codex]]\" 1540\u201385)]]\nWhile technological superiority, cultural factors and local allies played an important role in the victories of the conquistadors in the Americas, their conquest was greatly facilitated by old world diseases: [[smallpox]], [[chicken pox]], [[diphtheria]], [[typhus]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]].

They found other [[precious metals]] such as silver, which was particularly abundant in [[Potos\u00ed]], in modern-day Bolivia. They discovered new routes, [[ocean current]]s, [[trade winds]], crops, spices and other products. In the sail era knowledge of winds and currents was essential, for example, the [[Agulhas current]] long prevented Portuguese sailors from reaching India. Various places in Africa and the Americas have been named after the imagined cities made of gold, rivers of gold and precious stones.\n\nShipwrecked off [[Santa Catarina (island)|Santa Catarina island]] in present-day Brazil, [[Aleixo Garcia]] living among the Guaran\u00eds heard tales of a \"White King\" who lived to the west, ruling cities of incomparable riches and splendour.

He discovered a great waterfall{{clarify|where?|date=July 2012}} and the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco Plain]]. He managed to penetrate the outer defences of the [[Inca Empire]] on the hills of the [[Andes]], in present-day [[Bolivia]], the first European to do so, eight years before Francisco Pizarro.\nGarcia looted a booty of silver. When the army of [[Huayna C\u00e1pac]] arrived to challenge him, Garcia then retreated with the spoils, only to be assassinated by his Indian allies near [[San Pedro, Paraguay|San Pedro]] on the [[Paraguay River]].\n\n==Secrecy and disinformation==\n[[File:California island Vinckeboons5.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|Map of the [[Island of California]], circa 1650; restored.]]\nThe Spanish discovery of what they thought at that time was India, and the constant competition of Portugal and Spain led to a desire for secrecy about every trade route and every colony. As a consequence, many documents that could reach other European countries included fake dates and faked facts, to mislead any other nation's possible efforts. For example, the [[Island of California]] refers to a famous [[cartography|cartographic]] error propagated on many maps during the 17th and 18th centuries, despite contradictory evidence from various explorers. The legend was initially infused with the idea that California was a terrestrial paradise, peopled by black women [[Amazons]].\n\nThe tendency to secrecy and falsification of dates casts doubts about the authenticity of many [[primary sources]]. Several historians have hypothesized that John II may have known of the existence of Brazil and North America as early as 1480, thus explaining his wish in 1494 at the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], to push the line of influence further west. Many historians suspect that the real documents{{clarify|which real documents?|date=July 2012}} would have been placed in the Library of Lisbon. Unfortunately, a fire following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] destroyed nearly all of the library's records, but an extra copy{{clarify|copy of what?|date=July 2012}} available in Goa was transferred to Lisbon's Tower of Tombo, during the following 100 years.

He established direct royal control with the [[Council of the Indies]], the most important administrative organ of the [[Spanish Empire]], both in the Americas and in Asia. After unifying Castile, Ferdinand introduced to Castile many laws, regulations and institutions such as the [[Inquisition]], that were typical in Aragon. These laws were later used in the new lands.\n\nThe [[Laws of Burgos]], created in 1512\u20131513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of settlers in Spanish colonial America, particularly with regards to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. They forbade the maltreatment of indigenous people, and endorsed their conversion to Catholicism.\n\nThe evolving structure of colonial government was not fully formed until the third quarter of the 16th century; however, ''[[Catholic Monarchs|los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'' designated [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca]] to study the problems related to the colonization process. Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca effectively became minister for the Indies and laid the foundations for the creation of a colonial bureaucracy, combining legislative, executive and judicial functions. Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca presided over the council, which contained a number of members of the [[Council of Castile]] (''Consejo de Castilla''), and formed a ''Junta de Indias'' of about eight counsellors. Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was already using the term \"[[Council of the Indies]]\" in 1519.\n[[File:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Philip II of Spain]] (1527\u20131598).]]\n\nThe Crown reserved for itself important tools of intervention. The \"capitulacion\" clearly stated that the conquered territories belonged to the Crown, not to the individual. On the other hand, ''concessions'' allowed the Crown to guide the Companies conquests to certain territories, depending on their interests. In addition, the leader of the expedition received clear instructions about their duties towards the army, the native population, the type of military action. A written report about the results was mandatory. The army had a royal official, the \"veedor\". The \"veedor\" or notary, ensured they complied with orders and instructions and preserved the King's share of the booty.\n\nIn practice the Capit\u00e1n had almost unlimited power. Besides the Crown and the conquistador, they were very important the backers who were charged with anticipating the money to the Capit\u00e1n and guarantee payment of obligations.\n\nArmed groups sought supplies and funds in various ways. Financing was requested from the King, delegates of the Crown, the nobility, rich merchants or the troops themselves. The more professional campaigns were funded by the Crown. Campaigns were sometimes initiated by inexperienced governors, because in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Colonial America]], offices were bought or handed to relatives or cronies. Sometimes, an expedition of conquistadors were a group of influential men who had recruited and equipped their fighters, by promising a share of the booty.\n\nThe conquistador borrowed as little as possible, preferring to invest all their belongings. Sometimes, every soldier brought his own equipment and supplies, other times the soldiers received gear as an advance from the conquistador.\n\nThe [[Pinz\u00f3n brothers]], seamen of the [[R\u00edo Tinto (river)|Tinto]]\u2013[[Odiel]] participated in Columbus's undertaking.<ref name = \"ortegamartin\">{{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|loc=Tomo III, p. 37-110}}</ref> They also supported the project economically, supplying money from their personal fortunes.<ref name = \"LascasasPinz\u00f3n\">{{cite book |last= de las Casas|first= Bartolom\u00e9|authorlink= Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas|title= Historia de las Indias| url = http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12033856617830495876213/index.htm|accessdate= 18 October 2008|chapter= Tomo I.

The contribution of each individual conditioned the subsequent division of the booty, receiving a portion the pawn (lancero, piquero, alabardero, rodelero) and twice a man on horseback (caballero) owner of a horse.{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Sometimes part of the booty consisted of women and/or slaves. Even the dogs, important weapons of war in their own right, were in some cases rewarded. The division of the booty produced conflicts, such as the one between Pizarro and Almagro.\n\n==Military advantages==\n[[File:Mendoza, Villagra y Quiroga segun Ovalle.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alonso de Ovalle]]'s 1646 engraving of the conquistadors [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Pedro de Villagra]] and [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]]]] \n[[File:Cabeza reducida J\u00edbaro (M.

In 1599, the Jivaro destroyed Spanish settlements in eastern Ecuador and killed all the men.]]\n\nConquistadors had overwhelming military advantages over the native peoples. They belonged to a more militarily advanced civilization with better techniques, tools, firearms, artillery, iron, steel and domesticated animals. Horses and mules carried them, pigs fed them and dogs fought for them. The indigenous peoples had the advantage of established settlements, determination to remain independent and large numerical superiority. European diseases and [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]] tactics contributed to the defeat of the native populations.\n[[File:Los 13 de la Isla del Gallo.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish soldiers]]\nIn the Iberian peninsula, in a situation of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly interlinked. Small, lightly equipped armies were maintained at all times. The state of war continued intermittently for centuries and created a very warlike culture in Iberia.\n\n===Strategy===\nAnother factor was the ability of the conquistadors to manipulate the political situation between indigenous peoples. To beat the [[Inca]] civilization, they supported one side of a civil war. They overthrew the [[Aztec]] civilization by allying with natives who had been subjugated by more powerful neighbouring tribes and kingdoms. These tactics had been used since antiquity, for example, in the [[Granada War]], the [[conquest of the Canary Islands]] and [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|conquest of Navarre]]. Throughout the conquest, the indigenous people greatly outnumbered the conquistadors; the conquistador troops never exceeded 2% of the native population. The army with which [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] besieged [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|Tenochtitlan]] was composed of 200,000 soldiers, of which fewer than 1% were Spaniards.<ref name=Mann/>{{rp|178}}\n\nThe Europeans practiced war within the terms and laws of their concept of a ''[[just war]]''. While Spanish soldiers went to the battlefield to kill their enemies, the Aztecs and [[Maya peoples|Mayas]] captured their enemies for use as sacrificial victims to their gods\u2014a process called \"[[flower war]]\" by Spanish historians.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn traditional cultures of the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies the warfare was mostly 'endemic', long duration, low intensity, usually evolving into almost a ritualized form. By contrast, Europe had moved to 'sporadic' warfare in the Middle Ages due to the availability of professionally mercenary armies.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} When Italy was ransacked by French and Spanish Armies in the early 1500s, most Italian states were easily defeated by armies practicing sporadic-warfare. Aztec and other native peoples practiced an endemic system of warfare as well, and so were easily defeated by Spanish and Portuguese sporadic-warfare armies in the early 1500s.\n\n===Tactics===\nThese forces were capable of quickly moving long distances, allowing a quick return home after battle. Wars were mainly between clans, expelling intruders. On land, these wars combined some European methods with techniques from Muslim bandits in [[Al-Andalus]]. These tactics consisted of small groups who attempted to catch their opponents by surprise, through an ambush.\n\nIn [[Mombasa]], [[Vasco da Gama|Dom Vasco da Gama]] resorted to [[piracy]], looting Arab merchant ships, which were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons.\n\n===Equipment and animals===\n\n====Firearms and crossbows====\nEuropean conquistadors in the Americas made extensive use of [[crossbow]]s, with firearms becoming widespread only from the 1570s.<ref name=Espino2012>{{cite journal |last1=Espino L\u00f3pez |first1=Antonio |date=2012 |title=El uso t\u00e1ctico de las armas de fuego en las guerras civiles peruanas (1538-1547) |journal=Historica|language=Spanish |volume=XXXVI |issue=2 |pages=7\u201348 |access-date= }}</ref> A scarcity of firearms did not prevent conquistadors to pioneer the use mounted arquebusiers, an early form of [[dragoon]].<ref name=Espino2012/> In the 1540s [[Francisco de Carvajal]]'s use of firearms in the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish civil war in Peru]] prefigured the [[volley fire]] technique that developed in Europe many decades after.<ref name=Espino2012/>\n\n====Animals====\n[[File:1898 urtoko pottoka eta artzanora.jpg|thumb|left|Basque Countrymen near the France\u2013Spain border in 1898, with characteristic horse, donkey and dogs. These were the type of animals introduced to America.]]\n[[File:Mastspagn3.jpg|thumb|Spanish Mastiff used in expeditions and guard]] \nAnimals were another important factor for Spanish triumph. On the one hand, the introduction of the horse and other domesticated pack animals allowed them greater mobility unknown to the Indian cultures. However, in the mountains and jungles, the Spaniards were less able to use narrow Amerindian roads and bridges made for pedestrian traffic, which were sometimes no wider than a few feet. In places such as [[History of Argentina#Spanish colonial era|Argentina]], [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|New Mexico]] and [[History of California to 1899#Spanish colonization and governance (1697\u20131821)|California]], the indigenous people learned horsemanship, cattle raising, and sheep herding. The use of the new techniques by indigenous groups later became a disputed factor in native resistance to the colonial and American governments.\n\nThe Spaniards were also skilled at breeding dogs for war, hunting and protection. The [[Molosser]]s, [[Alano Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish war dogs]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Derr | first = Mark | title = A Dog's History of America | publisher = North Point Press | year = 2004 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/dogshistoryofame00mark/page/23 23\u201345] | isbn = 978-0-86547-631-8 | lay-url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57784-2004Sep2.html | url = https://archive.org/details/dogshistoryofame00mark/page/23 }}</ref> and [[Livestock guardian dog|sheep dogs]] they used in battle were effective as a psychological weapon against the natives, who, in many cases, had never seen domesticated dogs. Although some indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere did have domestic dogs, including the current Southwestern US, Aztec and other Central American peoples, the inhabitants of the Arctic/Tundra regions (Inuit, Aleut, Cree), and possibly some South American groups similar to South American fox (''[[Pseudalopex culpaeus]]'') or Yagan dog,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theobligatescientist.blogspot.com/2010/07/monday-mammal-10-yagan-dog.html|title=Monday Mammal #10: Yag\u00e1n \"dog\"|last=Paul|website=TheObligateScientist.Blogspot.com|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> during the conquest of the Americas, Spanish conquistadors used [[Spanish Mastiff]]s and other [[Molossers]] in battle against the [[Ta\u00ednos]], [[Aztecs]] and [[Mayans]]. These specially trained dogs were feared because of their strength and ferocity. The strongest big breeds of broad-mouthed dogs were [[Attack dog|specifically trained]] for battle. These [[Dogs in warfare|war dogs]] were used against barely clothed troops. They were armoured dogs trained to kill and disembowel.<ref name=Stannard>{{cite book|title=American holocaust: the conquest of the New World|first=David |last=Stannard}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous of these dogs of war was a mascot of [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n|Ponce de Leon]] called ''Becerrillo'', the first European dog known to reach North America;{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} another famous dog called ''Leoncico'', the son of ''Becerillo'', and the first European dog known to see the Pacific Ocean, was a mascot of [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] and accompanied him on several expeditions.\n\n==Nautical science==\n[[File:AlmanachPerpetuum.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ephemeris]] by [[Abraham Zacuto]] in Almanach Perpetuum, 1496]]\n\nThe successive expeditions and experience of the Portuguese pilots led to a rapid evolution of Portuguese nautical science.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\nIn the thirteenth century they were guided by the sun position. For [[celestial navigation]] like other Europeans, they used Greek tools, like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], which they made easier and simpler. They also created the [[cross-staff]], or ''cane of Jacob'', for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The [[Southern Cross]] became a reference upon the arrival of [[Jo\u00e3o de Santar\u00e9m]] and [[Pedro Escobar]] in the Southern hemisphere in 1471, starting its use in celestial navigation. The results varied throughout the year, which required corrections. To address this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables ([[Ephemeris]]), a precious tool for oceanic navigation, which spread widely in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, enabling [[latitude]] calculations. The tables of the [[Almanach Perpetuum]], by astronomer [[Abraham Zacuto]], published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]].\n\n===Ship design===\n{{Main|Iberian ship development, 1400\u20131600}}\n[[File:Caravel Boa Esperanca Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|A Portuguese [[caravel]]]]\nThe ship that truly launched the first phase of the discoveries along the African coast was the Portuguese [[caravel]]. Iberians quickly adopted it for their merchant navy. It was a development based on African fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and one to three masts, with [[lateen]] triangular sails allowing [[luffing]]. The caravel particularly benefited from a greater capacity to [[tack (sailing)|tack]]. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Limited crew and cargo space was acceptable, initially, because as exploratory ships, their \"cargo\" was what was in the explorer's discoveries about a new territory, which only took up the space of one person.<ref>[[Roger Smith (journalist)|Roger Smith]], \"Vanguard of the Empire\", Oxford University Press, 1993, p.30</ref> Among the famous caravels are ''Berrio'' and ''Caravela Annunciation''. Columbus also used them in his travels.\n\nLong oceanic voyages led to larger ships. \"Nau\" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily [[merchant ship]]s. Due to the piracy that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the navy and were provided with cannon windows, which led to the classification of \"naus\" according to the power of its artillery. The [[carrack]] or nau was a three- or four-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] ship. It had a high rounded [[stern]] with large [[aftcastle]], [[forecastle]] and [[bowsprit]] at the stem. It was first used by the Portuguese, and later by the Spanish. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade. They grew from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500. In the 16th century they usually had two [[deck (ship)|decks]], stern castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century used carracks, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2,000 tons.\n\n===Winds and currents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major [[oceanic gyre]]s]]\nBesides coastal exploration, Portuguese ships also made trips further out to gather [[meteorological]] and [[oceanographic]] information. These voyages revealed the archipelagos of [[Bissagos Islands]] where the Portuguese were defeated by native people in 1535, Madeira, the Azores, Cape Verde, Sao Tome, [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], [[Elobey Chico]] [[Annobon Island]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Bioko Island]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Principe Island]], [[Saint Helena|Saint Helena Island]], [[Tristan da Cunha]] Island and [[Sargasso Sea]].\n\nThe knowledge of wind patterns and [[ocean current|currents]], the [[trade winds]] and the [[oceanic gyre]]s in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the Azores, using the winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of [[atmospheric circulation]] and the effect of [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]], facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese to venture farther from shore, a manoeuvre that became known as the ''\"volta do mar\"'' (''return of the sea''). In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish discovering the [[Manila Galleon]] trade route.\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Map of Angelino Dulcert cropped.jpg|thumb| Portolan of [[Angelino Dulcert]] (1339) showing [[Lanzarote]] island]]\n\nIn 1339 [[Angelino Dulcert]] of Majorca produced the [[portolan chart]] map. Evidently drawing from the information provided in 1336 by [[Lanceloto Malocello]] sponsored by King [[Dinis of Portugal]]. It showed [[Lanzarote]] island, named ''Insula de Lanzarotus Marocelus'' and marked by a Genoese shield, as well as the island of ''Forte Vetura'' ([[Fuerteventura]]) and ''Vegi Mari'' ([[Lobos Island|Lobos]]), although Dulcert also included some imaginary islands himself, notably [[Saint Brendan's Island]], and three islands he names ''Primaria'', ''Capraria'' and ''Canaria''.<ref name=\"Meli\u00e1 p.45\">Meli\u00e1 (p. 45)</ref>\n\nMestre Jacome was a Majorcan cartographer induced by Portuguese prince [[Henry the Navigator]] to move to Portugal in the 1420s to train Portuguese map-makers in Majorcan-style cartography.<ref>\"Mestre Jacome\" the Majorcan cartographer is first mentioned by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de situ Orbis'' (c. 1507, [https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog p. 58]). [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], in his ''Decadas de Asia'' (1552: I.16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA133 p. 133]) adds that he was also a master instrument-maker.</ref> 'Jacome of Majorca' is even sometimes described as the head of Henry's observatory and \"school\" at [[Sagres (Vila do Bispo)|Sagres]].<ref>\"He also from Majorca caused one Master James, a man skilfull (sic) in Navigation and in Cards and Sea Instruments, to be brought into Portugall, there at his charge as it were, to erect a Schoole of Marinership, and to instruct his Countreymen in that Mysterie.\"\n[[Samuel Purchas]], ''Hakluytus Posthumus'', (1625, vol. 2, pt.2 [https://archive.org/details/hakluytusposthu92purcgoog/page/n103 p.11])</ref>\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-mercator navigation chart of the Coast of Africa (1571), by [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] ([[Torre do Tombo National Archive|Torre do Tombo]], [[Lisbon]])]]\n\nIt is thought that [[Jehuda Cresques]], son of Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques of [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] in Majorca, and Italian-Majorcan [[Angelino Dulcert]] were cartographers at the service of Prince Henry. Majorca had many skilled Jewish cartographers. However, the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by [[Pedro Reinel]] in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]]. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of latitudes in 1504 and the first representation of a [[wind rose]].\n\nWith his son, cartographer [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Lopo Homem]], they participated in the making of the atlas known as \"Lopo Homem-Rein\u00e9s Atlas\" or \"[[Miller Atlas]]\", in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time. Emperor Charles V wanted them to work for him. In 1517 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] handed Lopo Homem a charter giving him the privilege to certify and amend all [[compass]] needles in vessels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe third phase of nautical cartography was characterized by the abandonment of [[Ptolemy]]'s representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents. [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (Goa \u22481520 \u2013 \u22481580), produced work of extraordinary quality and beauty, giving him a reputation as one of the best cartographers of the time.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area.

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

Bus lines which cross Dietzenbach are the town lines OF-56 and 57, the county lines OF95, 96, 97 and 99 as well as night line n71. ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 459, the [[Autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] and  [[Bundesautobahn 661|A&nbsp;661]] can be reached in a few minutes through the Offenbach [[interchange (road)|interchange]].\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Festival ===\nEach year in Dietzenbach, the following festivals offer a chance to pursue social contacts:\n* ''Apfelbl\u00fctenfest'' is being held in April.\n* ''Fest ohne Grenzen'' (\u201cFestival Without Borders\u201d), held at the Hessentagspark\n* ''Fest der Biere'' (\u201cFestival of Beers\u201d), held at the Harmonieplatz, lasts five days\n* ''Weinfest'' in the New Town Centre, runs ten days\n* ''Nacht der Lichter''(\u201cNight of the Lights\u201d)with \"Museumsnacht\" and \"Heimatfest\" held in the Old Town Centre\n* ''Trinkbornfest'' in the Old Town on the first weekend in September\n* ''Dietzenbacher Kelterfest'' about the \"\u00c4bbelwoi\" and the making of it\n* ''Kerb'' or ''[[Kirchweih]]'', always held on the last weekend in October. It stretches along Landwehrstra\u00dfe from Harmonieplatz to the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Schule (school). The revived tradition of the ''Kerbborsche'' \u2013 a group of young men who perform part of the ceremony<!--Perhaps someone can find out what part.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].<ref>USDA.gov{{cite web\n |url          = http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/#\n |title        = USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map\n |last1

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

Her mother is of eastern Cherokee nations and her father comes from the Lakota and Powhatan nations. Agard was exposed to art at a very young age, as her father was a portrait artist and muralist. She has credited this constant exposure to art as an early inspiration for her choice to create art herself.<ref name=\":0\" /> Agard also has immediate family that resides in both New York and the [[Pamunkey]]-[[Powhatan]] Reservation in [[the Dakotas]]. <ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nShe had expressed an intent to find her family on reservations and has returned to her ancestral homeland in Virginia, where much of the Powhatan people still reside. She also spent time living in the Carolinas and later the Dakotas, with the Lakota Nation she also came from. It was here where she was given her Indian name through ceremony. Her Indian name \u201cWinyan Luta\u201d can be closely translated to \u201cRed Woman\u201d in English, but more accurately translated in Latin as \u201cSacred Red Woman.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nIn the early 2000s, Agard was diagnosed with breast cancer but she later beat it. She had to take a step back from making art until creating \"Moon Breast Mother.\"<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nShe currently lives in her hometown of New York.  \n\n== Education ==\nIn June 1970, Agard earned a Bachelor's of Science in Art Education from [[New York University]]. Three years later, she continued her education in New York and completed a master's program, earning a Master's of Art in Art in Education at [[Columbia University]], Teacher\u2019s College in December of 1973. Between the years living in New York and pursuing higher education, Agard spent two summers studying in Europe. At the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica di Milano of Rome, Italy, in Summer 1969, Agard studied [[Renaissance art]] and [[Architecture]]. <ref name=\":2\" />And in Greece at the Aegina Arts Centre, she studied fine arts through Summer 1972. Agard's art later became a reflection of her international education, merging religion and cultures into much of her work.  \n\nAfter years of studying and earning numerous degrees relating to art, Agard began to teach, give lectures, and curate at various universities and museums in the United States, primarily in New York. She has also served as a lecturer for the Council for the Humanities, a nonprofit organization that tackles social concerns, from 2003-2005. <ref name=\":1\" /> \nShe was a professor at [[Bemidji State University]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farris|first= Phoebe|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40193578|title=Women artists of color : a bio-critical sourcebook to 20th century artists in the Americas|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|others=|year=|isbn=0-313-30374-6|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=3|oclc=40193578}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid 80s, Agard has taken several roles as a guest curator, and has used her time to give lectures and create artwork. As a curator, Agard has greatly contributed to bridge the gap between the modern and contemporary art movements of women.\n\n== Artworks ==\n\n===''Our Lady of Guadalakota''===\n''Our Lady of Guadalakota'' is a sepia pencil drawing by Agard created in 1997. Drawn with a sepia pencil, Agard has stated that the drawing symbolizes the catholic roots of Mesoamerica and the Lakota Nation that of which she is a part. Agard often depicts elements of the Virgin Mary to reflect divine femininity in her art.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farris|first=Phoebe|title=Contemporary Native American Women Artists: Visual Expression of Feminism, the Environment, and Identity|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The image of the Virgin Mary depicts female genitalia, which the artist describes as the \u201csacred door\u201d which humanity enters the world.

It consists of ten pieces and each square is 12\u2019\u2019x12\u2019\u2019.\n\nAgard created the work in 2003 after she very ill for some time and overcame breast cancer. She created each of the moons to be a soft  sculpture that reflects a woman\u2019s body in many phases and per Patricia Janis Brodis, shows the ongoing theme of her art that highlights female genitalia in a more open perspective. After having this piece in a solo exhibition in 2003, Agard now keeps the ten piece installation in her home in New York.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broder|first=Patricia Janis|title=Earth Songs, Moon Dreams: Paintings by American Indian Women|publisher=St. Martin's Press Book|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===''Wampum Moons of Change''===\nWampum Moons of Change is a twelve piece installation, with a similar format to her piece \u201cMoon Breast Mother\u201d.

Her mother is of eastern Cherokee nations and her father comes from the Lakota and Powhatan nations. Agard was exposed to art at a very young age, as her father was a portrait artist and muralist. She has credited this constant exposure to art as an early inspiration for her choice to create art herself.<ref name=\":0\" /> Agard also has immediate family that resides in both New York and the [[Pamunkey]]-[[Powhatan]] Reservation in [[the Dakotas]]. <ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nShe had expressed an intent to find her family on reservations and has returned to her ancestral homeland in Virginia, where much of the Powhatan people still reside. She also spent time living in the Carolinas and later the Dakotas, with the Lakota Nation she also came from. It was here where she was given her Indian name through ceremony. Her Indian name \u201cWinyan Luta\u201d can be closely translated to \u201cRed Woman\u201d in English, but more accurately translated in Latin as \u201cSacred Red Woman.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nIn the early 2000's, Agard was diagnosed with breast cancer but she later beat it. She had to take a step back from making art until creating \"Moon Breast Mother.\"<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nShe currently lives in her hometown of New York.  \n\n== Education ==\nIn June 1970, Agard earned a Bachelor's of Science in Art Education from [[New York University]]. Three years later, she continued her education in New York and completed a master's program, earning a Master's of Art in Art in Education at [[Columbia University]], Teacher\u2019s College in December of 1973. Between the years living in New York and pursuing higher education, Agard spent two summers studying in Europe. At the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica di Milano of Rome, Italy, in Summer 1969, Agard studied [[Renaissance art]] and [[Architecture]]. <ref name=\":2\" />And in Greece at the Aegina Arts Centre, she studied fine arts through Summer 1972. Agard's art later became a reflection of her international education, merging religion and cultures into much of her work.  \n\nAfter years of studying and earning numerous degrees relating to art, Agard began to teach, give lectures, and curate at various universities and museums in the United States, primarily in New York. She has also served as a lecturer for the Council for the Humanities, a nonprofit organization that tackles social concerns, from 2003-2005. <ref name=\":1\" /> \nShe was a professor at [[Bemidji State University]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farris|first= Phoebe|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40193578|title=Women artists of color : a bio-critical sourcebook to 20th century artists in the Americas|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|others=|year=|isbn=0-313-30374-6|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=3|oclc=40193578}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid 80s, Agard has taken several roles as a guest curator, and has used her time to give lectures and create artwork. As a curator, Agard has greatly contributed to bridge the gap between the modern and contemporary art movements of women.\n\n== Artworks ==\n\n===''Our Lady of Guadalakota''===\n''Our Lady of Guadalakota'' is a sepia pencil drawing by Agard created in 1997. Drawn with a sepia pencil, Agard has stated that the drawing symbolizes the catholic roots of Mesoamerica and the Lakota Nation that of which she is a part. Agard often depicts elements of the Virgin Mary to reflect divine femininity in her art.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farris|first=Phoebe|title=Contemporary Native American Women Artists: Visual Expression of Feminism, the Environment, and Identity|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The image of the Virgin Mary depicts female genitalia, which the artist describes as the \u201csacred door\u201d which humanity enters the world. The title itself is a play on words for the very commonly recognized \u201cOur Lady of Guadalupe,\u201d in Catholicism. The piece is dedicated to the \u201cLegend of the White Buffalo,\u201d a sacred woman of Lakota religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aktalakota.stjo.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=8862|title=Legend of the White Buffalo - Akta Lakota Museum & Cultural Center|website=aktalakota.stjo.org|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>  \n\n===''Moon Breast Mother: An Installation''===\n''Moon Breast Mother: An Installation'' is a mixed media soft sculpture that includes acrylic paint on a canvas. It consists of ten pieces and each square is 12\u2019\u2019x12\u2019\u2019.\n\nAgard created the work in 2003 after she very ill for some time and overcame breast cancer. She created each of the moons to be a soft  sculpture that reflects a woman\u2019s body in many phases and per Patricia Janis Brodis, shows the ongoing theme of her art that highlights female genitalia in a more open perspective. After having this piece in a solo exhibition in 2003, Agard now keeps the ten piece installation in her home in New York.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broder|first=Patricia Janis|title=Earth Songs, Moon Dreams: Paintings by American Indian Women|publisher=St. Martin's Press Book|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===''Wampum Moons of Change''===\nWampum Moons of Change is a twelve piece installation, with a similar format to her piece \u201cMoon Breast Mother\u201d.

Such change would currently require a unanimous approval of all EU members, and Piketty has suggested that a change of rules might be necessary, saying that if countries representing 80% of EU's population or GDP ratify a treaty, it should be approved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/02/12/a-quoi-ressemble-leurope-de-hamon-version-piketty/ |title=\u00c0 quoi ressemble l'Europe de Beno\u00eet Hamon version Thomas Piketty |last=Boudet |first=Alexandre |date=12 February 2017 |website=Le Huffington Post |access-date=13 March 2017 | language=french}}</ref> He is also in favour of a \"credible and bold [[basic income]]\", which is one of Benoit Hamon's key proposals, although their views on the matter are different.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2017/02/13/for-a-credible-and-bold-basic-income/ |title=For a credible and bold basic income |last=Piketty |first=Thomas |date=13 February 2017 |website=Le blog de Thomas Piketty |access-date=13 March 2017 | language=english}}</ref> The call in which Piketty and other economic researchers argue for their version of the basic income has been criticised as not \"universal\", a criticism he answered on his blog.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2017/02/13/is-our-basic-income-really-universal/ |title=Is our basic income really universal? |last=Piketty |first=Thomas |date=13 February 2017 |website=Le blog de Thomas Piketty |access-date=13 March 2017 | language=english}}</ref>\n\nThomas Piketty joined the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) in 2015 as the distinguished Centennial Professor. Piketty continues his research as part of the LSE International Inequalities Institute. His economic research focusses mainly on wealth inequalities and the use of capital in the 21st century. Piketty has long-standing ties to the [[London School of Economics]] and he completed his PhD studies at the university in the early 1990s.\n\nIn addition to his research, Piketty also teaches post-graduate students at the LSE. His teaching and research approach is inter-disciplinary and he has been involved in the teaching of the new MSc degree in Inequalities and Social Science at the London School of Economics.\n\n== Research ==\nPiketty specializes in [[economic inequality]], taking a historic and statistical approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jourdan.ens.fr/piketty/fichiers/presse/panorama/2009/WallStreetJournal_090312.html|title=The Obama Rosetta Stone|author=Daniel Henninger|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=12 March 2009|accessdate=28 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517222852/http://www.jourdan.ens.fr/piketty/fichiers/presse/panorama/2009/WallStreetJournal_090312.html|archivedate=17 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>See in particular his ''Introduction \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de la redistribution des richesses'', Economica, 1994.</ref> His work looks at the rate of [[capital accumulation]] in relation to economic growth over a two hundred year spread from the nineteenth century to the present. His novel use of tax records enabled him to gather data on the very top economic elite, who had previously been understudied, and to ascertain their rate of accumulation of wealth and how this compared to the rest of society and economy. His most recent book, ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', relies on economic data going back 250 years to show that an ever-rising concentration of wealth is not self-correcting. To address this problem, he proposes redistribution through a progressive global tax on wealth.<ref name=\"nybooks1\"/><ref>An In-depth review by Robert Boyer, leader of the French R\u00e9gulation school [http://regulation.revues.org/10618 in R\u00e9gulation Review]</ref>\n\n=== Study of long-term economic inequalities ===\n[[File:Thomas Piketty- Extreme inequality is useless for growth.webm|thumb|Thomas Piketty: Extreme inequality is useless for growth]]\nA research project on high incomes in France led to the book ''Les hauts revenus en France au XXe si\u00e8cle'' (''High incomes in France in the 20th Century'', Grasset, 2001), which was based on a survey of statistical series covering the whole of the 20th century, built from data from the fiscal services (particularly income tax declarations). He extended this analysis in his immensely popular book ''Le Capital au XXIe si\u00e8cle'' (''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'').\nA study by [[Emmanuel Saez]] and Piketty showed that the top 10 percent of earners took more than half of the country's total income in 2012, the highest level recorded since the government began collecting the relevant data a century ago.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Annie | last=Lowrey | title=The Rich Get Richer Through the Recovery | date=10 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/27/the-presidents-inequality-absurdities/ | work=New York Post | first=Michael | last=Tanner | title=The president's 'inequality' absurdities | date=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2012.pdf|title=Striking it Richer : The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (Updated with 2012 preliminary estimates)|author=Emmanuel Saez|date=September 3, 2013|website=Eml.berkeley.edu|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Survey on the evolution of inequalities in France ===\nPiketty's work shows that differences in earnings dropped sharply during the 20th century in France, mostly after World War II. He argues that this was due to a decrease in estate inequalities, while wage inequalities remained stable. The shrinking inequality during this period, Piketty says, resulted from a highly progressive income tax after the war, which upset the dynamics of estate accumulation by reducing the surplus money available for saving by the wealthiest.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe normative conclusion Piketty draws is that a tax cut and thus a decrease in the financial contribution to society of the wealthy that has been happening in France since the late 1990s will assist in the rebuilding of the earlier large fortunes of the [[Rentier state|rentier]] class. This trend will lead to the rise of what he calls patrimonial capitalism, in which a few families control most of the wealth.<ref name=Cassidy/>\n\nThrough a statistical survey, Piketty also showed that the [[Laffer curve|Laffer effect]], which claims that high marginal tax rates on top incomes are an incentive for the rich to work less, was probably negligible in the case of France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/public/Piketty1998d.pdf|title=Les Hauts revenus face aux modifications des taux marginaux sup\u00e9rieurs de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu en France, 1970\u20131996|publisher=\u00c9conomie et pr\u00e9vision, n\u00b0 138\u2013139|date=1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Comparative work ===\nPiketty has done comparative work on inequality in other developed countries.

Banerjee, R. Benabou et D. Mookerhee (eds.), ''Understanding poverty'', Oxford university press, 2005.</ref> According to Kuznets, the long-term evolution of earnings inequalities was shaped as a curve ([[Simon_Kuznets#Kuznets_curve|Kuznets curve]]). Growth started at the beginning of the industrial revolution, and slackened off later due to the reallocation of the labor force from low productivity sectors like agriculture to higher productivity sectors like industry.\n\nAccording to Piketty, the tendency observed by Kuznets in the early 1950s is not necessarily a product of deep economic forces (e.g. sectoral spillover or the effects of technological progress). Instead, estate values, rather than wage inequalities, decreased, and they did so for reasons that were not specifically economic (for example, the creation of income tax). Consequently, the decrease would not necessarily continue, and in fact, inequalities have grown sharply in the United States over the last thirty years, returning to their 1930s level.\n\n=== Other work ===\nBesides these surveys, which make up the core of his work, Piketty has published in other areas, often with a connection to economic inequalities. His work on schools, for example, postulates that disparities among different schools, especially class sizes, are a cause for the persistence of inequalities in wages and the economy.<ref>T.

His most recent book, ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', relies on economic data going back 250 years to show that an ever-rising concentration of wealth is not self-correcting.

He extended this analysis in his immensely popular book ''Le Capital au XXIe si\u00e8cle'' (''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'').\nA study by [[Emmanuel Saez]] and Piketty showed that the top 10 percent of earners took more than half of the country's total income in 2012, the highest level recorded since the government began collecting the relevant data a century ago.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Annie | last=Lowrey | title=The Rich Get Richer Through the Recovery | date=10 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/27/the-presidents-inequality-absurdities/ | work=New York Post | first=Michael | last=Tanner | title=The president's 'inequality' absurdities | date=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2012.pdf|title=Striking it Richer : The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (Updated with 2012 preliminary estimates)|author=Emmanuel Saez|date=September 3, 2013|website=Eml.berkeley.edu|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Survey on the evolution of inequalities in France ===\nPiketty's work shows that differences in earnings dropped sharply during the 20th century in France, mostly after World War II. He argues that this was due to a decrease in estate inequalities, while wage inequalities remained stable. The shrinking inequality during this period, Piketty says, resulted from a highly progressive income tax after the war, which upset the dynamics of estate accumulation by reducing the surplus money available for saving by the wealthiest.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe normative conclusion Piketty draws is that a tax cut and thus a decrease in the financial contribution to society of the wealthy that has been happening in France since the late 1990s will assist in the rebuilding of the earlier large fortunes of the [[Rentier state|rentier]] class. This trend will lead to the rise of what he calls patrimonial capitalism, in which a few families control most of the wealth.<ref name=Cassidy/>\n\nThrough a statistical survey, Piketty also showed that the [[Laffer curve|Laffer effect]], which claims that high marginal tax rates on top incomes are an incentive for the rich to work less, was probably negligible in the case of France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/public/Piketty1998d.pdf|title=Les Hauts revenus face aux modifications des taux marginaux sup\u00e9rieurs de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu en France, 1970\u20131996|publisher=\u00c9conomie et pr\u00e9vision, n\u00b0 138\u2013139|date=1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Comparative work ===\nPiketty has done comparative work on inequality in other developed countries.

Banerjee, R. Benabou et D. Mookerhee (eds.), ''Understanding poverty'', Oxford university press, 2005.</ref> According to Kuznets, the long-term evolution of earnings inequalities was shaped as a curve ([[Simon_Kuznets#Kuznets_curve|Kuznets curve]]). Growth started at the beginning of the industrial revolution, and slackened off later due to the reallocation of the labor force from low productivity sectors like agriculture to higher productivity sectors like industry.\n\nAccording to Piketty, the tendency observed by Kuznets in the early 1950s is not necessarily a product of deep economic forces (e.g. sectoral spillover or the effects of technological progress). Instead, estate values, rather than wage inequalities, decreased, and they did so for reasons that were not specifically economic (for example, the creation of income tax). Consequently, the decrease would not necessarily continue, and in fact, inequalities have grown sharply in the United States over the last thirty years, returning to their 1930s level.\n\n=== Other work ===\nBesides these surveys, which make up the core of his work, Piketty has published in other areas, often with a connection to economic inequalities. His work on schools, for example, postulates that disparities among different schools, especially class sizes, are a cause for the persistence of inequalities in wages and the economy.<ref>T.

A thermoregulatory sweat test can evaluate the body\u2019s response to a thermal stimulus by inducing sweating through a hot box \u2044 room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing indicates hypohidrosis, and further tests may be required to localize the [[lesion]].\n\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] of the brain and \u2044 or spinal cord is the best modality for evaluation when the lesion is suspected to be localized to the [[central nervous system]].\n\n[[Skin biopsies]] are useful when anhidrosis occurs as part of a [[dermatological]] disorder. Biopsy results may reveal the sweat gland destruction, [[necrosis]] or [[fibrosis]], in addition to the findings of the primary dermatological disorder.\n\n==Management==\nThe treatment options for hypohidrosis and anhidrosis is limited. Those with hypohidrosis should avoid drugs that can aggravate the condition (see medication-causes). They should limit activities that raise the core body temperature and if exercises are to be performed, they should be supervised and be performed in a cool, sheltered and well-ventilated environment. In instances where the cause is known, treatment should be directed at the primary pathology. In autoimmune diseases, such as [[Sj\u00f6gren syndrome]] and [[systemic sclerosis]], treatment of the underlying disease using [[immunosuppressive drugs]] may lead to improvement in hypohidrosis. In neurological diseases, the primary pathology is often irreversible. In these instances, prevention of further neurological damage, such as good glycaemic control in [[diabetes]], is the cornerstone of management. In [[acquired generalized anhidrosis]], spontaneous remission may be observed in some cases. Numerous cases have been reported to respond effectively to systemic [[corticosteroids]]. Although an optimum dose and regime has not been established, pulse [[methylprednisolone]] (up to 1000&nbsp;mg \u2044 day) has been reported to have good effect.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n* http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/anhidrosis/DS01050{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n*{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003219|Sweating - absent}}\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 21064\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|L|74|4|l|60}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|705.0}}\n| MeshID          = D007007\n}}\n[[Category:Body fluids]]\n[[Category:Reflexes]]\n[[Category:Excretion]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Abnormally reduced sweating}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Hypohidrosis\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           = Dermatology, neurology\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = [[hyperthermia]], heat stroke and death\n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Hypohidrosis''' is a disorder in which a person exhibits diminished sweating in response to appropriate stimuli.

A thermoregulatory sweat test can evaluate the body\u2019s response to a thermal stimulus by inducing sweating through a hot box \u2044 room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing indicates hypohidrosis, and further tests may be required to localize the [[lesion]].\n\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] of the brain and \u2044 or spinal cord is the best modality for evaluation when the lesion is suspected to be localized to the [[central nervous system]].\n\n[[Skin biopsies]] are useful when anhidrosis occurs as part of a [[dermatological]] disorder. Biopsy results may reveal the sweat gland destruction, [[necrosis]] or [[fibrosis]], in addition to the findings of the primary dermatological disorder.\n\n==Management==\nThe treatment options for hypohidrosis and anhidrosis is limited. Those with hypohidrosis should avoid drugs that can aggravate the condition (see medication-causes). They should limit activities that raise the core body temperature and if exercises are to be performed, they should be supervised and be performed in a cool, sheltered and well-ventilated environment. In instances where the cause is known, treatment should be directed at the primary pathology. In autoimmune diseases, such as [[Sj\u00f6gren syndrome]] and [[systemic sclerosis]], treatment of the underlying disease using [[immunosuppressive drugs]] may lead to improvement in hypohidrosis. In neurological diseases, the primary pathology is often irreversible. In these instances, prevention of further neurological damage, such as good glycaemic control in [[diabetes]], is the cornerstone of management. In [[acquired generalized anhidrosis]], spontaneous remission may be observed in some cases. Numerous cases have been reported to respond effectively to systemic [[corticosteroids]]. Although an optimum dose and regime has not been established, pulse [[methylprednisolone]] (up to 1000&nbsp;mg \u2044 day) has been reported to have good effect.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n* http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/anhidrosis/DS01050{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n*{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003219|Sweating - absent}}\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 21064 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|L|74|4|l|60}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|705.0}}\n}}\n[[Category:Body fluids]]\n[[Category:Reflexes]]\n[[Category:Excretion]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypohidrosis"}

It replaced the modular-based 1950s \"Old style\" [[Tan (color)|tan]]-[[khaki]] cotton canvas equipment (similar in design to the [[British Army]]'s [[58 pattern webbing]]) and a variety of load-carrying waistcoats and assault vests used by Israeli infantry and elite units during the [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]], the [[War of Attrition|1967-1970 War of Attrition]], and the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]].<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 12.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Forces since 1948'' (1988), p. 57.</ref>\n\n==History and development==\nThe IDF load-bearing system or '''Ephod''' (\"apron\" or \"avantail\" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) is the direct result of the long experience acquired over the years with the \"commando web gear\" originally worn by [[Israeli special forces units|Israeli recon paratroopers]] during the War of Attrition, who made crude but comfortable Khaki or Olive Green waistcoats and assault vests incorporating many small canvas or [[Cordura|Nylon]] pouches.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 12.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Forces since 1948'' (1988), p. 57.</ref><ref>D'Elia, ''Personal Load Carrying Equipment'' (1992), p. 38.</ref> Known as the \"New style\" Load Bearing Equipment, the Ephod was designed by the Israeli private firm [[Rabintex Industries Ltd.]] of [[Herzeliya]] near [[Tel Aviv]] in 1975-76, who allegedly developed it from an American prototype.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 39.</ref>\n\n===Description===\nThe \"New style\" Load Bearing Equipment prototype presented in 1976 by Rabintex was made entirely of [[Olive (color)|olive green]] (OG) [[Cordura|Cordura-type nylon]] and consisted of wide unpadded shoulder straps or suspenders and an \"X\"-back harness or \"yoke\" system fitted with three chest/side and back panels fitted with a detachable [[Foam rubber|foam]]-padded waist-band or \"belt\", secured at the front by two strap-and-buckle attachment loops. One novel feature of the Ephod is that his yoke spread the weight to be borne over the shoulders and was not secured to a conventional waist belt. His suspenders were joined in the area of the shoulder-blades by a lateral piece to which was stitched a rectangular web loop with eyelets for attaching a [[Entrenching tool|U.S.-type entrenching tool]], a feature also found in the \"Old style\" web gear suspenders.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref>\n\nAnother feature of the Ephod was his wide cushioned waist-band fitted at the back of the panels by snap buttons, which distributed the weight well all around the waist. Many Israeli soldiers in the field had found the canvas material of the IDF standard issue \"Old style\" web gear and the load they carried to be very uncomfortable, and so wore padding underneath the pistol belt and waist pouches;<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), pp. 5; 52-53.</ref> this aspect was taken into consideration by the designers of the Ephod, who devised a unique system in which the ammunition pouches, the grenade carriers and other equipment rest on three [[Foam rubber|foam]] pads tied together by [[parachute cord]] lacing at four points, allowing infinite adjustment to individual size.<ref>D'Elia, ''Personal Load Carrying Equipment'' (1992), p. 38.</ref><ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref> Like the front extremities of the yoke, they were not secured to the cushioned waist-band but to the pouches instead.\n\nThe pouches came in three sets, left, right, and back. Each consists of a nylon base panel, in which a total of nine integral nylon pouches of five different sizes, comprising four large magazine pouches, two individual [[hand grenade]] carriers, one [[smoke grenade]] carrier, one [[First aid kit]] pouch and one rear pouch for carrying [[binoculars]] or [[Night-vision device|night-vision equipment]] are stitched.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref> All pouch flaps are fitted with [[Velcro]] [[Hook-and-loop fastener]] strips reinforced by a single metal eyelet and the larger magazine pouches each had at the lower end a nylon frog with two eyelets for additional pouches fitted with US-type M1910 hooks. In addition, the Ephod's back panel has two and the chest/side panels four snap loops for attaching the \"Old style\" web pistol belt and two detachable [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] pouches.\n\nDesigned to be worn over a [[Flak jacket|flak vest]], the Ephod Combat Vest is usually worn rather high and it can be put on and off in one piece, like a jacket. Its magazine pouches can hold up to twelve [[M16 rifle|M16]], [[IMI Galil]] or [[AK-47]] series magazines, along with additional pouches for medical equipment, 7.62mm [[FN MAG]] machine gun belts, [[40 mm grenade|40mm rounds]] and attachments for packs.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), p. 49.</ref> In addition, the asymmetrical arrangement of ammunition of the Ephod allows maximum comfort when in firing position, providing the soldier with an elbow rest when holding his rifle.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref> These characteristics made the Ephod an ingenious and versatile system, adaptable to the various needs of modern combat troops,<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref> considered at the time by some specialists a revolutionary, imaginative design and the best in the world.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n====Second-model Ephod vest====\n\n====Late-model Ephod vest====\n\n====Armoured Corps Web Gear====\nWhen the Ephod was issued to [[Armored Corps (Israel)|IDF Armoured Corps]] crewmen in 1978, they found that the standard combat vest was very cumbersome while operating in the confines of an armoured vehicle, so a special set was developed. Based on the ChiCom [[AK-47]] chest rig, the '''Ephod HaShan''' or '''Ephod Heil HaShiryon''' (\"Armoured Corps web gear\") load-bearing equipment is a variation of the Ephod and consists of four frontal rectangular magazine chest pouches designed specifically for the \"sitting\" tank soldiers, complete with two regular pouches for rectangular canteens worn on either side.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), p. 56.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Battleground Lebanon'' (1990), Plate A4.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israel's Cutting Edge'' (1990), p. 36.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Tools of the Trade \u2013 The Weapons, Gear & Uniforms of the IDF'' (1991), Plate B3.</ref>\n\n====Advanced Ephod====\n\n==Combat use==\n\n===Israeli service===\nThe Ephod made its operational d\u00e9but during the famous [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]] in [[July 1976]]<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Units since 1948'' (1988), p. 60.</ref><ref>Dunstan, ''Israel's Lighting Strike, The raid on Entebbe 1976'' (2009), p. 33.</ref> and was introduced the following year into Israeli forces,<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), p. 36.</ref>  though its massive use by Israeli troops came only during the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]]<ref>Russel & Katz, ''Israeli Defense Forces \u2013 1948 to the present'' (1985), p. 51.</ref> and the subsequent [[1982 Lebanon War|June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon]].<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Units since 1948'' (1988), p. 60.</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\nThe Ephod also began to be marketed to foreign recipients of Israeli military aid in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the first [[Latin America]]n country to receive it was [[Nicaragua]] in 1977-78.<ref>Caballero Jurado & Thomas, ''Central American Wars 1959\u201389'' (1990), p. 44.</ref> With the adoption of Israeli-made small-arms in 1976, the [[Somoza family|Somoza Regime]] ordered substantial quantities of the Ephod to equip the elite and infantry units of its [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|Nicaraguan National Guard]]. Later during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|1978-79 Nicaraguan Revolution]], captured Ephod vests were also worn by [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) guerrillas.\n\n[[Guatemala]] also received the Ephod for the [[Armed Forces of Guatemala|Guatemalan Army]]'s Parachute Brigade and [[Kaibiles]], while [[Ecuador]] adopted it for its [[Ecuadorian Navy#Marines|Naval Infantry Corps]] troops and [[Peru]] acquired Ephod vests to equip its [[Peruvian Armed Forces|Army]] and [[Peruvian Naval Infantry|Naval Infantry]] units. [[Argentina]] also adopted the Ephod for the [[Argentine Army]]'s [[8th Mountain Cazadores Company]] of the [[8th Mountain Infantry Brigade (Argentina)|8th Mountain Infantry Brigade]].<ref>Rivet, ''La 8e Brigade de Montagne Argentine'' (1996), p. 41.</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\nDuring the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the pro-Israeli militias in Lebanon, the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] (LF)<ref name=\"KVAL A\">Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), pp. 40-41.</ref><ref name=\"KVAAMEW2 A\">Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>Micheletti and Debay, ''Liban \u2013 dix jours aux c\u0153ur des combats'' (1989), pp. 12; 33-38.</ref> and the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA)<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), p. 38.</ref> also began to receive the Ephod in substantial quantities to equip their troops at the late 1970s, with captured examples eventually finding their way into the hands of militiamen from other Lebanese factions throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

The vest proved so popular during the War that the Lebanese soon began producing an unlicensed local copy, which was adopted in the mid-1990s by the [[Lebanese Army]] as standard web gear for its infantry troops.<ref name=\"EA LZL A\">El-Assad, ''Landing Zone Lebanon'' (2007), p. 35.</ref>\n\nRecently, Lebanese-produced Ephod vests have been encountered among regular soldiers of the [[Syrian Army]] and their adversaries of the [[Free Syrian Army]] and other rebel factions currently engaged in the [[Syrian Civil War|ongoing civil war in Syria]].\n\n===Asia===\nThe [[Sri Lanka Army]] (SLA) adopted in the 1980s-1990s the Ephod for its infantry, commando and special forces units equipped with the [[AKM]] assault rifle, who battled the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) insurgency during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] (1983-2009).\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) began to introduce their own version of the Ephod, known as the '''Skeletal Battle Order (SBO)''', for its infantry units.<Ref>https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/singapore-couple-start-company-selling-miniature-figurines-of-saf-soldiers</ref><ref name=\"2017 ISSUE 243\">https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/content/dam/imindef_media_library/graphics/army/army_news/download_our_issues/2017/armynews_issue243.pdf</ref> Manufactured primarily by the [[Johsen Equipment Company]] of [[Singapore]], the early models were direct copies of the original Israeli combat vest, featuring four large magazine pouches capable of accommodating eight 30-round [[M16 rifle|M16S1 assault rifle]] magazines, two narrow side pouches meant to store pen flares, two hand grenade carriers, one smoke grenade carrier, and a small butt-pack with two smaller side pouches. Later models of the SBO combat vest replaced the metal size adjusters in the suspenders and side panels with plastic buckles, and featured larger magazine pouches designed to hold the new plastic magazines for the [[SAR 21]] assault rifle which were more voluminous than those of the M16S1. The Ephod-based SBO continued to be issued to SAF infantry battalions until 2006-2007, when it was replaced a new model of [[Individual Integrated Fighting System|Load bearing vest]] (LBV) based on the [[MOLLE]]/[[Pouch Attachment Ladder System]]s (PALS).\n\n===Europe===\nThe [[Italian Army]] adopted the Ephod in the early 1990s and issued it as standard web gear for the paratroopers of the [[Paratroopers Brigade Folgore|Folgore Airborne Brigade]] deployed at the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in the cadre of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] on April\u2013July 1991.<ref name=\"Heraut A\">Heraut, ''Italian Army's new gear \u2013 ready for the next century'' (1992), pp. 32-36.</ref> The [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Incursori'') unit of the Folgore Brigade later employed the Ephod in combat when they participated in [[Operation Silver Back]] on April 1994, the joint multi-national effort to evacuate foreign nationals from [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]]'s capital city, during the [[Rwandan Civil War]].<ref>Charlier, ''Rescuing Europeans from the Rwandan Civil War'' (1994), p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe [[French Armed Forces]] elite units of the [[Special Operations Command (France)|Special Operations Command]] deployed to [[Rwanda]] in the cadre of [[Op\u00e9ration Turquoise]] on June\u2013August 1994 were photographed wearing a unique set of Load Bearing Equipment remarkably similar in design to the Israeli Ephod Combat Vest.<ref name=\"COSR\">Micheletti, ''COS intervention in Rwanda'' (1994), pp. 42-47.</ref>\n\nA number of Ephod vests were sent to the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1998 as aid from [[Israel]], and subsequently used by the [[Special Police Units (Serbia)]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. After the war, all of the Ephod vests seem to have been transferred to the [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)]], where they were mostly used during training. After the [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)]] was disbanded, the fate of the Ephod vests becomes unknown, while some were seen in use by the [[Gendarmery (Serbia)]], they were quickly retired and only a few examples remain in use.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

It replaced the modular-based 1950s \"Old style\" [[Tan (color)|tan]]-[[khaki]] cotton canvas equipment (similar in design to the [[British Army]]'s [[58 pattern webbing]]) and a variety of load-carrying waistcoats and assault vests used by Israeli infantry and elite units during the [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]], the [[War of Attrition|1967-1970 War of Attrition]], and the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]].<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 12.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Forces since 1948'' (1988), p. 57.</ref>\n\n==History and development==\nThe IDF load-bearing system or '''Ephod''' (\"apron\" or \"avantail\" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) is the direct result of the long experience acquired over the years with the \"commando web gear\" originally worn by [[Israeli special forces units|Israeli recon paratroopers]] during the War of Attrition, who made crude but comfortable Khaki or Olive Green waistcoats and assault vests incorporating many small canvas or [[Cordura|Nylon]] pouches.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 12.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Forces since 1948'' (1988), p. 57.</ref><ref>D'Elia, ''Personal Load Carrying Equipment'' (1992), p. 38.</ref> Known as the \"New style\" Load Bearing Equipment, the Ephod was designed by the Israeli private firm [[Rabintex Industries Ltd.]] of [[Herzeliya]] near [[Tel Aviv]] in 1975-76, who allegedly developed it from an American prototype.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 39.</ref>\n\n===Description===\nThe \"New style\" Load Bearing Equipment prototype presented in 1976 by Rabintex was made entirely of [[Olive (color)|olive green]] (OG) [[Cordura|Cordura-type nylon]] and consisted of wide unpadded shoulder straps or suspenders and an \"X\"-back harness or \"yoke\" system fitted with three chest/side and back panels fitted with a detachable [[Foam rubber|foam]]-padded waist-band or \"belt\", secured at the front by two strap-and-buckle attachment loops. One novel feature of the Ephod is that his yoke spread the weight to be borne over the shoulders and was not secured to a conventional waist belt. His suspenders were joined in the area of the shoulder-blades by a lateral piece to which was stitched a rectangular web loop with eyelets for attaching a [[Entrenching tool|U.S.-type entrenching tool]], a feature also found in the \"Old style\" web gear suspenders.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref>\n\nAnother feature of the Ephod was his wide cushioned waist-band fitted at the back of the panels by snap buttons, which distributed the weight well all around the waist. Many Israeli soldiers in the field had found the canvas material of the IDF standard issue \"Old style\" web gear and the load they carried to be very uncomfortable, and so wore padding underneath the pistol belt and waist pouches;<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), pp. 5; 52-53.</ref> this aspect was taken into consideration by the designers of the Ephod, who devised a unique system in which the ammunition pouches, the grenade carriers and other equipment rest on three [[Foam rubber|foam]] pads tied together by [[parachute cord]] lacing at four points, allowing infinite adjustment to individual size.<ref>D'Elia, ''Personal Load Carrying Equipment'' (1992), p. 38.</ref><ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref> Like the front extremities of the yoke, they were not secured to the cushioned waist-band but to the pouches instead.\n\nThe pouches came in three sets, left, right, and back. Each consists of a nylon base panel, in which a total of nine integral nylon pouches of five different sizes, comprising four large magazine pouches, two individual [[hand grenade]] carriers, one [[smoke grenade]] carrier, one [[First aid kit]] pouch and one rear pouch for carrying [[binoculars]] or [[Night-vision device|night-vision equipment]] are stitched.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref> All pouch flaps are fitted with [[Velcro]] [[Hook-and-loop fastener]] strips reinforced by a single metal eyelet and the larger magazine pouches each had at the lower end a nylon frog with two eyelets for additional pouches fitted with US-type M1910 hooks. In addition, the Ephod's back panel has two and the chest/side panels four snap loops for attaching the \"Old style\" web pistol belt and two detachable [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] pouches.\n\nDesigned to be worn over a [[Flak jacket|flak vest]], the Ephod Combat Vest is usually worn rather high and it can be put on and off in one piece, like a jacket. Its magazine pouches can hold up to twelve [[M16 rifle|M16]], [[IMI Galil]] or [[AK-47]] series magazines, along with additional pouches for medical equipment, 7.62mm [[FN MAG]] machine gun belts, [[40 mm grenade|40mm rounds]] and attachments for packs.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), p. 49.</ref> In addition, the asymmetrical arrangement of ammunition of the Ephod allows maximum comfort when in firing position, providing the soldier with an elbow rest when holding his rifle.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref> These characteristics made the Ephod an ingenious and versatile system, adaptable to the various needs of modern combat troops,<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref> considered at the time by some specialists a revolutionary, imaginative design and the best in the world.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n====Second-model Ephod vest====\n\n====Late-model Ephod vest====\n\n====Armoured Corps Web Gear====\nWhen the Ephod was issued to [[Armored Corps (Israel)|IDF Armoured Corps]] crewmen in 1978, they found that the standard combat vest was very cumbersome while operating in the confines of an armoured vehicle, so a special set was developed. Based on the ChiCom [[AK-47]] chest rig, the '''Ephod HaShan''' or '''Ephod Heil HaShiryon''' (\"Armoured Corps web gear\") load-bearing equipment is a variation of the Ephod and consists of four frontal rectangular magazine chest pouches designed specifically for the \"sitting\" tank soldiers, complete with two regular pouches for rectangular canteens worn on either side.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), p. 56.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Battleground Lebanon'' (1990), Plate A4.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israel's Cutting Edge'' (1990), p. 36.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Tools of the Trade \u2013 The Weapons, Gear & Uniforms of the IDF'' (1991), Plate B3.</ref>\n\n====Advanced Ephod====\n\n==Combat use==\n\n===Israeli service===\nThe Ephod made its operational d\u00e9but during the famous [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]] in [[July 1976]]<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Units since 1948'' (1988), p. 60.</ref><ref>Dunstan, ''Israel's Lighting Strike, The raid on Entebbe 1976'' (2009), p. 33.</ref> and was introduced the following year into Israeli forces,<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), p. 36.</ref>  though its massive use by Israeli troops came only during the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]]<ref>Russel & Katz, ''Israeli Defense Forces \u2013 1948 to the present'' (1985), p. 51.</ref> and the subsequent [[1982 Lebanon War|June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon]].<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Units since 1948'' (1988), p. 60.</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\nThe Ephod also began to be marketed to foreign recipients of Israeli military aid in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the first [[Latin America]]n country to receive it was [[Nicaragua]] in 1977-78.<ref>Caballero Jurado & Thomas, ''Central American Wars 1959\u201389'' (1990), p. 44.</ref> With the adoption of Israeli-made small-arms in 1976, the [[Somoza family|Somoza Regime]] ordered substantial quantities of the Ephod to equip the elite and infantry units of its [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|Nicaraguan National Guard]]. Later during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|1978-79 Nicaraguan Revolution]], captured Ephod vests were also worn by [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) guerrillas.\n\n[[Guatemala]] also received the Ephod for the [[Armed Forces of Guatemala|Guatemalan Army]]'s Parachute Brigade and [[Kaibiles]], while [[Ecuador]] adopted it for its [[Ecuadorian Navy#Marines|Naval Infantry Corps]] troops and [[Peru]] acquired Ephod vests to equip its [[Peruvian Armed Forces|Army]] and [[Peruvian Naval Infantry|Naval Infantry]] units. [[Argentina]] also adopted the Ephod for the [[Argentine Army]]'s [[8th Mountain Cazadores Company]] of the [[8th Mountain Infantry Brigade (Argentina)|8th Mountain Infantry Brigade]].<ref>Rivet, ''La 8e Brigade de Montagne Argentine'' (1996), p. 41.</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\nDuring the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the pro-Israeli militias in Lebanon, the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] (LF)<ref name=\"KVAL A\">Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), pp. 40-41.</ref><ref name=\"KVAAMEW2 A\">Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>Micheletti and Debay, ''Liban \u2013 dix jours aux c\u0153ur des combats'' (1989), pp. 12; 33-38.</ref> and the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA)<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), p. 38.</ref> also began to receive the Ephod in substantial quantities to equip their troops at the late 1970s, with captured examples eventually finding their way into the hands of militiamen from other Lebanese factions throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

The vest proved so popular during the War that the Lebanese soon began producing an unlicensed local copy, which was adopted in the mid-1990s by the [[Lebanese Army]] as standard web gear for its infantry troops.<ref name=\"EA LZL A\">El-Assad, ''Landing Zone Lebanon'' (2007), p. 35.</ref>\n\nRecently, Lebanese-produced Ephod vests have been encountered among regular soldiers of the [[Syrian Army]] and their adversaries of the [[Free Syrian Army]] and other rebel factions currently engaged in the [[Syrian Civil War|ongoing civil war in Syria]].\n\n===Asia===\nThe [[Sri Lanka Army]] (SLA) adopted in the 1980s-1990s the Ephod for its infantry, commando and special forces units equipped with the [[AKM]] assault rifle, who battled the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) insurgency during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] (1983-2009).\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) began to introduce their own version of the Ephod, known as the '''Skeletal Battle Order (SBO)''', for its infantry units.<Ref>https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/singapore-couple-start-company-selling-miniature-figurines-of-saf-soldiers</ref><ref name=\"2017 ISSUE 243\">https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/content/dam/imindef_media_library/graphics/army/army_news/download_our_issues/2017/armynews_issue243.pdf</ref> Manufactured primarily by the [[Johsen Equipment Company]] of [[Singapore]], the early models were direct copies of the original Israeli combat vest, featuring four large magazine pouches capable of accommodating eight 30-round [[M16 rifle|M16S1 assault rifle]] magazines, two narrow side pouches meant to store pen flares, two hand grenade carriers, one smoke grenade carrier, and a small butt-pack with two smaller side pouches. Later models of the SBO combat vest replaced the metal size adjusters in the suspenders and side panels with plastic buckles, and featured larger magazine pouches designed to hold the new plastic magazines for the [[SAR 21]] assault rifle which were more voluminous than those of the M16S1. The Ephod-based SBO continued to be issued to SAF infantry battalions until 2006-2007, when it was replaced a new model of [[Individual Integrated Fighting System|Load bearing vest]] (LBV) based on the [[MOLLE]]/[[Pouch Attachment Ladder System]]s (PALS).\n\n===Europe===\nThe [[Italian Army]] adopted the Ephod in the early 1990s and issued it as standard web gear for the paratroopers of the [[Paratroopers Brigade Folgore|Folgore Airborne Brigade]] deployed at the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in the cadre of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] on April\u2013July 1991.<ref name=\"Heraut A\">Heraut, ''Italian Army's new gear \u2013 ready for the next century'' (1992), pp. 32-36.</ref> The [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Incursori'') unit of the Folgore Brigade later employed the Ephod in combat when they participated in [[Operation Silver Back]] on April 1994, the joint multi-national effort to evacuate foreign nationals from [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]]'s capital city, during the [[Rwandan Civil War]].<ref>Charlier, ''Rescuing Europeans from the Rwandan Civil War'' (1994), p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe [[French Armed Forces]] elite units of the [[Special Operations Command (France)|Special Operations Command]] deployed to [[Rwanda]] in the cadre of [[Op\u00e9ration Turquoise]] on June\u2013August 1994 were photographed wearing a unique set of Load Bearing Equipment remarkably similar in design to the Israeli Ephod Combat Vest.<ref name=\"COSR\">Micheletti, ''COS intervention in Rwanda'' (1994), pp. 42-47.</ref>\n\nA number of Ephod vests were sent to the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1998 as aid from [[Israel]], and subsequently used by the [[Special Police Units (Serbia)]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. After the war, all of the Ephod vests seem to have been transferred to the [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)]], where they were mostly used during training. After the [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)]] was disbanded, the fate of the Ephod vests becomes unknown, while some were seen in use by the [[Gendarmery (Serbia)]], they were quickly retired and only a few examples remain in use.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.
