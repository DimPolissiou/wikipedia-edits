{"title_page": "Speed of sound", "text_new": "{{short description|Distance travelled during a unit of time by a sound wave propagating through an elastic medium}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Sound measurements}}\n\nThe '''speed of sound''' is the distance travelled per unit time by a [[sound wave]] as it propagates through an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] medium. At {{convert|20|C|F}}, the speed of sound in air is about {{convert|343|m/s|km/h ft/s mph kn|0}}, or a kilometre in {{nobreak|2.9 s}} or a mile in {{nobreak|4.7 s}}. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a [[sound wave]] is propagating.\n\nThe speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]] depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.\n\nIn common everyday speech, ''speed of sound'' refers to the speed of sound waves in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: typically sound travels most slowly in [[gas]]es; it travels faster in [[liquid]]s; and faster still in [[solids]]. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at {{nobreak|343 m/s}} in air; it travels at {{nobreak|1,481 m/s}} in [[water]] (almost 4.3 times as fast as in air); and at {{nobreak|5,120 m/s}} in iron (almost 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at {{convert|12000|m/s}}<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/soundv.html Speed of Sound]</ref>{{mdash}}about 35 times as fast as in air{{mdash}}which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.\n\nSound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and a different type of sound wave called a [[S-wave|shear wave]], which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in [[seismology]]. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]], [[shear modulus]] and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.\n\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the fluid is called the object's [[Mach number]]. Objects moving at speeds greater than ''{{gaps|Mach|1}}'' are said to be traveling at [[supersonic]] speeds.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s 1687 ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' includes a computation of the speed of sound in air as {{convert|979|ft/s|m/s|0}}.  This is too low by about 15%.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://mathpages.com/home/kmath109/kmath109.htm\n| title = The Speed of Sound\n| publisher = mathpages.com\n| accessdate = 3 May 2015\n}}</ref> The discrepancy is due primarily to neglecting the (then unknown) effect of rapidly-fluctuating temperature in a sound wave (in modern terms, sound wave compression and expansion of air is an [[adiabatic process]], not an [[isothermal process]]).

This is longer than the standard \"international foot\" in common use today, which was officially defined in 1959 as 304.8&nbsp;mm.)\n\nDerham used a telescope from the tower of the [[church of St Laurence, Upminster]] to observe the flash of a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half-second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including [[North Ockendon]] church. The distance was known by [[triangulation]], and thus the speed that the sound had travelled was calculated.<ref name=\"Tony Fox\">{{cite book\n| title = Essex Journal\n| last = Fox\n| first = Tony\n| pages = 12\u201316\n| year = 2003\n| publisher = Essex Arch & Hist Soc\n}}</ref>\n\n== Basic concepts ==\nThe transmission of sound can be illustrated by using a model consisting of an array of spherical objects interconnected by springs.\n\nIn real material terms, the spheres represent the material's molecules and the springs represent the [[Chemical bond|bonds]] between them. Sound passes through the system by compressing and expanding the springs, transmitting the acoustic energy to neighboring spheres. This helps transmit the energy in-turn to the neighboring sphere's springs (bonds), and so on.\n\nThe speed of sound through the model depends on the [[stiffness]]/rigidity of the [[Spring (device)|spring]]s, and the mass of the spheres. As long as the spacing of the spheres remains constant, stiffer springs/bonds transmit energy quicker, while larger spheres transmit the energy slower.\n\nIn a real material, the stiffness of the springs is known as the \"[[elastic modulus]]\", and the mass corresponds to the material [[density]]. Given that all other things being equal ([[ceteris paribus]]), sound will travel slower in [[Sponge (material)|spongy material]]s, and faster in stiffer ones. Effects like dispersion and reflection can also be understood using this model. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nFor instance, sound will travel 1.59 times faster in nickel than in bronze, due to the greater stiffness of nickel at about the same density. Similarly, sound travels about 1.41 times faster in light hydrogen ([[Hydrogen-1|protium]]) gas than in heavy hydrogen ([[deuterium]]) gas, since deuterium has similar properties but twice the density. At the same time, \"compression-type\" sound will travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases, because the solids are more difficult to compress than liquids, while liquids in turn are more difficult to compress than gases.\n\nSome textbooks mistakenly state that the speed of sound increases with density. This notion is illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, they each have vastly different compressibility, which more than makes up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to ''slow'' sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.\n\nA practical example can be observed in Edinburgh when the \"One o' Clock Gun\" is fired at the eastern end of Edinburgh Castle. Standing at the base of the western end of the Castle Rock, the sound of the Gun can be heard through the rock, slightly before it arrives by the air route, partly delayed by the slightly longer route. It is particularly effective if a multi-gun salute such as for \"The Queen's Birthday\" is being fired.\n\n===Compression and shear waves===\n[[File:Onde compression impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|Pressure-pulse or compression-type wave ([[longitudinal wave]]) confined to a plane. This is the only type of sound wave that travels in fluids (gases and liquids). A pressure-type wave may also travel in solids, along with other types of waves ([[transverse wave]]s, see below)|alt=|305x305px]]\n[[File:Onde cisaillement impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|[[Transverse wave]] affecting atoms initially confined to a plane. This additional type of sound wave (additional type of elastic wave) travels only in solids, for it requires a sideways shearing motion which is supported by the presence of elasticity in the solid. The sideways shearing motion may take place in '''any''' direction which is at right-angle to the direction of wave-travel (only one shear direction is shown here, at right angles to the plane). Furthermore, the right-angle shear direction may change over time and distance, resulting in different types of ''[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]'' of shear-waves|alt=|305x305px]]\n\nIn a gas or liquid, sound consists of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A [[longitudinal wave]] is associated with compression and decompression in the direction of travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the [[transverse wave]], also called a [[shear wave]], occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the \"[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]\" of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of [[orthogonal]] polarizations.\n\nThese different waves (compression waves and the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an [[earthquake]], where sharp compression waves arrive first and rocking transverse waves seconds later.\n\nThe speed of a compression wave in a fluid is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]] and [[density]]. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the additional factor of [[shear modulus]] which affects compression waves due to off-axis elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.\n\n==Equations==\nThe speed of sound in mathematical notation is conventionally represented by ''c'', from the Latin ''celeritas'' meaning \"velocity\".\n\nFor fluids in general, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by the Newton\u2013Laplace equation:\n: <math>c = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_s}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere\n* ''K<sub>s</sub>'' is a coefficient of stiffness, the isentropic [[bulk modulus]] (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gases);\n* <math>\\rho</math> is the [[density]].\n\nThus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force) of the material and decreases with an increase in density. For ideal gases, the bulk modulus ''K'' is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless [[adiabatic index]], which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.\n\nFor general [[equations of state]], if [[classical mechanics]] is used, the speed of sound ''c'' can be derived<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-osuniversityphysics/chapter/17-2-speed-of-sound/|title=17.2 Speed of Sound {{!}} University Physics Volume 1|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> as follows:\n\nConsider the sound wave propagating through a pipe with cross-sectional area <math>A</math>.

This is because sound wave travels so fast that its propagation can be approximated as [[Adiabatic process#Various applications of the adiabatic assumption|adiabatic process]].\n\nIf [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the [[relativistic Euler equations]].\n\nIn a [[Acoustic dispersion|non-dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is independent of [[sound frequency]], so the speeds of energy transport and sound propagation are the same for all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO<sub>2</sub> which ''is'' a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies ({{nobreak|> 28 [[kHz]]}}).<ref>Dean, E. A. (August 1979). [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA076060 Atmospheric Effects on the Speed of Sound], Technical report of Defense Technical Information Center</ref>\n\nIn a [[Acoustic dispersion|dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the [[dispersion relation]]. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the [[phase velocity]], while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the [[group velocity]]. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see [[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|optical dispersion]] for a description.\n\n==Dependence on the properties of the medium==\nThe speed of sound is variable and depends on the properties of the substance through which the wave is travelling. In solids, the speed of transverse (or shear) waves depends on the shear deformation under shear stress (called the [[shear modulus]]), and the density of the medium. Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on [[compressibility]].\n\nIn fluids, only the medium's compressibility and density are the important factors, since fluids do not transmit shear stresses. In heterogeneous fluids, such as a liquid filled with gas bubbles, the density of the liquid and the compressibility of the gas affect the speed of sound in an additive manner, as demonstrated in the [[hot chocolate effect]].\n\nIn gases, adiabatic compressibility is directly related to pressure through the [[heat capacity ratio]] (adiabatic index), while pressure and density are inversely related to the temperature and molecular weight, thus making only the completely independent properties of ''temperature and molecular structure'' important (heat capacity ratio may be determined by temperature and molecular structure, but simple molecular weight is not sufficient to determine it).\n\nIn low [[molecular weight]] gases such as [[helium]], sound propagates faster as compared to heavier gases such as [[xenon]]. For monatomic gases, the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that the atoms move in that gas.\n\nFor a given [[ideal gas]] the molecular composition is fixed, and thus the speed of sound depends only on its [[temperature]]. At a constant temperature, the gas [[pressure]] has no effect on the speed of sound, since the density will increase, and since pressure and [[density]] (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density\u2014just as in liquids\u2014but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility in such a way that some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio which can be independently derived from temperature and molecular composition (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (assuming the molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (for which the heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.\n\nIn non-ideal gas behavior regimen, for which the [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals gas]] equation would be used, the proportionality is not exact, and there is a slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.\n\nHumidity has a small but measurable effect on the speed of sound (causing it to increase by about 0.1%\u20130.6%), because [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] molecules of the air are replaced by lighter molecules of [[water]]. This is a simple mixing effect.\n\n==Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics==\n[[File:Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg|thumb|Density and pressure decrease smoothly with altitude, but temperature (red) does not. The speed of sound (blue) depends only on the complicated temperature variation at altitude and can be calculated from it since isolated density and pressure effects on the speed of sound cancel each other. The speed of sound increases with height in two regions of the stratosphere and thermosphere, due to heating effects in these regions.]]\n\nIn the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the [[temperature]]. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, the speed of sound is dependent ''solely'' upon temperature; see [[Speed of sound#Details|Details]] below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude cancel each other out, save for the residual effect of temperature.\n\nSince temperature (and thus the speed of sound) decreases with increasing altitude up to {{nobreak|11 km}}, sound is [[refraction|refracted]] upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an [[acoustic shadow]] at some distance from the source.<ref name=\"Everest2001\">{{cite book\n| last = Everest\n| first = F.\n| title = The Master Handbook of Acoustics\n| publisher = McGraw-Hill\n| location = New York\n| year = 2001\n| isbn = 978-0-07-136097-5\n| pages = 262\u2013263\n}}</ref> The decrease of the speed of sound with height is referred to as a negative [[sound speed gradient]].\n\nHowever, there are variations in this trend above {{nobreak|11 km}}. In particular, in the [[stratosphere]] above about {{nobreak|20 km}}, the speed of sound increases with height, due to an increase in temperature from heating within the [[ozone layer]]. This produces a positive speed of sound gradient in this region. Still another region of positive gradient occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named [[thermosphere]] above {{nobreak|90 km}}.\n\n==Practical formula for dry air==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Speed of sound in dry air.svg|thumb|Approximation of the speed of sound in dry air based on the [[heat capacity ratio]] (in green) against the truncated [[Taylor expansion]] (in red).]]\n\nThe approximate speed of sound in dry (0% humidity) air, in metres per second, at temperatures near {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}}, can be calculated from\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = (331.3 + 0.606 \\cdot \\vartheta)~~~\\mathrm{m/s},</math>\nwhere ''<math>\\vartheta</math>'' is the temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] (\u00b0C).\n<ref name=\"Bies2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Bies\n| first = D.A.\n| last2 = Hansen\n| first2 = C.H.\n| title = Engineering Noise Control - Theory and Practice, 4th Edition\n| publisher = CRC Press\n| location = New York\n| year = 2009\n| isbn = 978-0-415-48707-8\n| pages = 18\u201319\n}}</ref> \n\nThis equation is derived from the first two terms of the [[Taylor expansion]] of the following more accurate equation:\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~ \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\vartheta}{273.15}}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}.</math>\n\nDividing the first part, and multiplying the second part, on the right hand side, by {{radic|273.15}} gives the exactly equivalent form\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~ \\sqrt{\\vartheta + 273.15}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}.</math>\n\nwhich can also be written as\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~ \\sqrt{T/K}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}</math>\n\nwhere T denotes the [[thermodynamic temperature]].\n\nThe value of {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, which represents the speed at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} (or {{nobreak|273.15 K}}), is based on theoretical (and some measured) values of the [[heat capacity ratio]], ''\u03b3'', as well as on the fact that at 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] real air is very well described by the ideal gas approximation. Commonly found values for the speed of sound at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} may vary from 331.2 to 331.6 due to the assumptions made when it is calculated. If ideal gas ''\u03b3'' is assumed to be {{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}} exactly, the {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} speed is calculated (see section below) to be {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, the coefficient used above.\n\nThis equation is correct to a much wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, and for this reason will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low-pressure conditions, such as the Earth's [[stratosphere]]. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence on the assumption that the wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average [[mean free path]] between gas molecule collisions.

It is the ratio of the specific heat of a gas at constant pressure to that of a gas at constant volume (<math>C_p/C_v</math>) and arises because a classical sound wave induces an adiabatic compression, in which the heat of the compression does not have enough time to escape the pressure pulse, and thus contributes to the pressure induced by the compression;\n* ''p'' is the [[pressure]];\n* ''\u03c1'' is the [[density]].\n\nUsing the [[ideal gas]] law to replace ''p'' with ''nRT''/''V'', and replacing ''\u03c1'' with ''nM''/''V'', the equation for an ideal gas becomes\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\sqrt{\\gamma \\cdot {p \\over \\rho}} = \\sqrt{\\gamma \\cdot R \\cdot T \\over M} = \\sqrt{\\gamma \\cdot k \\cdot T \\over m},</math>\nwhere\n* ''c''<sub>ideal</sub> is the speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]];\n* ''R'' (approximately {{val|8.314463}} {{nobreak|J\u00b7K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup>}}) is the [[molar gas constant]] (universal gas constant);<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?r\n| title = CODATA Value: molar gas constant\n| publisher = Physics.nist.gov\n| accessdate = 24 October 2010\n}}</ref>\n* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]];\n* ''\u03b3'' (gamma) is the [[adiabatic index]].

Calculated values for ''c''<sub>air</sub> have been found to vary slightly from experimentally determined values.<ref name=USSA1976>U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1976.</ref>\n\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] famously considered the speed of sound before most of the development of [[thermodynamics]] and so incorrectly used [[isothermal]] calculations instead of [[adiabatic]]. His result was missing the factor of ''\u03b3'' but was otherwise correct.\n\nNumerical substitution of the above values gives the ideal gas approximation of sound velocity for gases, which is accurate at relatively low gas pressures and densities (for air, this includes standard Earth sea-level conditions). Also, for diatomic gases the use of {{nobreak|1=''\u03b3'' = 1.4000}} requires that the gas exists in a temperature range high enough that rotational heat capacity is fully excited (i.e., molecular rotation is fully used as a heat energy \"partition\" or reservoir); but at the same time the temperature must be low enough that molecular vibrational modes contribute no heat capacity (i.e., insignificant heat goes into vibration, as all vibrational quantum modes above the minimum-energy-mode, have energies too high to be populated by a significant number of molecules at this temperature). For air, these conditions are fulfilled at room temperature, and also temperatures considerably below room temperature (see tables below). See the section on gases in [[specific heat capacity]] for a more complete discussion of this phenomenon.\n\nFor air, we introduce the shorthand\n: <math>R_* = R/M_{\\mathrm{air}}.</math>\nIn addition, we switch to the Celsius temperature {{nobreak|1=''<math>\\vartheta</math>'' = ''T'' \u2212 273.15}}, which is useful to calculate air speed in the region near \n0&nbsp;\u00b0C (about 273 kelvin).

Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere\u2014''actual conditions may vary''.\n\n{{Temperature_effect}}\n\nGiven normal atmospheric conditions, the temperature, and thus speed of sound, varies with altitude:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|'''Altitude'''\n|'''Temperature'''\n|'''m/s'''\n|'''km/h'''\n|'''mph'''\n|'''kn'''\n|-\n|Sea level\n|{{nobreak|15&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|59&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|340\n|1,225\n|761\n|661\n|-\n|{{nobreak|11,000 m}}\u2212{{nobreak|20,000 m}}<br>(Cruising altitude of commercial jets,<br>and [[Bell X-1|first supersonic flight]])\n| {{nobreak|\u221257&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|\u221270&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|295\n|1,062\n|660\n|573\n|-\n|29,000 m (Flight of [[Boeing X-43|X-43A]])\n| {{nobreak|\u221248&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|\u221253&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|301\n|1,083\n|673\n|585\n|}\n\n==Effect of frequency and gas composition==\n\n===General physical considerations===\nThe medium in which a sound wave is travelling does not always respond adiabatically, and as a result, the speed of sound can vary with frequency.<ref>[[Albert Beaumont Wood|A B Wood]], A Textbook of Sound (Bell, London, 1946)</ref>\n\nThe limitations of the concept of speed of sound due to extreme attenuation are also of concern. The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the [[mean free path]] increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes.<ref name=\"USSA1976\"/> The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the sound wave is considerably longer than the mean free path of molecules in a gas.\n\nThe molecular composition of the gas contributes both as the mass (M) of the molecules, and their heat capacities, and so both have an influence on speed of sound. In general, at the same molecular mass, monatomic gases have slightly higher speed of sound (over 9% higher) because they have a higher ''\u03b3'' ({{nobreak|1=5/3 = 1.66}}...) than diatomics do ({{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}}). Thus, at the same molecular mass, the speed of sound of a monatomic gas goes up by a factor of\n: <math>{c_{\\mathrm{gas,monatomic}} \\over c_{\\mathrm{gas,diatomic}}} = \\sqrt{{{{5/3} \\over {7/5}}}} = \\sqrt{25 \\over 21} = 1.091\\ldots</math>\n\nThis gives the 9% difference, and would be a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room temperature in [[helium]] vs. [[deuterium]], each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases; the figure is 75% in monatomic gases and 68% in diatomic gases).\n\nNote that in this example we have assumed that temperature is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see [[heat capacity]]). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas give the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase the difference between the speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.\n\n===Practical application to air===\nBy far the most important factor influencing the speed of sound in air is temperature. The speed is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, giving an increase of about {{nobreak|0.6 m/s}} per degree Celsius. For this reason, the pitch of a musical wind instrument increases as its temperature increases.\n\nThe speed of sound is raised by humidity but decreased by carbon dioxide. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about {{nobreak|1.5 m/s}} at standard pressure and temperature, but the size of the humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature. The carbon dioxide content of air is not fixed, due to both carbon pollution and human breath (e.g., in the air blown through wind instruments).\n\nThe dependence on frequency and pressure are normally insignificant in practical applications. In dry air, the speed of sound increases by about {{nobreak|0.1 m/s}} as the frequency rises from {{nobreak|10 Hz}} to {{nobreak|100 Hz}}. For audible frequencies above {{nobreak|100 Hz}} it is relatively constant. Standard values of the speed of sound are quoted in the limit of low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the mean free path.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/SpeedofSound.html\n| title = Speed of Sound in Air\n| publisher = Phy.mtu.edu\n|accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs shown above, the approximate value 1000/3 = 333.33... m/s is exact a little below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C and is a good approximation for all \"usual\" outside temperatures (in temperate climates, at least), hence the usual rule of thumb to determine how far lightning has struck: count the seconds from the start of the lightning flash to the start of the corresponding roll of thunder and divide by 3: the result is the distance in kilometers to the nearest point of the lightning bolt.\n\n==Mach number==\n{{Main|Mach number}}\n[[File:FA-18 Hornet breaking sound barrier (7 July 1999) - filtered.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] traveling near the speed of sound.

At altitude, for reasons explained, Mach number is a function of temperature.\nAircraft [[flight instruments]], however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The assumption is that a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a [[Pitot tube]] is dependent on altitude as well as speed.\n\n==Experimental methods==\nA range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound in air.\n\nThe earliest reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound in air was made by [[William Derham]] and acknowledged by [[Isaac Newton]]. Derham had a telescope at the top of the tower of the [[Church of St Laurence, Upminster|Church of St Laurence]] in [[Upminster]], England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final estimate of the speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200\u2013400 metres, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.\n\n===Single-shot timing methods===\nThe simplest concept is the measurement made using two [[microphone]]s and a fast recording device such as a [[Digital data|digital]] storage scope. This method uses the following idea.\n\nIf a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:\n# The distance between the microphones (''x''), called microphone basis.\n# The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones (''t'').\n\nThen ''v'' = ''x''/''t''.\n\n===Other methods===\nIn these methods, the [[time]] measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time ([[frequency]]).\n\n[[Kundt's tube]] is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume. It has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the [[Node (physics)|nodes]] and [[antinode]]s visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.\n\nA [[tuning fork]] can be held near the mouth of a long [[pipe (material)|pipe]] which is dipping into a barrel of [[water]]. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to ''(1 + 2''n'')\u03bb/4'' where ''n'' is an integer. As the [[antinode|antinodal]] point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.\n\nHere it is the case that ''v'' = ''f\u03bb''.\n\n===High-precision measurements in air===\nThe effect of impurities can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical [[desiccant]]s can be used to dry the air, but will, in turn, contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review<ref>Zuckerwar, Handbook of the speed of sound in real gases, p. 52</ref> found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave \"the most probable value of the standard speed of sound to date.\" The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air. The experiments were done at {{nobreak|30&nbsp;\u00b0C}} but corrected for temperature in order to report them at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}}. The result was {{nobreak|331.45 \u00b1 0.01 m/s}} for dry air at STP, for frequencies from {{nobreak|93 Hz}} to {{nobreak|1,500 Hz}}.\n\n==Non-gaseous media==\n\n===Speed of sound in solids===\n\n====Three-dimensional solids====\nIn a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric deformations and shear deformations. Hence, it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent\non the deformation mode. Sound waves generating volumetric deformations (compression) and shear deformations (shearing) are called pressure waves (longitudinal waves) and shear waves (transverse waves), respectively. In [[earthquake]]s, the corresponding seismic waves are called [[P-wave]]s (primary waves) and [[S-wave]]s (secondary waves), respectively. The sound velocities of these two types of waves propagating in a homogeneous 3-dimensional solid are respectively given by<ref name=\"E. Kinsler 2000\">L. E. Kinsler et al.

The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.\n\n==Gradients==\n{{Main|Sound speed gradient}}\nWhen sound spreads out evenly in all directions in three dimensions, the intensity drops in proportion to the inverse square of the distance. However, in the ocean, there is a layer called the 'deep sound channel' or [[SOFAR channel]] which can confine sound waves at a particular depth.\n\nIn the SOFAR channel, the speed of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher [[refractive index|index]], sound waves will [[refraction|refract]] towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets confined in the layer, much the way light can be confined to a sheet of glass or [[optical fiber]]. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.\n\nA similar effect occurs in the atmosphere. [[Project Mogul]] successfully used this effect to detect a [[nuclear explosion]] at a considerable distance.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acoustoelastic effect]]\n* [[Elastic wave]]\n* [[Second sound]]\n* [[Sonic boom]]\n* [[Sound barrier]]\n* [[Speeds of sound of the elements]]\n* [[Underwater acoustics]]\n* [[Vibrations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://e6bx.com/speed-of-sound/ Speed of Sound Calculator] \n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-speedsound.htm Calculation: Speed of Sound in Air and the Temperature]\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/SpeedOfSoundPressure.pdf Speed of sound: Temperature Matters, Not Air Pressure]\n* [http://www.pdas.com/atmos.html Properties of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976]\n* [http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath109/kmath109.htm The Speed of Sound]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060429062028/http://www.bustertests.co.uk/answer/how-to-measure-the-speed-of-sound-in-a-laboratory/ How to Measure the Speed of Sound in a Laboratory]\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826504.200-did-sound-once-travel-at-light-speed.html Did Sound Once Travel at Light Speed?]\n* [http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Ultrasonics/Reference%20Information/matproperties.htm Acoustic Properties of Various Materials Including the Speed of Sound]\n* [http://www.dosits.org/ Discovery of Sound in the Sea] (uses of sound by humans and other animals)\n\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Acoustics]]\n[[Category:Sound]]\n[[Category:Sound measurements]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Chemical properties]]\n[[Category:Velocity]]\n[[Category:Temporal rates]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Distance travelled during a unit of time by a sound wave propagating through an elastic medium}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Sound measurements}}\n\nThe '''speed of sound''' is the distance travelled per unit time by a [[sound wave]] as it propagates through an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] medium. At {{convert|20|C|F}}, the speed of sound in air is about {{convert|343|m/s|km/h ft/s mph kn|0}}, or a kilometre in {{nobreak|2.9 s}} or a mile in {{nobreak|4.7 s}}. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a [[sound wave]] is propagating.\n\nThe speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]] depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.\n\nIn common everyday speech, ''speed of sound'' refers to the speed of sound waves in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: typically sound travels most slowly in [[gas]]es; it travels faster in [[liquid]]s; and faster still in [[solids]]. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at {{nobreak|343 m/s}} in air; it travels at {{nobreak|1,481 m/s}} in [[water]] (almost 4.3 times as fast as in air); and at {{nobreak|5,120 m/s}} in iron (almost 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at {{convert|12000|m/s}}<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/soundv.html Speed of Sound]</ref>{{mdash}}about 35 times as fast as in air{{mdash}}which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.\n\nSound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and a different type of sound wave called a [[S-wave|shear wave]], which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in [[seismology]]. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]], [[shear modulus]] and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.\n\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the fluid is called the object's [[Mach number]]. Objects moving at speeds greater than ''{{gaps|Mach|1}}'' are said to be traveling at [[supersonic]] speeds.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s 1687 ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' includes a computation of the speed of sound in air as {{convert|979|ft/s|m/s|0}}.

Sound passes through the system by compressing and expanding the springs, transmitting the acoustic energy to neighboring spheres. This helps transmit the energy in-turn to the neighboring sphere's springs (bonds), and so on.\n\nThe speed of sound through the model depends on the [[stiffness]]/rigidity of the [[Spring (device)|spring]]s, and the mass of the spheres. As long as the spacing of the spheres remains constant, stiffer springs/bonds transmit energy quicker, while larger spheres transmit the energy slower.\n\nIn a real material, the stiffness of the springs is known as the \"[[elastic modulus]]\", and the mass corresponds to the material [[density]]. Given that all other things being equal ([[ceteris paribus]]), sound will travel slower in [[Sponge (material)|spongy material]]s, and faster in stiffer ones. Effects like dispersion and reflection can also be understood using this model. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nFor instance, sound will travel 1.59 times faster in nickel than in bronze, due to the greater stiffness of nickel at about the same density. Similarly, sound travels about 1.41 times faster in light hydrogen ([[Hydrogen-1|protium]]) gas than in heavy hydrogen ([[deuterium]]) gas, since deuterium has similar properties but twice the density. At the same time, \"compression-type\" sound will travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases, because the solids are more difficult to compress than liquids, while liquids in turn are more difficult to compress than gases.\n\nSome textbooks mistakenly state that the speed of sound increases with density. This notion is illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, they each have vastly different compressibility, which more than makes up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to ''slow'' sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.\n\nA practical example can be observed in Edinburgh when the \"One o' Clock Gun\" is fired at the eastern end of Edinburgh Castle. Standing at the base of the western end of the Castle Rock, the sound of the Gun can be heard through the rock, slightly before it arrives by the air route, partly delayed by the slightly longer route. It is particularly effective if a multi-gun salute such as for \"The Queen's Birthday\" is being fired.\n\n===Compression and shear waves===\n[[File:Onde compression impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|Pressure-pulse or compression-type wave ([[longitudinal wave]]) confined to a plane. This is the only type of sound wave that travels in fluids (gases and liquids). A pressure-type wave may also travel in solids, along with other types of waves ([[transverse wave]]s, see below)|alt=|305x305px]]\n[[File:Onde cisaillement impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|[[Transverse wave]] affecting atoms initially confined to a plane. This additional type of sound wave (additional type of elastic wave) travels only in solids, for it requires a sideways shearing motion which is supported by the presence of elasticity in the solid. The sideways shearing motion may take place in '''any''' direction which is at right-angle to the direction of wave-travel (only one shear direction is shown here, at right angles to the plane). Furthermore, the right-angle shear direction may change over time and distance, resulting in different types of ''[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]'' of shear-waves|alt=|305x305px]]\n\nIn a gas or liquid, sound consists of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A [[longitudinal wave]] is associated with compression and decompression in the direction of travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the [[transverse wave]], also called a [[shear wave]], occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the \"[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]\" of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of [[orthogonal]] polarizations.\n\nThese different waves (compression waves and the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an [[earthquake]], where sharp compression waves arrive first and rocking transverse waves seconds later.\n\nThe speed of a compression wave in a fluid is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]] and [[density]]. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the additional factor of [[shear modulus]] which affects compression waves due to off-axis elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.\n\n==Equations==\nThe speed of sound in mathematical notation is conventionally represented by ''c'', from the Latin ''celeritas'' meaning \"velocity\".\n\nFor fluids in general, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by the Newton\u2013Laplace equation:\n: <math>c = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_s}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere\n* ''K<sub>s</sub>'' is a coefficient of stiffness, the isentropic [[bulk modulus]] (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gases);\n* <math>\\rho</math> is the [[density]].\n\nThus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force) of the material and decreases with an increase in density. For ideal gases, the bulk modulus ''K'' is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless [[adiabatic index]], which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.\n\nFor general [[equations of state]], if [[classical mechanics]] is used, the speed of sound ''c'' can be derived<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-osuniversityphysics/chapter/17-2-speed-of-sound/|title=17.2 Speed of Sound {{!}} University Physics Volume 1|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> as follows:\n\nConsider the sound wave propagating through a pipe with cross-sectional area <math>A</math>.

This is because sound wave travels so fast that its propagation can be approximated as [[Adiabatic process#Various applications of the adiabatic assumption|adiabatic process]].\n\nIf [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the [[relativistic Euler equations]].\n\nIn a [[Acoustic dispersion|non-dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is independent of [[sound frequency]], so the speeds of energy transport and sound propagation are the same for all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO<sub>2</sub> which ''is'' a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies ({{nobreak|> 28 [[kHz]]}}).<ref>Dean, E. A. (August 1979). [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA076060 Atmospheric Effects on the Speed of Sound], Technical report of Defense Technical Information Center</ref>\n\nIn a [[Acoustic dispersion|dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the [[dispersion relation]]. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the [[phase velocity]], while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the [[group velocity]]. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see [[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|optical dispersion]] for a description.\n\n==Dependence on the properties of the medium==\nThe speed of sound is variable and depends on the properties of the substance through which the wave is travelling. In solids, the speed of transverse (or shear) waves depends on the shear deformation under shear stress (called the [[shear modulus]]), and the density of the medium. Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on [[compressibility]].\n\nIn fluids, only the medium's compressibility and density are the important factors, since fluids do not transmit shear stresses. In heterogeneous fluids, such as a liquid filled with gas bubbles, the density of the liquid and the compressibility of the gas affect the speed of sound in an additive manner, as demonstrated in the [[hot chocolate effect]].\n\nIn gases, adiabatic compressibility is directly related to pressure through the [[heat capacity ratio]] (adiabatic index), while pressure and density are inversely related to the temperature and molecular weight, thus making only the completely independent properties of ''temperature and molecular structure'' important (heat capacity ratio may be determined by temperature and molecular structure, but simple molecular weight is not sufficient to determine it).\n\nIn low [[molecular weight]] gases such as [[helium]], sound propagates faster as compared to heavier gases such as [[xenon]]. For monatomic gases, the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that the atoms move in that gas.\n\nFor a given [[ideal gas]] the molecular composition is fixed, and thus the speed of sound depends only on its [[temperature]]. At a constant temperature, the gas [[pressure]] has no effect on the speed of sound, since the density will increase, and since pressure and [[density]] (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density\u2014just as in liquids\u2014but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility in such a way that some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio which can be independently derived from temperature and molecular composition (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (assuming the molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (for which the heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.\n\nIn non-ideal gas behavior regimen, for which the [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals gas]] equation would be used, the proportionality is not exact, and there is a slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.\n\nHumidity has a small but measurable effect on the speed of sound (causing it to increase by about 0.1%\u20130.6%), because [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] molecules of the air are replaced by lighter molecules of [[water]]. This is a simple mixing effect.\n\n==Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics==\n[[File:Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg|thumb|Density and pressure decrease smoothly with altitude, but temperature (red) does not. The speed of sound (blue) depends only on the complicated temperature variation at altitude and can be calculated from it since isolated density and pressure effects on the speed of sound cancel each other. The speed of sound increases with height in two regions of the stratosphere and thermosphere, due to heating effects in these regions.]]\n\nIn the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the [[temperature]]. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, the speed of sound is dependent ''solely'' upon temperature; see [[Speed of sound#Details|Details]] below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude cancel each other out, save for the residual effect of temperature.\n\nSince temperature (and thus the speed of sound) decreases with increasing altitude up to {{nobreak|11 km}}, sound is [[refraction|refracted]] upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an [[acoustic shadow]] at some distance from the source.<ref name=\"Everest2001\">{{cite book\n| last = Everest\n| first = F.\n| title = The Master Handbook of Acoustics\n| publisher = McGraw-Hill\n| location = New York\n| year = 2001\n| isbn = 978-0-07-136097-5\n| pages = 262\u2013263\n}}</ref> The decrease of the speed of sound with height is referred to as a negative [[sound speed gradient]].\n\nHowever, there are variations in this trend above {{nobreak|11 km}}. In particular, in the [[stratosphere]] above about {{nobreak|20 km}}, the speed of sound increases with height, due to an increase in temperature from heating within the [[ozone layer]]. This produces a positive speed of sound gradient in this region. Still another region of positive gradient occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named [[thermosphere]] above {{nobreak|90 km}}.\n\n==Practical formula for dry air==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Speed of sound in dry air.svg|thumb|Approximation of the speed of sound in dry air based on the [[heat capacity ratio]] (in green) against the truncated [[Taylor expansion]] (in red).]]\n\nThe approximate speed of sound in dry (0% humidity) air, in metres per second, at temperatures near {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}}, can be calculated from\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = (331.3 + 0.606 \\cdot \\vartheta)~~~\\mathrm{m/s},</math>\nwhere ''<math>\\vartheta</math>'' is the temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] (\u00b0C).\n<ref name=\"Bies2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Bies\n| first = D.A.\n| last2 = Hansen\n| first2 = C.H.\n| title = Engineering Noise Control - Theory and Practice, 4th Edition\n| publisher = CRC Press\n| location = New York\n| year = 2009\n| isbn = 978-0-415-48707-8\n| pages = 18\u201319\n}}</ref> \n\nThis equation is derived from the first two terms of the [[Taylor expansion]] of the following more accurate equation:\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~ \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\vartheta}{273.15}}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}.</math>\n\nDividing the first part, and multiplying the second part, on the right hand side, by {{radic|273.15}} gives the exactly equivalent form\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~ \\sqrt{\\vartheta + 273.15}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}.</math>\n\nwhich can also be written as\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~ \\sqrt{T/K}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}</math>\n\nwhere T denotes the [[thermodynamic temperature]].\n\nThe value of {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, which represents the speed at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} (or {{nobreak|273.15 K}}), is based on theoretical (and some measured) values of the [[heat capacity ratio]], ''\u03b3'', as well as on the fact that at 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] real air is very well described by the ideal gas approximation. Commonly found values for the speed of sound at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} may vary from 331.2 to 331.6 due to the assumptions made when it is calculated. If ideal gas ''\u03b3'' is assumed to be {{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}} exactly, the {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} speed is calculated (see section below) to be {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, the coefficient used above.\n\nThis equation is correct to a much wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, and for this reason will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low-pressure conditions, such as the Earth's [[stratosphere]]. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence on the assumption that the wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average [[mean free path]] between gas molecule collisions.

Calculated values for ''c''<sub>air</sub> have been found to vary slightly from experimentally determined values.<ref name=USSA1976>U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1976.</ref>\n\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] famously considered the speed of sound before most of the development of [[thermodynamics]] and so incorrectly used [[isothermal]] calculations instead of [[adiabatic]]. His result was missing the factor of ''\u03b3'' but was otherwise correct.\n\nNumerical substitution of the above values gives the ideal gas approximation of sound velocity for gases, which is accurate at relatively low gas pressures and densities (for air, this includes standard Earth sea-level conditions). Also, for diatomic gases the use of {{nobreak|1=''\u03b3'' = 1.4000}} requires that the gas exists in a temperature range high enough that rotational heat capacity is fully excited (i.e., molecular rotation is fully used as a heat energy \"partition\" or reservoir); but at the same time the temperature must be low enough that molecular vibrational modes contribute no heat capacity (i.e., insignificant heat goes into vibration, as all vibrational quantum modes above the minimum-energy-mode, have energies too high to be populated by a significant number of molecules at this temperature). For air, these conditions are fulfilled at room temperature, and also temperatures considerably below room temperature (see tables below). See the section on gases in [[specific heat capacity]] for a more complete discussion of this phenomenon.\n\nFor air, we introduce the shorthand\n: <math>R_* = R/M_{\\mathrm{air}}.</math>\nIn addition, we switch to the Celsius temperature {{nobreak|1=''<math>\\vartheta</math>'' = ''T'' \u2212 273.15}}, which is useful to calculate air speed in the region near \n0&nbsp;\u00b0C (about 273 kelvin).

Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere\u2014''actual conditions may vary''.\n\n{{Temperature_effect}}\n\nGiven normal atmospheric conditions, the temperature, and thus speed of sound, varies with altitude:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|'''Altitude'''\n|'''Temperature'''\n|'''m/s'''\n|'''km/h'''\n|'''mph'''\n|'''kn'''\n|-\n|Sea level\n|{{nobreak|15&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|59&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|340\n|1,225\n|761\n|661\n|-\n|{{nobreak|11,000 m}}\u2212{{nobreak|20,000 m}}<br>(Cruising altitude of commercial jets,<br>and [[Bell X-1|first supersonic flight]])\n| {{nobreak|\u221257&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|\u221270&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|295\n|1,062\n|660\n|573\n|-\n|29,000 m (Flight of [[Boeing X-43|X-43A]])\n| {{nobreak|\u221248&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|\u221253&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|301\n|1,083\n|673\n|585\n|}\n\n==Effect of frequency and gas composition==\n\n===General physical considerations===\nThe medium in which a sound wave is travelling does not always respond adiabatically, and as a result, the speed of sound can vary with frequency.<ref>[[Albert Beaumont Wood|A B Wood]], A Textbook of Sound (Bell, London, 1946)</ref>\n\nThe limitations of the concept of speed of sound due to extreme attenuation are also of concern. The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the [[mean free path]] increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes.<ref name=\"USSA1976\"/> The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the sound wave is considerably longer than the mean free path of molecules in a gas.\n\nThe molecular composition of the gas contributes both as the mass (M) of the molecules, and their heat capacities, and so both have an influence on speed of sound. In general, at the same molecular mass, monatomic gases have slightly higher speed of sound (over 9% higher) because they have a higher ''\u03b3'' ({{nobreak|1=5/3 = 1.66}}...) than diatomics do ({{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}}). Thus, at the same molecular mass, the speed of sound of a monatomic gas goes up by a factor of\n: <math>{c_{\\mathrm{gas,monatomic}} \\over c_{\\mathrm{gas,diatomic}}} = \\sqrt{{{{5/3} \\over {7/5}}}} = \\sqrt{25 \\over 21} = 1.091\\ldots</math>\n\nThis gives the 9% difference, and would be a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room temperature in [[helium]] vs. [[deuterium]], each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases; the figure is 75% in monatomic gases and 68% in diatomic gases).\n\nNote that in this example we have assumed that temperature is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see [[heat capacity]]). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas give the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase the difference between the speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.\n\n===Practical application to air===\nBy far the most important factor influencing the speed of sound in air is temperature. The speed is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, giving an increase of about {{nobreak|0.6 m/s}} per degree Celsius. For this reason, the pitch of a musical wind instrument increases as its temperature increases.\n\nThe speed of sound is raised by humidity but decreased by carbon dioxide. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about {{nobreak|1.5 m/s}} at standard pressure and temperature, but the size of the humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature. The carbon dioxide content of air is not fixed, due to both carbon pollution and human breath (e.g., in the air blown through wind instruments).\n\nThe dependence on frequency and pressure are normally insignificant in practical applications. In dry air, the speed of sound increases by about {{nobreak|0.1 m/s}} as the frequency rises from {{nobreak|10 Hz}} to {{nobreak|100 Hz}}. For audible frequencies above {{nobreak|100 Hz}} it is relatively constant. Standard values of the speed of sound are quoted in the limit of low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the mean free path.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/SpeedofSound.html\n| title = Speed of Sound in Air\n| publisher = Phy.mtu.edu\n|accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs shown above, the approximate value 1000/3 = 333.33... m/s is exact a little below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C and is a good approximation for all \"usual\" outside temperatures (in temperate climates, at least), hence the usual rule of thumb to determine how far lightning has struck: count the seconds from the start of the lightning flash to the start of the corresponding roll of thunder and divide by 3: the result is the distance in kilometers to the nearest point of the lightning bolt.\n\n==Mach number==\n{{Main|Mach number}}\n[[File:FA-18 Hornet breaking sound barrier (7 July 1999) - filtered.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] traveling near the speed of sound.

At altitude, for reasons explained, Mach number is a function of temperature.\nAircraft [[flight instruments]], however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The assumption is that a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a [[Pitot tube]] is dependent on altitude as well as speed.\n\n==Experimental methods==\nA range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound in air.\n\nThe earliest reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound in air was made by [[William Derham]] and acknowledged by [[Isaac Newton]]. Derham had a telescope at the top of the tower of the [[Church of St Laurence, Upminster|Church of St Laurence]] in [[Upminster]], England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final estimate of the speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200\u2013400 metres, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.\n\n===Single-shot timing methods===\nThe simplest concept is the measurement made using two [[microphone]]s and a fast recording device such as a [[Digital data|digital]] storage scope. This method uses the following idea.\n\nIf a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:\n# The distance between the microphones (''x''), called microphone basis.\n# The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones (''t'').\n\nThen ''v'' = ''x''/''t''.\n\n===Other methods===\nIn these methods, the [[time]] measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time ([[frequency]]).\n\n[[Kundt's tube]] is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume. It has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the [[Node (physics)|nodes]] and [[antinode]]s visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.\n\nA [[tuning fork]] can be held near the mouth of a long [[pipe (material)|pipe]] which is dipping into a barrel of [[water]]. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to ''(1 + 2''n'')\u03bb/4'' where ''n'' is an integer. As the [[antinode|antinodal]] point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.\n\nHere it is the case that ''v'' = ''f\u03bb''.\n\n===High-precision measurements in air===\nThe effect of impurities can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical [[desiccant]]s can be used to dry the air, but will, in turn, contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review<ref>Zuckerwar, Handbook of the speed of sound in real gases, p. 52</ref> found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave \"the most probable value of the standard speed of sound to date.\" The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air. The experiments were done at {{nobreak|30&nbsp;\u00b0C}} but corrected for temperature in order to report them at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}}. The result was {{nobreak|331.45 \u00b1 0.01 m/s}} for dry air at STP, for frequencies from {{nobreak|93 Hz}} to {{nobreak|1,500 Hz}}.\n\n==Non-gaseous media==\n\n===Speed of sound in solids===\n\n====Three-dimensional solids====\nIn a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric deformations and shear deformations. Hence, it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent\non the deformation mode. Sound waves generating volumetric deformations (compression) and shear deformations (shearing) are called pressure waves (longitudinal waves) and shear waves (transverse waves), respectively. In [[earthquake]]s, the corresponding seismic waves are called [[P-wave]]s (primary waves) and [[S-wave]]s (secondary waves), respectively. The sound velocities of these two types of waves propagating in a homogeneous 3-dimensional solid are respectively given by<ref name=\"E. Kinsler 2000\">L. E. Kinsler et al. (2000), ''Fundamentals of acoustics'', 4th Ed., John Wiley and sons Inc., New York, USA.</ref>\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{solid,p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{K + \\frac{4}{3}G}{\\rho}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E(1 - \\nu)}{\\rho (1 + \\nu)(1 - 2 \\nu)}},</math>\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{solid,s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere\n* ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] of the elastic materials;\n* ''G'' is the [[shear modulus]] of the elastic materials;\n* ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]];\n* ''\u03c1'' is the density;\n* ''\u03bd'' is [[Poisson's ratio]].\n\nThe last quantity is not an independent one, as {{nobreak|1=E = 3K(1 \u2212 2\u03bd)}}. Note that the speed of pressure waves depends both on the pressure and shear resistance properties of the material, while the speed of shear waves depends on the shear properties only.\n\nTypically, pressure waves travel faster in materials than do shear waves, and in earthquakes this is the reason that the onset of an earthquake is often preceded by a quick upward-downward shock, before arrival of waves that produce a side-to-side motion. For example, for a typical steel alloy, {{nobreak|1=''K'' = 170 GPa}}, {{nobreak|1=''G'' = 80 GPa}} and {{nobreak|1=''\u03c1'' = 7,700&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>}}, yielding a compressional speed ''c''<sub>solid,p</sub> of {{nobreak|6,000 m/s}}.<ref name=\"E. Kinsler 2000\"/> This is in reasonable agreement with ''c''<sub>solid,p</sub> measured experimentally at {{nobreak|5,930 m/s}} for a (possibly different) type of steel.<ref>J. Krautkr\u00e4mer and H. Krautkr\u00e4mer (1990), ''Ultrasonic testing of materials'', 4th fully revised edition, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, p. 497</ref> The shear speed ''c''<sub>solid,s</sub> is estimated at {{nobreak|3,200 m/s}} using the same numbers.\n\n====One-dimensional solids====\nThe speed of sound for pressure waves in stiff materials such as metals is sometimes given for \"long rods\" of the material in question, in which the speed is easier to measure. In rods where their diameter is shorter than a wavelength, the speed of pure pressure waves may be simplified and is given by<ref name=\"Kinsler2000\" />:\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{solid}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere ''E'' is [[Young's modulus]]. This is similar to the expression for shear waves, save that [[Young's modulus]] replaces the [[shear modulus]]. This speed of sound for pressure waves in long rods will always be slightly less than the same speed in homogeneous 3-dimensional solids, and the ratio of the speeds in the two different types of objects depends on [[Poisson's ratio]] for the material.\n\n===Speed of sound in liquids===\n[[File:Speed of sound in water.svg|thumb|right|Speed of sound in water vs temperature.]]\nIn a fluid, the only non-zero [[stiffness]] is to volumetric deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces).\n\nHence the speed of sound in a fluid is given by\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{fluid}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] of the fluid.\n\n====Water====\nIn fresh water, sound travels at about {{nobreak|1481 m/s}} at {{nobreak|20&nbsp;\u00b0C}} (see the External Links section below for online calculators).<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/sound-speed-water-d_598.html\n| title = Speed of Sound in Water at Temperatures between 32\u2013212 oF (0\u2013100 oC) \u2014 imperial and SI units\n| website = The Engineering Toolbox\n}}</ref> Applications of [[underwater acoustics|underwater sound]] can be found in [[sonar]], [[Underwater acoustics#Underwater communication|acoustic communication]] and [[acoustical oceanography]].\n\n====Seawater====\n{{see also|Sound speed profile}}\n[[File:Underwater speed of sound.svg|thumb|Speed of sound as a function of depth at a position north of Hawaii in the [[Pacific Ocean]] derived from the 2005 [[World Ocean Atlas]].

The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.\n\n==Gradients==\n{{Main|Sound speed gradient}}\nWhen sound spreads out evenly in all directions in three dimensions, the intensity drops in proportion to the inverse square of the distance. However, in the ocean, there is a layer called the 'deep sound channel' or [[SOFAR channel]] which can confine sound waves at a particular depth.\n\nIn the SOFAR channel, the speed of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher [[refractive index|index]], sound waves will [[refraction|refract]] towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets confined in the layer, much the way light can be confined to a sheet of glass or [[optical fiber]]. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.\n\nA similar effect occurs in the atmosphere. [[Project Mogul]] successfully used this effect to detect a [[nuclear explosion]] at a considerable distance.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acoustoelastic effect]]\n* [[Elastic wave]]\n* [[Second sound]]\n* [[Sonic boom]]\n* [[Sound barrier]]\n* [[Speeds of sound of the elements]]\n* [[Underwater acoustics]]\n* [[Vibrations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://e6bx.com/speed-of-sound/ Speed of Sound Calculator] \n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-speedsound.htm Calculation: Speed of Sound in Air and the Temperature]\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/SpeedOfSoundPressure.pdf Speed of sound: Temperature Matters, Not Air Pressure]\n* [http://www.pdas.com/atmos.html Properties of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976]\n* [http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath109/kmath109.htm The Speed of Sound]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060429062028/http://www.bustertests.co.uk/answer/how-to-measure-the-speed-of-sound-in-a-laboratory/ How to Measure the Speed of Sound in a Laboratory]\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826504.200-did-sound-once-travel-at-light-speed.html Did Sound Once Travel at Light Speed?]\n* [http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Ultrasonics/Reference%20Information/matproperties.htm Acoustic Properties of Various Materials Including the Speed of Sound]\n* [http://www.dosits.org/ Discovery of Sound in the Sea] (uses of sound by humans and other animals)\n\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Acoustics]]\n[[Category:Sound]]\n[[Category:Sound measurements]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Chemical properties]]\n[[Category:Velocity]]\n[[Category:Temporal rates]]\n", "name_user": "Bob Clemintime", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOne-dimensional solids:Correct mistake during my last edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound"}
