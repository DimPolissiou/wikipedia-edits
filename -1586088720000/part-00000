The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ringside bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a no disqualification match. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ringside bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the WWE Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a nearfall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. In the end, as Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title.\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard Match which was contested in an undisclosed location resembling a graveyard. The only way to attain victory was to bury your opponent in a grave. Styles emerged from a casket while Undertaker arrived in his American Badass Persona (circa 2000-2003) riding a motorcycle. The two fought throughout the graveyard and in a warehouse. Halfway through the match, Styles' [[The O.C. (professional wrestling)|O.C.]] teammates [[Luke Gallows]] and [[Karl Anderson]] appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a couple of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles threw The Undertaker in the grave but as he was preparing to drop dirt on The Undertaker to bury him and win, The Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. The Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. The Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on a druid and threw Styles off the rooftop. The Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the grave, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle.\n<!--\n===Night 2===\n====Pre-show====\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====-->\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Night 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Night1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Night1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win the title.\n\nNext, Elias faced King Corbin. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin. Elias then performed a roll-up on Corbin to win the match.\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the WWE Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into an roll-up to retain the title.\n\nIn the fourth match, Sami Zayn (accompanied by Cesaro and Shinsuke Nakamura) defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Daniel Bryan (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back in to the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Nakamura and Cesaro recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a Slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.\n\nNext, the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match. Due to the absence of John Morrison's tag team partner, The Miz, the match was contested between Morrison, Kofi Kingston (representing The New Day) and Jimmy Uso (representing The Usos). In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Kingston and Jimmy performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles eventually unhooking them, thus Morrison retained the title. \n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ringside bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a no disqualification match. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ringside bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the WWE Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a nearfall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. In the end, as Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title.\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard Match which was contested in an undisclosed location resembling a graveyard. The only way to attain victory was to bury your opponent in a grave. Styles emerged from a casket while Undertaker arrived in his American Badass Persona (circa 2000-2003) riding a motorcycle. The two fought throughout the graveyard and in a warehouse. Halfway through the match, Styles' [[The O.C. (professional wrestling)|O.C.]] teammates [[Luke Gallows]] and [[Karl Anderson]] appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a couple of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles threw The Undertaker in the grave but as he was preparing to drop dirt on The Undertaker to bury him and win, The Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. The Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. The Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on a druid and threw Styles off the rooftop. The Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the grave, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle.\n<!--\n===Part 2===\n====Pre-show====\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====-->\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Night1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Night1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

{"title_page": "Postwar anti-Jewish violence in Slovakia", "text_new": "{{use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n'''Postwar anti-Jewish violence in Slovakia''' resulted in at least 36 deaths and more than 100 injuries between 1945 and 1948, according to research by the Polish historian [[Anna Cichopek]]. Overall, it was significantly less severe than [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944\u201346|in Poland]]. The causes of the violence included antisemitism and conflict over the restitution of property stolen from Jews during [[the Holocaust in Slovakia]].\n\nThe violence often took the form of rioting and occurred in waves: late 1945, mid-1946, early 1947, and mid-1948. The most notable incidents were the [[Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom]] on 24 September 1945, the Kolbasov massacre in December 1945, and the [[Partisan Congress riots]] in Bratislava in early August 1946. The violence ceased after the emigration of most Jews by the end of 1949.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|The Holocaust in Slovakia}}\n[[File:\"Nebu\u010f slu\u017eobn\u00edkom \u017eida\"\u2014Slovak propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|alt=Man kissing feet of another man with hooked nose, dropping money on his head|A Slovak State propaganda poster exhorts readers not to \"be a servant to the Jew\".|upright=0.9]]\nThe [[Slovak State]], a [[one-party state]] of the [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party]] (HS\u013dS), declared its independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] on 14 March 1939. Although the Slovak State was an [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[client state]] during [[World War II]], it enjoyed considerable latitude in domestic policy, including anti-Jewish actions.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=12\u201313}} Anti-Jewish laws were passed in 1940 and 1941, depriving Jews of their property via [[Aryanization in Slovakia|Aryanization]] and redistributing it to Slovaks viewed by the regime as more deserving.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=90\u201392}}{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka| 2018| p= 845}} Unusually, the Slovak State organized the [[deportation of Jews from Slovakia|deportation of 58,000 of its own Jewish citizens]] to German-occupied Poland in 1942, which was carried out by the paramilitary [[Hlinka Guard]] and regular policemen.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=14\u201316}}{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka| 2018| p= 847}} On 29 August 1944, [[German occupation of Slovakia|Germany invaded Slovakia]], sparking the [[Slovak National Uprising]]. The fighting and German countermeasures devastated much of the country; nearly 100 villages were burned by [[Einsatzgruppe H]]. Thousands of people, including several hundred Jews, were murdered in Slovakia, and more than 10,000 Jews were deported.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=21}}{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka| 2018| p= 849}}  Anti-regime forces included [[Slovak Army]] defectors, Agrarians, Communists, and Jews.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=21}} Altogether 69,000 of the 89,000 Jews in the Slovak State were murdered.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=19}}\n\n==Causes==\nConflict over Aryanization and restitution characterized postwar relations between Jews and Slovaks.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=90}}{{sfn|\u0160mige\u013e|2011|p=272}} At issue was not just large businesses which had been Aryanized, but confiscated movable property (such as furniture) which had been confiscated and sold to non-Jewish buyers. There were also conflicts regarding movable property that had been entrusted to non-Jewish individuals who refused to return it after the war. For many Slovaks, restitution meant returning property that they had paid for under the then-existing law, developed, and considered theirs. From the perspective of Jews, however, it was the obligation of those in possession of stolen property to return it.{{sfn|Bumov\u00e1|2007|p=27}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|2016|pp=330\u2013331, 336}} Former partisans, veterans of the Czechoslovak armies abroad, and political prisoners were prioritized for appointment as national administrators{{efn|name=national administrators|National administrators ({{lang-sk|n\u00e1rodn\u00e9 spr\u00e1vcovia}}) were the state-appointed managers of nationalized property Aryanized by the Slovak State regime, left behind by deported Jews, or confiscated from \"traitors and politically unreliable people\" (Germans and Hungarians) by the postwar Czechoslovak government. The administrators were required to be \"nationally and politically reliable, with appropriate professional and practical knowledge\", and benefitted economically from their appointment.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=94\u201396}}}} of previously Jewish businesses or residences. In some cases, national administrators were appointed even though the owners or their heirs were still alive.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=96, 99}} The newly appointed national administrators considered their gains just reward for their sacrifices during the war\u2014a rationale that was endorsed by the government.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=105, 107}} \n\n[[File:Povstalecka kolona.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Slovak National Uprising]] brought devastation to central and eastern Slovakia.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=21}}]]\nBefore the war, [[economic antisemitism]] had portrayed Jews as economic exploiters of poor Slovaks who lived off their labor.{{sfn|Ni\u017e\u0148ansk\u00fd|2014|pp=49\u201350}} After the war, Jews were accused of shirking manual labor and instead being involved in [[black market]] and [[smuggling]].{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|p=6}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=59}} (In defense of such activities, [[SRP (Slovak organization)|SRP]] chairman [[Vojtech Winterstein]] said: \"Jews have to make a living.

Many non-Jewish Slovaks believed that Jews occupied a privileged position in the economy.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|p=6}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=60}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|2016|p=326}} Unlike in the Czech lands, most Slovaks saw a reduction in their standard of living after liberation.{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|2016|p=336}} Over the winter of 1945\u20131946, [[UNRRA]] reported that hundreds of thousands of residents of rural areas in eastern Slovakia still lacked housing.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|p=6}} The straitened economic circumstances meant that any sign of favoritism became a cause of ethnic resentment.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=61}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|2016|pp=326\u2013327}} False claims were made that Jews had not suffered as much as non-Jews during the war and had not participated in the Slovak National Uprising, which further fueled resentment against them.{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|2016|pp=326, 339\u2013340}}\n\nAnother source of antisemitism, and trigger for violence, was false rumors and [[antisemitic conspiracy theories]], especially that Jewish doctors were conspiring to kill non-Jews with drugs or vaccines.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|p=4}} For example, before the [[Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom]], a Jewish doctor carrying out vaccinations of schoolchildren was accused of poisoning them.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=128}} In [[Michalovce]], a Jewish salesman was accused of selling poisoned watermelon and candies.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|p=4}} Jews were also rumored to have kidnapped or murdered non-Jewish children.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|p=4}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=118}} Actual [[blood libel|ritual murder libel]] was rare but occurred, especially in the form of Jews supposedly needing Christian blood in connection to [[aliyah|emigration to Israel]].{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|p=4}} Especially in eastern Slovakia, supporters of the former regime were outraged that the new government considered participation in roundups and deportation of Jews to be a criminal offense. It was alleged that Jews manipulated the court system in order to obtain a harsher verdict in cases where the defendant was accused of harming Jews.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|pp=13\u201314}}  Jews were also criticized for speaking German or Hungarian. Unlike non-Jewish [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|Germans]] and [[Expulsion of Hungarians from Slovakia|Hungarians]], the majority of Jews in Slovakia who had German or Hungarian as their mother tongue were not expelled from the country and retained their [[Czechoslovak citizenship]].{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|p=5}}{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=170, 174, 178}} Another issue was the passage of Jewish refugees from Poland and Hungary through Czechoslovakia; these Jews did not speak Czech or Slovak, further inflaming suspicions.{{sfn|Mlyn\u00e1rik|2005}} The anti-Jewish policies of the wartime government sharpened categorization along ethnic lines; when victims were attacked because of being Jews, their Jewishness overpowered any other affiliations (such as political, national, or economic).{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=145}}\n\nCzech historian Hana Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1 points out that these accusations against Jews differed little from classical antisemitism as found in, for example, the eighteenth-century novel ''{{ill|Ren\u00e9 ml\u00e1denca pr\u00edhody a sk\u00fasenosti|sk}}'' by [[Jozef Ign\u00e1c Bajza]].{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|2016|pp=330\u2013331}}\n\n==1945==\n{{Location map many|Slovakia\n|width      = \n|float      = \n|border     = \n|caption    = Locations where significant anti-Jewish violence was reported\n|alt        = \n|relief     = yes\n|places=\n|label1      = Topo\u013e\u010dany\n|coordinates1= {{coord|48|33|15|N|18|10|37|E}}\n|label2      = Bratislava\n|coordinates2= {{coord|48|08|38|N|17|06|35|E}}\n|label3      = Kolbasov\n|coordinates3= {{coord|49|01|N|22|23|E}}\n<!-- |label1      = Topo\u013e\u010dany\n|coordinates1= {{coord|48|33|15|N|18|10|37|E|display=title}} -->\n}}\nThe first postwar anti-Jewish riot occurred in [[Ko\u0161ice]] on 2 May.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|p=117}}{{sfn|\u0160i\u0161jakov\u00e1|2008}}  In late June, rumors circulated in [[Bardejov]] that Jews were stockpiling firearms and ammunition. Some partisans tried to search their houses, but were stopped by police. On 22 July, 1,000 people participated in a partisan demonstration at which Captain Pal\u0161a advocated the \"cleansing\" of collaborators from the area. Antisemitic slogans were shouted, and some demonstrators went to a nearby bakery where white bread (forbidden by rationing laws) was supposedly being made for Jews. They confiscated the bread to give it to infirm individuals. The next morning a drunk Pal\u0161a was heard shouting \"the Jew was and always will be our enemy\". On  26 December 1945, two soldiers physically assaulted seven Jews in the town. In July, the rioting spread to the nearby city of [[Pre\u0161ov]], where non-Jews complained about the [[deportation of Czechoslovak citizens to the Soviet Union]]; Jews were [[Judeo-Bolshevism|accused of supporting Communism]]. Jewish community offices, a communal kitchen, and Jewish buildings were robbed and vandalized.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|pp=11\u201312}} \n\n===Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom===\n{{main|Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom}}\nIn [[Nitra]], local women were infuriated with inadequate food rations.

Overall, it was significantly less severe than [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944\u201346|in Poland]]. The causes of the violence included antisemitism and conflict over the restitution of property stolen from Jews during [[the Holocaust in Slovakia]].\n\nThe violence often took the form of rioting and occurred in waves: late 1945, mid-1946, early 1947, and mid-1948. The most notable incidents were the [[Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom]] on 24 September 1945, the Kolbasov massacre in December 1945, and the [[Partisan Congress riots]] in Bratislava in early August 1946.

Although the Slovak State was an [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[client state]] during [[World War II]], it enjoyed considerable latitude in domestic policy, including anti-Jewish actions.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=12\u201313}} Anti-Jewish laws were passed in 1940 and 1941, depriving Jews of their property via [[Aryanization in Slovakia|Aryanization]] and redistributing it to Slovaks viewed by the regime as more deserving.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=90\u201392}}{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka| 2018| p= 845}} Unusually, the Slovak State organized the [[deportation of Jews from Slovakia|deportation of 58,000 of its own Jewish citizens]] to German-occupied Poland in 1942, which was carried out by the paramilitary [[Hlinka Guard]] and regular policemen.{{sfn|Cichopek|2014|pp=14\u201316}}{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka| 2018| p= 847}} On 29 August 1944, [[German occupation of Slovakia|Germany invaded Slovakia]], sparking the [[Slovak National Uprising]]. The fighting and German countermeasures devastated much of the country; nearly 100 villages were burned by [[Einsatzgruppe H]].

There were also conflicts regarding movable property that had been entrusted to non-Jewish individuals who refused to return it after the war. For many Slovaks, restitution meant returning property that they had paid for under the then-existing law, developed, and considered theirs. From the perspective of Jews, however, it was the obligation of those in possession of stolen property to return it.{{sfn|Bumov\u00e1|2007|p=27}}{{sfn|Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1|2016|pp=330\u2013331, 336}} Former partisans, veterans of the Czechoslovak armies abroad, and political prisoners were prioritized for appointment as national administrators{{efn|name=national administrators|National administrators ({{lang-sk|n\u00e1rodn\u00e9 spr\u00e1vcovia}}) were the state-appointed managers of nationalized property Aryanized by the Slovak State regime, left behind by deported Jews, or confiscated from \"traitors and politically unreliable people\" (Germans and Hungarians) by the postwar Czechoslovak government.

On 22 July, 1,000 people participated in a partisan demonstration at which Captain Pal\u0161a advocated the \"cleansing\" of collaborators from the area. Antisemitic slogans were shouted, and some demonstrators went to a nearby bakery where white bread (forbidden by rationing laws) was supposedly being made for Jews. They confiscated the bread to give it to infirm individuals. The next morning a drunk Pal\u0161a was heard shouting \"the Jew was and always will be our enemy\". On  26 December 1945, two soldiers physically assaulted seven Jews in the town. In July, the rioting spread to the nearby city of [[Pre\u0161ov]], where non-Jews complained about the [[deportation of Czechoslovak citizens to the Soviet Union]]; Jews were [[Judeo-Bolshevism|accused of supporting Communism]]. Jewish community offices, a communal kitchen, and Jewish buildings were robbed and vandalized.{{sfn|L\u00f4n\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1|2019|pp=11\u201312}} \n\n===Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom===\n{{main|Topo\u013e\u010dany pogrom}}\nIn [[Nitra]], local women were infuriated with inadequate food rations. On 11 September 1945, after a rumor spread alleging that nuns at the local school would be replaced by Jewish teachers, the situation escalated into a 200-strong demonstration against the local District Committee. One woman complained, \"the committee is already stuffed, while we are starving, we have no bread or wood and we have no food to cook for our children.

In early September, nuns who taught at a local Catholic school for girls heard that their institution was about to be nationalized, and that they would be replaced. Although many Slovak schools were nationalized in 1945, rumors that it was due to a Jewish conspiracy and that Jewish teachers would replace gentiles were unfounded.

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing [[digital video recorder]]s (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as [[motion detection]] and email alerts). More recently, decentralized [[IP camera]]s, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to [[network-attached storage]] devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation.\n\nThere are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years. <ref name=\"SDM2016\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sdmmag.com/articles/92407-rise-of-surveillance-camera-installed-base-slows|title=Rise of Surveillance Camera Installed Base Slows|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref> The deployment of this technology has facilitated a significant growth in state surveillance, a substantial rise in the methods of advanced social monitoring and control, and a host of crime prevention measures throughout the world.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

The development of reel-to-reel media enabled the recording of surveillance footage. These systems required magnetic tapes to be changed manually, which was a time consuming, expensive and unreliable process, with the operator having to manually thread the tape from the tape reel through the recorder onto an empty take-up reel. Due to these shortcomings, video surveillance was not widespread. [[VCR]] technology became available in the 1970s, making it easier to record and erase information, and the use of video surveillance became more common.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaQY8CrmqFcC&pg=PA276 |title=CCTV Surveillance|isbn=9780080468181|last1=Kruegle|first1=Herman|date=15 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, digital [[multiplexing]] was developed, allowing several cameras to record at once, as well as [[Time lapse photography|time lapse]] and motion-only recording.

A 2017 review published in [[Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention]] compiles seven studies that use such research designs. The studies included in the review found that CCTV reduced crime by 24-28% in public streets and urban subway stations. It also found that CCTV could decrease unruly behaviour in football stadiums and theft in supermarkets/mass merchant stores. However, there was no evidence of CCTV having desirable effects in parking facilities or suburban subway stations.

CCTV monitors for viewing the event by attendees are often placed in lounges, hallways, and restrooms.\nIn a trial with CCTV camera's, football club fans no longer need to identify themselves manually, but could pass freely after being authorized by the facial recognition system.<ref>[https://www.heracles.nl/nieuws/nieuwsbericht/12992/doe-mee-aan-de-proef-met-gezichtsherkenning Trial by 20Face]</ref>\n\n=== Employee monitoring ===\n{{See also|Employee monitoring}}\nOrganizations use CCTV to monitor the actions of workers. Every action is recorded as an information block with subtitles that explain the performed operation. This helps to track the actions of workers, especially when they are making critical financial transactions, such as correcting or cancelling of a sale, withdrawing money or altering personal information.\n\nActions which an employer may wish to monitor could include:\n* Scanning of goods, selection of goods, introduction of price and quantity;\n* Input and output of operators in the system when entering passwords;\n* Deleting operations and modifying existing documents;\n* Implementation of certain operations, such as financial statements or operations with cash;\n* Moving goods, revaluation scrapping and counting;\n* Control in the kitchen of fast food restaurants;\n* Change of settings, reports and other official functions.\n\nEach of these operations is transmitted with a description, allowing detailed monitoring of all actions of the operator. Some systems allow the user to search for a specific event by time of occurrence and text description, and perform statistical evaluation of operator behaviour. This allows the software to predict deviations from the standard workflow and record only anomalous behaviour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/archive/library/subject-gateways/business-management/smes/small-business-update/2015-01/using-cctv-to-monitor-the-workplace|title=Using CCTV to monitor the workplace |publisher= icaew |access-date=2016-09-18}}</ref>\n\n===Use in schools===\nIn the United States, Britain,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.atl.org.uk/policy-and-campaigns/policy-posts/use-cctv-surveillance-schools?resetmyATL=true|title= Use of CCTV surveillance in schools| author= ATL|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher= ATL the education union|date=22 October 2013}}</ref> Australia<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/school-security-cctv-puts-bullies-on-pause/story-e6freuzi-1226311797645|title= School security CCTV puts bullies on pause | author= Bruce McDougall and Katherine Danks |accessdate=8 November 2016|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date=28 March 2012}}</ref> and New Zealand, CCTV is widely used in schools due to its success in preventing [[bullying]], [[vandalism]], monitoring visitors and maintaining a record of evidence in the event of a crime. There are some restrictions on installation, with cameras not being installed in an area where there is a \"reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]\", such as bathrooms, gym locker areas and private offices (unless consent by the office occupant is given). Cameras are generally acceptable in hallways, parking lots, front offices where students, employees, and parents come and go, gymnasiums, cafeterias, supply rooms and classrooms. The installation of cameras in classrooms may be objected to by some teachers.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|title = Legal aspects of the use of video cameras in schools =|access-date = 25 March 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160215174520/https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|archive-date = 15 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Use in private homes===\nMany home owners now choose to install CCTV systems on their own homes. CCTV cameras are an effective deterrent to criminals as it increases the risk of criminals being caught because they could be identified through the camera footage. Most criminals will scout through affluent suburbs looking for the easiest house to break into. Having an obvious CCTV system, or another security alarm, makes the house appear to be a more difficult target so the criminals will likely move on to the next house. \nModern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage. Some systems even provide motion detection so when movement is detected, an alert can be sent to your phone.\n\n=== Criminal use ===\n\nCriminals may use surveillance cameras to monitor the public. For example, a hidden camera at an [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]] can capture people's [[Personal Identification Number|PINs]] as they are entered, without their knowledge. The devices are small enough not to be noticed, and are placed where they can monitor the keypad of the machine as people enter their PINs. Images may be transmitted wirelessly to the criminal. Even lawful surveillance cameras sometimes have their data go into the hands of people who have no legal right to receive it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.letelegramme.fr/france/benalla-trois-policiers-suspendus-pour-avoir-transmis-des-images-de-videosurveillance-20-07-2018-12032279.php|title=Benalla.

In an opinion poll commissioned by [[Lund University]] in August 2017, the general public of Sweden were asked to choose one measure that would ensure their need for privacy when subject to CCTV-operation in public spaces: 43% favored regulation in the form of clear routines for managing, storing and distributing image material generated from surveillance cameras, 39% favored regulation in the form of clear signage informing that camera surveillance in public spaces is present, 2% favored regulation in the form of having permits restricting the use of surveillance cameras during certain times of day/week, 10% favored regulation in the form of having restrictive policies for issuing permits for surveillance cameras in public spaces, and 6% were unsure or did not know.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lahtinen|first1=Markus|title=The perception of surveillance cameras and privacy among the general public in Sweden|date=2017|publisher=LUSAX-research group, Lund University School of Economics and Management, Sweden|url=http://lusax.se/Lahtinen_2017_OpinionPoll_DataSheet.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Technological developments ==\n[[File:closed.circuit.camera.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Surveillance camera at London Heathrow Airport with a wiper for clear images during rain]]\n\n=== Computer-controlled analytics and identification ===\n\nComputer-controlled cameras can identify, track, and categorize objects in their field of view.<ref> James Vincent, The Verge. \"[https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16907238/artificial-intelligence-surveillance-cameras-security Artificial Intelligence Is Going To Supercharge Surveillance].\" 23 January 2018.

More recently, decentralized [[IP camera]]s, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to [[network-attached storage]] devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation.\n\nThere are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016.

The development of reel-to-reel media enabled the recording of surveillance footage. These systems required magnetic tapes to be changed manually, which was a time consuming, expensive and unreliable process, with the operator having to manually thread the tape from the tape reel through the recorder onto an empty take-up reel. Due to these shortcomings, video surveillance was not widespread. [[VCR]] technology became available in the 1970s, making it easier to record and erase information, and the use of video surveillance became more common.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaQY8CrmqFcC&pg=PA276 |title=CCTV Surveillance|isbn=9780080468181|last1=Kruegle|first1=Herman|date=15 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, digital [[multiplexing]] was developed, allowing several cameras to record at once, as well as [[Time lapse photography|time lapse]] and motion-only recording.

First, researchers have argued that the British car park studies included in the meta-analysis cannot accurately control for the fact that CCTV was introduced simultaneously with a range of other security-related measures.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The economics of subjective security and camera surveillance|url = https://wwz.unibas.ch/fileadmin/wwz/redaktion/wipo/Alois_Stutzer/Zehnder_B-099.pdf =|date = 2009|issn = |pages = |volume = |issue = |doi = |last = Zehnder|journal = |access-date = 27 October 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170706060053/https://wwz.unibas.ch/fileadmin/wwz/redaktion/wipo/Alois_Stutzer/Zehnder_B-099.pdf|archive-date = 6 July 2017|url-status = dead}}</ref> Second, some have noted that, in many of the studies, there may be issues with [[selection bias]] since the introduction of CCTV was potentially [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogenous]] to previous crime trends.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Effects of Surveillance Cameras on Crime: Evidence from the Stockholm Subway|journal = The Economic Journal|date = 1 November 2015|issn = 1468-0297|pages = F289\u2013F305|volume = 125|issue = 588|doi = 10.1111/ecoj.12327|first = Mikael|last = Priks}}</ref> In particular, the estimated effects may be biased if CCTV is introduced in response to crime trends.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Is camera surveillance an effective measure of counterterrorism?|url =  |journal = Defence and Peace Economics|date = 2013|issn = |pages = 1\u201314|volume = 24|issue = |doi = 10.1080/10242694.2011.650481|last = Stutzer}}</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that problems of selection bias and endogeneity can be addressed by stronger research designs such as [[randomized controlled trials]] and [[natural experiments]]. A 2017 review published in [[Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention]] compiles seven studies that use such research designs. The studies included in the review found that CCTV reduced crime by 24-28% in public streets and urban subway stations. It also found that CCTV could decrease unruly behaviour in football stadiums and theft in supermarkets/mass merchant stores. However, there was no evidence of CCTV having desirable effects in parking facilities or suburban subway stations. Furthermore, the review indicates that CCTV is more effective in preventing property crimes than in violent crimes.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Surveillance cameras and crime: a review of randomized and natural experiments|journal = Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention|date = 2017|issn = |pages = 210\u2013222|volume = 18|issue = 2| author = Gustav Alexandrie|doi = 10.1080/14043858.2017.1387410}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexis Navy Yard 012 1dsLQLVk7nY.jpg|thumb|left|Closed-circuit video cameras in the Navy Yard complex caught gunman Aaron Alexis during his [[Washington Navy Yard shooting|shooting rampage]].]]\nAnother question in the effectiveness of CCTV for policing is around uptime of the system; in 2013 City of Philadelphia Auditor found that the $15M system was operational only 32% of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viakoo.com/orphaned-video-system-in-philadelphia/|title=Orphaned Video System in Philadelphia?|date=May 2015}}</ref> There is strong anecdotal evidence that CCTV aids in detection and conviction of offenders; indeed UK police forces routinely seek CCTV recordings after crimes.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10512087/10484338Police-are-failing-to-recover-crucial-CCTV-footage-new-figures-suggest.html?fbHow&goback=%2Egde_1889337_member_5817222616544473092 \"Police are failing to recover crucial CCTV footage, new figures suggest\"], The Daily Telegraph</ref>. Moreover, CCTV has played a crucial role in tracing the movements of suspects or victims and is widely regarded by anti-terrorist officers as a fundamental tool in tracking terrorist suspects.

Every action is recorded as an information block with subtitles that explain the performed operation. This helps to track the actions of workers, especially when they are making critical financial transactions, such as correcting or cancelling of a sale, withdrawing money or altering personal information.\n\nActions which an employer may wish to monitor could include:\n* Scanning of goods, selection of goods, introduction of price and quantity;\n* Input and output of operators in the system when entering passwords;\n* Deleting operations and modifying existing documents;\n* Implementation of certain operations, such as financial statements or operations with cash;\n* Moving goods, revaluation scrapping and counting;\n* Control in the kitchen of fast food restaurants;\n* Change of settings, reports and other official functions.\n\nEach of these operations is transmitted with a description, allowing detailed monitoring of all actions of the operator. Some systems allow the user to search for a specific event by time of occurrence and text description, and perform statistical evaluation of operator behaviour. This allows the software to predict deviations from the standard workflow and record only anomalous behaviour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/archive/library/subject-gateways/business-management/smes/small-business-update/2015-01/using-cctv-to-monitor-the-workplace|title=Using CCTV to monitor the workplace |publisher= icaew |access-date=2016-09-18}}</ref>\n\n===Use in schools===\nIn the United States, Britain,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.atl.org.uk/policy-and-campaigns/policy-posts/use-cctv-surveillance-schools?resetmyATL=true|title= Use of CCTV surveillance in schools| author= ATL|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher= ATL the education union|date=22 October 2013}}</ref> Australia<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/school-security-cctv-puts-bullies-on-pause/story-e6freuzi-1226311797645|title= School security CCTV puts bullies on pause | author= Bruce McDougall and Katherine Danks |accessdate=8 November 2016|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date=28 March 2012}}</ref> and New Zealand, CCTV is widely used in schools due to its success in preventing [[bullying]], [[vandalism]], monitoring visitors and maintaining a record of evidence in the event of a crime. There are some restrictions on installation, with cameras not being installed in an area where there is a \"reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]\", such as bathrooms, gym locker areas and private offices (unless consent by the office occupant is given). Cameras are generally acceptable in hallways, parking lots, front offices where students, employees, and parents come and go, gymnasiums, cafeterias, supply rooms and classrooms. The installation of cameras in classrooms may be objected to by some teachers.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|title = Legal aspects of the use of video cameras in schools =|access-date = 25 March 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160215174520/https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|archive-date = 15 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Use in private homes===\nMany home owners now choose to install CCTV systems on their own homes. CCTV cameras are an effective deterrent to criminals as it increases the risk of criminals being caught because they could be identified through the camera footage. Most criminals will scout through affluent suburbs looking for the easiest house to break into. Having an obvious CCTV system, or another security alarm, makes the house appear to be a more difficult target so the criminals will likely move on to the next house. \nModern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage. Some systems even provide motion detection so when movement is detected, an alert can be sent to your phone.\n\n=== Criminal use ===\n\nCriminals may use surveillance cameras to monitor the public. For example, a hidden camera at an [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]] can capture people's [[Personal Identification Number|PINs]] as they are entered, without their knowledge. The devices are small enough not to be noticed, and are placed where they can monitor the keypad of the machine as people enter their PINs. Images may be transmitted wirelessly to the criminal.

These years, while featuring general [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and many improvements in the [[standard of living]],{{Ref label|a1|a1|none}} were marred by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions, social unrest, political strife and severe economic difficulties.\n\nNear the end of World War II, the advancing Soviet [[Red Army]], along with the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East#Berling's Army: 1943\u20131945|Polish Armed Forces in the East]], pushed out the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] forces from [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]]. In February 1945, the [[Yalta Conference]] sanctioned the formation of a provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. [[Joseph Stalin]], the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] was formed in [[Warsaw]] by ignoring the [[Polish government-in-exile]] based in [[London]] since 1940.\n\nDuring the subsequent [[Potsdam Conference]] in July\u2013August 1945, the three major [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ratified the colossal westerly shift of the Polish frontier and approved its new territory between the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] and [[Curzon Line]], which resulted in Poland returning to its original borders that existed upon the [[Baptism of Poland|foundation]] of the first Polish state in 966 AD. Following the destruction of the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] population in [[The Holocaust in Poland|the Holocaust]], the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|flight and expulsion of Germans]] in the west, [[Operation Vistula|resettlement of Ukrainians]] in the east, and the [[Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)|repatriation of Poles]] from the [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]] (''Kresy''), Poland became for the first time in its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government [[1947 Polish legislative election|solidified its political power]] over the next two years, while the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) under [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] gained firm control over the country, which would be within the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet sphere of influence]], but remain independent. The [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] was promulgated in July 1952 and the state officially became the [[Polish People's Republic]] (PRL).\n\nFollowing Stalin's death in 1953, a political \"[[Khrushchev Thaw|thaw]]\" allowed a more liberal faction of the [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]], led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], to [[Polish October|gain power]]. By the mid-1960s, Poland began experiencing increasing economic as well as political difficulties. They culminated in the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] and the [[1970 Polish protests]], when a consumer price hike led to a wave of strikes. The government introduced a new economic program based on large-scale loans from western creditors, which resulted in a rise in living standards and expectations, but the program meant growing integration of Poland's economy with the [[world economy]] and it faltered after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In 1976, the government of [[Edward Gierek]] was forced to raise prices again and this led to the [[June 1976 protests]].\n\nThis cycle of repression and reform{{Ref label|b|b|none}} and the economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojty\u0142a as [[Pope John Paul II]]. Wojty\u0142a's unexpected elevation strengthened the opposition to the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and ineffective system of ''[[nomenklatura]]''-run [[state socialism]], especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent [[trade union]] \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to declare [[martial law in Poland|martial law]] in December 1981. However, with the reforms of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989 [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Talks]] led to Solidarity's participation in the [[1989 Polish legislative election|1989 election]]. Its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the [[Revolutions of 1989|succession of transitions]] from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned from the presidency following the [[1990 Polish presidential election|presidential election]] and he was succeeded by Wa\u0142\u0119sa.\n\n==Establishment of communist-ruled Poland (1944\u201348)==\n\n===Wartime devastation, border and population shifts, rebuilding of infrastructure and economy===\n\n[[File:Map of Poland (1945).png|left|thumb|Poland's [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|old and new borders in 1945]]]]\n\nBefore [[World War II]], a third of Poland's population was composed of [[Ethnic minorities in Poland|ethnic minorities]].

In reality it was not finished until mid-August, after the Polish communist [[Union of Polish Patriots|Moscow group]] was joined by the late-arriving [[Polish Workers' Party|Warsaw group]], led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut|Bierut]].<ref name=\"GP 414\"/>]]\n\nAfter the prewar [[Communist Party of Poland]] was eliminated in [[Great Purge|Stalin's purges]] in 1938 (some five thousand Polish communists were brought to [[Russia]] and killed), a group of survivors led by [[Marceli Nowotko]], [[Boles\u0142aw Mo\u0142ojec]] and [[Pawe\u0142 Finder]] convinced in 1941 the Soviets in Moscow of the need to reestablish a Polish party. The conspiratorial core of the new Polish Workers' Party was assembled in Warsaw in January 1942, and after the deaths or arrests of the above leaders there, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] emerged as the PPR's first secretary by the end of 1943. Gomu\u0142ka was a dedicated communist in the national tradition of the Polish [[left-wing politics|leftist]] movement. He loathed the Soviet practices he experienced while being trained in Russia and [[Ukraine]] in the 1930s, but was convinced of the historic necessity of alliance with the Soviet Union. He may have survived the purges because of being imprisoned in Poland for illegal labor-organizing activities in 1938\u201339. Throughout the [[German-occupied Europe|German occupation]], Gomu\u0142ka remained in Poland and was not a part of the circle organized in the Soviet Union around the [[Union of Polish Patriots]] by Stalin and [[Wanda Wasilewska]]. In Polish society of 1945, Gomu\u0142ka's party was marginally small in comparison to other political groups.<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/>\n\nWith the liberation of Polish territories and the failure of the [[Home Army]]'s [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944, control over what was to become post-war Poland passed from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany to the Red Army, and from the Red Army to [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]], who formed the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (''Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego'', PKWN), an early government, in existence from late July 1944 in [[Lublin]]. The Polish communists became the most influential Polish factor in the politics of emerging Poland,<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> despite having initially minuscule popular support.<ref name=\"Gibianskii\"/> The PKWN recognized the legal continuity of the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]], as opposed to the [[April Constitution of Poland|April Constitution]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Szel\u0105g 11\u201312\"/> On 6 September 1944, the PKWN issued its momentous [[land reform]] decree, the consequences of which would fundamentally alter the antiquated social and economic structure of the country. Over one million peasant families benefited from parcellation of the [[folwark|larger estates]].<ref name=\"GP 417, 424\"/>\n\nThe communists, favored by the Yalta decisions, enjoyed the advantages of Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe firmly under the influence of the Soviet Union; they exercised control over crucial government departments, such as the security services (security was in the hands of the Soviet [[NKVD]] until its Polish counterparts were developed).<ref name=\"GP 414\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the [[populism|populist]] program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's [[Government Delegation for Poland|delegation]] was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its [[Polish Underground State|political-military organizations]] became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the [[PKWN Manifesto]] and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support.<ref name=\"Od rz\u0105du do nierz\u0105du\"/> Beyond the land reform, the PKWN Manifesto foresaw no further radical ownership changes and [[nationalization]] of industry was not mentioned. On the contrary, business property was supposed to return to its owners as the economic relations become properly regulated.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 97\"/> From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established [[workers' council]]s, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/>\n\nThe PKWN was reshaped into the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland]] (''Rz\u0105d Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'', RTRP), which functioned from January 1945.<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> This government was headed by [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], a [[Polish Socialist Party|socialist]], but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees such as [[Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski]], held a majority of key posts.<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/> In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited the possibilities of future Western or [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] impact or internal cooperation with non-communist political forces in Poland.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"GP 416\"/> The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the [[State National Council]] (''Krajowa Rada Narodowa'', KRN), formed by Gomu\u0142ka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'', RJN).\n\n[[File:zapluty karzel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Postwar Polish communist propaganda poster depicting \"The giant and the putrid reactionary midget\", meaning the communist [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]] soldier and the pro-Western [[Home Army]] soldier, respectively]]\n\nThe Yalta agreement stipulated a governmental union in Poland of \"all democratic and anti-Nazi elements\". Prime Minister [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] of the Polish government-in-exile resigned his post in November 1944 and having accepted the Yalta terms went to Moscow, where he negotiated with [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] the shape of a \"national unity\" government\".

The government was \"provisional\" and the [[Potsdam Conference]] soon declared that before a regular government is created, free elections must be held and a permanent constitutional system established.<ref name=\"GP 417\"/>\n\nThe communists' principal rivals were [[Freedom and Independence|veteran activists]] of the [[Polish Underground State]], Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|Polish People's Party]] (''Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe'', PSL), and veterans of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]]. Of particular practical importance was Miko\u0142ajczyk's People's Party (originally a peasant formation), because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> Miko\u0142ajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, would be allowed to act as a bridge between the East and the West.<ref name=\"Kochanski 569\u2013577\"/>\n\nSoviet-oriented parties, backed by the Soviet Red Army and in control of the security forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Gomu\u0142ka and Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated at the time of the PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918\u20131945 619\"/>\n\nAs a show of Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish anti-Nazi underground]] were brought to [[Trial of the Sixteen|trial in Moscow]] in June 1945.<ref name=\"Kemp-Welch 8\"/> Their removal from the political scene precluded the possibility of a democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements.<ref name=\"GP 415\"/> The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest.

However, the Polish communists, led by Gomu\u0142ka and Bierut, while having no intention of giving up power, were also aware of the limited support they enjoyed among the general population. To circumvent this difficulty, in 1946 a national plebiscite, known as the [[1946 Polish people's referendum|\"Three Times Yes\" referendum]] (''Trzy razy tak''), was held first, before the parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Poland-7306\">[http://countrystudies.us/poland/16.htm  Consolidation of Communist Power.] ''Countrystudies.us/Poland.'' Retrieved 27 November 2011.</ref> The referendum comprised three fairly general, but politically charged questions about the Senate, national industries and western borders. It was meant to check and promote the popularity of communist initiatives in Poland. Since most of the important parties at the time were leftist or centrist \u2013 and could have easily approved all three options \u2013 Miko\u0142ajczyk's Polish People's Party (PSL) decided, not to be seen as merging into the government bloc, to ask its supporters to oppose the first one: the abolition of the Senate.<ref name=\"GP 424\"/> The communists voted \"Three Times Yes\". The partial results, reconstructed by the PSL, showed that the communist side was met with little support on the first question. However, after a campaign marked by electoral fraud and intimidation the communists claimed large majorities on all three questions,<ref name=\"Encyklopedia_WIEM\"/><ref name=\"GP 424\"/> which led to the [[nationalization]] of industry and state control of economic activity in general, and a unicameral national parliament (''[[Sejm]]'').<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe communists consolidated power by gradually whittling away the rights of their non-communist foes, particularly by suppressing the leading opposition party \u2013 Miko\u0142ajczyk's PSL.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> In some widely publicized cases, the perceived enemies were sentenced to death on trumped up charges \u2014 among them [[Witold Pilecki]], the organizer of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] resistance. Leaders of the Home Army and of the Council of National Unity were persecuted. Many resistance fighters were murdered extrajudicially or forced to exile.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 272\u2013274\"/> The opposition members were also harassed by administrative means. Although the ongoing persecution of the former anti-Nazi and [[National Armed Forces|right-wing organizations]] by state security kept [[cursed soldiers|some partisans]] in the forests, the actions of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] (known as the UB, Department of Security), NKVD and the Red Army steadily diminished their numbers. The [[National Military Union|right-wing insurgency]] radically decreased after the amnesty of July 1945<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 70\"/> and faded after the [[Amnesty of 1947|amnesty of February 1947]].<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski Zdobycie w\u0142adzy\"/><ref name=\"Daszczy\u0144ski Po wojnie\"/>\n\nBy 1946, all rightist parties had been outlawed,<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> and a new pro-government [[Front of National Unity|Democratic Bloc]] was formed in 1947 which included only the Polish Workers' Party and its leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the [[1947 Polish legislative election|first parliamentary elections]] took place featuring primarily the PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party. However, the PSL's strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Election results were adjusted by Stalin to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords.<ref name=\"GP 426\"/> The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> After the referendum dress rehearsal, this time the vote fraud was much better concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, an NKVD colonel charged with election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new ''Sejm'', out of 444 seats, 27 were given to the [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|Polish People's Party]] of [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]].<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 91\u201395, 102\"/> He, having declared the results to be falsified, was threatened with arrest or worse and fled the country in October 1947, helped by the [[United States|US]] Embassy; other opposition leaders also left.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 91\u201395, 102\"/> In February, the new ''Sejm'' created the [[Small Constitution of 1947]].

The [[socialism|socialists]]' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss the idea of a party merger. The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin]], increasingly uncomfortable with Gomu\u0142ka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972).<ref name=\"GP 426-427\"/> In December 1948, after the removal of Gomu\u0142ka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief,<ref name=\"GP 428-430\"/> the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza'', PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]] and a [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/> Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) that had split from Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|PSL]] and was meant to represent rural communities, and the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] (SD), a token [[intelligentsia]] party (see also: [[List of political parties in Poland]]).<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/>\n\nAs the period of [[Sovietization]] and [[Stalinism]] began, the PZPR was anything but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with the PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomu\u0142ka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction.<ref name=\"GP 428-430\"/> The PZPR became divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], the official ideology, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, including those of the [[Sanation]], the [[National Democracy]], and 19th century traditions of cooperation with the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning powers]].<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/>\n\nWith Poland being a member of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]], the party's pursuits of power and reform were permanently hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction).<ref name=\"GP 411-413\"/> Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.<ref name=\"GP 431\"/>\n\nThe ''[[nomenklatura]]'' political elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within the ruling party structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. ''Nomenklatura'' members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management, or education. For the party, the privileged ''nomenklatura'' layer was maintained to assure the proper placement of people who were ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] dissidents [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/> The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted ''nomenklatura'' and the security services were resented.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 66\u201367\"/>\n\n==Stalinist era (1948\u201356)==\n\n{{Redirect|Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism in general|Stalinism|the state-sanctioned art of the period|Socialist realism in Poland}}\n\n[[File:Proces Pileckiego 1948-2.jpg|thumb|The [[show trial]] of Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], sentenced to death and executed May 1948]]\n\n===Removal of Gomu\u0142ka, Stalinist repressions===\n\nAs in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, there was a Soviet-style political purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of \"nationalist\" or other \"[[Deviationism|deviationist]]\" tendencies.<ref name=\"KJL\"/> The half-hearted in Poland campaign included the arrests and imprisonments of [[Marian Spychalski]] from May 1950, and [[Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski]] five months after Stalin's death.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 170\u2013171\"/> In September 1948 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together with a group of communist leaders who like Gomu\u0142ka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from [[Leninism]], and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary.<ref name=\"KJL\"/><ref name=\"Stola Anti-Zionist Campaign\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, accused of \"right-wing nationalist deviations\", had indeed emphasized the [[Polish Socialist Party|Polish socialist]] traditions and severely criticized [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL) party for belittling Polish national aspirations.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 38\u201349\"/> More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomu\u0142ka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 115\u2013116\"/> Following Boles\u0142aw Bierut's order, he was arrested by the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by [[Roman Romkowski]] and [[Anatol Fejgin]], as demanded by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 79\u201381\"/> Gomu\u0142ka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, [[Jakub Berman]], and other Stalin's associates.<ref name=\"LIFE\"/><ref name=\"Hodos-151\">George H.

The program of free and compulsory school education for all and the establishment of free institutions of higher learning received much support. The communists screened out what facts and interpretations were to be taught; history and other sciences had to follow Marxist views approved by [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|ideological censorship]].<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> During 1951\u201353, a large number of prewar professors who were perceived by the regime as reactionary was dismissed from universities. Government control over art and artists deepened. The Soviet-style [[socialist realism]] became the only formula accepted by the authorities after 1949. Most works of art and literature represented [[Propaganda in the Polish People's Republic|propaganda of the party]] or had to be in line with its views. (See also: [[Socialist realism in Poland]])\n\nThe reforms often brought relief for a significant part of the population. After World War II many people were willing to accept communist rule in exchange for the restoration of relatively normal life; hundreds of thousands joined the communist party and actively supported the regime. Nonetheless, latent popular discontent remained present and many Poles adopted the attitude of \"resigned cooperation\". Others, like the [[Freedom and Independence]] organization that originated from elements of the Home Army and especially the [[National Armed Forces]] actively opposed the communists, hoping for a [[World War III]] that would liberate Poland. Most [[cursed soldiers|people who took up arms against the communist regime]] had surrendered during the amnesties of 1945 and [[amnesty of 1947|1947]], but brutal repressions by the secret police continued and some fought well into the 1950s.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/><ref name=\"Piotrowski-88-90\"/>{{Ref label|d|d|none}}\n\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]], Primate of Poland]]\n\nThe communists further alienated many Poles by persecuting the [[Catholic Church in Poland|Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The [[PAX Association]] created in 1947 and led by the former prewar [[National Radical Camp|far-right]] activist [[Boles\u0142aw Piasecki]], attempted to divide the Catholic movement and promote a communist rule-friendly, [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] church.<ref name=\"GP 435\"/> The PAX did not get very far in molding the Catholic public opinion, but published numerous books and officially approved daily Catholic press.

But the recommended economic improvements, despite the self-restraint of the authors, were not compatible with the obligatory at that time heavy-handed centralized economic command system, and the reform effort fizzled out.<ref name=\"Reforma nie zacz\u0119\u0142a\"/>\n\nIn October 1957, Poland's Foreign Minister [[Adam Rapacki]] proposed a European [[Rapacki Plan|nuclear-free zone]] that would include the territories of Poland, [[West Germany]], [[East Germany]] and [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"GP 441\"/> In August 1961, the new [[Berlin Wall]] cemented the division of Europe.\n\nDuring 1948\u201371, the Polish government signed [[Indemnity|indemnification]] agreements with a number of [[Western Europe|West European]] countries (excluding those considered allies of [[Nazi Germany]]), [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The agreements dealt with compensation for the losses incurred by citizens and firms of the countries involved as a result of war events and the subsequent [[nationalization]]. The agreement with the U.S. followed the visit to Poland of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1959 and his talks with Gomu\u0142ka. It was signed in 1960 and the agreed amount had been paid by the Polish government in twenty installments. The U.S. government thereby assumed responsibility for indemnities resulting from claims filed by U.S. citizens.<ref name=\"Polsko nie daj sie\"/>\n\nAfter the first wave of reform, Gomu\u0142ka's regime started to move back on their promises. Control over mass media and universities was gradually tightened, and many of the younger and more reformist members of the party were forced out (over 200,000 purged already in 1958, when the PZPR undertook a \"verification\" of its membership).<ref name=\"Werblan Szkice 149\u2013150\"/> The reform-promising Gomu\u0142ka of 1956 turned into the authoritarian Gomu\u0142ka of the 1960s. Although Poland enjoyed a period of relative stability in that decade, the idealism of the \"Polish October\" faded away.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The decisions made at the XIII Plenum of the Central Committee, held in 1963, meant a definite end of the post-October liberalization period. The demise of Gomu\u0142ka's tactical allies, the ''Pu\u0142awy'' faction, gradually replaced by Gomu\u0142ka's own people, was apparent when [[Roman Zambrowski]], the leading Jewish politician, was removed from the Politburo.<ref name=\"Stola 13\u201327\"/>\n\nPoland under Gomu\u0142ka's rule was generally considered one of the more liberal [[communist state]]s. However, Poles could still go to prison for writing [[political satire]] about the party leader, as [[Janusz Szpota\u0144ski]] did,<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 337\"/> or for publishing a book abroad. A March 1964 \"Letter of the 34\", signed by leading intellectuals and delivered to the office of Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, criticized the worsening censorship and demanded a more open cultural policy, as guaranteed by the constitution.<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski Najs\u0142ynniejszy list Peerelu\"/> [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] were expelled from the party and from 1965 imprisoned for written criticism (an \"Open Letter to the Party\") of the party rule and pointing out the contradictory nature of the supposedly workers' state.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 305\u2013306\"/> Kuro\u0144 and Modzelewski accused the regime of betraying the revolutionary cause; like many younger Polish reformers, they spoke from [[New Left|leftist positions]] and were ideologically closely aligned with Western radicals of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 1\u20136\"/>\n\nAs the regime was getting less liberal and more repressive, Gomu\u0142ka's popularity declined as his initial vision lost its impetus.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Many Poles found Gomu\u0142ka's self-righteous attitude irritating and his demeanor provincial. He reacted to increasing criticism by refusing to budge and insulating himself with the help of cronies, of whom [[Zenon Kliszko]] was the most influential. Within the party, Minister of the Interior [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]] and his nationalist-communist faction known as \"the Partisans\" (together with ''Moczarowcy'', the much broader system of Moczar's political clientele) were looking for an opportunity to assert their dominance.<ref name=\"Stola Anti-Zionist Campaign\"/><ref name=\"Stola 13\u201327\"/><ref name=\"GP 441-442\"/>\n\n[[File:Polski Fiat 125p.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Polski Fiat 125p]], produced in Poland from the late 1960s, was based on technology purchased from [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]]]]\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Poland was starting to experience economic difficulties and the appreciable thus far standard of living improvements were showing signs of stagnation (during 1960\u201370 real wages for workers grew only by an average of 1.8% per year). The postwar [[Business cycle|economic boom]] was ending and the increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] and integrated [[world economy]] was becoming inhospitable to national developments operating behind trade barriers.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/><ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 12\u201313\"/> Like the other communist states, Poland was spending too much on heavy industry, armaments and prestige projects and too little on consumer production. The failure of Soviet-style collectivization returned the collectivized land to the peasants,<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> but most of their farms were too small to be prosperous and  productivity in agriculture remained low. Economic relations with West Germany were frozen due to East German interference and resistance to economic integration. Gomu\u0142ka attributed the signs of economic decline to faulty implementation of the fundamentally correct directions issued by central organs of the party. He failed to appreciate the corrective role of the [[Market (economics)|market]], whose [[feedback]] could not be replaced by theoretical computations, planning and administrative decisions.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 236\u2013238\"/> On the other hand, pursuing conservative investment rather than consumption oriented economic policies, his government generated no foreign debt.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 224\"/>\n\nFrom 1960, the regime increasingly implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and measures that made carrying out religious practices more difficult.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 227\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, according to Andrzej Leder, was the last Polish politician who seriously tried to realize an [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] program, a staple leftist undertaking.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 185\u2013187\"/> In 1965, the [[Episcopal Conference of Poland|Conference of Polish Bishops]] issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]].<ref name=\"Stelmachowski 33\"/> In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the [[Christianization of Poland]] led by the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]], Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] and other bishops who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the [[Catholic Church in Poland]].<ref name=\"GP I 15-17\"/> In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing the origin of Polish statehood,<ref name=\"GP I 15-17\"/> but the display of the Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic [[prelate]]s in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and elsewhere.

Poland's security chief Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar, a wartime communist partisan commander, based his appeal on nationalistic rhetoric combined with anti-intelligentsia and anti-Jewish sentiments and became the chief challenger.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> The party leader in [[Upper Silesia]], [[Edward Gierek]], who had become involved with the communist movement as a teenage mining industry laborer in France,<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/> also emerged as a possible alternative leader. Gierek was favored by the more pragmatic and technocratic members of the ''[[nomenklatura]]''.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 268\u2013272\"/> From January 1968, Polish revisionist opposition and other circles were strongly influenced by the developing movement of the [[Prague Spring]].<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 232\"/>\n\nIn March 1968, student demonstrations at the [[University of Warsaw]] broke out in the wake of the government's ban on further performance of the play ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] (written in 1824) at the [[National Theatre, Warsaw|National Theatre in Warsaw]],<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski March 68\"/> because of its alleged \"anti-Soviet references\".

Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/> The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomu\u0142ka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which gave Gomu\u0142ka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power early in his term.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 282\"/>\n\nThe revisionist dissident prominence in the 1968 events overshadowed the equally significant awakening taking place among the working class of Poland. [[Gda\u0144sk]], where thousands of students and workers fought the police on March 15, had the highest in the country rate of administrative detentions and court cases.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 342\"/> The greatest proportion of people arrested and imprisoned in March and April 1968 in Poland were classified by the authorities as \"workers\".<ref name=Friszke/>\n\nAn internal attempt was made to discredit Gomu\u0142ka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and tolerated. In the meantime, irreversible damage to society had been wrecked by the Moczar movement. Gomu\u0142ka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], was preoccupied with the [[Prague Spring|crisis in Czechoslovakia]] and not inclined to support personnel changes in the Polish leadership.<ref name=\"GP 442-443\"/>\n\nIn August 1968, the [[Polish People's Army]] took part in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Some Polish intellectuals protested, and [[Ryszard Siwiec]] burned himself alive during celebrations of an official holiday.

Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the \"fraternal course\".<ref name=\"GP 442-443\"/>\n\n===Treaty with West Germany, food riots and the ousting of Gomu\u0142ka===\n\n[[File:Polish 1970 protests - Zbyszek Godlewski body.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstrators in [[Gdynia]] carry the body of [[Janek Wi\u015bniewski|Zbigniew Godlewski]], who was shot and killed during the [[1970 Polish protests|protests of 1970]]]]\n\nIn December 1970, Gomu\u0142ka's government scored a major political success when Poland obtained recognition by [[West Germany]] of [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|post-World War II borders]].<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> In the negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]], the German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for residents of Poland of German identity and the ability to help financially those who stayed in Poland by granting pensions. Hundreds of thousands eventually became affected.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/> [[Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013present)|German Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]], who signed the agreement, used the occasion to ask on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (''[[Kniefall von Warschau]]''). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was made at the site of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church leaders issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]], criticized then by the Polish government.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka felt proud and secure after the treaty with West Germany, his milestone political achievement. It signified a lasting trend in Poland's international policy: extricating the country from the disproportional dependence on Russia and compensating the security vulnerability by building good relations with Germany.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/><ref name=\"GP 444-445\"/>\n\nBut the event could not mask the economic crisis into which Poland was drifting. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 the regime unexpectedly announced substantial increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The new measures were incomprehensible to many workers, and their unfortunate timing (before Christmas, the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomu\u0142ka's fall from power.\n\nOn 14\u201319 December 1970, [[1970 Polish protests|mass demonstrations]] against the price rises broke out in the northern ([[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast) cities of [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Gdynia]], [[Elbl\u0105g]] and [[Szczecin]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including headquarters of the party in Gda\u0144sk and Szczecin.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/> The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomu\u0142ka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, however, was determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/> Among the party leaders who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gda\u0144sk, were [[Zenon Kliszko]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Kocio\u0142ek]]. In Gdynia, soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. Possibly about fifty people were killed in the coastal region in December.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/><ref name=\"Kemp-Welch 180\u2013188\"/>\n\nThe protest movement spread to other cities, leading to more strikes and causing angry workers to occupy many factories. The general strike across Poland was scheduled for 21 December 1970.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/>\n\nThe party leadership meeting in Warsaw on 20 December recognized the danger that the working class revolt presented to their system. In consultations with the disturbed Soviet leaders, they proceeded with arranging the resignation of Gomu\u0142ka, who was by then stressed out and ill.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/> Several of his collaborators were also removed. [[Edward Gierek]] was drafted as the new first secretary. [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]], another strong contender, was not trusted and even blamed for the current debacle by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/>\n\nAnother strike in Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. Gierek gambled that his personal appearances would resolve the crisis. He went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gda\u0144sk the next day, met the workers, apologized for the past mistakes and assured them that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Participants of the Szczecin strike demanded freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek consented, but in reality the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing labor structures and their places of employment. The February [[1971 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a strikes]] followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes promised.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 209\u2013211\"/><ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 258\u2013259\"/>\n\nThe Polish opposition movement, traditionally led by the intelligentsia, after the two heavy blows of 1968 and 1970 was in disarray and silent. The revisionists' tenuous connection with the communist party was permanently broken, but a new strategy had not yet emerged.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/> However, already in 1971 [[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] published in the \u00e9migr\u00e9 ''[[Kultura]]'' journal a seminal article entitled ''Theses on Hope and Hopelessness''. It put forward a concept of civil democratizing resistance movement that would be valid even in the repressed and seemingly deadlocked [[state socialism|state socialist]] society.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 58\u201364\"/>\n\n==Gierek decade (1970\u201380)==\n\n===Catching up with the West===\n\n[[File:Edward Gierek 1980b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Gierek]]]]\n\nGierek, like Gomu\u0142ka in 1956, came to power on a raft of promises that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and those responsible for the violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He proceeded to create a new economic program, based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West, to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek years, was intended to be used for equipment and modernization of Polish industry, and for import of [[consumer goods]] to give the workers more incentive to work.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 258\u2013259\"/>\n\nFor the next few years, the regime optimistically engaged in reform and experimentation and for the first time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other luxury items. Attention was paid to the wages workers received. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. Censorship was eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were improved. The relative cultural and political relaxation resulted in a better [[freedom of speech]] environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly ''[[Polityka]]''. The massive investments and purchases of Western technology were expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/> The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/>\n\nThis \"New Development Strategy\", based on import-led growth,<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> depended on the global economic conditions and the program faltered suddenly because of worldwide recession and increased oil prices.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> The effects of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973\u201374 oil crisis]] produced an inflationary surge followed by a recession in the West, which resulted in a sharp increase in the price of imported consumer goods in Poland, coupled with a decline in demand for Polish exports, particularly [[coal]]. Poland's [[external debt|foreign debt]], absent at the time of Gomu\u0142ka's departure,<ref name=\"Prazmowska Gomulka grozil\"/> rose rapidly under Gierek to reach a multibillion-dollar figure. Continuing borrowing from the West had become increasingly difficult. Consumer goods began to disappear from Polish shops. The new factories built by Gierek's regime proved to be largely ineffective and mismanaged, as the basics of market [[demand]] and [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]] were often ignored.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The significant internal economic reform, promised by the Gierek team, had not materialized.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 55\u201358\"/>\n\nThe Western credits thus helped spur industrial growth and helped Gierek's policy of [[consumerism]], but just for a few years. The industrial production grew by an average of 10% per year between 1971 and 1975 (the years remembered later by many older Poles as most prosperous, considering not only the communist period in Poland), only to dwindle to less than 2% in 1979. [[Government debt|Debt servicing]] that took 12% of export earnings in 1971, rose to 75% in 1979.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 286\"/>\n\nIn 1975, like other European countries, Poland became a signatory of the [[Helsinki Accords]] and member of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE); such developments were possible because of the period of \"[[d\u00e9tente]]\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. Despite the regime's promises that the freedoms listed in the agreement would be implemented in Poland, there was little change. However, the Poles were becoming more aware of the rights they were being denied and emboldened by the knowledge of their government's treaty obligations.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/>\n\nGierek government's growing difficulties led also to increased dependence on the Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomu\u0142ka's rule. The [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|constitution]], amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after [[Letter of 59|protests by intellectuals]] and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/><ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 405\u2013407\"/>\n\nNevertheless, the regime of Gierek deemphasized the Marxist ideology and from his time the \"communist\" governments of Poland concentrated on pragmatic issues and current concerns.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 67\u201370\"/> In Polish economic politics new lasting trends were initiated, such as the emphasis on individual initiative, personal aspirations and competition, which some interpreted as an attack on [[egalitarianism]] (social inequalities were indeed increasing). Sections of the [[intelligentsia]], ''[[nomenklatura]]'' and [[small business]] gave rise to the emerging [[middle class]]. The new \"socialist\" ways were less totalitarian, stressed innovation, modern management methods and engaged workers, all seen as necessary to push the outdated economy past the constant crisis stage. Poland of the 1970s became more open to the world and entered the [[World economy|global economy]], which permanently changed society, creating at the same time a new type of crisis vulnerability. The opposition thinking, its promotion of society formed by active individuals, developed along complementary concepts.<ref name=\"Jak narod nie obalil komuny\"/><ref name=\"Gawin Michnik\"/>\n\n===Renewal of social unrest and the rise of organized opposition===\n\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Queue area|Queue line]], a frequent scene at times of [[shortage economy|shortages]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]] in the 1970s and 1980s]]\n\nAs a result of the 1970 worker rebellion food prices remained frozen and were artificially low. The demand for food products exceeded the supply also because of the higher real wages, which already in the first two years of Gierek's government increased more than during the entire decade of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Dudek Wzlot i upadek\"/> In June 1976, in an attempt to reduce consumption,<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> the government introduced a long-announced and several times delayed, but radical price increase: basic foodstuffs had their prices raised by an average of 60%, three times the rate of Gomu\u0142ka'a increases from six years before. The compensatory wage rises were skewed toward the better-off part of the population.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/>{{Ref label|w|w|none}} The result was an immediate [[June 1976 protests|nationwide wave of strikes]], with violent demonstrations, looting and other labor unrest at the [[Ursus Factory]] near Warsaw, in [[Radom]], [[P\u0142ock]] and other places.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 119\u2013120\"/> The government quickly backed down and repealed the price rises, but the strike leaders were arrested and put on trial.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> A series of \"spontaneous\" large scale public gatherings, intended to convey the \"anger of the people\" at the \"trouble-makers\" was staged by the party leadership in a number of cities, but the Soviet pressure prevented further attempts at raising prices. Gierek's cordial in the past relations with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were now seriously damaged. Food [[Ration stamp|ration cards]], introduced because of the destabilized market in August 1976, were to remain a feature of life in Poland for the duration of the People's Republic.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/> The regime's retreat, having occurred for the second time in several years, amounted to an unprecedented defeat. Within the rigid political system, the government was neither able to reform (it would lose control and power) nor to satisfy society's staple needs, because it had to sell abroad all it could to make foreign debt and interests payments.

Cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a, the [[archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]], was elected [[pope]] at the Vatican, taking the name [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. The election of a Polish pope had an electrifying effect on what was at that time one of the last idiosyncratically Catholic countries in Europe.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> When John Paul toured Poland in June 1979, half a million people came to welcome him in Warsaw; in the next eight days, about ten million Poles attended the many outdoor [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] he celebrated.<ref name=\"TVN-1\"/> John Paul clearly became the most important person in Poland, leaving the regime not so much opposed as ignored. Rather than calling for rebellion, John Paul encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next crisis came, the nation would present a united front.<ref name=\"Weigel-Pope\"/><ref name=\"Weigel-Witness\"/>\n\n===Polish emigration===\n\nThe [[Polish government-in-exile]] in [[London]], unrecognized since the end of World War II, ridiculed by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance. Under President [[Edward Bernard Raczy\u0144ski]] it overcame years of internal squabbles, and after the election of the Polish pope, at the time of the increasingly assertive Polish opposition, improved its image and standing.<ref name=\"GP 481\"/>\n\nThe large Polish emigrant communities in North America, Western Europe and elsewhere were politically active and lent significant support to those struggling in the country. The staunchly anti-communist American ''[[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]'' and other Poles felt grateful for the leadership of President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Of the Polish institutions in the West the most important were the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], whose Polish section was run by [[Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]], and the monthly literary ''[[Kultura]]'' magazine in [[Paris]], led by [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Juliusz Mieroszewski]].<ref name=\"GP 481\"/>\n\n==Final decade of the Polish People's Republic (1980\u201389)==\n\n===Failing economy and labor unrest===\n\nBy 1980, the authorities had no choice but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic level, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western [[Financial institution|financial companies and institutions]] providing loans to the regime at a meeting at the [[Bank Handlowy]] in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that the state could no longer subsidize artificially low prices of consumer goods.<ref name=\"gnauck7\"/> The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat.

Among the leaders of the strike were [[Anna Walentynowicz]] and [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of [[21 demands of MKS|21 demands]] was formulated by the [[Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee]] on 17 August.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 239\u2013240\"/> The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With the assistance of activists from the [[Workers' Defence Committee|KOR]] and support of many other intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations),<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 242\"/> the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of [[trade union]]s independent of government control.<ref name=\"Int Soc\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 79\u201381\"/> Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 22\u201323\"/>\n\nThe party leadership was faced with a choice between repressions on a massive scale and an amicable agreement that would give the workers what they wanted and thus quieten the aroused population.<ref name=\"GP 482-491\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 81\u201385\"/> They chose the latter. On 31 August Wa\u0142\u0119sa signed the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]] with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Jagielski]], a member of the party [[Politburo]].<ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> The agreement acknowledged the right of employees to associate in free trade unions, obliged the government to take steps to eliminate censorship, abolished weekend work, increased the [[minimum wage]], improved and extended welfare and pensions and increased autonomy of industrial enterprises, where a meaningful role was to be played by [[workers' self-management]] councils.

In addition to the Gda\u0144sk Agreement, similar documents were signed at other centers of strike activity: in Szczecin (the [[Szczecin Agreement]]), [[Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j strikes|Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j]], and at [[Katowice Steelworks]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 85\u201393\"/>\n\n===Solidarity===\n\n[[File:Astilleros de Gdansk.jpg|thumb|right|300px|25th anniversary of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], summer 2005 in [[Gda\u0144sk]]]]\n\nThe Gda\u0144sk Agreement, an aftermath of the August 1980 strike, was an important milestone. It led to a national gathering of independent union representatives (Interfactory Organizing Committees, MKZ) on 17 September in Gda\u0144sk and the formation of the trade union \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" (Polish ''Solidarno\u015b\u0107''), founded on that day and led by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 22\u201323\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 85\u201393\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 250\u2013258\"/>{{Ref label|j|j|none}} The ideas of the independent union movement spread rapidly throughout Poland; Solidarity structures were formed in most places of employment and in all regions.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 268\u2013276\"/> Having been able to overcome the regime's efforts to thwart or derail its activities and status, Solidarity was finally registered in court as a national labor union in November.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 93\u201397\"/> Early in 1981, a network of union organizations at the enterprise-level was established; it included the country's main industrial complexes, such as the [[Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks|Lenin Steelworks]] in Krak\u00f3w and the [[Upper Silesia|Silesian]] mines.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 22\u201323\"/>\n\nInitially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political movement aiming at reconstruction of [[civil society]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 1\u20136\"/> Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 70\u201374\"/> In 1981, Solidarity accepted the necessity of assuming a political role and helped form a broad anti-[[real socialism|ruling system]] social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from [[Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej|people associated with the Catholic Church]] to non-communist leftists.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 22\u201323\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 75\u201379\"/> The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of [[nonviolent resistance]].<ref name=\"Wehr\"/> According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980\u201381 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 119\u2013120\"/> In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 125\u2013131\"/>{{Ref label|p|p|none}}\n\nThe activity of Solidarity, although concerned with trade union matters (such as replacing the [[nomenklatura]]-run system with worker self-management in enterprise-level decision making),{{Ref label|h|h|none}} was widely regarded as the first step towards dismantling the regime's dominance over social institutions, professional organizations and community associations.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/> Because of conditions specific to [[state socialism|state socialist]] society, Solidarity soon lost its labor focus and became a [[universalism|universalist]] movement that emphasized [[Civil and political rights|civic rights]] and [[open society]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 125\u2013131\"/> Removing the ruling formation or breaking the dependence on the Soviet Union was not on the agenda.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 40\u201341\"/> Using strikes and other tactics, the union sought to block government policies.<ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> The aims of the original, so-called First Solidarity (1980\u201381), were to reform socialism, not to introduce industrial private ownership or promote [[capitalism]] in general.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 268\u2013276\"/><ref name=\"Pyzik Poor but Sexy 30\u201331\"/> Solidarity was an egalitarian and collectivist movement.

They were formally recognized by the authorities only after strike actions conducted by activists of both movements in January 1981.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 362\"/>\n\nIn September 1980, in the aftermath of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> Like his predecessors, Kania made promises that the regime could not fulfill because the authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. The [[gross national income]] fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8%, and in 1981 by 15\u201320%.<ref name = \"Int Soc\"/>\n\nAt the communist summit in December 1980 in [[Moscow]], Kania argued with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] leaders, who pressed for an immediate military intervention in Poland. Kania and Minister of Defense [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] declared their determination to fight the \"counterrevolution\" in Poland on their own. In regard to Solidarity, as they saw it, there was still a chance for its healthy, working class current to prevail, not the KOR-instigated anti-socialist, troublemaking elements. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and President-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] made urgent phone calls to Brezhnev and the intervention was postponed.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/> In the meantime Solidarity, not quite aware of the looming danger, did its [[revolution]]ary work, practicing democracy in the union movement and pushing for sovereign society in a number of ways.<ref name=\"Solidarnosc tak bylo\"/> The autonomous labor unions, united under the Solidarity banner, strove to \"recapture public life from the monopoly control of the party\". On 16 December 1980, the [[Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970]] was officially unveiled in Gda\u0144sk in a ceremony that marked the high point in the ascent of Solidarity.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 100\u2013111\"/>\n\nAmong the mass protests that occurred at that time were the winter [[1981 general strike in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]], the [[1981 warning strike in Poland|nationwide warning strike]] in the spring of that year and [[Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland|hunger demonstrations]] in summer. The warning strike took place in the aftermath of the [[Bydgoszcz events]] (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention.<ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/> Wa\u0142\u0119sa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, but at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.<ref name=\"Dudek: 13 grudnia\"/>\n\nMinister Jaruzelski became also prime minister in February 1981. In June, the Soviet Central Committee pressured the Polish party for a leadership change, but Jaruzelski received strong support from the military members of the Polish Central Committee. The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR took place in July. Kania was reelected the party's first secretary, while the organization's internal reformers suffered a defeat.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nAs the economic situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuro\u0144 and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the ruling party of some of its burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 126\u2013133\"/>\n\nThe existence of Solidarity and the political liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy. Everyday life was becoming increasingly unbearable and the public displayed sentiments of extreme volatility. The hostility of the ''nomenklatura'' toward Solidarity was rapidly increasing.<ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nAt the State Defense Committee meeting on 13 September (the time of the Soviet [[Exercise Zapad-81]] maneuvers and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition of [[martial law]]. The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nIn September and October, the [[History of Solidarity|First Congress of Solidarity]] deliberated in Gda\u0144sk. Wa\u0142\u0119sa faced activist opposition and was barely elected chairman of the organization. The delegates passed a radical reform program in which the world \"social\" or \"socialized\" was repeated 150 times. The congress issued a provocative call for workers in other East European countries, urging them to follow in Solidarity's footsteps.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Stelmachowski 53\"/><ref name=\"Kapitalizm przegra\"/> Locally authorized, increasingly \"political\" strikes continued. They were characterized as \"[[Wildcat strike action|wildcats]]\" by Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who desperately tried to impose discipline from the center. He attempted to reach an accord with the state, meeting General Jaruzelski and Catholic Primate [[J\u00f3zef Glemp]] on 4 November. At the time of the regime's re-energized efforts to reduce Solidarity's role, the union had nearly ten million members \u2014 almost four times as many as the ruling party.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 137\u2013141\"/> Militant mood was displayed and unrealistic demands made at the meeting of the partially represented National Commission on 3 December, but the proceedings were wiretapped by the authorities, who then broadcast the (previously manipulated to their advantage) recordings.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 141\u2013146\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 320\u2013327\"/>\n\nThe government, not consulting Solidarity, adopted a plan of economic measures that could be implemented only by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 320\u2013327\"/> In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention.

The remaining 65% were to be reserved for candidates from the PZPR and its allies (the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]], the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] and the [[PAX Association]]). Since the Round Table Agreement mandated only reform (not replacement) of \"[[real socialism]]\" in Poland, the party thought of the election as a way of neutralizing political conflict and staying in power, while gaining some legitimacy to carry out economic reforms.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 205\u2013215\"/><ref name=\"DSM\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 375\u2013380\"/> However, the negotiated social policies, arrived at by economists and trade unionists during the Round Table talks, were quickly tossed out by both the party and the opposition.<ref name=\"Sutowski Okragly Stol\"/>\n\nA systemic transformation happening sooner rather than later was made possible by the [[1989 Polish legislative election|Polish legislative elections]] of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square protests]] in [[China]].

The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. On 19 July 1989 Jaruzelski barely won the vote in the [[Parliament of Poland#National Assembly|National Assembly]] [[1989 Polish presidential election|presidential election]], even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong.

On 1 August, prices were freed because of the ongoing market reforms and [[hyperinflation]] resulted. The instantly increased economic hardship caused a new wave of strikes. The strikes were spontaneous, but the Solidarity leaders, no longer in agreement with the strikers' economic demands, were able to emphasize the secondary political aspect of the strikes (anger at the party's obstinacy) and use them to pressure the regime for an expedited transfer of power.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 43\u201349\"/> The new prime minister, General Kiszczak, who was appointed on 2 August 1989, failed to gain enough support in the ''Sejm'' to form a government and resigned on 19 August. He was the last communist head of government in Poland. Although Jaruzelski tried to persuade Solidarity to join the PZPR in a \"grand coalition\", Wa\u0142\u0119sa refused.

These years, while featuring general [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] and many improvements in the [[standard of living]],{{Ref label|a1|a1|none}} were marred by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] terror, social unrest, political strife and severe economic difficulties.\n\nNear the end of World War II, the advancing Soviet [[Red Army]], along with the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East#Berling's Army: 1943\u20131945|pro-Soviet Polish Armed Forces]], pushed out the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] forces from [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]]. In February 1945, the [[Yalta Conference]] sanctioned the formation of a provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. [[Joseph Stalin]], the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] was formed in [[Warsaw]] by ignoring the [[Polish government-in-exile]] based in [[London]] since 1940.\n\nDuring the subsequent [[Potsdam Conference]] in July\u2013August 1945, the three major [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] and [[Curzon Line]]. Following the destruction of the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] population in [[The Holocaust in Poland|the Holocaust]], the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|flight and expulsion of Germans]] in the west, [[Operation Vistula|resettlement of Ukrainians]] in the east, and the [[Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)|repatriation of Poles]] from [[Kresy]], [[Poland]] became for the first time in its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government [[1947 Polish legislative election|solidified its political power]] over the next two years, while the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) under [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar [[Soviet Empire|Soviet sphere of influence]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] was promulgated in July 1952 and the state officially became the [[Polish People's Republic]] (PRL).\n\nFollowing Stalin's death in 1953, a political [[Khrushchev Thaw|\"thaw\" in the Soviet sphere]] allowed a more liberal faction of the [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]], led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], to [[Polish October|gain power]]. By the mid-1960s, Poland began experiencing increasing economic as well as political difficulties. They culminated in the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] and the [[1970 Polish protests]], when a consumer price hike led to a wave of strikes. The government introduced a new economic program based on large-scale borrowing from the West, which resulted in a rise in living standards and expectations, but the program meant growing integration of Poland's economy with the [[world economy]] and it faltered after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In 1976, the government of [[Edward Gierek]] was forced to raise prices again and this led to the [[June 1976 protests]].\n\nThis cycle of repression and reform{{Ref label|b|b|none}} and the economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojty\u0142a as [[Pope John Paul II]]. Wojty\u0142a's unexpected elevation strengthened the opposition to the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and ineffective system of ''[[nomenklatura]]''-run [[state socialism]], especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent [[trade union]] \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') led by electrician [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to declare [[martial law in Poland|martial law]] in December 1981. However, with the reforms of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989 [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Talks]] led to Solidarity's participation in the [[1989 Polish legislative election|1989 election]]. Its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the [[Revolutions of 1989|succession of transitions]] from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned from the presidency of the Republic of Poland; following the [[1990 Polish presidential election|presidential election]], he was succeeded by Wa\u0142\u0119sa.\n\n==Establishment of communist-ruled Poland (1944\u201348)==\n\n===Wartime devastation, border and population shifts, rebuilding of infrastructure and economy===\n\n[[File:Map of Poland (1945).png|left|thumb|Poland's [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|old and new borders in 1945]]]]\n\nBefore [[World War II]], a third of Poland's population was composed of [[Ethnic minorities in Poland|ethnic minorities]].

In reality it was not finished until mid-August, after the Polish communist [[Union of Polish Patriots|Moscow group]] was joined by the late-arriving [[Polish Workers' Party|Warsaw group]], led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut|Bierut]].<ref name=\"GP 414\"/>]]\n\nAfter the prewar [[Communist Party of Poland]] was eliminated in [[Great Purge|Stalin's purges]] in 1938 (some five thousand Polish communists were brought to [[Russia]] and killed), a group of survivors led by [[Marceli Nowotko]], [[Boles\u0142aw Mo\u0142ojec]] and [[Pawe\u0142 Finder]] convinced in 1941 the Soviets in Moscow of the need to reestablish a Polish party. The conspiratorial core of the new Polish Workers' Party was assembled in Warsaw in January 1942, and after the deaths or arrests of the above leaders there, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] emerged as the PPR's first secretary by the end of 1943. Gomu\u0142ka was a dedicated communist in the national tradition of the Polish [[left-wing politics|leftist]] movement. He loathed the Soviet practices he experienced while being trained in Russia and [[Ukraine]] in the 1930s, but was convinced of the historic necessity of alliance with the Soviet Union. He may have survived the purges because of being imprisoned in Poland for illegal labor-organizing activities in 1938\u201339. Throughout the [[German-occupied Europe|German occupation]], Gomu\u0142ka remained in Poland and was not a part of the circle organized in the Soviet Union around the [[Union of Polish Patriots]] by Stalin and [[Wanda Wasilewska]]. In Polish society of 1945, Gomu\u0142ka's party was marginally small in comparison to other political groups.<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/>\n\nWith the liberation of Polish territories and the failure of the [[Home Army]]'s [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944, control over what was to become post-war Poland passed from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany to the Red Army, and from the Red Army to [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]], who formed the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (''Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego'', PKWN), an early government, in existence from late July 1944 in [[Lublin]]. The Polish communists became the most influential Polish factor in the politics of emerging Poland,<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> despite having initially minuscule popular support.<ref name=\"Gibianskii\"/> The PKWN recognized the legal continuity of the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]], as opposed to the [[April Constitution of Poland|April Constitution]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Szel\u0105g 11\u201312\"/> On 6 September 1944, the PKWN issued its momentous [[land reform]] decree, the consequences of which would fundamentally alter the antiquated social and economic structure of the country. Over one million peasant families benefited from parcellation of the [[folwark|larger estates]].<ref name=\"GP 417, 424\"/>\n\nThe communists, favored by the Yalta decisions, enjoyed the advantages of Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe firmly under the influence of the Soviet Union; they exercised control over crucial government departments, such as the security services (security was in the hands of the Soviet [[NKVD]] until its Polish counterparts were developed).<ref name=\"GP 414\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the [[populism|populist]] program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's [[Government Delegation for Poland|delegation]] was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its [[Polish Underground State|political-military organizations]] became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the [[PKWN Manifesto]] and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support.<ref name=\"Od rz\u0105du do nierz\u0105du\"/> Beyond the land reform, the PKWN Manifesto foresaw no further radical ownership changes and [[nationalization]] of industry was not mentioned. On the contrary, business property was supposed to return to its owners as the economic relations become properly regulated.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 97\"/> From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established [[workers' council]]s, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/>\n\nThe PKWN was reshaped into the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland]] (''Rz\u0105d Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'', RTRP), which functioned from January 1945.<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> This government was headed by [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], a [[Polish Socialist Party|socialist]], but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees such as [[Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski]], held a majority of key posts.<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/> In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited the possibilities of future Western or [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] impact or internal cooperation with non-communist political forces in Poland.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"GP 416\"/> The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the [[State National Council]] (''Krajowa Rada Narodowa'', KRN), formed by Gomu\u0142ka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'', RJN).\n\n[[File:zapluty karzel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Postwar Polish communist propaganda poster depicting \"The giant and the putrid reactionary midget\", meaning the communist [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]] soldier and the pro-Western [[Home Army]] soldier, respectively]]\n\nThe Yalta agreement stipulated a governmental union in Poland of \"all democratic and anti-Nazi elements\". Prime Minister [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] of the Polish government-in-exile resigned his post in November 1944 and having accepted the Yalta terms went to Moscow, where he negotiated with [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] the shape of a \"national unity\" government\".

The government was \"provisional\" and the [[Potsdam Conference]] soon declared that before a regular government is created, free elections must be held and a permanent constitutional system established.<ref name=\"GP 417\"/>\n\nThe communists' principal rivals were [[Freedom and Independence|veteran activists]] of the [[Polish Underground State]], Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|Polish People's Party]] (''Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe'', PSL), and veterans of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]]. Of particular practical importance was Miko\u0142ajczyk's People's Party (originally a peasant formation), because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> Miko\u0142ajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, would be allowed to act as a bridge between the East and the West.<ref name=\"Kochanski 569\u2013577\"/>\n\nSoviet-oriented parties, backed by the Soviet Red Army and in control of the security forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Gomu\u0142ka and Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated at the time of the PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918\u20131945 619\"/>\n\nAs a show of Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish anti-Nazi underground]] were brought to [[Trial of the Sixteen|trial in Moscow]] in June 1945.<ref name=\"Kemp-Welch 8\"/> Their removal from the political scene precluded the possibility of a democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements.<ref name=\"GP 415\"/> The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest.

However, the Polish communists, led by Gomu\u0142ka and Bierut, while having no intention of giving up power, were also aware of the limited support they enjoyed among the general population. To circumvent this difficulty, in 1946 a national plebiscite, known as the [[1946 Polish people's referendum|\"Three Times Yes\" referendum]] (''Trzy razy tak''), was held first, before the parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Poland-7306\">[http://countrystudies.us/poland/16.htm  Consolidation of Communist Power.] ''Countrystudies.us/Poland.'' Retrieved 27 November 2011.</ref> The referendum comprised three fairly general, but politically charged questions about the Senate, national industries and western borders. It was meant to check and promote the popularity of communist initiatives in Poland. Since most of the important parties at the time were leftist or centrist \u2013 and could have easily approved all three options \u2013 Miko\u0142ajczyk's Polish People's Party (PSL) decided, not to be seen as merging into the government bloc, to ask its supporters to oppose the first one: the abolition of the Senate.<ref name=\"GP 424\"/> The communists voted \"Three Times Yes\". The partial results, reconstructed by the PSL, showed that the communist side was met with little support on the first question. However, after a campaign marked by electoral fraud and intimidation the communists claimed large majorities on all three questions,<ref name=\"Encyklopedia_WIEM\"/><ref name=\"GP 424\"/> which led to the [[nationalization]] of industry and state control of economic activity in general, and a unicameral national parliament (''[[Sejm]]'').<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe communists consolidated power by gradually whittling away the rights of their non-communist foes, particularly by suppressing the leading opposition party \u2013 Miko\u0142ajczyk's PSL.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> In some widely publicized cases, the perceived enemies were sentenced to death on trumped up charges \u2014 among them [[Witold Pilecki]], the organizer of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] resistance. Leaders of the Home Army and of the Council of National Unity were persecuted. Many resistance fighters were murdered extrajudicially or forced to exile.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 272\u2013274\"/> The opposition members were also harassed by administrative means. Although the ongoing persecution of the former anti-Nazi and [[National Armed Forces|right-wing organizations]] by state security kept [[cursed soldiers|some partisans]] in the forests, the actions of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] (known as the UB, Department of Security), NKVD and the Red Army steadily diminished their numbers. The [[National Military Union|right-wing insurgency]] radically decreased after the amnesty of July 1945<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 70\"/> and faded after the [[Amnesty of 1947|amnesty of February 1947]].<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski Zdobycie w\u0142adzy\"/><ref name=\"Daszczy\u0144ski Po wojnie\"/>\n\nBy 1946, all rightist parties had been outlawed,<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> and a new pro-government [[Front of National Unity|Democratic Bloc]] was formed in 1947 which included only the Polish Workers' Party and its leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the [[1947 Polish legislative election|first parliamentary elections]] took place featuring primarily the PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party. However, the PSL's strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Election results were adjusted by Stalin to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords.<ref name=\"GP 426\"/> The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> After the referendum dress rehearsal, this time the vote fraud was much better concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, an NKVD colonel charged with election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new ''Sejm'', out of 444 seats, 27 were given to the [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|Polish People's Party]] of [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]].<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 91\u201395, 102\"/> He, having declared the results to be falsified, was threatened with arrest or worse and fled the country in October 1947, helped by the [[United States|US]] Embassy; other opposition leaders also left.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 91\u201395, 102\"/> In February, the new ''Sejm'' created the [[Small Constitution of 1947]].

The [[socialism|socialists]]' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss the idea of a party merger. The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin]], increasingly uncomfortable with Gomu\u0142ka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972).<ref name=\"GP 426-427\"/> In December 1948, after the removal of Gomu\u0142ka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief,<ref name=\"GP 428-430\"/> the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza'', PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]] and a [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/> Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) that had split from Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|PSL]] and was meant to represent rural communities, and the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] (SD), a token [[intelligentsia]] party (see also: [[List of political parties in Poland]]).<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/>\n\nAs the period of [[Sovietization]] and [[Stalinism]] began, the PZPR was anything but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with the PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomu\u0142ka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction.<ref name=\"GP 428-430\"/> The PZPR became divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], the official ideology, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, including those of the [[Sanation]], the [[National Democracy]], and 19th century traditions of cooperation with the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning powers]].<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/>\n\nWith Poland being a member of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]], the party's pursuits of power and reform were permanently hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction).<ref name=\"GP 411-413\"/> Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.<ref name=\"GP 431\"/>\n\nThe ''[[nomenklatura]]'' political elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within the ruling party structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. ''Nomenklatura'' members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management, or education. For the party, the privileged ''nomenklatura'' layer was maintained to assure the proper placement of people who were ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] dissidents [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/> The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted ''nomenklatura'' and the security services were resented.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 66\u201367\"/>\n\n==Stalinist era (1948\u201356)==\n\n{{Redirect|Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism in general|Stalinism|the state-sanctioned art of the period|Socialist realism in Poland}}\n\n[[File:Proces Pileckiego 1948-2.jpg|thumb|The [[show trial]] of Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], sentenced to death and executed May 1948]]\n\n===Removal of Gomu\u0142ka, Stalinist repressions===\n\nAs in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, there was a Soviet-style political purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of \"nationalist\" or other \"[[Deviationism|deviationist]]\" tendencies.<ref name=\"KJL\"/> The half-hearted in Poland campaign included the arrests and imprisonments of [[Marian Spychalski]] from May 1950, and [[Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski]] five months after Stalin's death.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 170\u2013171\"/> In September 1948 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together with a group of communist leaders who like Gomu\u0142ka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from [[Leninism]], and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary.<ref name=\"KJL\"/><ref name=\"Stola Anti-Zionist Campaign\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, accused of \"right-wing nationalist deviations\", had indeed emphasized the [[Polish Socialist Party|Polish socialist]] traditions and severely criticized [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL) party for belittling Polish national aspirations.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 38\u201349\"/> More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomu\u0142ka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 115\u2013116\"/> Following Boles\u0142aw Bierut's order, he was arrested by the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by [[Roman Romkowski]] and [[Anatol Fejgin]], as demanded by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 79\u201381\"/> Gomu\u0142ka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, [[Jakub Berman]], and other Stalin's associates.<ref name=\"LIFE\"/><ref name=\"Hodos-151\">George H.

The program of free and compulsory school education for all and the establishment of free institutions of higher learning received much support. The communists screened out what facts and interpretations were to be taught; history and other sciences had to follow Marxist views approved by [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|ideological censorship]].<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> During 1951\u201353, a large number of prewar professors who were perceived by the regime as reactionary was dismissed from universities. Government control over art and artists deepened. The Soviet-style [[socialist realism]] became the only formula accepted by the authorities after 1949. Most works of art and literature represented [[Propaganda in the Polish People's Republic|propaganda of the party]] or had to be in line with its views. (See also: [[Socialist realism in Poland]])\n\nThe reforms often brought relief for a significant part of the population. After World War II many people were willing to accept communist rule in exchange for the restoration of relatively normal life; hundreds of thousands joined the communist party and actively supported the regime. Nonetheless, latent popular discontent remained present and many Poles adopted the attitude of \"resigned cooperation\". Others, like the [[Freedom and Independence]] organization that originated from elements of the Home Army and especially the [[National Armed Forces]] actively opposed the communists, hoping for a [[World War III]] that would liberate Poland. Most [[cursed soldiers|people who took up arms against the communist regime]] had surrendered during the amnesties of 1945 and [[amnesty of 1947|1947]], but brutal repressions by the secret police continued and some fought well into the 1950s.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/><ref name=\"Piotrowski-88-90\"/>{{Ref label|d|d|none}}\n\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]], Primate of Poland]]\n\nThe communists further alienated many Poles by persecuting the [[Catholic Church in Poland|Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The [[PAX Association]] created in 1947 and led by the former prewar [[National Radical Camp|far-right]] activist [[Boles\u0142aw Piasecki]], attempted to divide the Catholic movement and promote a communist rule-friendly, [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] church.<ref name=\"GP 435\"/> The PAX did not get very far in molding the Catholic public opinion, but published numerous books and officially approved daily Catholic press.

But the recommended economic improvements, despite the self-restraint of the authors, were not compatible with the obligatory at that time heavy-handed centralized economic command system, and the reform effort fizzled out.<ref name=\"Reforma nie zacz\u0119\u0142a\"/>\n\nIn October 1957, Poland's Foreign Minister [[Adam Rapacki]] proposed a European [[Rapacki Plan|nuclear-free zone]] that would include the territories of Poland, [[West Germany]], [[East Germany]] and [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"GP 441\"/> In August 1961, the new [[Berlin Wall]] cemented the division of Europe.\n\nDuring 1948\u201371, the Polish government signed [[Indemnity|indemnification]] agreements with a number of [[Western Europe|West European]] countries (excluding those considered allies of [[Nazi Germany]]), [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The agreements dealt with compensation for the losses incurred by citizens and firms of the countries involved as a result of war events and the subsequent [[nationalization]]. The agreement with the U.S. followed the visit to Poland of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1959 and his talks with Gomu\u0142ka. It was signed in 1960 and the agreed amount had been paid by the Polish government in twenty installments. The U.S. government thereby assumed responsibility for indemnities resulting from claims filed by U.S. citizens.<ref name=\"Polsko nie daj sie\"/>\n\nAfter the first wave of reform, Gomu\u0142ka's regime started to move back on their promises. Control over mass media and universities was gradually tightened, and many of the younger and more reformist members of the party were forced out (over 200,000 purged already in 1958, when the PZPR undertook a \"verification\" of its membership).<ref name=\"Werblan Szkice 149\u2013150\"/> The reform-promising Gomu\u0142ka of 1956 turned into the authoritarian Gomu\u0142ka of the 1960s. Although Poland enjoyed a period of relative stability in that decade, the idealism of the \"Polish October\" faded away.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The decisions made at the XIII Plenum of the Central Committee, held in 1963, meant a definite end of the post-October liberalization period. The demise of Gomu\u0142ka's tactical allies, the ''Pu\u0142awy'' faction, gradually replaced by Gomu\u0142ka's own people, was apparent when [[Roman Zambrowski]], the leading Jewish politician, was removed from the Politburo.<ref name=\"Stola 13\u201327\"/>\n\nPoland under Gomu\u0142ka's rule was generally considered one of the more liberal [[communist state]]s. However, Poles could still go to prison for writing [[political satire]] about the party leader, as [[Janusz Szpota\u0144ski]] did,<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 337\"/> or for publishing a book abroad. A March 1964 \"Letter of the 34\", signed by leading intellectuals and delivered to the office of Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, criticized the worsening censorship and demanded a more open cultural policy, as guaranteed by the constitution.<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski Najs\u0142ynniejszy list Peerelu\"/> [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] were expelled from the party and from 1965 imprisoned for written criticism (an \"Open Letter to the Party\") of the party rule and pointing out the contradictory nature of the supposedly workers' state.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 305\u2013306\"/> Kuro\u0144 and Modzelewski accused the regime of betraying the revolutionary cause; like many younger Polish reformers, they spoke from [[New Left|leftist positions]] and were ideologically closely aligned with Western radicals of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 1\u20136\"/>\n\nAs the regime was getting less liberal and more repressive, Gomu\u0142ka's popularity declined as his initial vision lost its impetus.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Many Poles found Gomu\u0142ka's self-righteous attitude irritating and his demeanor provincial. He reacted to increasing criticism by refusing to budge and insulating himself with the help of cronies, of whom [[Zenon Kliszko]] was the most influential. Within the party, Minister of the Interior [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]] and his nationalist-communist faction known as \"the Partisans\" (together with ''Moczarowcy'', the much broader system of Moczar's political clientele) were looking for an opportunity to assert their dominance.<ref name=\"Stola Anti-Zionist Campaign\"/><ref name=\"Stola 13\u201327\"/><ref name=\"GP 441-442\"/>\n\n[[File:Polski Fiat 125p.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Polski Fiat 125p]], produced in Poland from the late 1960s, was based on technology purchased from [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]]]]\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Poland was starting to experience economic difficulties and the appreciable thus far standard of living improvements were showing signs of stagnation (during 1960\u201370 real wages for workers grew only by an average of 1.8% per year). The postwar [[Business cycle|economic boom]] was ending and the increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] and integrated [[world economy]] was becoming inhospitable to national developments operating behind trade barriers.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/><ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 12\u201313\"/> Like the other communist states, Poland was spending too much on heavy industry, armaments and prestige projects and too little on consumer production. The failure of Soviet-style collectivization returned the collectivized land to the peasants,<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> but most of their farms were too small to be prosperous and  productivity in agriculture remained low. Economic relations with West Germany were frozen due to East German interference and resistance to economic integration. Gomu\u0142ka attributed the signs of economic decline to faulty implementation of the fundamentally correct directions issued by central organs of the party. He failed to appreciate the corrective role of the [[Market (economics)|market]], whose [[feedback]] could not be replaced by theoretical computations, planning and administrative decisions.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 236\u2013238\"/> On the other hand, pursuing conservative investment rather than consumption oriented economic policies, his government generated no foreign debt.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 224\"/>\n\nFrom 1960, the regime increasingly implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and measures that made carrying out religious practices more difficult.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 227\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, according to Andrzej Leder, was the last Polish politician who seriously tried to realize an [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] program, a staple leftist undertaking.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 185\u2013187\"/> In 1965, the [[Episcopal Conference of Poland|Conference of Polish Bishops]] issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]].<ref name=\"Stelmachowski 33\"/> In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the [[Christianization of Poland]] led by the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]], Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] and other bishops who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the [[Catholic Church in Poland]].<ref name=\"GP I 15-17\"/> In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing the origin of Polish statehood,<ref name=\"GP I 15-17\"/> but the display of the Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic [[prelate]]s in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and elsewhere.

Poland's security chief Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar, a wartime communist partisan commander, based his appeal on nationalistic rhetoric combined with anti-intelligentsia and anti-Jewish sentiments and became the chief challenger.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> The party leader in [[Upper Silesia]], [[Edward Gierek]], who had become involved with the communist movement as a teenage mining industry laborer in France,<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/> also emerged as a possible alternative leader. Gierek was favored by the more pragmatic and technocratic members of the ''[[nomenklatura]]''.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 268\u2013272\"/> From January 1968, Polish revisionist opposition and other circles were strongly influenced by the developing movement of the [[Prague Spring]].<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 232\"/>\n\nIn March 1968, student demonstrations at the [[University of Warsaw]] broke out in the wake of the government's ban on further performance of the play ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] (written in 1824) at the [[National Theatre, Warsaw|National Theatre in Warsaw]],<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski March 68\"/> because of its alleged \"anti-Soviet references\".

Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/> The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomu\u0142ka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which gave Gomu\u0142ka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power early in his term.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 282\"/>\n\nThe revisionist dissident prominence in the 1968 events overshadowed the equally significant awakening taking place among the working class of Poland. [[Gda\u0144sk]], where thousands of students and workers fought the police on March 15, had the highest in the country rate of administrative detentions and court cases.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 342\"/> The greatest proportion of people arrested and imprisoned in March and April 1968 in Poland were classified by the authorities as \"workers\".<ref name=Friszke/>\n\nAn internal attempt was made to discredit Gomu\u0142ka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and tolerated. In the meantime, irreversible damage to society had been wrecked by the Moczar movement. Gomu\u0142ka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], was preoccupied with the [[Prague Spring|crisis in Czechoslovakia]] and not inclined to support personnel changes in the Polish leadership.<ref name=\"GP 442-443\"/>\n\nIn August 1968, the [[Polish People's Army]] took part in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Some Polish intellectuals protested, and [[Ryszard Siwiec]] burned himself alive during celebrations of an official holiday.

Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the \"fraternal course\".<ref name=\"GP 442-443\"/>\n\n===Treaty with West Germany, food riots and the ousting of Gomu\u0142ka===\n\n[[File:Polish 1970 protests - Zbyszek Godlewski body.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstrators in [[Gdynia]] carry the body of [[Janek Wi\u015bniewski|Zbigniew Godlewski]], who was shot and killed during the [[1970 Polish protests|protests of 1970]]]]\n\nIn December 1970, Gomu\u0142ka's government scored a major political success when Poland obtained recognition by [[West Germany]] of [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|post-World War II borders]].<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> In the negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]], the German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for residents of Poland of German identity and the ability to help financially those who stayed in Poland by granting pensions. Hundreds of thousands eventually became affected.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/> [[Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013present)|German Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]], who signed the agreement, used the occasion to ask on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (''[[Kniefall von Warschau]]''). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was made at the site of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church leaders issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]], criticized then by the Polish government.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka felt proud and secure after the treaty with West Germany, his milestone political achievement. It signified a lasting trend in Poland's international policy: extricating the country from the disproportional dependence on Russia and compensating the security vulnerability by building good relations with Germany.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/><ref name=\"GP 444-445\"/>\n\nBut the event could not mask the economic crisis into which Poland was drifting. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 the regime unexpectedly announced substantial increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The new measures were incomprehensible to many workers, and their unfortunate timing (before Christmas, the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomu\u0142ka's fall from power.\n\nOn 14\u201319 December 1970, [[1970 Polish protests|mass demonstrations]] against the price rises broke out in the northern ([[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast) cities of [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Gdynia]], [[Elbl\u0105g]] and [[Szczecin]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including headquarters of the party in Gda\u0144sk and Szczecin.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/> The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomu\u0142ka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, however, was determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/> Among the party leaders who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gda\u0144sk, were [[Zenon Kliszko]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Kocio\u0142ek]]. In Gdynia, soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. Possibly about fifty people were killed in the coastal region in December.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/><ref name=\"Kemp-Welch 180\u2013188\"/>\n\nThe protest movement spread to other cities, leading to more strikes and causing angry workers to occupy many factories. The general strike across Poland was scheduled for 21 December 1970.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/>\n\nThe party leadership meeting in Warsaw on 20 December recognized the danger that the working class revolt presented to their system. In consultations with the disturbed Soviet leaders, they proceeded with arranging the resignation of Gomu\u0142ka, who was by then stressed out and ill.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/> Several of his collaborators were also removed. [[Edward Gierek]] was drafted as the new first secretary. [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]], another strong contender, was not trusted and even blamed for the current debacle by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/>\n\nAnother strike in Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. Gierek gambled that his personal appearances would resolve the crisis. He went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gda\u0144sk the next day, met the workers, apologized for the past mistakes and assured them that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Participants of the Szczecin strike demanded freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek consented, but in reality the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing labor structures and their places of employment. The February [[1971 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a strikes]] followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes promised.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 209\u2013211\"/><ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 258\u2013259\"/>\n\nThe Polish opposition movement, traditionally led by the intelligentsia, after the two heavy blows of 1968 and 1970 was in disarray and silent. The revisionists' tenuous connection with the communist party was permanently broken, but a new strategy had not yet emerged.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/> However, already in 1971 [[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] published in the \u00e9migr\u00e9 ''[[Kultura]]'' journal a seminal article entitled ''Theses on Hope and Hopelessness''. It put forward a concept of civil democratizing resistance movement that would be valid even in the repressed and seemingly deadlocked [[state socialism|state socialist]] society.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 58\u201364\"/>\n\n==Gierek decade (1970\u201380)==\n\n===Catching up with the West===\n\n[[File:Edward Gierek 1980b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Gierek]]]]\n\nGierek, like Gomu\u0142ka in 1956, came to power on a raft of promises that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and those responsible for the violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He proceeded to create a new economic program, based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West, to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek years, was intended to be used for equipment and modernization of Polish industry, and for import of [[consumer goods]] to give the workers more incentive to work.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 258\u2013259\"/>\n\nFor the next few years, the regime optimistically engaged in reform and experimentation and for the first time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other luxury items. Attention was paid to the wages workers received. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. Censorship was eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were improved. The relative cultural and political relaxation resulted in a better [[freedom of speech]] environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly ''[[Polityka]]''. The massive investments and purchases of Western technology were expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/> The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/>\n\nThis \"New Development Strategy\", based on import-led growth,<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> depended on the global economic conditions and the program faltered suddenly because of worldwide recession and increased oil prices.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> The effects of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973\u201374 oil crisis]] produced an inflationary surge followed by a recession in the West, which resulted in a sharp increase in the price of imported consumer goods in Poland, coupled with a decline in demand for Polish exports, particularly [[coal]]. Poland's [[external debt|foreign debt]], absent at the time of Gomu\u0142ka's departure,<ref name=\"Prazmowska Gomulka grozil\"/> rose rapidly under Gierek to reach a multibillion-dollar figure. Continuing borrowing from the West had become increasingly difficult. Consumer goods began to disappear from Polish shops. The new factories built by Gierek's regime proved to be largely ineffective and mismanaged, as the basics of market [[demand]] and [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]] were often ignored.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The significant internal economic reform, promised by the Gierek team, had not materialized.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 55\u201358\"/>\n\nThe Western credits thus helped spur industrial growth and helped Gierek's policy of [[consumerism]], but just for a few years. The industrial production grew by an average of 10% per year between 1971 and 1975 (the years remembered later by many older Poles as most prosperous, considering not only the communist period in Poland), only to dwindle to less than 2% in 1979. [[Government debt|Debt servicing]] that took 12% of export earnings in 1971, rose to 75% in 1979.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 286\"/>\n\nIn 1975, like other European countries, Poland became a signatory of the [[Helsinki Accords]] and member of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE); such developments were possible because of the period of \"[[d\u00e9tente]]\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. Despite the regime's promises that the freedoms listed in the agreement would be implemented in Poland, there was little change. However, the Poles were becoming more aware of the rights they were being denied and emboldened by the knowledge of their government's treaty obligations.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/>\n\nGierek government's growing difficulties led also to increased dependence on the Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomu\u0142ka's rule. The [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|constitution]], amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after [[Letter of 59|protests by intellectuals]] and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/><ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 405\u2013407\"/>\n\nNevertheless, the regime of Gierek deemphasized the Marxist ideology and from his time the \"communist\" governments of Poland concentrated on pragmatic issues and current concerns.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 67\u201370\"/> In Polish economic politics new lasting trends were initiated, such as the emphasis on individual initiative, personal aspirations and competition, which some interpreted as an attack on [[egalitarianism]] (social inequalities were indeed increasing). Sections of the [[intelligentsia]], ''[[nomenklatura]]'' and [[small business]] gave rise to the emerging [[middle class]]. The new \"socialist\" ways were less totalitarian, stressed innovation, modern management methods and engaged workers, all seen as necessary to push the outdated economy past the constant crisis stage. Poland of the 1970s became more open to the world and entered the [[World economy|global economy]], which permanently changed society, creating at the same time a new type of crisis vulnerability. The opposition thinking, its promotion of society formed by active individuals, developed along complementary concepts.<ref name=\"Jak narod nie obalil komuny\"/><ref name=\"Gawin Michnik\"/>\n\n===Renewal of social unrest and the rise of organized opposition===\n\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Queue area|Queue line]], a frequent scene at times of [[shortage economy|shortages]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]] in the 1970s and 1980s]]\n\nAs a result of the 1970 worker rebellion food prices remained frozen and were artificially low. The demand for food products exceeded the supply also because of the higher real wages, which already in the first two years of Gierek's government increased more than during the entire decade of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Dudek Wzlot i upadek\"/> In June 1976, in an attempt to reduce consumption,<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> the government introduced a long-announced and several times delayed, but radical price increase: basic foodstuffs had their prices raised by an average of 60%, three times the rate of Gomu\u0142ka'a increases from six years before. The compensatory wage rises were skewed toward the better-off part of the population.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/>{{Ref label|w|w|none}} The result was an immediate [[June 1976 protests|nationwide wave of strikes]], with violent demonstrations, looting and other labor unrest at the [[Ursus Factory]] near Warsaw, in [[Radom]], [[P\u0142ock]] and other places.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 119\u2013120\"/> The government quickly backed down and repealed the price rises, but the strike leaders were arrested and put on trial.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> A series of \"spontaneous\" large scale public gatherings, intended to convey the \"anger of the people\" at the \"trouble-makers\" was staged by the party leadership in a number of cities, but the Soviet pressure prevented further attempts at raising prices. Gierek's cordial in the past relations with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were now seriously damaged. Food [[Ration stamp|ration cards]], introduced because of the destabilized market in August 1976, were to remain a feature of life in Poland for the duration of the People's Republic.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/> The regime's retreat, having occurred for the second time in several years, amounted to an unprecedented defeat. Within the rigid political system, the government was neither able to reform (it would lose control and power) nor to satisfy society's staple needs, because it had to sell abroad all it could to make foreign debt and interests payments.

Cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a, the [[archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]], was elected [[pope]] at the Vatican, taking the name [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. The election of a Polish pope had an electrifying effect on what was at that time one of the last idiosyncratically Catholic countries in Europe.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> When John Paul toured Poland in June 1979, half a million people came to welcome him in Warsaw; in the next eight days, about ten million Poles attended the many outdoor [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] he celebrated.<ref name=\"TVN-1\"/> John Paul clearly became the most important person in Poland, leaving the regime not so much opposed as ignored. Rather than calling for rebellion, John Paul encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next crisis came, the nation would present a united front.<ref name=\"Weigel-Pope\"/><ref name=\"Weigel-Witness\"/>\n\n===Polish emigration===\n\nThe [[Polish government-in-exile]] in [[London]], unrecognized since the end of World War II, ridiculed by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance. Under President [[Edward Bernard Raczy\u0144ski]] it overcame years of internal squabbles, and after the election of the Polish pope, at the time of the increasingly assertive Polish opposition, improved its image and standing.<ref name=\"GP 481\"/>\n\nThe large Polish emigrant communities in North America, Western Europe and elsewhere were politically active and lent significant support to those struggling in the country. The staunchly anti-communist American ''[[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]'' and other Poles felt grateful for the leadership of President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Of the Polish institutions in the West the most important were the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], whose Polish section was run by [[Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]], and the monthly literary ''[[Kultura]]'' magazine in [[Paris]], led by [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Juliusz Mieroszewski]].<ref name=\"GP 481\"/>\n\n==Final decade of the Polish People's Republic (1980\u201389)==\n\n===Failing economy and labor unrest===\n\nBy 1980, the authorities had no choice but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic level, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western [[Financial institution|financial companies and institutions]] providing loans to the regime at a meeting at the [[Bank Handlowy]] in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that the state could no longer subsidize artificially low prices of consumer goods.<ref name=\"gnauck7\"/> The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat.

Among the leaders of the strike were [[Anna Walentynowicz]] and [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of [[21 demands of MKS|21 demands]] was formulated by the [[Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee]] on 17 August.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 239\u2013240\"/> The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With the assistance of activists from the [[Workers' Defence Committee|KOR]] and support of many other intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations),<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 242\"/> the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of [[trade union]]s independent of government control.<ref name=\"Int Soc\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 79\u201381\"/> Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 22\u201323\"/>\n\nThe party leadership was faced with a choice between repressions on a massive scale and an amicable agreement that would give the workers what they wanted and thus quieten the aroused population.<ref name=\"GP 482-491\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 81\u201385\"/> They chose the latter. On 31 August Wa\u0142\u0119sa signed the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]] with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Jagielski]], a member of the party [[Politburo]].<ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> The agreement acknowledged the right of employees to associate in free trade unions, obliged the government to take steps to eliminate censorship, abolished weekend work, increased the [[minimum wage]], improved and extended welfare and pensions and increased autonomy of industrial enterprises, where a meaningful role was to be played by [[workers' self-management]] councils.

In addition to the Gda\u0144sk Agreement, similar documents were signed at other centers of strike activity: in Szczecin (the [[Szczecin Agreement]]), [[Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j strikes|Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j]], and at [[Katowice Steelworks]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 85\u201393\"/>\n\n===Solidarity===\n\n[[File:Astilleros de Gdansk.jpg|thumb|right|300px|25th anniversary of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], summer 2005 in [[Gda\u0144sk]]]]\n\nThe Gda\u0144sk Agreement, an aftermath of the August 1980 strike, was an important milestone. It led to a national gathering of independent union representatives (Interfactory Organizing Committees, MKZ) on 17 September in Gda\u0144sk and the formation of the trade union \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" (Polish ''Solidarno\u015b\u0107''), founded on that day and led by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 22\u201323\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 85\u201393\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 250\u2013258\"/>{{Ref label|j|j|none}} The ideas of the independent union movement spread rapidly throughout Poland; Solidarity structures were formed in most places of employment and in all regions.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 268\u2013276\"/> Having been able to overcome the regime's efforts to thwart or derail its activities and status, Solidarity was finally registered in court as a national labor union in November.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 93\u201397\"/> Early in 1981, a network of union organizations at the enterprise-level was established; it included the country's main industrial complexes, such as the [[Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks|Lenin Steelworks]] in Krak\u00f3w and the [[Upper Silesia|Silesian]] mines.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 22\u201323\"/>\n\nInitially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political movement aiming at reconstruction of [[civil society]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 1\u20136\"/> Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 70\u201374\"/> In 1981, Solidarity accepted the necessity of assuming a political role and helped form a broad anti-[[real socialism|ruling system]] social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from [[Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej|people associated with the Catholic Church]] to non-communist leftists.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 22\u201323\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 75\u201379\"/> The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of [[nonviolent resistance]].<ref name=\"Wehr\"/> According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980\u201381 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 119\u2013120\"/> In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 125\u2013131\"/>{{Ref label|p|p|none}}\n\nThe activity of Solidarity, although concerned with trade union matters (such as replacing the [[nomenklatura]]-run system with worker self-management in enterprise-level decision making),{{Ref label|h|h|none}} was widely regarded as the first step towards dismantling the regime's dominance over social institutions, professional organizations and community associations.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/> Because of conditions specific to [[state socialism|state socialist]] society, Solidarity soon lost its labor focus and became a [[universalism|universalist]] movement that emphasized [[Civil and political rights|civic rights]] and [[open society]].<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 125\u2013131\"/> Removing the ruling formation or breaking the dependence on the Soviet Union was not on the agenda.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 40\u201341\"/> Using strikes and other tactics, the union sought to block government policies.<ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> The aims of the original, so-called First Solidarity (1980\u201381), were to reform socialism, not to introduce industrial private ownership or promote [[capitalism]] in general.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 268\u2013276\"/><ref name=\"Pyzik Poor but Sexy 30\u201331\"/> Solidarity was an egalitarian and collectivist movement.

They were formally recognized by the authorities only after strike actions conducted by activists of both movements in January 1981.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 362\"/>\n\nIn September 1980, in the aftermath of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> Like his predecessors, Kania made promises that the regime could not fulfill because the authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. The [[gross national income]] fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8%, and in 1981 by 15\u201320%.<ref name = \"Int Soc\"/>\n\nAt the communist summit in December 1980 in [[Moscow]], Kania argued with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] leaders, who pressed for an immediate military intervention in Poland. Kania and Minister of Defense [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] declared their determination to fight the \"counterrevolution\" in Poland on their own. In regard to Solidarity, as they saw it, there was still a chance for its healthy, working class current to prevail, not the KOR-instigated anti-socialist, troublemaking elements. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and President-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] made urgent phone calls to Brezhnev and the intervention was postponed.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/> In the meantime Solidarity, not quite aware of the looming danger, did its [[revolution]]ary work, practicing democracy in the union movement and pushing for sovereign society in a number of ways.<ref name=\"Solidarnosc tak bylo\"/> The autonomous labor unions, united under the Solidarity banner, strove to \"recapture public life from the monopoly control of the party\". On 16 December 1980, the [[Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970]] was officially unveiled in Gda\u0144sk in a ceremony that marked the high point in the ascent of Solidarity.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 100\u2013111\"/>\n\nAmong the mass protests that occurred at that time were the winter [[1981 general strike in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]], the [[1981 warning strike in Poland|nationwide warning strike]] in the spring of that year and [[Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland|hunger demonstrations]] in summer. The warning strike took place in the aftermath of the [[Bydgoszcz events]] (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention.<ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/> Wa\u0142\u0119sa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, but at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.<ref name=\"Dudek: 13 grudnia\"/>\n\nMinister Jaruzelski became also prime minister in February 1981. In June, the Soviet Central Committee pressured the Polish party for a leadership change, but Jaruzelski received strong support from the military members of the Polish Central Committee. The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR took place in July. Kania was reelected the party's first secretary, while the organization's internal reformers suffered a defeat.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nAs the economic situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuro\u0144 and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the ruling party of some of its burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 126\u2013133\"/>\n\nThe existence of Solidarity and the political liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy. Everyday life was becoming increasingly unbearable and the public displayed sentiments of extreme volatility. The hostility of the ''nomenklatura'' toward Solidarity was rapidly increasing.<ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nAt the State Defense Committee meeting on 13 September (the time of the Soviet [[Exercise Zapad-81]] maneuvers and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition of [[martial law]]. The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nIn September and October, the [[History of Solidarity|First Congress of Solidarity]] deliberated in Gda\u0144sk. Wa\u0142\u0119sa faced activist opposition and was barely elected chairman of the organization. The delegates passed a radical reform program in which the world \"social\" or \"socialized\" was repeated 150 times. The congress issued a provocative call for workers in other East European countries, urging them to follow in Solidarity's footsteps.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Stelmachowski 53\"/><ref name=\"Kapitalizm przegra\"/> Locally authorized, increasingly \"political\" strikes continued. They were characterized as \"[[Wildcat strike action|wildcats]]\" by Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who desperately tried to impose discipline from the center. He attempted to reach an accord with the state, meeting General Jaruzelski and Catholic Primate [[J\u00f3zef Glemp]] on 4 November. At the time of the regime's re-energized efforts to reduce Solidarity's role, the union had nearly ten million members \u2014 almost four times as many as the ruling party.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 137\u2013141\"/> Militant mood was displayed and unrealistic demands made at the meeting of the partially represented National Commission on 3 December, but the proceedings were wiretapped by the authorities, who then broadcast the (previously manipulated to their advantage) recordings.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 141\u2013146\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 320\u2013327\"/>\n\nThe government, not consulting Solidarity, adopted a plan of economic measures that could be implemented only by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 320\u2013327\"/> In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention.

The remaining 65% were to be reserved for candidates from the PZPR and its allies (the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]], the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] and the [[PAX Association]]). Since the Round Table Agreement mandated only reform (not replacement) of \"[[real socialism]]\" in Poland, the party thought of the election as a way of neutralizing political conflict and staying in power, while gaining some legitimacy to carry out economic reforms.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 205\u2013215\"/><ref name=\"DSM\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 375\u2013380\"/> However, the negotiated social policies, arrived at by economists and trade unionists during the Round Table talks, were quickly tossed out by both the party and the opposition.<ref name=\"Sutowski Okragly Stol\"/>\n\nA systemic transformation happening sooner rather than later was made possible by the [[1989 Polish legislative election|Polish legislative elections]] of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square protests]] in [[China]].

The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. On 19 July 1989 Jaruzelski barely won the vote in the [[Parliament of Poland#National Assembly|National Assembly]] [[1989 Polish presidential election|presidential election]], even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong.

On 1 August, prices were freed because of the ongoing market reforms and [[hyperinflation]] resulted. The instantly increased economic hardship caused a new wave of strikes. The strikes were spontaneous, but the Solidarity leaders, no longer in agreement with the strikers' economic demands, were able to emphasize the secondary political aspect of the strikes (anger at the party's obstinacy) and use them to pressure the regime for an expedited transfer of power.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 43\u201349\"/> The new prime minister, General Kiszczak, who was appointed on 2 August 1989, failed to gain enough support in the ''Sejm'' to form a government and resigned on 19 August. He was the last communist head of government in Poland. Although Jaruzelski tried to persuade Solidarity to join the PZPR in a \"grand coalition\", Wa\u0142\u0119sa refused.
