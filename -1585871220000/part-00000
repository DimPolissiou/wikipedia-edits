Its major features include [[Full text search|full-text search]], hit highlighting, [[faceted search]], real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, [[NoSQL]] features<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchhub.org/2012/05/21/solr-4-preview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706165443/http://searchhub.org/2012/05/21/solr-4-preview/ |archivedate=2014-07-06}}</ref> and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is designed for scalability and [[fault tolerance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lucene.apache.org/solr/#intro|title=Apache Solr -|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Solr is widely used for enterprise search and analytics use cases and has an active development community and regular releases.\n\nSolr runs as a standalone full-text search server. It uses the [[Lucene]] Java search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has [[REST]]-like [[HTTP]]/[[XML]] and [[JSON]] APIs that make it usable from most popular programming languages. Solr's external configuration allows it to be tailored to many types of applications without Java coding, and it has a plugin architecture to support more advanced customization.\n\nApache [[Lucene]] and Apache Solr are both produced by the same [[Apache Software Foundation]] development team.\n\n==History==\nIn 2004, Solr was created by Yonik Seeley at [[CNET Networks]] as an in-house project to add search capability for the company website.\n\nIn January 2006, CNET Networks decided to openly publish the source code by donating it to the [[Apache Software Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-1|title=[SOLR-1] CNET code contribution - ASF JIRA|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Like any new Apache project, it entered an incubation period which helped solve organizational, legal, and financial issues.\n\nIn January 2007, Solr graduated from incubation status into a standalone top-level project (TLP) and grew steadily with accumulated features, thereby attracting users, contributors, and committers. Although quite new as a public project, it powered several high-traffic websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers|title=PublicServers - Solr Wiki|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2008, Solr 1.3 was released including distributed search capabilities and performance enhancements among many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lucene.apache.org/solr/news.html#15%20September%202008%20-%20Solr%201.3.0%20Available|title=Apache Solr -|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, Yonik Seeley along with Grant Ingersoll and Erik Hatcher joined [[Lucidworks]] (formerly Lucid Imagination), the first company providing commercial support and training for Apache Solr search technologies.{{citation needed|reason=date=February 2015|date=February 2015}} Since then, support offerings around Solr have been abundant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Support|title=Support - Solr Wiki|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nNovember 2009 saw the release of Solr 1.4. This version introduced enhancements in indexing, searching and faceting along with many other improvements such as rich document processing ([[PDF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[HTML]]), Search Results clustering based on [[Carrot2]] and also improved database integration. The release also features many additional plug-ins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lucene.apache.org/solr/#10%20November%202009%20-%20Solr%201.4%20Released|title=Apache Solr -|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, the [[Lucene]] and Solr projects merged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucene.markmail.org/thread/cmbek34vfycb6sfc|title=[VOTE] merge lucene/solr development (take 3) - Yonik Seeley - org.apache.lucene.general - MarkMail|work=markmail.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Solr became a Lucene sub project. Separate downloads continued, but the products were now jointly developed by a single set of committers.\n\nIn 2011 the Solr version number scheme was changed in order to match that of Lucene. After Solr 1.4, the next release of Solr was labeled 3.1, in order to keep Solr and Lucene on the same version number.<ref>[http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Solr3.1 Solr3.1 - Solr Wiki]. Wiki.apache.org (2013-05-16). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref>\n\nIn October 2012 Solr version 4.0 was released, including the new SolrCloud feature.<ref>[https://lucene.apache.org/solr/solrnews.html Apache Lucene]. Lucene.apache.org.

Be aware that by default, internal requests are also sent by using HTTP/2. Furthermore, an admin UI login was added with support for BasicAuth and Kerberos. And plotting math expressions in Apache Zeppelin is now possible.\n\n==Operations==\nIn order to search a document, Apache Solr performs following operations in sequence:\n# Indexing: first of all, it converts the documents into a machine-readable format which is called Indexing. \n# Querying: understanding the terms of a query asked by the user. These terms can be images or keywords, for example. \n# Mapping: Solr maps the user query to the documents stored in the database to find the appropriate result.\n# Ranking the outcome: as soon as the engine searches the indexed documents, it ranks the outputs as per their relevance.\n\n==Community==\nSolr has both individuals and companies who contribute new features and bug fixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/solr?sort=votes|title=Highest Voted 'solr' Questions|work=stackoverflow.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucenerevolution.org/|title=Lucene/Solr Revolution 2016|work=lucenerevolution.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/SFBay-Lucene-Solr-Meetup/|title=SFBay Apache Lucene/Solr Meetup|work=meetup.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Solr-Community/|title=Oslo Solr Community|work=meetup.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Solr-1557747|title=LinkedIn Solr Group|work=linkedin.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Integrating Solr==\nSolr is bundled as the built-in search in many applications such as [[content management system]]s and [[enterprise content management]] systems.

Its major features include [[Full text search|full-text search]], hit highlighting, [[faceted search]], real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, [[NoSQL]] features<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchhub.org/2012/05/21/solr-4-preview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706165443/http://searchhub.org/2012/05/21/solr-4-preview/ |archivedate=2014-07-06}}</ref> and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is designed for scalability and [[fault tolerance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lucene.apache.org/solr/#intro|title=Apache Solr -|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Solr is widely used for enterprise search and analytics use cases and has an active development community and regular releases.\n\nSolr runs as a standalone full-text search server. It uses the [[Lucene]] Java search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has [[REST]]-like [[HTTP]]/[[XML]] and [[JSON]] APIs that make it usable from most popular programming languages. Solr's external configuration allows it to be tailored to many types of applications without Java coding, and it has a plugin architecture to support more advanced customization.\n\nApache [[Lucene]] and Apache Solr are both produced by the same [[Apache Software Foundation]] development team.\n\n==History==\nIn 2004, Solr was created by Yonik Seeley at [[CNET Networks]] as an in-house project to add search capability for the company website.\n\nIn January 2006, CNET Networks decided to openly publish the source code by donating it to the [[Apache Software Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-1|title=[SOLR-1] CNET code contribution - ASF JIRA|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Like any new Apache project, it entered an incubation period which helped solve organizational, legal, and financial issues.\n\nIn January 2007, Solr graduated from incubation status into a standalone top-level project (TLP) and grew steadily with accumulated features, thereby attracting users, contributors, and committers. Although quite new as a public project, it powered several high-traffic websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers|title=PublicServers - Solr Wiki|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2008, Solr 1.3 was released including distributed search capabilities and performance enhancements among many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lucene.apache.org/solr/news.html#15%20September%202008%20-%20Solr%201.3.0%20Available|title=Apache Solr -|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, Yonik Seeley along with Grant Ingersoll and Erik Hatcher joined [[Lucidworks]] (formerly Lucid Imagination), the first company providing commercial support and training for Apache Solr search technologies.{{citation needed|reason=date=February 2015|date=February 2015}} Since then, support offerings around Solr have been abundant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Support|title=Support - Solr Wiki|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nNovember 2009 saw the release of Solr 1.4. This version introduced enhancements in indexing, searching and faceting along with many other improvements such as rich document processing ([[PDF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[HTML]]), Search Results clustering based on [[Carrot2]] and also improved database integration. The release also features many additional plug-ins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lucene.apache.org/solr/#10%20November%202009%20-%20Solr%201.4%20Released|title=Apache Solr -|work=apache.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, the [[Lucene]] and Solr projects merged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucene.markmail.org/thread/cmbek34vfycb6sfc|title=[VOTE] merge lucene/solr development (take 3) - Yonik Seeley - org.apache.lucene.general - MarkMail|work=markmail.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Solr became a Lucene sub project. Separate downloads continued, but the products were now jointly developed by a single set of committers.\n\nIn 2011 the Solr version number scheme was changed in order to match that of Lucene. After Solr 1.4, the next release of Solr was labeled 3.1, in order to keep Solr and Lucene on the same version number.<ref>[http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Solr3.1 Solr3.1 - Solr Wiki]. Wiki.apache.org (2013-05-16).

Be aware that by default, internal requests are also sent by using HTTP/2. Furthermore, an admin UI login was added with support for BasicAuth and Kerberos. And plotting math expressions in Apache Zeppelin is now possible.\n\n==Operations==\nIn order to search a document, Apache Solr performs following operations in sequence:\n# Indexing: first of all, it converts the documents into a machine-readable format which is called Indexing. \n# Querying: understanding the terms of a query asked by the user. These terms can be images or keywords, for example. \n# Mapping: Solr maps the user query to the documents stored in the database to find the appropriate result.\n# Ranking the outcome: as soon as the engine searches the indexed documents, it ranks the outputs as per their relevance.\n\n==Community==\nSolr has both individuals and companies who contribute new features and bug fixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/solr?sort=votes|title=Highest Voted 'solr' Questions|work=stackoverflow.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucenerevolution.org/|title=Lucene/Solr Revolution 2016|work=lucenerevolution.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/SFBay-Lucene-Solr-Meetup/|title=SFBay Apache Lucene/Solr Meetup|work=meetup.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Solr-Community/|title=Oslo Solr Community|work=meetup.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Solr-1557747|title=LinkedIn Solr Group|work=linkedin.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Integrating Solr==\nSolr is bundled as the built-in search in many applications such as [[content management system]]s and [[enterprise content management]] systems.
