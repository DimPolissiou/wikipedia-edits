Sheila tries to persuade Gary to visit his son Kyle, but he refuses. However, he changes his mind when Kyle's wife Georgia begs him not to walk away from his son. Gary and Kyle initially struggle to bond. Gary explains that he left his family to protect them, after he witnessed a robbery and was seen by the perpetrators. Gary decides to stay around and he helps Kyle out with his handyman business. Gary and his sister Naomi agree not to tell Kyle that they have been meeting up over the years. One day, Gary leaves Kyle's toolbox unlocked and someone steals the tools. He tries to buy some second-hand tools to help Kyle, before getting a job to compensate his son. Paul Robinson pays Gary to beat up Ezra Hanley. Sheila sees Gary taking payment from Paul and confronts him. She urges her son to turn himself in, but he leaves. Gary later hears that Sheila has had a heart attack and he goes to the hospital, where he admits that it is his fault Sheila is ill. Naomi then tells Kyle that Gary walked out on him as he was actually the getaway driver in the robbery. Kyle reports Gary to the police. Gary also confesses that Paul paid him to assault Ezra. After Paul is questioned, he pays Gary to change his story. Gary offers the money to Kyle and Naomi, but they refuse to take it. Before Gary is taken to jail, Sheila and Kyle visit him to say their goodbyes.\n\nA year later, Gary sends a visiting order to Kyle, but Sheila and his newly arrived, teenage daughter Xanthe come instead. Gary reveals that he is eligible for parole. After Kyle asks Gary not to let Xanthe down when he gets out, Gary deliberately gets into a fight and his parole is revoked. Months later, Gary encounters Paul in the prison yard. Paul asks Gary for protection and later begs Gary for help when the other inmates threaten to beat him, but Gary refuses as he is being released. At home, Gary finds a missing Xanthe and learns that she took $10,000 from [[Tom Quill]] (Kane Felsinger). Gary tells Tom that he will not receive any more repayments, as he believes the money was illegally gained to begin with, since Tom did not report the theft to the police. After Paul is released, Gary apologises for leaving him and Paul gives him a cleaning job at his motel. When Xanthe needs a tutor and a prom dress, Gary struggles financially and he asks ex-con Kev McNally for work. He later decides to get a loan from Paul, who also asks him to spy on his business rival, Terese Willis. Gary is arrested for attacking Cooper Knights, a student who assaulted Xanthe. Ben Kirk soon learns that Cooper's mother was the assailant. Gary enters a pigeon race and wins, but he is disqualified after officials find his bird was doped. Xanthe admits that she gave the pigeon paracetamol. Terese asks Gary on a date.\n\nGary and Terese date in secret, until Xanthe reveals the relationship to Sheila, while the family are on ''Family Feud''. Xanthe's mother Brooke Butler comes to town and Gary reconciles his relationship with her. Brooke makes several jewellery sales and then persuades Gary to give her money, as the jewellery is being held at customs. She soon leaves town and Gary is forced to seek extra work to pay back those who she cheated. Gary feuds with Karl Kennedy, who bought some of the jewellery. He contacts Kev again, who offers him a job moving stolen goods from a car. Gary finds the car is missing and enlists Tyler Brennan's help to find it. After locating the car, Gary discovers it is empty and Kev tells him he now owes $30,000. Sheila speaks with Kev's father, who reveals Kev stole the laptops and set Gary up. Gary and Terese get back together, but shortly after Brooke returns and tries to make amends. Gary offers to help her reconnect with her daughter, Jessie. Their behaviour leads Terese to think Gary is cheating on her and she ends their relationship. Brooke persuades Gary to propose to Terese, who accepts. Terese has an allergic reaction to Gary's engagement ring, and he steals a replacement from the hotel's lost property box.\n\nAfter noticing Terese exhibiting odd behaviour, Gary thinks she is either pregnant or drinking again, but she admits that she has breast cancer. Gary is supportive and tries to convince Terese to cut back on her work hours. When her treatment fails to work, Gary seeks out alternatives and approaches her brother, and former oncologist, Nick Petrides in prison. When Paul and Gary argue over Terese's new treatment, Gary learns that Terese told Paul about her diagnosis before him. Gary accidentally tells Terese's boss [[Jasmine Udagawa]] (Kaori Maeda-Judge) about her cancer, leading the Udagawas to withdraw their investment. Gary arranges a surprise engagement party for Terese. He later interviews for a chefs job at a local restaurant, but [[List of Neighbours characters (2017)#John Rotondo|John Rotondo]] (Vincent Gorceis) turns him down. After John offers him an illegal oyster-fishing job, Gary follows him to Lassiters and realises Paul tried to set him up. On their wedding day, Terese pulls Gary aside and confesses to having sex with Paul. Days later, Gary returns to work and his colleague tells him to get revenge. While moving a couch from Terese's office, Paul tells Gary he and Terese had sex on it. Gary places the couch in the middle of Lassiters with the word \"Cheater\" painted on it to humiliate Terese.\n\nWhile he is in The Waterhole, Gary is propositioned by [[List of Neighbours characters (2017)#Caro Watts|Caro Watts]] (Janine Atwill), who gives him her hotel key card. He later reassures Terese that nothing happened with Caro. Gary is rushed to hospital after he inhales toxic fumes from cleaning fluid. When Terese visits him, he tells her he wants to give their relationship another go. [[Hamish Roche]]'s (Sean Taylor) body is found in the Cannings spa, and Gary and Sheila becomes suspects in his murder. Gary asks Paul for an alibi and Paul agrees, but only if Gary breaks up with Terese. Gary and Sheila realise that they thought each other had killed Hamish, but neither of them did. Gary tells the police that he cleaned up the crime scene and is charged with obstruction of justice. Terese forgives Gary for going to Paul for help instead of her, and they go on a camping trip. She later offers him a trial in the Lassiters kitchen, but he annoys the head chef by making several mistakes. Gary enrols in a [[TAFE]] course to qualify as a chef. After catering for the launch of The Flametree Retreat, [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) offers Gary a job.\n\nGary learns that Xanthe and Ben are in a sexual relationship. When Gary sees them together at the hotel, he uses his master key to enter a room to stop them. But he ends up scaring hotel guest [[List of Neighbours characters (2018)#Levi Jansen|Levi Jansen]] (Sam Allen), who cancels a meeting with [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan). Terese bars Gary from the hotel, while Shane confronts him in the street and breaks his fishing pole. Gary and Terese get back together, but he suspects that she still has feelings for Paul. Gary suspicions grow when he learns that Terese has engineered a reason for him to be delayed at work. He later finds Terese on the Lassiters mezzanine, where she proposes to him and he accepts. While they are spending a night at the hotel, Gary finds Terese and Paul together in her office for a phone call. Gary decides to end the relationship. He later accompanies Terese for her post-cancer check-up, telling her he will always support her. Steph gives Gary a trial as manager of the retreat, but reconsiders when Xanthe and Piper have their drinks spiked at a party. Sheila urges her to keep Gary on and Steph agrees. [[Fay Brennan]] ([[Zoe Bertram]]) asks Gary on a date. Sheila encourages him to accept, as she suspects Fay is laundering money through The Waterhole and needs evidence. Gary learns Fay is not doing anything illegal, but he humiliates her when she  overhears him telling Sheila that he is not interested in dating her.\n\nXanthe is deliberately struck by [[Elly Conway]]'s ([[Jodi Anasta]]) car. Gary initially blames Elly for Xanthe's injuries, but Xanthe later confirms that Finn Kelly was driving, so Gary goes to his apartment and trashes it. Gary meets with Finn's former cellmate [[Jeremy Sluggett]] (Tamblyn Lord) to ask for his whereabouts. Jeremy promises to give Gary the information, as long as Gary holds onto $100,000 for him for a week. They arrange for Jeremy to pick up the money from the retreat, but Gary's new employee [[Sindi Watts]] ([[Marisa Warrington]]) turns up unexpectedly and Jeremy knocks her unconscious. Jeremy is arrested and the money is returned to Gary, who uses some of it to fund Xanthe's medical treatments. Gary considers using Jeremy's money to help Xanthe pay for a private university. He asks for a bank loan instead, and he secures one when Steph gives him a new contract and a pay rise. Gary admits to Xanthe that he is lonely, and that he has feelings for [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]). After learning that the loan will not come through for two weeks, Gary uses Jeremy's money for Xanthe's university fees, intending to replace it with the loan. However, after one of Steph's friends see him fighting with Shane, Steph rescinds his pay rise and the bank cancel the loan. Jeremy's mother [[Nance Sluggett]] ([[Denise Drysdale]]) comes to collect his money, but deduces that Gary does not have it. She asks him for free treatments and then a job in return for derailing Jeremy's parole hearing. However, when she clashes with Sheila, Nance cancels the deal.\n\nGary tells his family and Amy about his situation, and Amy gifts him the money to pay Nance. Gary then declares his love for Amy, who breaks up with her boyfriend [[Rob Carson]] (Christopher Farrell) to be with him. Steph fires Gary after learning the truth about his deal with Jeremy, while Paul refuses to accept Gary and Amy's relationship, leading Amy to move in with Gary. Paul uses to Jeremy to try and set Gary up, but Gary realises what is happening and goads Paul, who punches him. Terese hires Gary as a barista at the pavilion coffee hut and he delivers stolen goods for Kev McNally to pay Amy back faster. He later discovers that he is moving solar converters stolen from Amy's Robinson Heights project. Kev agrees to let Gary quit if he retrieves a remote that was left behind at the site. Sheila catches Gary with the remote and he asks that she keeps it from Amy. Kev asks Gary to do another job, but Gary turns it down and Kev has some of the stolen converters placed in the coffee hut. Gary returns later that night to move them, but when he sees someone near the hut, he grabs them and throws them against the building. He soon realises he has attacked [[Dipi Rebecchi]] (Sharon Johal), who is left bruised and concussed. Shane vents his anger at Gary, while Amy learns the truth about the robbery and stolen converters in the coffee hut. She helps Sheila get rid of them and then breaks up with Gary.\n\nGary is encouraged to change his life around. He convinces Xanthe to leave Erinsborough to pursue her studies in Toowoomba or everything he did will have been for nothing. He apologises to Dipi properly and they bond over recipes, angering Shane and leading Sheila to suspect they are having an affair. They make it clear that they are just friends, and Gary focuses on trying to find and job and reconciling with Amy. Toadie gives Gary some work at the garden nursery and he gets a job in a warehouse, but he struggles to remember the instructions given to him due to tiredness and is knocked unconscious by some falling boxes. Amy finds Gary and he recovers in hospital. Amy admits that she wants to get back together, but only if Gary tells Sheila to back off, which he does. Gary proposes to Amy, but they are interrupted by Kyle who has returned to Erinsborough to take over Amy's former job at the Robinson Pines development. Amy accepts Gary's proposal and moves back in with him and Sheila. Gary reads out Xanthe's statement at Finn's sentencing hearing and is sure that he will be sent to prison, however, Finn is released into the Kennedys' care, causing tension between them and the Cannings.\n\nAfter learning that Kyle is in love with Amy, Gary arranges a secret wedding, but Amy shuts it down. After a short break away, Amy returns and tells Gary that their engagement is still on. Gary and Kyle put in a tender for Karl's tram business. Karl chooses them both, forcing them to work together to turn the tram into a restaurant. Gary becomes competitive with Kyle, and fails to secure some scaffolding correctly, resulting in Kyle falling to the ground and straining their relationship. Gary suspects that Kyle and Amy have feelings for each other, leading him to agree to try for a baby with Amy. However, Amy overhears Gary admitting that he does not want another child, and she realises that she is content with the life she has with him. Gary learns that Sheila and Paul teamed up to split him and Amy up. He struggles to forgive Sheila and vents his anger at Paul, who is attacked later that night, leaving Gary as the prime suspect. [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) tells the police that she saw Gary attack Paul, leading to his arrest. The charges are dropped when it emerges that [[Vance Abernethy]] ([[Conrad Coleby]]) attacked Paul. Gary realises Amy is in love with Kyle and he ends their relationship. Gary later goes on dates with two of Paul's former wives; [[Rebecca Napier]] ([[Jane Hall (actress)|Jane Hall]]) and [[Gail Robinson (Neighbours)|Gail Lewis]] ([[Fiona Corke]]). Gary then meets and bonds with [[Prudence Wallace]] ([[Denise van Outen]]) at The Waterhole. \n\nGary and Prue go on a few dates, until Prue's daughter Harlow Robinson warns Gary away. Harlow later apologises and Gary and Prue arrange another date. As Prue waits for Gary to finish work, he catches her attempting to take money from the tram's till. Prue reveals she is part of an organisation called the Restoration Order, but she cannot afford to pay her monthly fee. Gary loans Prue the money on the condition she tells him more about the Order. When Prue has to go back to England, Gary and Amy realise that she has deceived Harlow and is planning on bringing her into the Order. Gary and Paul find Harlow at a [[milk bar]], where Prue left her, and bring her home. Gary later tells Harlow that although Prue left, she does love her and shows her a video of them dancing together. Gary and Dipi start spending more time together after her marriage becomes strained, and Shane tries to insert himself into their friendship. After Dipi learns Roxy kissed Shane, she moves in with Gary and Sheila. Gary is wary about how close he and Dipi are becoming, but she reassures him that she values their friendship. Dipi later kisses Gary and Shane learns about it from Karl. He and Dipi talk through their issues and she moves back home. Gary objects when Finn begins tutoring Harlow, as he is reminded of the situation with Xanthe years earlier. Gary goes to London to look for Prue and get her out of the Order. Prue later joins Gary in Erinsborough and reveals that she has left the Order and that she and Gary are engaged. Despite opposition from their families, Terese arranges for Prue and Gary to get married at the Lassiters wedding expo the following week. On his wedding day, Gary learns that Prue did not leave the Order for him, but rather she was kicked out. He tells her he cannot marry her and heads to [[Pierce Greyson]]'s ([[Tim Robards]]) island glamping retreat to make amends with Kyle. While there, he becomes suspicious of Finn's increasingly erratic behaviour. After learning that Harlow is missing on the island, Gary joins in the search and finds her and Bea Nilsson trapped in a mineshaft. He attempts to save them by throwing down a rope, but Finn fatally shoots him in the back with an arrow. Finn then drags his body away, and it is discovered by Elly while she is fleeing from Finn.\n\n==Reception==\nSophie Dainty of ''Digital Spy'' branded Gary \"troublesome\".<ref name=\"Return\"/> Bridget McManus of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' thought Richardson was \"underutilised\" in the role.<ref name=\"McManus\">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-guide/m14tvfri-20161229-gtjc84.html|title=m14-tv-fri|last=McManus|first=Bridget|date=15 January 2017|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=24 November 2017}}</ref> She also thought the plot in which Gary gets involved with Kev and the stolen car was reminiscent of the television crime series ''[[Underbelly (TV series)|Underbelly]]''.<ref name=\"McManus\"/> McManus later wrote that although Richardson was convincing as a detective in his former roles, he has \"the sort of furtive look that lends itself much more comfortably to roles such as the slightly paranoid ex-con Gary.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-guide/m04tvthu-20161229-gtjd4w.html|title=M Mag Thursday television picks|last=McManus|first=Bridget|date=5 February 2017|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=24 November 2017}}</ref> When Terese learnt she had breast cancer, a ''[[South Wales Echo]]'' observed \"If you were battling a life-threatening illness, who would you turn to?

Sheila tries to persuade Gary to visit his son Kyle, but he refuses. However, he changes his mind when Kyle's wife Georgia begs him not to walk away from his son. Gary and Kyle initially struggle to bond. Gary explains that he left his family to protect them, after he witnessed a robbery and was seen by the perpetrators. Gary decides to stay around and he helps Kyle out with his handyman business. Gary and his sister Naomi agree not to tell Kyle that they have been meeting up over the years. One day, Gary leaves Kyle's toolbox unlocked and someone steals the tools. He tries to buy some second-hand tools to help Kyle, before getting a job to compensate his son. Paul Robinson pays Gary to beat up Ezra Hanley. Sheila sees Gary taking payment from Paul and confronts him. She urges her son to turn himself in, but he leaves. Gary later hears that Sheila has had a heart attack and he goes to the hospital, where he admits that it is his fault Sheila is ill. Naomi then tells Kyle that Gary walked out on him as he was actually the getaway driver in the robbery. Kyle reports Gary to the police. Gary also confesses that Paul paid him to assault Ezra. After Paul is questioned, he pays Gary to change his story. Gary offers the money to Kyle and Naomi, but they refuse to take it. Before Gary is taken to jail, Sheila and Kyle visit him to say their goodbyes.\n\nA year later, Gary sends a visiting order to Kyle, but Sheila and his newly arrived, teenage daughter Xanthe come instead. Gary reveals that he is eligible for parole. After Kyle asks Gary not to let Xanthe down when he gets out, Gary deliberately gets into a fight and his parole is revoked. Months later, Gary encounters Paul in the prison yard. Paul asks Gary for protection and later begs Gary for help when the other inmates threaten to beat him, but Gary refuses as he is being released. At home, Gary finds a missing Xanthe and learns that she took $10,000 from [[Tom Quill]] (Kane Felsinger). Gary tells Tom that he will not receive any more repayments, as he believes the money was illegally gained to begin with, since Tom did not report the theft to the police. After Paul is released, Gary apologises for leaving him and Paul gives him a cleaning job at his motel. When Xanthe needs a tutor and a prom dress, Gary struggles financially and he asks ex-con Kev McNally for work. He later decides to get a loan from Paul, who also asks him to spy on his business rival, Terese Willis. Gary is arrested for attacking Cooper Knights, a student who assaulted Xanthe. Ben Kirk soon learns that Cooper's mother was the assailant. Gary enters a pigeon race and wins, but he is disqualified after officials find his bird was doped. Xanthe admits that she gave the pigeon paracetamol. Terese asks Gary on a date.\n\nGary and Terese date in secret, until Xanthe reveals the relationship to Sheila, while the family are on ''Family Feud''. Xanthe's mother Brooke Butler comes to town and Gary reconciles his relationship with her. Brooke makes several jewellery sales and then persuades Gary to give her money, as the jewellery is being held at customs. She soon leaves town and Gary is forced to seek extra work to pay back those who she cheated. Gary feuds with Karl Kennedy, who bought some of the jewellery. He contacts Kev again, who offers him a job moving stolen goods from a car. Gary finds the car is missing and enlists Tyler Brennan's help to find it. After locating the car, Gary discovers it is empty and Kev tells him he now owes $30,000. Sheila speaks with Kev's father, who reveals Kev stole the laptops and set Gary up. Gary and Terese get back together, but shortly after Brooke returns and tries to make amends. Gary offers to help her reconnect with her daughter, Jessie. Their behaviour leads Terese to think Gary is cheating on her and she ends their relationship. Brooke persuades Gary to propose to Terese, who accepts. Terese has an allergic reaction to Gary's engagement ring, and he steals a replacement from the hotel's lost property box.\n\nAfter noticing Terese exhibiting odd behaviour, Gary thinks she is either pregnant or drinking again, but she admits that she has breast cancer. Gary is supportive and tries to convince Terese to cut back on her work hours. When her treatment fails to work, Gary seeks out alternatives and approaches her brother, and former oncologist, Nick Petrides in prison. When Paul and Gary argue over Terese's new treatment, Gary learns that Terese told Paul about her diagnosis before him. Gary accidentally tells Terese's boss [[Jasmine Udagawa]] (Kaori Maeda-Judge) about her cancer, leading the Udagawas to withdraw their investment. Gary arranges a surprise engagement party for Terese. He later interviews for a chefs job at a local restaurant, but [[List of Neighbours characters (2017)#John Rotondo|John Rotondo]] (Vincent Gorceis) turns him down. After John offers him an illegal oyster-fishing job, Gary follows him to Lassiters and realises Paul tried to set him up. On their wedding day, Terese pulls Gary aside and confesses to having sex with Paul. Days later, Gary returns to work and his colleague tells him to get revenge. While moving a couch from Terese's office, Paul tells Gary he and Terese had sex on it. Gary places the couch in the middle of Lassiters with the word \"Cheater\" painted on it to humiliate Terese.\n\nWhile he is in The Waterhole, Gary is propositioned by [[List of Neighbours characters (2017)#Caro Watts|Caro Watts]] (Janine Atwill), who gives him her hotel key card. He later reassures Terese that nothing happened with Caro. Gary is rushed to hospital after he inhales toxic fumes from cleaning fluid. When Terese visits him, he tells her he wants to give their relationship another go. [[Hamish Roche]]'s (Sean Taylor) body is found in the Cannings spa, and Gary and Sheila becomes suspects in his murder. Gary asks Paul for an alibi and Paul agrees, but only if Gary breaks up with Terese. Gary and Sheila realise that they thought each other had killed Hamish, but neither of them did. Gary tells the police that he cleaned up the crime scene and is charged with obstruction of justice. Terese forgives Gary for going to Paul for help instead of her, and they go on a camping trip. She later offers him a trial in the Lassiters kitchen, but he annoys the head chef by making several mistakes. Gary enrols in a [[TAFE]] course to qualify as a chef. After catering for the launch of The Flametree Retreat, [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) offers Gary a job.\n\nGary learns that Xanthe and Ben are in a sexual relationship. When Gary sees them together at the hotel, he uses his master key to enter a room to stop them. But he ends up scaring hotel guest [[List of Neighbours characters (2018)#Levi Jansen|Levi Jansen]] (Sam Allen), who cancels a meeting with [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan). Terese bars Gary from the hotel, while Shane confronts him in the street and breaks his fishing pole. Gary and Terese get back together, but he suspects that she still has feelings for Paul. Gary suspicions grow when he learns that Terese has engineered a reason for him to be delayed at work. He later finds Terese on the Lassiters mezzanine, where she proposes to him and he accepts. While they are spending a night at the hotel, Gary finds Terese and Paul together in her office for a phone call. Gary decides to end the relationship. He later accompanies Terese for her post-cancer check-up, telling her he will always support her. Steph gives Gary a trial as manager of the retreat, but reconsiders when Xanthe and Piper have their drinks spiked at a party. Sheila urges her to keep Gary on and Steph agrees. [[Fay Brennan]] ([[Zoe Bertram]]) asks Gary on a date. Sheila encourages him to accept, as she suspects Fay is laundering money through The Waterhole and needs evidence. Gary learns Fay is not doing anything illegal, but he humiliates her when she  overhears him telling Sheila that he is not interested in dating her.\n\nXanthe is deliberately struck by [[Elly Conway]]'s ([[Jodi Anasta]]) car. Gary initially blames Elly for Xanthe's injuries, but Xanthe later confirms that Finn Kelly was driving, so Gary goes to his apartment and trashes it. Gary meets with Finn's former cellmate [[Jeremy Sluggett]] (Tamblyn Lord) to ask for his whereabouts. Jeremy promises to give Gary the information, as long as Gary holds onto $100,000 for him for a week. They arrange for Jeremy to pick up the money from the retreat, but Gary's new employee [[Sindi Watts]] ([[Marisa Warrington]]) turns up unexpectedly and Jeremy knocks her unconscious. Jeremy is arrested and the money is returned to Gary, who uses some of it to fund Xanthe's medical treatments. Gary considers using Jeremy's money to help Xanthe pay for a private university. He asks for a bank loan instead, and he secures one when Steph gives him a new contract and a pay rise. Gary admits to Xanthe that he is lonely, and that he has feelings for [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]). After learning that the loan will not come through for two weeks, Gary uses Jeremy's money for Xanthe's university fees, intending to replace it with the loan. However, after one of Steph's friends see him fighting with Shane, Steph rescinds his pay rise and the bank cancel the loan. Jeremy's mother [[Nance Sluggett]] ([[Denise Drysdale]]) comes to collect his money, but deduces that Gary does not have it. She asks him for free treatments and then a job in return for derailing Jeremy's parole hearing. However, when she clashes with Sheila, Nance cancels the deal.\n\nGary tells his family and Amy about his situation, and Amy gifts him the money to pay Nance. Gary then declares his love for Amy, who breaks up with her boyfriend [[Rob Carson]] (Christopher Farrell) to be with him. Steph fires Gary after learning the truth about his deal with Jeremy, while Paul refuses to accept Gary and Amy's relationship, leading Amy to move in with Gary. Paul uses to Jeremy to try and set Gary up, but Gary realises what is happening and goads Paul, who punches him. Terese hires Gary as a barista at the pavilion coffee hut and he delivers stolen goods for Kev McNally to pay Amy back faster. He later discovers that he is moving solar converters stolen from Amy's Robinson Heights project. Kev agrees to let Gary quit if he retrieves a remote that was left behind at the site. Sheila catches Gary with the remote and he asks that she keeps it from Amy. Kev asks Gary to do another job, but Gary turns it down and Kev has some of the stolen converters placed in the coffee hut. Gary returns later that night to move them, but when he sees someone near the hut, he grabs them and throws them against the building. He soon realises he has attacked [[Dipi Rebecchi]] (Sharon Johal), who is left bruised and concussed. Shane vents his anger at Gary, while Amy learns the truth about the robbery and stolen converters in the coffee hut. She helps Sheila get rid of them and then breaks up with Gary.\n\nGary is encouraged to change his life around. He convinces Xanthe to leave Erinsborough to pursue her studies in Toowoomba or everything he did will have been for nothing. He apologises to Dipi properly and they bond over recipes, angering Shane and leading Sheila to suspect they are having an affair. They make it clear that they are just friends, and Gary focuses on trying to find and job and reconciling with Amy. Toadie gives Gary some work at the garden nursery and he gets a job in a warehouse, but he struggles to remember the instructions given to him due to tiredness and is knocked unconscious by some falling boxes. Amy finds Gary and he recovers in hospital. Amy admits that she wants to get back together, but only if Gary tells Sheila to back off, which he does. Gary proposes to Amy, but they are interrupted by Kyle who has returned to Erinsborough to take over Amy's former job at the Robinson Pines development. Amy accepts Gary's proposal and moves back in with him and Sheila. Gary reads out Xanthe's statement at Finn's sentencing hearing and is sure that he will be sent to prison, however, Finn is released into the Kennedys' care, causing tension between them and the Cannings.\n\nAfter learning that Kyle is in love with Amy, Gary arranges a secret wedding, but Amy shuts it down. After a short break away, Amy returns and tells Gary that their engagement is still on. Gary and Kyle put in a tender for Karl's tram business. Karl chooses them both, forcing them to work together to turn the tram into a restaurant. Gary becomes competitive with Kyle, and fails to secure some scaffolding correctly, resulting in Kyle falling to the ground and straining their relationship. Gary suspects that Kyle and Amy have feelings for each other, leading him to agree to try for a baby with Amy. However, Amy overhears Gary admitting that he does not want another child, and she realises that she is content with the life she has with him. Gary learns that Sheila and Paul teamed up to split him and Amy up. He struggles to forgive Sheila and vents his anger at Paul, who is attacked later that night, leaving Gary as the prime suspect. [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) tells the police that she saw Gary attack Paul, leading to his arrest. The charges are dropped when it emerges that [[Vance Abernethy]] ([[Conrad Coleby]]) attacked Paul. Gary realises Amy is in love with Kyle and he ends their relationship. Gary later goes on dates with two of Paul's former wives; [[Rebecca Napier]] ([[Jane Hall (actress)|Jane Hall]]) and [[Gail Lewis]] ([[Fiona Corke]]). Gary then meets and bonds with [[Prudence Wallace]] ([[Denise van Outen]]) at The Waterhole. \n\nGary and Prue go on a few dates, until Prue's daughter Harlow Robinson warns Gary away. Harlow later apologises and Gary and Prue arrange another date. As Prue waits for Gary to finish work, he catches her attempting to take money from the tram's till. Prue reveals she is part of an organisation called the Restoration Order, but she cannot afford to pay her monthly fee. Gary loans Prue the money on the condition she tells him more about the Order. When Prue has to go back to England, Gary and Amy realise that she has deceived Harlow and is planning on bringing her into the Order. Gary and Paul find Harlow at a [[milk bar]], where Prue left her, and bring her home. Gary later tells Harlow that although Prue left, she does love her and shows her a video of them dancing together. Gary and Dipi start spending more time together after her marriage becomes strained, and Shane tries to insert himself into their friendship. After Dipi learns Roxy kissed Shane, she moves in with Gary and Sheila. Gary is wary about how close he and Dipi are becoming, but she reassures him that she values their friendship. Dipi later kisses Gary and Shane learns about it from Karl. He and Dipi talk through their issues and she moves back home. Gary objects when Finn begins tutoring Harlow, as he is reminded of the situation with Xanthe years earlier. Gary goes to London to look for Prue and get her out of the Order. Prue later joins Gary in Erinsborough and reveals that she has left the Order and that she and Gary are engaged. Despite opposition from their families, Terese arranges for Prue and Gary to get married at the Lassiters wedding expo the following week. On his wedding day, Gary learns that Prue did not leave the Order for him, but rather she was kicked out. He tells her he cannot marry her and heads to [[Pierce Greyson]]'s ([[Tim Robards]]) island glamping retreat to make amends with Kyle. While there, he becomes suspicious of Finn's increasingly erratic behaviour. After learning that Harlow is missing on the island, Gary joins in the search and finds her and Bea Nilsson trapped in a mineshaft. He attempts to save them by throwing down a rope, but Finn fatally shoots him in the back with an arrow. Finn then drags his body away, and it is discovered by Elly while she is fleeing from Finn.\n\n==Reception==\nSophie Dainty of ''Digital Spy'' branded Gary \"troublesome\".<ref name=\"Return\"/> Bridget McManus of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' thought Richardson was \"underutilised\" in the role.<ref name=\"McManus\">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-guide/m14tvfri-20161229-gtjc84.html|title=m14-tv-fri|last=McManus|first=Bridget|date=15 January 2017|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=24 November 2017}}</ref> She also thought the plot in which Gary gets involved with Kev and the stolen car was reminiscent of the television crime series ''[[Underbelly (TV series)|Underbelly]]''.<ref name=\"McManus\"/> McManus later wrote that although Richardson was convincing as a detective in his former roles, he has \"the sort of furtive look that lends itself much more comfortably to roles such as the slightly paranoid ex-con Gary.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-guide/m04tvthu-20161229-gtjd4w.html|title=M Mag Thursday television picks|last=McManus|first=Bridget|date=5 February 2017|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=24 November 2017}}</ref> When Terese learnt she had breast cancer, a ''[[South Wales Echo]]'' observed \"If you were battling a life-threatening illness, who would you turn to?

This compulsion hardly belongs to the man who enunciates them; it belongs to universal reason and to all men who wish to listen to its voice. It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality...

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], a former colonel in the National Guard, who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability.

Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the [[Dauphin of France]], Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the [[existence of God]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]''.\n\nIn the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of [[Pentecost]]) a \"Festival of the Supreme Being\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the [[Bastille]]. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the [[Tuileries]].{{sfn | Moore | 2007 | p=291}} ([[Joachim Vilate]] had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.)\n\nThe festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the Convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=308}} Witnesses state that throughout the \"Festival of the Supreme Being\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\"<ref>Michelet, J.

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-supreme.asp|title=Robespierre, M. \"The Cult of the Supreme Being\", in Modern History Sourcebook, 1997|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRobespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled [[Moses]] as the leader of the people.

He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France.

The monument was commissioned by Vladimir Lenin, who referred to Robespierre as a \"Bolshevik ''[[wikt:avant la lettre|avant la lettre]]''\" or a \"Bolshevik before his time\".{{sfn|Jordan|2013}} Due to the poor construction of the monument (it was made of tubes and common concrete), it crumbled within three days of its unveiling and was never replaced.{{sfn|Bean|Horak|Kapse|2014}} The Robespierre Embankment in Saint-Petersburg across [[Kresty prison]]  is now called Voskresenskaya Embankment.\n\n===Public Memorials===\n[[File:Place Robespierre Marseille.png|upright=1|thumb|La Place Robespierre in Marseille with the inscription: \"Lawyer, born in Arras in 1758, guillotined without trial on 27 July 1794. Nicknamed ''L'Incorruptible''. Defender of the people. Author of our republican motto: [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|''Libert\u00e9 \u00c9galit\u00e9 Fraternit\u00e9'']]\".]]\n\n==== Street-names ====\nRobespierre is one of the few revolutionaries not to have a street named for him in the centre of [[Paris]]. At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]]. This returned to public view Robespierre\u2019s only surviving contemporary sculpted portrait. A plaster cast of it is displayed at the Conciergerie in Paris, and a bronze cast is in the Place de la R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise in [[Montpellier]], with bronzes of other figures of the time.<ref>See Nella Buscot, sculpteur, ''Sculptures \u00e0 Montpellier'': http://www.nella-buscot.com/jardins_montpellier_prf_2.php</ref>\n\n==== Resistance units ====\nIn the Second World War, several Resistance groups took his name: the Robespierre Company in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], commanded by Lieutenant Aurin, alias Mar\u00e9chal; the Robespierre Batallion in the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], under Captain Laplace; and a [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]] formed by Marcel Claeys in the [[Ain]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources (selection)==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Andress |first1=David |title=The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France |date=2006 |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux |isbn=978-0374273415 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDfxQDcQzJ0C |language=en |ref=harv}}\n* Aulard, Fran\u00e7ois-Alphonse (1897).

To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the [[Dauphin of France]], Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the [[existence of God]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].

Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony.

He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]].

The highest level of soccer being played in Tasmania was in two regional leagues in the [[Northern Championship|North]] and [[Southern Championship|South]] of the state.\n\nThe league was formed in 2012 by [[Football Federation Tasmania]] and the first season commenced in 2013.  FFT referred to the league as the '''T-League''' during planning prior to the establishment of the league.  Between 2012\u20132014 the league was known as the '''Victory League''' due to sponsorship by A-League club [[Melbourne Victory]].  In 2015 the league was officially known as the '''PS4 Victory League''' also for sponsorship reasons.  In 2016, the league changed names again to '''National Premier Leagues Tasmania''' in line with other divisions within the [[National Premier Leagues|NPL]].\n\nThe initial clubs were awarded licences for league membership for three seasons between 2013\u20132015.  In 2015 the FFT Board analysed the clubs on and off pitch.  Based on this analysis six of the eight clubs in the NPL Tasmania were offered licences for an additional three seasons between 2016\u20132018. Glenorchy Knights and [[Launceston City FC|Launceston City]] were required to reapply for membership and compete with other clubs for the final two positions in the league in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/sport/local-sport/two-clubs-battling-for-victory-league-licences-in-tasmania/story-fnj92b0f-1227353323470|work=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]| author=SIMEON THOMAS-WILSON| accessdate=2015-07-09|title=Two clubs battling for Victory League licences in Tasmania }}</ref>  [[Riverside Olympic]], [[University of Tasmania SC|University]], [[Clarence United FC|Clarence]] and [[New Town Eagles FC|New Town Eagles]] also applied for the two positions in addition to Glenorchy and Launceston City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/3151547/riverside-moves-for-victory-league-licence/|work=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]|title=Riverside moves for Victory League licence|author=ROB SHAW|accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>  In August 2015 it was announced that Clarence United and Launceston City had been awarded the available licences between 2016\u201318.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walterpless.com.au/2015/march/clarence-united-replace-glenorchy-knights-in-victory-league.html|author=Walter Pless|accessdate=2015-08-05|title=Clarence United replace Glenorchy Knights in Victory League|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417053442/http://www.walterpless.com.au/2015/march/clarence-united-replace-glenorchy-knights-in-victory-league.html|archive-date=17 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUp until 2017, the top teams in the league also qualified for a Tasmanian end of season finals series.  Between 2013\u201315 the winner of the local finals series was awarded the '''Victory Cup'''.  In 2013 and 2014 the top four teams participated in the finals series.  In 2015 the finals series has been expanded to include the top six teams in the league as well as the champions of the [[Northern Championship]] and [[Southern Championship]].  In 2016, the end of season finals series cup was renamed the '''League Cup''' due to lapsing sponsorship arrangements,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballfedtas.com.au/index.php?id=15&tx_ttnews%5Byear%5D=2016&tx_ttnews%5Bmonth%5D=08&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1502&cHash=9064820d5ae8093db320280e6ec0be40|title=CEO Update August 9|publisher=[[Football Federation Tasmania]]}}</ref> and scrapped entirely after the end of the 2017 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/5579528/league-cups-end-confirmed/|title=League Cup\u2019s end confirmed|publisher=The Advocate|author=Andrew Mathieson|date=10 August 2018|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nIn late 2016, FFT announced they will expand the league to ten teams and introduce a promotion/relegation system.  The winner of the 2018 Southern and Northern Championships will be promoted into NPL Tasmania and the competition will expand to ten teams in 2019.  From the end of the 2019 season the winners of the Northern and Southern Championships will play-off against each other with the winner then automatically replacing the last placed finisher in the NPL Tasmania whilst the loser of the Northern and Southern Championships Play-off will play an additional play-off for a place in the NPL Tasmania in the following season against the second last NPL Tasmania club.<ref name=\"TAS_2019\"/>\n\nFrom 2019 onwards, the league consists of ten clubs geographically spread throughout Tasmania.  The team on top of the table is considered the league champion and qualifies to play in the [[National Premier Leagues]] finals series against the champions of the other states.\n\n==Sponsorship==\nThe official sponsor for the league between 2013\u20132015 was [[A-League]] club [[Melbourne Victory]].<ref>http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8505237{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Redline Coaches|Tasmanian Redline]] is the official sponsor for transport.<ref>http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/08/03/351231_soccer.html</ref>  In 2015 the League is also included as part of [[PlayStation 4|Sony PlayStation 4]] sponsorship of the [[National Premier Leagues]].\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 the League had centralised apparel providers to all teams being Pelada and Jemsz respectively.

The highest level of soccer being played in Tasmania was in two regional leagues in the [[Northern Championship|North]] and [[Southern Championship|South]] of the state.\n\nThe league was formed in 2012 by [[Football Federation Tasmania]] and the first season commenced in 2013.  FFT referred to the league as the '''T-League''' during planning prior to the establishment of the league.  Between 2012\u20132014 the league was known as the '''Victory League''' due to sponsorship by A-League club [[Melbourne Victory]].  In 2015 the league was officially known as the '''PS4 Victory League''' also for sponsorship reasons.  In 2016, the league changed names again to '''National Premier Leagues Tasmania''' in line with other divisions within the [[National Premier Leagues|NPL]].\n\nThe initial clubs were awarded licences for league membership for three seasons between 2013\u20132015.  In 2015 the FFT Board analysed the clubs on and off pitch.  Based on this analysis six of the eight clubs in the NPL Tasmania were offered licences for an additional three seasons between 2016\u20132018. Glenorchy Knights and [[Launceston City FC|Launceston City]] were required to reapply for membership and compete with other clubs for the final two positions in the league in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/sport/local-sport/two-clubs-battling-for-victory-league-licences-in-tasmania/story-fnj92b0f-1227353323470|work=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]| author=SIMEON THOMAS-WILSON| accessdate=2015-07-09|title=Two clubs battling for Victory League licences in Tasmania }}</ref>  [[Riverside Olympic]], [[University of Tasmania SC|University]], [[Clarence United FC|Clarence]] and [[New Town Eagles FC|New Town Eagles]] also applied for the two positions in addition to Glenorchy and Launceston City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/3151547/riverside-moves-for-victory-league-licence/|work=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]|title=Riverside moves for Victory League licence|author=ROB SHAW|accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>  In August 2015 it was announced that Clarence United and Launceston City had been awarded the available licences between 2016\u201318.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walterpless.com.au/2015/march/clarence-united-replace-glenorchy-knights-in-victory-league.html|author=Walter Pless|accessdate=2015-08-05|title=Clarence United replace Glenorchy Knights in Victory League|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417053442/http://www.walterpless.com.au/2015/march/clarence-united-replace-glenorchy-knights-in-victory-league.html|archive-date=17 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victory League logo.png|thumbnail|Logo used between 2012\u20132014]] -->\n\nUp until 2017, the top teams in the league also qualified for a Tasmanian end of season finals series.  Between 2013\u201315 the winner of the local finals series was awarded the '''Victory Cup'''.  In 2013 and 2014 the top four teams participated in the finals series.  In 2015 the finals series has been expanded to include the top six teams in the league as well as the champions of the [[Northern Championship]] and [[Southern Championship]].  In 2016, the end of season finals series cup was renamed the '''League Cup''' due to lapsing sponsorship arrangements,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballfedtas.com.au/index.php?id=15&tx_ttnews%5Byear%5D=2016&tx_ttnews%5Bmonth%5D=08&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1502&cHash=9064820d5ae8093db320280e6ec0be40|title=CEO Update August 9|publisher=[[Football Federation Tasmania]]}}</ref> and scrapped entirely after the end of the 2017 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/5579528/league-cups-end-confirmed/|title=League Cup\u2019s end confirmed|publisher=The Advocate|author=Andrew Mathieson|date=10 August 2018|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nIn late 2016, FFT announced they will expand the league to ten teams and introduce a promotion/relegation system.  The winner of the 2018 Southern and Northern Championships will be promoted into NPL Tasmania and the competition will expand to ten teams in 2019.  From the end of the 2019 season the winners of the Northern and Southern Championships will play-off against each other with the winner then automatically replacing the last placed finisher in the NPL Tasmania whilst the loser of the Northern and Southern Championships Play-off will play an additional play-off for a place in the NPL Tasmania in the following season against the second last NPL Tasmania club.<ref name=\"TAS_2019\"/>\n\nFrom 2019 onwards, the league consists of ten clubs geographically spread throughout Tasmania.  The team on top of the table is considered the league champion and qualifies to play in the [[National Premier Leagues]] finals series against the champions of the other states.\n\n==Sponsorship==\nThe official sponsor for the league between 2013\u20132015 was [[A-League]] club [[Melbourne Victory]].<ref>http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8505237{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Redline Coaches|Tasmanian Redline]] is the official sponsor for transport.<ref>http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/08/03/351231_soccer.html</ref>  In 2015 the League is also included as part of [[PlayStation 4|Sony PlayStation 4]] sponsorship of the [[National Premier Leagues]].\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 the League had centralised apparel providers to all teams being Pelada and Jemsz respectively.

Named in honor of the [[Arizona|48th state]]'s recent admission into the union, the ship was the second and last of the ''Pennsylvania'' class of \"[[super-dreadnought]]\" battleships. Although [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1916, the ship remained stateside during [[World War I]]. Shortly after the end of the war, ''Arizona'' was one of a number of American ships that briefly escorted President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The ship was sent to Turkey in 1919 at the beginning of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]] to represent American interests for several months. Several years later, she was transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] and remained there for the rest of her career.\n\nAside from a comprehensive modernization in 1929\u20131931, ''Arizona'' was regularly used for training exercises between the wars, including the annual [[Fleet Problem]]s (training exercises). When an earthquake [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|struck Long Beach, California]], on 10 March 1933, ''Arizona''{{'}}s crew provided aid to the survivors. In July 1934, the ship was featured in a [[James Cagney]] film, ''[[Here Comes the Navy]]'', about the romantic troubles of a sailor. In April 1940, she and the rest of the Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, as a deterrent to [[Japanese Empire|Japanese imperialism]].\n\n''Arizona'' was hit by Japanese [[torpedo bomber]]s during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941. After one of their bombs detonated in a [[magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]], she exploded violently and sank, with the loss of 1,177&nbsp;officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, ''Arizona'' was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The [[shipwreck|wreck]] still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor beneath the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]].

When the ship sailed near the wreck of the old [[USS Texas (1892)|''San Marcos'']] (ex-''Texas''), the wreck was sometimes used as a target for the 14-inch guns. ''Arizona'' rarely ventured into the ocean for fear of [[U-boat]]s, and when she did, it was only in the company of other battleships and escort ships. Four coal-fired American dreadnoughts (it was easier to obtain coal than oil in the United Kingdom) were eventually sent across the Atlantic in December 1917 as [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division Nine]], but ''Arizona'' was not among them. Life for ''Arizona''{{'}}s crew was not all training, as the [[Rowing (sport)|race-boat]] team from ''Arizona'' was able to win the [[Battenberg Cup]] in July 1918 by beating the team from {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}} by three lengths over the three-mile course.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 22\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe fighting ended on 11 November 1918 with [[Armistice with Germany|an armistice]].

In April, ''Arizona''{{'}}s crew won the Battenberg Cup rowing competition for the second straight year before the ship was deployed to France once again to escort President Wilson back to the United States. While the ship was awaiting Wilson's departure, she was redeployed to Smyrna (now [[Izmir]]) in Turkey in response to tensions between Greece and Italy over the awarding of Smyrna to Greece in the [[Paris Peace Treaty]].<ref>Stillwell, pp. 41\u201343.</ref> The Greek and Italian governments had each deployed a major warship to the area ([[Greek cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']] and [[Italian battleship Caio Duilio|''Caio Duilio'']], respectively) to enforce their interests. Shortly after ''Arizona'' arrived, Greek ground forces arrived in transports and [[Greek landing at Smyrna|were off-loaded]] in the port. The resultant chaos in the city caused many American citizens in the area to seek shelter on board ''Arizona''.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nWhen the crisis abated, ''Arizona'' was ordered to Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]) before she sailed for home on 15 June. She put into the New York Navy Yard on 30 June for an overhaul, where six 5-inch guns were removed and the fire control system was modernized. Work was completed in January 1920 and the battleship sailed south to Guantanamo Bay for crew training. During this time, ''Arizona'' was fitted with a [[Flight deck#Early flight decks|flying-off platform]] similar to the one given to ''Texas'' in March 1919. In April, ''Arizona'' lost the Battenberg Cup to ''Nevada'', and in June she was present for the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]]'s graduation ceremonies. In August she became the flagship of [[United States Battleship Division Seven|Battleship Division Seven]], although it was only later in 1920 that the battleship was refitted to be an admiral's flagship.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 45, 48, 51, 56\u201357.</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Arizona (BB-39) - NH 86101.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' with ship's complement (1924)]]\nIn company with six battleships and eighteen destroyers, ''Arizona'' was sent south again to transit the [[Panama Canal]] in January 1921. After meeting up with the Pacific Fleet, ''Arizona'' continued on to Peru for a week before the two fleets combined to practice battle maneuvers. After a short return to the Atlantic, which included an overhaul in New York, ''Arizona'', under the command of [[Jehu V. Chase]], returned to Peru in the summer before she began operating from her new home port of [[San Pedro, California]], part of Los Angeles, where she was based until 1940.<ref name=\"DANFS\" /><ref>Stillwell, pp. 61, 64, 66\u201368.</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the 1920s, ''Arizona''{{'}}s service consisted of routine training exercises. Naval historian Paul Stillwell remarked that \"the Pacific years included a great deal of sameness and repetition\", and his chronology of the ship's movements is filled with phrases like \"torpedo-defense practice\", \"battle-practice rehearsal\", \"gunnery practice\", \"en route to\u2026\", and \"anchored at\u2026\".<ref>Stillwell, pp. 69, 300\u2013314.</ref> A recurring theme in these years were the annual Fleet Problems, which began in 1923 and simulated large fleet actions by having most of the active fleet face off against each other. The first two simulated an attack on the Panama Canal from the west, while in 1925 they attempted to defend the Hawaiian Islands. Other 1920s Fleet Problems included the Caribbean, near Central America, the [[West Indies]], and Hawaii. On 27 July 1923 the ship, under command of [[John Russell Young Blakely|John Y.R. Blakely]], joined President [[Warren G. Harding]]'s naval review in Seattle. Harding died just one week later, and ''Arizona'' joined the Pacific Fleet to fire a salute in his honor on 3 August.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nSometime in early March 1924, a [[Madeline Blair|woman]] stowed away, trading sex for a free voyage to San Pedro until she was discovered on 12 April while the ship was anchored in [[Balboa, Panama]]. She was sent back to New York City and Captain Percy Olmstead later convened [[courts-martial]] for 23 sailors once the ship began her refit in the [[Bremerton Navy Yard]], which imposed sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment. Admiral [[Henry A. Wiley]], commander of the [[Battle Fleet]], issued a [[letter of reprimand]] to all officers of the ship, including future Admiral and [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Arleigh Burke]], then an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]]. Admiral [[William V. Pratt]], then in command of the [[division (naval)|division]] to which ''Arizona'' was assigned, thought the penalties excessive, and he ordered the reprimands stricken from the officer's records when he became Chief of Naval Operations in 1930.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 74, 78\u201381, 303.</ref>\n\n== Modernization ==\n[[File:USS Arizona (BB-39) being modernized in 1930.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' being modernized in Norfolk, June 1930]]\nFour months after [[Fleet Problem IX]] in January 1929, ''Arizona'' was modernized at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" /> New tripod masts, surmounted by three-tiered [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control directors]] for the main and secondary armament, replaced the old [[Hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid]] [[cage mast]]s; the number of five-inch guns was reduced to 12 and the guns re-positioned one deck higher, and eight 25-caliber [[5\"/25 caliber gun (United States)|five-inch]] [[anti-aircraft guns]] replaced the three-inch guns with which she had been originally equipped. These changes increased her crew to 92 officers and 1,639 enlisted men.<ref name=\"s60\" /> The ship's main gun turrets were modified to increase the maximum elevation of their guns to 30\u00b0.<ref name=f71/> The compressed-air catapult on the quarterdeck was replaced by one that used [[black powder]].<ref>Stillwell, p. 111.</ref> Her deck armor was increased by the addition of a {{convert|1.75|in|adj=on}} thickness of [[Special Treatment Steel]], and the ship was [[anti-torpedo bulge|bulged]] to protect her from torpedoes. An additional bulkhead was added to the sides of the boiler rooms for the same purpose. At the same stroke, her own outfit of two submerged torpedo tubes was removed during this refit in light of a new appreciation that anticipated battleship engagement ranges made their future use improbable.  This alteration also permitted the large transverse flat in which the tubes had been situated to be subdivided to reduce risks of flooding in action.<ref>Stillwell.  pp. 110-111.</ref>  ''Arizona''{{'}}s machinery was almost entirely replaced; her high-pressure turbines were replaced by more powerful geared turbines from the cancelled battleship {{USS|Washington|BB-47|2}}, and six new boilers replaced her originals.

The President visited [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. Returning on 29 March, ''Arizona'' conducted her sea trials at [[Rockland, Maine]], and had another catapult fitted on the top of Turret III, before she was transferred to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] in August with her sister ''Pennsylvania''. In February 1932, the ship participated in Grand Joint Exercise No. 4 in which carrier aircraft successfully attacked [[Pearl Harbor]] on Sunday morning, 7 February. After returning to the West Coast from Fleet Problem&nbsp;XIV in 1933, the ship was anchored in San Pedro when an earthquake struck nearby [[Long Beach, California]], on 10 March. Sailors from the ship joined the relief efforts, providing food, treating the injured and providing security from looters.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 112\u2013120, 124, 128\u2013129.</ref>\n\nIn early 1934, the ship and her crew were featured in a [[James Cagney]] film for Warner Brothers, ''[[Here Comes the Navy]]'', which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on-board location shots. In the early morning of 26 July, ''Arizona'' collided with a [[fishing trawler]], ''Umatilla'', that was under tow by another trawler off [[Cape Flattery]]. Two men aboard ''Umatilla'' were killed in the collision and the Navy convened a [[Court of Inquiry (Naval)|Court of Inquiry]] to investigate the incident. The court recommended that the ship's captain, Captain [[MacGillivray Milne]], be court-martialed. This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, [[Cuba]], while the ship was participating in that year's Fleet Problem off the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast. In the meantime, [[Rear Admiral]] [[Samuel W. Bryant]] assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September, with ''Arizona'' as his flagship.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 133\u2013142, 183, 185, 321.</ref>\n\nRear Admiral [[George T. Pettengill]] relieved Bryant on 4 March 1935 and the ship participated in Fleet Problem XVI two months later. ''Arizona'' made a port visit to Balboa in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII. On 8 June, Captain [[George A. Alexander]] relieved Baum as captain, and, 15 days later, Rear Admiral [[Claude C. Bloch]] relieved Pettengill. During gunnery practice on 24 July, the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret, burning one crewman. The turret's sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, but the water leaked into the turret's electrical switchboard and started a small fire that was easily put out. Due to the navy's limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In [[Fiscal Year]] 1936\u201337, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship spent the rest of her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 190\u201391, 196, 322\u2013331.</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Arizona after 1931 modernization NARA 19-LC-19B-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' in 1931 after her modernization]]\nOn 2 January 1937, Rear Admiral [[John Greenslade]] assumed command of Battleship Division Two from Bloch and transferred his flag to the battleship {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}} on 13 April. Rear Admiral [[Manley H. Simons]], commander of Battleship Division One, transferred his flag to ''Arizona'' on 7 August. He was relieved by Rear Admiral [[Adolphus Wilson]] on 8 November. Captain [[Alfred Winsor Brown]] relieved Baum on 11 December. The ship participated in Fleet Problem XIX off Hawaii in April\u2013May 1938. Captain Brown died in his sleep on 7 September and Captain [[Isaac C. Kidd]] assumed command of the ship on 17 September 1938. That same day, Rear Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] assumed command of Battleship Division One.

Flying at an estimated altitude of {{convert|3000|m|sp=us}}, ''Kaga''{{'}}s aircraft bombed ''Arizona'' from amidships to stern. Soon after, ''Hiry\u016b''{{'}}s bombers hit the bow area.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 274\u2013276.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft scored four hits and three near misses on and around ''Arizona''. The near miss off the port bow is thought to have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a small fire. The next forward most hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating in the area of the anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 273\u2013275.</ref>{{refn|The preliminary damage report, filed on 28 January 1942, listed seven bomb hits as well one [[torpedo]] hit on the port bow forward. This last hit was based on a report from the captain of the [[repair ship]] {{USS|Vestal|AR-4|2}} moored alongside and could not be verified at the time. One bomb was thought to have gone down the stack, but this was contradicted when the ship's superstructure was salvaged in 1942 and the [[funnel (ship)|funnel cap]] was found to be intact.<ref>Reproduced in Wright, pp. 275\u2013276.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\n=== Magazine explosion ===\n[[File:Pearlharborcolork13513.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|''Arizona''{{'}}s forward magazines explode in a still from a film made during the attack]]\nThe last bomb hit at 08:06 in the vicinity of Turret II, likely penetrating the armored deck near the magazines located in the forward section of the ship. While not enough of the ship is intact to judge the exact location, its effects are indisputable: about seven seconds after the hit, the forward magazines detonated in a cataclysmic explosion, mostly venting through the sides of the ship and destroying much of the interior structure of the forward part of the ship. This caused the forward turrets and conning tower to collapse downward some {{convert|25|-|30|ft|1}} and the foremast and funnel to collapse forward, effectively tearing the ship in half.<ref name=\"s78\">Stillwell, pp. 277\u2013278.</ref> The explosion touched off fierce fires that burned for two days; debris showered down on Ford Island in the vicinity. The blast from this explosion also put out fires on the repair ship ''Vestal'', which was moored alongside.<ref>Prange, pp. 513\u2013514.</ref> The bombs and subsequent explosion killed 1,177 of the 1,512 crewmen on board at the time, approximately half of the lives lost during the attack.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' burning after the Japanese attack]]\nTwo competing theories have arisen about the cause of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black-powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the [[smokeless powder]] magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy [[Bureau of Ships]] report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The [[Naval History and Heritage Command]] explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine.<ref name=\"navalhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-az.htm |title=Pearl Harbor Raid, 7 December 1941, USS Arizona during the Pearl Harbor Attack |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901132555/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-az.htm |archivedate=1 September 2010 |df= }}</ref> The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode.<ref>Wright, pp. 287\u2013288, 60\u201361</ref> It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine the cause of the magazine explosion.<ref name=\"s78\" /><ref>Friedman, p. 6.</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\n[[File:USSArizonaSinkingsimple.png|thumb|right|Simplistic representation of the explosion on ''Arizona''.]]\nAfter the attack, several sailors received medals for their conduct and actions under fire.

Named in honor of the [[Arizona|48th state]]'s recent admission into the union, the ship was the second and last of the ''Pennsylvania'' class of \"[[super-dreadnought]]\" battleships. Although [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1916, the ship remained stateside during [[World War I]]. Shortly after the end of the war, ''Arizona'' was one of a number of American ships that briefly escorted President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The ship was sent to Turkey in 1919 at the beginning of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]] to represent American interests for several months. Several years later, she was transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] and remained there for the rest of her career.\n\nAside from a comprehensive modernization in 1929\u20131931, ''Arizona'' was regularly used for training exercises between the wars, including the annual [[Fleet Problem]]s (training exercises). When an earthquake [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|struck Long Beach, California]], on 10 March 1933, ''Arizona''{{'}}s crew provided aid to the survivors. In July 1934, the ship was featured in a [[James Cagney]] film, ''[[Here Comes the Navy]]'', about the romantic troubles of a sailor. In April 1940, she and the rest of the Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, as a deterrent to [[Japanese Empire|Japanese imperialism]].\n\n''Arizona'' was hit by Japanese [[torpedo bomber]]s during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941. After one of their bombs detonated in a [[magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]], she exploded violently and sank, with the loss of 1,177&nbsp;officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, ''Arizona'' was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The [[shipwreck|wreck]] still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor beneath the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]]. Dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, the memorial straddles but does not touch the ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe ''Pennsylvania''-class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors, the {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|4}}.

The waterline [[Belt armor|armor belt]] of [[Krupp armor]] measured {{convert|13.5|in|mm|0}} thick and covered only the ship's machinery spaces and [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. It had a total height of {{convert|17|ft|6|in|1}}, of which {{convert|8|ft|9.75|in|1}} was below the waterline; beginning {{convert|2|ft|4|in|1}} below the waterline, the belt tapered to its minimum thickness of {{convert|8|in|0}}.<ref name=\"f0\" /> The transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] at each end of the ship ranged from 13 to 8&nbsp;inches in thickness. The faces of the gun turrets were {{convert|18|in|0}} thick while the sides were {{convert|9|-|10|in|0}} thick and the turret roofs were protected by {{convert|5|in|0}} of armor. The armor of the [[barbette]]s was {{convert|18|to|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick. The [[conning tower]] was protected by {{convert|16|in|0}} of armor and had a roof eight inches thick.<ref name=\"s9\" />\n\nThe main armor deck was three plates thick with a total thickness of 3 inches; over the steering gear the armor increased to {{convert|6.25|in|0}} in two plates.

Esther Ross, the daughter of an Arizona [[pioneer family]], was given the honors of ship sponsor and christening. To acknowledge a ban on alcohol recently passed by the state legislature, the state's governor decided that two bottles would be used: one full of sparkling wine from Ohio, and another filled with water from the [[Roosevelt Dam]].

Shortly after the war began, eight of her 5-inch guns (the four guns farthest forward and the sternmost four guns) were removed to equip merchant ships. When the ship sailed near the wreck of the old [[USS Texas (1892)|''San Marcos'']] (ex-''Texas''), the wreck was sometimes used as a target for the 14-inch guns. ''Arizona'' rarely ventured into the ocean for fear of [[U-boat]]s, and when she did, it was only in the company of other battleships and escort ships. Four coal-fired American dreadnoughts (it was easier to obtain coal than oil in the United Kingdom) were eventually sent across the Atlantic in December 1917 as [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division Nine]], but ''Arizona'' was not among them. Life for ''Arizona''{{'}}s crew was not all training, as the [[Rowing (sport)|race-boat]] team from ''Arizona'' was able to win the [[Battenberg Cup]] in July 1918 by beating the team from {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}} by three lengths over the three-mile course.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 22\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe fighting ended on 11 November 1918 with [[Armistice with Germany|an armistice]].

In April, ''Arizona''{{'}}s crew won the Battenberg Cup rowing competition for the second straight year before the ship was deployed to France once again to escort President Wilson back to the United States. While the ship was awaiting Wilson's departure, she was redeployed to Smyrna (now [[Izmir]]) in Turkey in response to tensions between Greece and Italy over the awarding of Smyrna to Greece in the [[Paris Peace Treaty]].<ref>Stillwell, pp. 41\u201343.</ref> The Greek and Italian governments had each deployed a major warship to the area ([[Greek cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']] and [[Italian battleship Caio Duilio|''Caio Duilio'']], respectively) to enforce their interests. Shortly after ''Arizona'' arrived, Greek ground forces arrived in transports and [[Greek landing at Smyrna|were off-loaded]] in the port. The resultant chaos in the city caused many American citizens in the area to seek shelter on board ''Arizona''.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nWhen the crisis abated, ''Arizona'' was ordered to Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]) before she sailed for home on 15 June. She put into the New York Navy Yard on 30 June for an overhaul, where six 5-inch guns were removed and the fire control system was modernized. Work was completed in January 1920 and the battleship sailed south to Guantanamo Bay for crew training. During this time, ''Arizona'' was fitted with a [[Flight deck#Early flight decks|flying-off platform]] similar to the one given to ''Texas'' in March 1919. In April, ''Arizona'' lost the Battenberg Cup to ''Nevada'', and in June she was present for the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]]'s graduation ceremonies. In August she became the flagship of [[United States Battleship Division Seven|Battleship Division Seven]], although it was only later in 1920 that the battleship was refitted to be an admiral's flagship.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 45, 48, 51, 56\u201357.</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Arizona (BB-39) - NH 86101.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' with ship's complement (1924)]]\nIn company with six battleships and eighteen destroyers, ''Arizona'' was sent south again to transit the [[Panama Canal]] in January 1921. After meeting up with the Pacific Fleet, ''Arizona'' continued on to Peru for a week before the two fleets combined to practice battle maneuvers. After a short return to the Atlantic, which included an overhaul in New York, ''Arizona'', under the command of [[Jehu V. Chase]], returned to Peru in the summer before she began operating from her new home port of [[San Pedro, California]], part of Los Angeles, where she was based until 1940.<ref name=\"DANFS\" /><ref>Stillwell, pp. 61, 64, 66\u201368.</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the 1920s, ''Arizona''{{'}}s service consisted of routine training exercises. Naval historian Paul Stillwell remarked that \"the Pacific years included a great deal of sameness and repetition\", and his chronology of the ship's movements is filled with phrases like \"torpedo-defense practice\", \"battle-practice rehearsal\", \"gunnery practice\", \"en route to\u2026\", and \"anchored at\u2026\".<ref>Stillwell, pp. 69, 300\u2013314.</ref> A recurring theme in these years were the annual Fleet Problems, which began in 1923 and simulated large fleet actions by having most of the active fleet face off against each other. The first two simulated an attack on the Panama Canal from the west, while in 1925 they attempted to defend the Hawaiian Islands. Other 1920s Fleet Problems included the Caribbean, near Central America, the [[West Indies]], and Hawaii. On 27 July 1923 the ship, under command of [[John Russell Young Blakely|John Y.R. Blakely]], joined President [[Warren G. Harding]]'s naval review in Seattle. Harding died just one week later, and ''Arizona'' joined the Pacific Fleet to fire a salute in his honor on 3 August.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nSometime in early March 1924, a [[Madeline Blair|woman]] stowed away, trading sex for a free voyage to San Pedro until she was discovered on 12 April while the ship was anchored in [[Balboa, Panama]]. She was sent back to New York City and Captain Percy Olmstead later convened [[courts-martial]] for 23 sailors once the ship began her refit in the [[Bremerton Navy Yard]], which imposed sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment. Admiral [[Henry A. Wiley]], commander of the [[Battle Fleet]], issued a [[letter of reprimand]] to all officers of the ship, including future Admiral and [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Arleigh Burke]], then an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]]. Admiral [[William V. Pratt]], then in command of the [[division (naval)|division]] to which ''Arizona'' was assigned, thought the penalties excessive, and he ordered the reprimands stricken from the officer's records when he became Chief of Naval Operations in 1930.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 74, 78\u201381, 303.</ref>\n\n== Modernization ==\n[[File:USS Arizona (BB-39) being modernized in 1930.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' being modernized in Norfolk, June 1930]]\nFour months after [[Fleet Problem IX]] in January 1929, ''Arizona'' was modernized at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" /> New tripod masts, surmounted by three-tiered [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control directors]] for the main and secondary armament, replaced the old [[Hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid]] [[cage mast]]s; the number of five-inch guns was reduced to 12 and the guns re-positioned one deck higher, and eight 25-caliber [[5\"/25 caliber gun (United States)|five-inch]] [[anti-aircraft guns]] replaced the three-inch guns with which she had been originally equipped. These changes increased her crew to 92 officers and 1,639 enlisted men.<ref name=\"s60\" /> The ship's main gun turrets were modified to increase the maximum elevation of their guns to 30\u00b0.<ref name=f71/> The compressed-air catapult on the quarterdeck was replaced by one that used [[black powder]].<ref>Stillwell, p. 111.</ref> Her deck armor was increased by the addition of a {{convert|1.75|in|adj=on}} thickness of [[Special Treatment Steel]], and the ship was [[anti-torpedo bulge|bulged]] to protect her from torpedoes. An additional bulkhead was added to the sides of the boiler rooms for the same purpose. At the same stroke, her own outfit of two submerged torpedo tubes was removed during this refit in light of a new appreciation that anticipated battleship engagement ranges made their future use improbable.  This alteration also permitted the large transverse flat in which the tubes had been situated to be subdivided to reduce risks of flooding in action.<ref>Stillwell.  pp. 110-111.</ref>  ''Arizona''{{'}}s machinery was almost entirely replaced; her high-pressure turbines were replaced by more powerful geared turbines from the cancelled battleship {{USS|Washington|BB-47|2}}, and six new boilers replaced her originals. Their additional power offset the ship's increased displacement as demonstrated during her sea trials; ''Arizona'' made {{convert|20.7|kn}} with {{convert|35081|shp|abbr=on}} at a displacement of {{convert|37654|lt|t}}.<ref name=f71>Friedman, pp. 197, 201.</ref>\n\n== 1930s ==\n[[File:USS Arizona (BB-39) - 80-G-463589.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' after her modernization during the 1930s]]\nOn 19 March 1931, even before ''Arizona'' was put through post-modernization sea trials, she hosted President [[Herbert Hoover]] for a brief vacation in the Caribbean. The President visited [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. Returning on 29 March, ''Arizona'' conducted her sea trials at [[Rockland, Maine]], and had another catapult fitted on the top of Turret III, before she was transferred to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] in August with her sister ''Pennsylvania''. In February 1932, the ship participated in Grand Joint Exercise No. 4 in which carrier aircraft successfully attacked [[Pearl Harbor]] on Sunday morning, 7 February. After returning to the West Coast from Fleet Problem&nbsp;XIV in 1933, the ship was anchored in San Pedro when an earthquake struck nearby [[Long Beach, California]], on 10 March. Sailors from the ship joined the relief efforts, providing food, treating the injured and providing security from looters.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 112\u2013120, 124, 128\u2013129.</ref>\n\nIn early 1934, the ship and her crew were featured in a [[James Cagney]] film for Warner Brothers, ''[[Here Comes the Navy]]'', which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on-board location shots. In the early morning of 26 July, ''Arizona'' collided with a [[fishing trawler]], ''Umatilla'', that was under tow by another trawler off [[Cape Flattery]]. Two men aboard ''Umatilla'' were killed in the collision and the Navy convened a [[Court of Inquiry (Naval)|Court of Inquiry]] to investigate the incident. The court recommended that the ship's captain, Captain [[MacGillivray Milne]], be court-martialed. This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, [[Cuba]], while the ship was participating in that year's Fleet Problem off the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast. In the meantime, [[Rear Admiral]] [[Samuel W. Bryant]] assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September, with ''Arizona'' as his flagship.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 133\u2013142, 183, 185, 321.</ref>\n\nRear Admiral [[George T. Pettengill]] relieved Bryant on 4 March 1935 and the ship participated in Fleet Problem XVI two months later. ''Arizona'' made a port visit to Balboa in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII. On 8 June, Captain [[George A. Alexander]] relieved Baum as captain, and, 15 days later, Rear Admiral [[Claude C. Bloch]] relieved Pettengill. During gunnery practice on 24 July, the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret, burning one crewman. The turret's sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, but the water leaked into the turret's electrical switchboard and started a small fire that was easily put out. Due to the navy's limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In [[Fiscal Year]] 1936\u201337, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship spent the rest of her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 190\u201391, 196, 322\u2013331.</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Arizona after 1931 modernization NARA 19-LC-19B-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' in 1931 after her modernization]]\nOn 2 January 1937, Rear Admiral [[John Greenslade]] assumed command of Battleship Division Two from Bloch and transferred his flag to the battleship {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}} on 13 April. Rear Admiral [[Manley H. Simons]], commander of Battleship Division One, transferred his flag to ''Arizona'' on 7 August. He was relieved by Rear Admiral [[Adolphus Wilson]] on 8 November. Captain [[Alfred Winsor Brown]] relieved Baum on 11 December. The ship participated in Fleet Problem XIX off Hawaii in April\u2013May 1938. Captain Brown died in his sleep on 7 September and Captain [[Isaac C. Kidd]] assumed command of the ship on 17 September 1938. That same day, Rear Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] assumed command of Battleship Division One. Nimitz was relieved on 27 May 1939 by Rear Admiral [[Russell Willson]].<ref>Stillwell, pp. 324\u2013330.</ref>\n\n''Arizona''{{'}}s last fleet problem was off Hawaii in April\u2013May 1940.

On board ''Arizona'', the ship's air raid alarm went off at about 07:55, and the ship went to [[general quarters]] soon after. Shortly after 08:00, 10 [[Nakajima B5N2]] \"Kate\" torpedo bombers,<ref>{{cite web |title=Battle of Midway, 3-6 June 1942 Composition of Japanese Naval Forces |publisher=Naval History And Heritage Command |date=14 February 2018 |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/c/composition-of-japanese-forces.html |accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> five each from the carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}, attacked ''Arizona''. All of the aircraft were carrying {{convert|41|cm|adj=on|sp=us|1}} [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] shells modified into {{convert|797|kg|adj=on}} bombs. Flying at an estimated altitude of {{convert|3000|m|sp=us}}, ''Kaga''{{'}}s aircraft bombed ''Arizona'' from amidships to stern. Soon after, ''Hiry\u016b''{{'}}s bombers hit the bow area.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 274\u2013276.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft scored four hits and three near misses on and around ''Arizona''. The near miss off the port bow is thought to have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a small fire. The next forward most hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating in the area of the anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.<ref>Stillwell, pp. 273\u2013275.</ref>{{refn|The preliminary damage report, filed on 28 January 1942, listed seven bomb hits as well one [[torpedo]] hit on the port bow forward. This last hit was based on a report from the captain of the [[repair ship]] {{USS|Vestal|AR-4|2}} moored alongside and could not be verified at the time. One bomb was thought to have gone down the stack, but this was contradicted when the ship's superstructure was salvaged in 1942 and the [[funnel (ship)|funnel cap]] was found to be intact.<ref>Reproduced in Wright, pp. 275\u2013276.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\n=== Magazine explosion ===\n[[File:Pearlharborcolork13513.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|''Arizona''{{'}}s forward magazines explode in a still from a film made during the attack]]\nThe last bomb hit at 08:06 in the vicinity of Turret II, likely penetrating the armored deck near the magazines located in the forward section of the ship. While not enough of the ship is intact to judge the exact location, its effects are indisputable: about seven seconds after the hit, the forward magazines detonated in a cataclysmic explosion, mostly venting through the sides of the ship and destroying much of the interior structure of the forward part of the ship. This caused the forward turrets and conning tower to collapse downward some {{convert|25|-|30|ft|1}} and the foremast and funnel to collapse forward, effectively tearing the ship in half.<ref name=\"s78\">Stillwell, pp. 277\u2013278.</ref> The explosion touched off fierce fires that burned for two days; debris showered down on Ford Island in the vicinity. The blast from this explosion also put out fires on the repair ship ''Vestal'', which was moored alongside.<ref>Prange, pp. 513\u2013514.</ref> The bombs and subsequent explosion killed 1,177 of the 1,512 crewmen on board at the time, approximately half of the lives lost during the attack.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Arizona'' burning after the Japanese attack]]\nTwo competing theories have arisen about the cause of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black-powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the [[smokeless powder]] magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy [[Bureau of Ships]] report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The [[Naval History and Heritage Command]] explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine.<ref name=\"navalhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-az.htm |title=Pearl Harbor Raid, 7 December 1941, USS Arizona during the Pearl Harbor Attack |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901132555/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-az.htm |archivedate=1 September 2010 |df= }}</ref> The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode.<ref>Wright, pp. 287\u2013288, 60\u201361</ref> It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine the cause of the magazine explosion.<ref name=\"s78\" /><ref>Friedman, p. 6.</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\n[[File:USSArizonaSinkingsimple.png|thumb|right|Simplistic representation of the explosion on ''Arizona''.]]\nAfter the attack, several sailors received medals for their conduct and actions under fire.

The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities.

A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

After its dissolution in December 1991, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1981).

[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/02/04.htm \"The Tasks of Business Executives\"].</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45.

The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates.

[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/02/04.htm \"The Tasks of Business Executives\"].</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries. The congress established [[African independence movements|national liberation]] as the main topic of their sessions, emphasizing the elimination and exploitation by the imperialist powers over authentic national sovereignty. However, they did not establish clear social or political parameters for this new liberation.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/>\n\nAfrican leaders consistently viewed socialism as a direct rejection of the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial system]] and in turn dismissed the notion of creating independent capitalist systems throughout the continent. They attempted to infuse various forms of socialism\u2014some Marxist\u2013Leninist, others democratic\u2014into tailored ideologies specific to each country.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/> Once these systems were in place, countries developed towards a \"focal institutional\" society. According to sociologist William Friedland, societies adopted a totalitarian vision of rule, allowing one-party systems and institutions to \"penetrate every sphere of private or public activity\".<ref name=\"Gregor\">{{cite journal|last=Gregor|first=A.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources. He maintained that \"production for private profit deprives a large section of the people of the goods and services produced\", advocating public ownership to fit the \"people's needs\".<ref name=\"Kwame\">{{cite book|last=Nkrumah|first=Kwame|title=Africa Must Unite|url=https://archive.org/details/africamustunite00nkru|url-access=registration|date=1963|publisher=Frederick A.

He argued that if people submitted and accepted the singular party's program, political independence would be possible.<ref name=\"Kwame\"/> By 1965, his one-party rule had produced an Assembly entirely made up of his own party members <ref name=\"Bretton\">{{cite book|last1=Bretton|first1=Henry L.|title=The Rise and Fall of Kwame Nkrumah|date=1966|publisher=Frederick A.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway. With the power to set the agenda, the authoritarian party often clashed with these emerging regional groups, ultimately undermining the one-party system.<ref name=\"Redl\"/>\n\n==== Tanzania ====\n[[Julius Nyerere]] attempted to socialist reform for [[Tanzania]] following those in [[Ghana]] and [[Senegal]]. The tenets of his initiatives were four-fold:<ref name=Pratt>{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Cranford|title=Julius Nyerere: Reflections on the Legacy of His Socialism|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies|date=1999|volume=33|issue=1|page=139}}</ref>\n# Promote the Tanzanian economy.\n# Secure state control over development.\n# Create a sole political party called the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU) which would be under his control.\n# Share the benefits of all gathered income.\n\nThe system\u2014called ujaama\u2014became a tool for nationalization of the [[Tanzanian]] people. In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

The design was first proposed in 1988 by [[John K. Ousterhout]] and Fred Douglis and first implemented in 1992 by Ousterhout and [[Mendel Rosenblum]] for the Unix-like [[Sprite (operating system)|Sprite]] distributed operating system.<ref name=\"rblub\">{{citation|title=The Design and Implementation of a Log-Structured File System|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/LFS.pdf|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|year = 1991|first1 = Mendel Rosenblum.|last1 =John K. Ousterhout}}</ref>\n\n== Rationale ==\nConventional file systems tend to lay out files with great care for spatial locality and make in-place changes to their data structures in order to perform well on optical and magnetic disks, which tend to seek relatively slowly.\n\nThe design of log-structured file systems is based on the hypothesis that this will no longer be effective because ever-increasing memory sizes on modern computers would lead to I/O becoming write-heavy because reads would be almost always satisfied from memory cache.  A log-structured file system thus treats its storage as a [[Circular buffer|circular log]] and writes sequentially to the head of the log.\n\nThis has several important side effects:\n* Write throughput on optical and magnetic disks is improved because they can be batched into large sequential runs and costly seeks are kept to a minimum.\n** The structure is naturally suited to media with [[append-only]] zones or pages, such as [[flash storage]]s and [[shingled magnetic recording]] HDDs\n* Writes create multiple, chronologically-advancing versions of both file data and meta-data.  Some implementations make these old file versions nameable and accessible, a feature sometimes called time-travel or [[snapshot (computer storage)|snapshotting]]. This is very similar to a [[versioning file system]].\n* Recovery from crashes is simpler.  Upon its next mount, the file system does not need to walk all its data structures to fix any inconsistencies, but can reconstruct its state from the last consistent point in the log.\n\nLog-structured file systems, however, must reclaim free space from the tail of the log to prevent the file system from becoming full when the head of the log wraps around to meet it.  The tail can release space and move forward by skipping over data for which newer versions exist farther ahead in the log.  If there are no newer versions, then the data is moved and appended to the head.\n\nTo reduce the overhead incurred by this [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], most implementations avoid purely circular logs and divide up their storage into segments.  The head of the log simply advances into non-adjacent segments which are already free.  If space is needed, the least-full segments are reclaimed first.  This decreases the I/O load (and decreases the [[write amplification]]) of the garbage collector, but becomes increasingly ineffective as the file system fills up and nears capacity.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n\nThe [[design rationale]] for log-structured file systems assumes that most reads will be optimized away by ever-enlarging memory caches.  This assumption does not always hold:\n* On magnetic media\u2014where seeks are relatively expensive\u2014the log structure may actually make reads much slower, since it [[fragmentation (computer)#External fragmentation|fragments]] files that conventional file systems normally keep contiguous with in-place writes.\n* On flash memory\u2014where seek times are usually negligible\u2014the log structure may not confer a worthwhile performance gain because write fragmentation has much less of an impact on write throughput. Another issue is stacking log on top of another log isn't a very good idea as it forces multiple erases with unaligned access.<ref name=\"logonlog\">{{citation|title=Don\u2019t stack your Log on my Log|url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/inflow14/inflow14-yang.pdf|publisher=SanDisk Corporation|year = 2014|first1 = Jingpei Yang|last1 =Swaminathan Sundararaman}}</ref>  However many flash based devices cannot rewrite part of a block, and they must first perform a (slow) erase cycle of each block before being able to re-write, so by putting all the writes in one block, this can help performance as opposed to writes scattered into various blocks, each one of which must be copied into a buffer, erased, and written back, which is a clear advantage for so-called \"raw\" flash memory where flash translation layer is bypassed.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of log-structured file systems]]\n* [[Comparison of file systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-lfs.pdf  Log-structured File Systems (2014), Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H.; Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C.; Arpaci-Dusseau Books]\n\n{{File systems}}\n\n[[Category:Computer file systems]]\n[[Category:Bell Labs]]\n[[Category:Fault-tolerant computer systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the general concept of log-structured file systems|the NetBSD file system|Log-structured File System (BSD)|the Linux log-structured Flash file system|LogFS}}\n\nA '''log-structured filesystem''' is a [[file system]] in which data and metadata are written sequentially to a [[circular buffer]], called a log.

This decreases the I/O load (and decreases the [[write amplification]]) of the garbage collector, but becomes increasingly ineffective as the file system fills up and nears capacity.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n\nThe [[design rationale]] for log-structured file systems assumes that most reads will be optimized away by ever-enlarging memory caches.  This assumption does not always hold:\n* On magnetic media\u2014where seeks are relatively expensive\u2014the log structure may actually make reads much slower, since it [[fragmentation (computer)#External fragmentation|fragments]] files that conventional file systems normally keep contiguous with in-place writes.\n* On flash memory\u2014where seek times are usually negligible\u2014the log structure may not confer a worthwhile performance gain because write fragmentation has much less of an impact on write throughput. Another issue is stacking log on top of another log isn't a very good idea as it forces multiple erases with unaligned access.<ref name=\"logonlog\">{{citation|title=Don\u2019t stack your Log on my Log|url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/inflow14/inflow14-yang.pdf|publisher=SanDisk Corporation|year = 2014|first1 = Jingpei Yang|last1 =Swaminathan Sundararaman}}</ref>  However many flash based devices cannot rewrite part of a block, and they must first perform a (slow) erase cycle of each block before being able to re-write, so by putting all the writes in one block, this can help performance as opposed to writes scattered into various blocks, each one of which must be copied into a buffer, erased, and written back, which is a clear advantage for so-called \"raw\" flash memory where flash translation layer is bypassed.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of log-structured file systems]]\n* [[Comparison of file systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-lfs.pdf  Log-structured File Systems (2014), Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H.; Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C.; Arpaci-Dusseau Books]\n\n{{File systems}}\n\n[[Category:Computer file systems]]\n[[Category:Bell Labs]]\n[[Category:Fault-tolerant computer systems]]\n", "name_user": "Artoria2e5", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system"}
