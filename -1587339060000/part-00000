Only [[Moses Tanui]] and trailing off the back [[Salvatore Antibo]] managed to stay in contact.  More than 60 metres back, [[Arturo Barrios]] led the chase pack.  As Tanui came up behind Boutayeb to tighten the lead group of three, Boutayeb went around Kimeli.  The two Kenyans ran together in chase for part of a lap then Tanui was unable to keep up with the accelerated pace.  Kimeli managed to keep close to Boutayeb but ever so slightly was losing ground.  As Tanui faded, Antibo accelerated to move himself into a stronger medal position.  By 5 laps to go, Antibo closed down on Kimeli.  The two were jockeying for the position, Antibo first sprinting past Kimeli, then Kimeli accelerating away from Antibo.  Boutayeb entered the last lap with a 20-metre lead and ran the last lap checking behind him.  Coming down the home stretch, realizing the world record was out of reach, he slowed the last 30 metres and celebrated, blowing kisses to the crowd.  Behind him, Antibo made one more move, sprinting around Kimeli, sprinting for home for the silver.  Kimeli was unable to respond and cruised home for bronze still more than eleven seconds up on [[Jean-Louis Prianon]] and the best sprinting efforts of the rest of the pack.\n\n==Medalists==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; font-size:110%;\" width=\"35%\"\n|-\n|{{OlympicGoldMedalist|[[Brahim Boutayeb]]|MAR|1988 Summer}}\n|-\n|{{OlympicSilverMedalist|[[Salvatore Antibo]]|ITA|1988 Summer}}\n|-\n|{{OlympicBronzeMedalist|[[Kipkemboi Kimeli]]|KEN|1988 Summer}}\n|}\n\n==Records==\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

It resulted in the complete destruction of the Armenian-populated quarters of Shusha and the elimination of the town's Armenian population.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Armenian boroughs of city of Shusha destroyed by Azerbaijani armed forces in 1920 with defiled cathedral of Holy Savior on background.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Armenian half of Shusha destroyed by Azerbaijani armed forces in 1920, with the defiled cathedral of the Holy Savior and Aguletsots church in the background]]\n[[File:Ruins of Armenian part of Shusha after 1920 pogrom 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Ruins of Armenian part of Shusha after the 1920 pogrom.

Shusha&nbsp;\u2013 the territory's largest settlement, its capital, and with a mixed population consisting mostly of ethnic Armenians and Azeris&nbsp;\u2013 found themselves at the centre of the dispute.\n\nThe government of Azerbaijan proclaimed in [[Baku]] the [[annexation]] of the disputed territory and, on January 15, 1919, appointed [[Khosrov bek Sultanov]],<ref name=\"Armenia 1990, page 270\">\"Armenia: The Survival of a Nation\", revised second edition, 1990, by Christopher J. Walker, page 270</ref> as governor-general of Karabagh. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] had a small detachment of troops stationed in Shusha and acceeded to Sultanov's appointment as provisional governor, but insisted that a final decision on the territory's ownership should be decided only at a future peace conference.\n\nIn response to Sultanov's appointment, the General Assembly of the Armenians of Karabagh ([[Armenian National Council of Karabagh]]), meeting in Shusha on February 19, \"rejected with legitimate indignation all pretence of Azerbaijan with regard to Armenian Karabagh, which said Assembly has declared an integral part of Armenia\".<ref>[http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/fr/nk/nk_file/article/11.html \"letter from Avetis Aharonian, president of the delegation of the Republic of Armenia, addressed to the presidents of the delegations of Italy, France, England, and the U.S.\"]</ref>\n\nOn April 23, 1919, the National Council of [[Karabagh]] met again in Shusha and again rejected  Azerbaijan's claim of [[sovereignty]], insisting on their right of [[self-determination]]. After this, a local [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] detachment encircled the [[Armenians|Armenian]] quarters of Shusha, demanding the inhabitants to surrender the fortress. Shots were fired, but when the British mediated, Armenians agreed to surrender to them instead.<ref name=\"Armenia 1990, page 270\"/>\n\nOn the 4 and 5 June 1919, armed clashes occurred in Shusha between the two communities and Sultanov began a blockade of the town's Armenian quarters. American nurses working in Shusha for [[American Committee for Relief in the Near East|Near East Relief]] wrote of a massacre \"by [[Tartars]] of 700 of the Christian inhabitants of the town\".<ref>[[s:The New York Times/Nurses stuck to post|The New York Times, Sept. 4, 1919. \"Nurses stuck to post\"]]</ref> A cease-fire was quickly organised after the Armenian side agreed to Sultanov's condition that members of the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians|Armenian National Council]] leave the town. However, a new wave of violence then swept through neighbouring Armenian-populated villages: in mid-June [[Azeri]] mounted \"irregulars\", about 2,000 strong, [[Khaibalikend Massacre|attacked, looted and burnt]] a large Armenian village, [[Qeybal\u0131|Khaibalikend]], just outside Shusha, and approximately 600 Armenians lay dead.<ref name=\"Armenia 1990, page 270\"/>\n\nThe seventh Congress of the Armenians of Karabagh was convened in Shusha on 13 August 1919. It concluded with the agreement of 22 August, according to which Nagorno-Karabagh would consider itself to be provisionally within the borders of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] until its final status was decided at the Peace Conference in Paris.\n\nOn 19 February 1920 Sultanov issued a demand that the Armenian National Council of Karabagh \"urgently to solve the question of the final incorporation of Karabagh into Azerbaijan\".<ref name=\"Nagorno Karabagh in 1918-1920\">[http://nkr.am/eng/history/1918.htm \"Nagorno Karabagh in 1918\u20131920\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124213324/http://nkr.am/eng/history/1918.htm |date=2008-01-24 }}</ref> The Council, at their eighth congress held from 23 February to 4 March, responded that Azerbaijan's demand violated the terms of the 22nd August provisional agreement and warned that \"repetition of the events will compel the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabagh to turn to appropriate means for defence\".<ref name=\"Nagorno Karabagh in 1918-1920\"/> Armenians of Karabakh prepared a revolt against the Azerbaijani power.<ref name=\"\u041e\u0432\u0430\u043d\">The Armenian People from ancient to modern times, ed. by prof.

The twenty-six conditions strictly limited the Azerbaijani administrative and military presence in the region and underscored the internal autonomy of Mountainous Karabagh. Violations of those conditions by Azerbaijan culminated in an abortive rebellion in March 1920. In retribution, the Azerbaijani forces burned the beautiful city of [[Shushi]], hanged [[Bishop Vahan]], and massacred much of the population. It was the end of Armenian Shushi.\u00bb</ref>\n\n===Revolt===\nAccording to [[Richard Hovannisian]], the failure at [[Khankendi]] sealed the doom of [[Shusha]]. \"As planned, the [[Martuni Region|Varanda]] militia entered Shushi on the evening of March 22, supposedly to receive its pay and to felicitate Governor-General Sultanov on the occasion of [[Novruz Bairam]]. That same night, about 100 armed men led by Nerses Azbekian slipped into the city to disarm the Azerbaijani garrison in the Armenian quarter. But everything went wrong. The Varanda militiamen spent most of the night eating and drinking and were late in taking up their assigned positions, whereas Azbekian's detachment, failing to link up with the militia, began firing on the Azerbaijani fort from afar, awakening the troops and sending them scurrying to arms. It was only then that the Varanda militiamen were roused and began seizing Azerbaijani officers quartered in Armenian homes. The confusion on both sides continued until dawn, when the Azerbaijanis learned that their garrison at Khankend had held and, heartened, began to spread out into the Armenian quarter. The fighting took the Armenians of Shushi by surprise. Several thousand fled under cover of the dense fog by way of [[Karintak]] into the Varanda countryside.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAudrey L. Altstadt writes, referring to a British correspondent in [[Baku]], that representatives of [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in the region decided that the police of Karabakh should be made up of equal numbers of Armenians and Azerbaijanis; however, in late March 1920, the Armenian half of the police murdered the Azerbaijani half during the latter's traditional [[Novruz Bayram]] holiday celebrations.<ref>Audrey L.

From March 23 to 26, some 2,000 structures were consumed in the flames, including the churches and [[wikt:consistory|consistory]], cultural institutions, schools, libraries, the business section and the grand homes of the merchant class. Bishop Vahan (Ter-Grigorian), long an advocate of accommodation with the Azerbaijani authorities, paid the price of retribution, as his tongue was torn out before his head was cut off and paraded through the streets on a spike. The chief of police, Avetis Ter-Ghukasian, was turned into a human torch, and many intellectuals were among the 500 Armenian victims\".<ref name=\"Hovan\">Richard G. Hovannisian.

Shusha&nbsp;\u2013 the territory's largest settlement, its capital, and with a mixed population consisting mostly of ethnic Armenians and Azeris&nbsp;\u2013 found themselves at the centre of the dispute.\n\nThe government of Azerbaijan proclaimed in [[Baku]] the [[annexation]] of the disputed territory and, on January 15, 1919, appointed [[Khosrov bek Sultanov]], the \"owner of vast tracts of Karabagh ... an ardent [[pan-Turkist]], a friend of the [[Committee of Union and Progress|Ittihadists of Constantinople]], and a terror to all Armenians\",<ref name=\"Armenia 1990, page 270\">\"Armenia: The Survival of a Nation\", revised second edition, 1990, by Christopher J. Walker, page 270</ref> as governor-general of Karabagh. [[The United Kingdom|Britain]] had a small detachment of troops stationed in Shusha and agreed to Sultanov's appointment as provisional governor, but insisted that a final decision on the territory's ownership should be decided only at a future peace conference.\n\nIn response to Sultanov's appointment, the General Assembly of the Armenians of Karabagh ([[Armenian National Council of Karabagh]]), meeting in Shusha on February 19, \"rejected with legitimate indignation all pretence of Azerbaijan with regard to Armenian Karabagh, which said Assembly has declared an integral part of Armenia\".<ref>[http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/fr/nk/nk_file/article/11.html \"letter from Avetis Aharonian, president of the delegation of the Republic of Armenia, addressed to the presidents of the delegations of Italy, France, England, and the U.S.\"]</ref>\n\nOn April 23, 1919, the National Council of [[Karabagh]] met again in Shusha and again rejected  Azerbaijan's claim of [[sovereignty]], insisting on their right of [[self-determination]]. After this, a local [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] detachment encircled the [[Armenians|Armenian]] quarters of Shusha, demanding the inhabitants to surrender the fortress. Shots were fired, but when the British mediated, Armenians agreed to surrender to them.<ref name=\"Armenia 1990, page 270\"/>\n\nOn the 4 and 5 June 1919, armed clashes occurred in Shusha between the two communities and Sultanov began a blockade of the town's Armenian quarters. American nurses working in Shusha for [[American Committee for Relief in the Near East|Near East Relief]] wrote of a massacre \"by [[Tartars]] of 700 of the Christian inhabitants of the town\".<ref>[[s:The New York Times/Nurses stuck to post|The New York Times, Sept. 4, 1919. \"Nurses stuck to post\"]]</ref> A cease-fire was quickly organised after the Armenian side agreed to Sultanov's condition that members of the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians|Armenian National Council]] leave the town. However, a new wave of violence then swept through neighbouring Armenian-populated villages: in mid-June [[Azeri]] mounted \"irregulars\", about 2,000 strong, [[Khaibalikend Massacre|attacked, looted and burnt]] a large Armenian village, [[Qeybal\u0131|Khaibalikend]], just outside Shusha, and approximately 600 Armenians lay dead.<ref name=\"Armenia 1990, page 270\"/>\n\nThe seventh Congress of the Armenians of Karabagh was convened in Shusha on 13 August 1919. It concluded with the agreement of 22 August, according to which Nagorno-Karabagh would consider itself to be provisionally within the borders of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] until its final status was decided at the Peace Conference in Paris.\n\nOn 19 February 1920 Sultanov issued a demand that the Armenian National Council of Karabagh \"urgently to solve the question of the final incorporation of Karabagh into Azerbaijan\".<ref name=\"Nagorno Karabagh in 1918-1920\">[http://nkr.am/eng/history/1918.htm \"Nagorno Karabagh in 1918\u20131920\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124213324/http://nkr.am/eng/history/1918.htm |date=2008-01-24 }}</ref> The Council, at their eighth congress held from 23 February to 4 March, responded that Azerbaijan's demand violated the terms of the 22nd August provisional agreement and warned that \"repetition of the events will compel the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabagh to turn to appropriate means for defence\".<ref name=\"Nagorno Karabagh in 1918-1920\"/> Armenians of Karabakh prepared a revolt against the Azerbaijani power.<ref name=\"\u041e\u0432\u0430\u043d\">The Armenian People from ancient to modern times, ed. by prof.

The twenty-six conditions strictly limited the Azerbaijani administrative and military presence in the region and underscored the internal autonomy of Mountainous Karabagh. Violations of those conditions by Azerbaijan culminated in an abortive rebellion in March 1920. In retribution, the Azerbaijani forces burned the beautiful city of [[Shushi]], hanged [[Bishop Vahan]], and massacred much of the population. It was the end of Armenian Shushi.\u00bb</ref>\n\n===Revolt===\nAccording to [[Richard Hovannisian]], the failure at [[Khankendi]] sealed the doom of [[Shusha]]. \"As planned, the [[Martuni Region|Varanda]] militia entered Shushi on the evening of March 22, supposedly to receive its pay and to felicitate Governor-General Sultanov on the occasion of [[Novruz Bairam]]. That same night, about 100 armed men led by Nerses Azbekian slipped into the city to disarm the Azerbaijani garrison in the Armenian quarter. But everything went wrong. The Varanda militiamen spent most of the night eating and drinking and were late in taking up their assigned positions, whereas Azbekian's detachment, failing to link up with the militia, began firing on the Azerbaijani fort from afar, awakening the troops and sending them scurrying to arms. It was only then that the Varanda militiamen were roused and began seizing Azerbaijani officers quartered in Armenian homes. The confusion on both sides continued until dawn, when the Azerbaijanis learned that their garrison at Khankend had held and, heartened, began to spread out into the Armenian quarter. The fighting took the Armenians of Shushi by surprise. Several thousand fled under cover of the dense fog by way of [[Karintak]] into the Varanda countryside.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAudrey L. Altstadt writes, referring to a British correspondent in [[Baku]], that representatives of [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in the region decided that the police of Karabakh should be made up of equal numbers of Armenians and Azerbaijanis; however, in late March 1920, the Armenian half of the police murdered the Azerbaijani half during the latter's traditional [[Novruz Bayram]] holiday celebrations.<ref>Audrey L.

From March 23 to 26, some 2,000 structures were consumed in the flames, including the churches and [[wikt:consistory|consistory]], cultural institutions, schools, libraries, the business section and the grand homes of the merchant class. Bishop Vahan (Ter-Grigorian), long an advocate of accommodation with the Azerbaijani authorities, paid the price of retribution, as his tongue was torn out before his head was cut off and paraded through the streets on a spike. The chief of police, Avetis Ter-Ghukasian, was turned into a human torch, and many intellectuals were among the 500 Armenian victims\".<ref name=\"Hovan\">Richard G. Hovannisian.

On that occasion an Azerbaijani army rampaged through the Armenian upper town, burning whole streets and killing hundreds of Armenians. When the Russians returned, wearing Bolshevik uniforms, Stepanakert was made the new capital of Nagorny Karabakh. The ruins of the Armenian quarter of Shusha stood, ghostly and untouched, for more than forty years.}}\n\nIn Karabakh, the Armenian community was split between the age-old dilemma of cooperation or confrontation. There were those&nbsp;\u2013 primarily [[Dashnak]]s and villagers&nbsp;\u2013 who wanted unification with [[Armenia]], and those&nbsp;\u2013 mainly [[Bolshevik]]s, [[merchant]]s, and [[professional]]s&nbsp;\u2013 who, in the words of the Armenian historian Richard Hovannisian, \"admitted that the district was economically with eastern [[Transcaucasia]] and sought accommodation with the Azerbaijani government as the only way to spare Mountainous Karabagh from ruin\". The latter group was mainly concentrated in Shusha, but both groups were killed or expelled when an Armenian rebellion was brutally put down in March 1920 with a toll of hundreds of Shusha Armenians. He also wrote that \"In March 1920, an Azerbaijani army sacked the town, burning the Armenian quarter and killing some five hundred Armenians.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAccording to Tim Potier: Following the [[October Revolution]], Karabakh became part of the independent [[Republic of Azerbaijan]], although its control was hotly disputed by Ottoman and British forces, as well as, of course, Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Eventually, however, the British re-affirmed Azerbaijani jurisdiction over Karabakh by appointing a [[Muslim]] governor at Shusha. Shusha had, by this time, come to be regarded by the Armenian people as an Armenian [[cultural center]] and it was not until 28 February 1920 that the Armenian [[elder (administrative title)|elder]]s of Shusha reluctantly agreed to recognise Azerbaijan's authority. The situation was to alter following the events of 4 April, when a [[mass exodus]] of Armenians from Shusha to nearby [[Khankendi]] ([[Stepanakert]], today the capital of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]), following an Armenian uprising put down by Azeri forces, transformed, almost overnight, Shusha into an Azeri city.<ref>Tim Potier.

He also selected poetry passages such as the John Milton epigraph. However, these facts were not known at the time. Scott concluded that it was \"an extraordinary tale, in which the author seems to us to disclose uncommon powers of poetic imagination\".\n\nThe next public challenge to Mary Shelley's authorship came in 1824. She had written a follow-up novel that was reviewed in Charles Knight's literary magazine called Knight's Quarterly Review. In the section titled \"Frankenstein\", the reviewer alleged that the follow-up novel and Frankenstein were written by two different authors:<ref>[http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Reviews/knights.html \u201cFrankenstein\u2019\u2019, ''Knight's Quarterly Review'', 3 (August, 1824), edited by Charles Knight: 195-99.]</ref>\n<blockquote>\"[T]here is not the slightest trace of the same hand -- instead of the rapidity and enthusiastic energy which hurries you forward in ''Frankenstein'', every thing is cold, crude, inconsecutive, and wearisome; -- not one flash of imagination, not one spark of passion -- opening it as I did, with eager expectation, it must indeed have been bad for me after toiling a week to send the book back without having finished the first volume.

The second edition was published two years later in 1823. It was published in London by G. and W.B. Whittaker. The publication came under the supervision of William Godwin, who is Mary Shelley's father. Godwin listed the author as \"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley\". He made \"114 substantive changes\" to the 1818 edition. He decided to not credit Percy Bysshe Shelley as the author of the Preface. Godwin also did not cite Percy Shelley as the author of the poem \"Mutability\" which gave implications that Mary Shelley was the author of the poem. He also removed the John Milton epigraph from Paradise Lost. Godwin failed to credit Percy Shelly for his textual contributions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=E.B. |date=December 1981 |title=Changes in the 1823 Edition of ''Frankenstein'' |url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/murray.html |journal=[[Bibliographical Society|The Library]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |series=6 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=320\u2013327 |doi=10.1093/library/s6-III.4.320}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1831 edition published by Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley in London, Mary acknowledged for the first time that Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote the preface.

James Rieger, an English professor and editor, in a publication of the original 1818 edition in 1974, republished in 1982, argued that Shelley made significant contributions to the novel and should be regarded at least as a \"minor collaborator\" or even as a collaborator: \"His assistance at every point in the book's manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator. ... Percy Bysshe Shelley worked on ''Frankenstein'' at every stage, from the earliest drafts through the printer's proofs, with Mary's final 'carte blanche to make what alterations you please.' ...

Bodleian. Oxford.]]Authors have examined and investigated Percy Bysshe Shelley's scientific knowledge and experimentation, his two Gothic horror novels published in 1810 and 1811, his atheistic worldview, his antipathy to church and state, his 1818 Preface to ''Frankenstein'', and his connection to the secret anti-Catholic organization, the [[Illuminati]]. These revelations showed that the novel drew inspiration from Shelley's life, background, his readings such as [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''Ruins of Empires'' (1791) by [[Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney]], which also informed \"[[Ozymandias]]\", also published in 1818, [[Sir Humphry Davy]]'s ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy'' (1812), a textbook which Percy Bysshe Shelley owned,<ref>[http://crossref-it.info/textguide/frankenstein/7/987 Sir Humphry Davy. \"Percy Shelley owned a copy of Davy's textbook, ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy'' (1812) and it is probable that he and Mary studied it together, again in the autumn of 1816, at the time when she was working on ''Frankenstein''.\"]</ref> and the works of Dr. [[Erasmus Darwin]], the grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], whom Shelley had earlier cited as a major influence in ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab]]'' (1813), his views on religion, his poetic style, and his themes and ideas. In letters to William Godwin, Shelley also mentioned his affinity for [[Paracelsus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Heinrich Agrippa]], \"some of the physiological writers of Germany\" cited in his 1818 Preface to ''Frankenstein''.<ref>[http://www.thethinkersgarden.com/2015/12/odd-truths-the-occult-secrets-of-percy-shelley/#.WwB_jkgvzIU \"Odd Truths: The Occult Secrets of Percy Shelley\", ''The Thinker's Garden'', December 23, 2015.

Leslie S. Klinger, in ''The New Annotated Frankenstein'' (2017), argued it is spurious to maintain \"that the biographical coincidences of Victor Frankenstein and Percy Shelley are evidence of Percy's authorship\". Instead, critics rely on the handwriting evidence and Mary's statements in the 1831 Introduction to the novel.<ref>Klinger, Leslie S., editor. ''The New Annotated Frankenstein''. New York: Liveright, 2017.</ref>\n\nProponents of Percy Shelley's authorship such as Scott de Hart and Joseph P. Farrell claim that he was obsessed with [[electricity]], [[galvanism]], and the reanimation of corpses, and point to the influence of [[James Lind (1736\u20131812)|James Lind]], Percy Shelley's former teacher at [[Eton College]]. Advocates of Percy Shelley's authorship also point out that the novel contains his poetry such as \"Mutability\" as well as poetry by others, that the novel was imbued with the themes of [[atheism]], [[social tolerance]], [[social justice]], [[reform]], and antipathy to [[monarchism]] that only he advocated, and that there were noticeable motifs and subjects in the novel which only he espoused, such as [[vegetarianism]], [[pantheism]], [[alchemy]], [[incest]], male friendship, and [[scientific discovery]].\n\nHowever, editor Marilyn Butler, in her introduction and explanatory notes to the Oxford Press \"1818 Text\" edition of the novel, attributes these apparent coincidences to Percy's admiration and emulation of Mary's father, novelist William Godwin, whose works share numerous similarities in style, ideology, and subject matter with the novels of both Percy and Mary.\n\nEnglish literature scholars Phyllis Zimmerman, Phillip Wade,<ref>Wade, Phillip. \"Shelley and the Miltonic Element in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\" ''Milton and the Romantics'', 2 (December 1976), 23-25. A scene from Zastrozzi is re-invoked in Frankenstein.</ref> Stephen C. Behrendt,<ref>Shelley, Percy Bysshe. ''Zastrozzi and St. Irvyne.'' Edited by Stephen C. Behrendt.

Another Look at the Dreams in Frankenstein.\" ''Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts'', 7.4: 30\u201347.</ref> compared the two early Shelley Gothic horror novels ''[[Zastrozzi]]'' (1810) and ''[[St. Irvyne]]'' (1811) with ''Frankenstein'' and found them to be precursors of the latter novel, containing the same or similar ideas, themes, structure, plot, and characters. Zastrozzi is a novel of pursuit and revenge where an atheist antagonist seeks to destroy his victim and his progeny. He can kill his victim at any time, but instead seeks to torture and slowly kill his victim by destroying and killing everything he loves. In ''St. Irvyne'', the plot centers around an alchemist, Ginotti, who has a lifelong goal to find the secret of life by the study of \"natural philosophy\", to attain immortality. It is also a plot of pursuit where the alchemist seeks to impart the secret of eternal life to Wolfstein, the protagonist. There is even a poem in ''St. Irvyne'' on the reanimation of a corpse, the nun Rosa. Both novels rely extensively on John Milton's ''Paradise Lost'', containing epigraphs like in ''Frankenstein'', and contain poetry intertwined throughout the novel, a distinctive feature of ''Frankenstein'' as well. These novels were also published anonymously.\n\nOther authors have noted that Percy Shelley did not originate the aforementioned ideas, themes, structure, plots or character types. As Marilyn Butler observes in her introduction and notes to the \"1818 Text\" edition, Percy admired and sought approbation from Mary's famous father, in whose works can be seen numerous similarities with both \"Frankenstein\" and Percy's above-listed novels. Among these similarities are: tragic action narrated in the first person by an isolated intellectual (\"Fleetwood\" and \"Caleb Williams\"); enmity between two powerful characters with antithetical ideologies who pursue each other in a complex and shifting chase (\"Mandeville\" and Caleb Williams); and the story of a selfish intellectual who trades domestic happiness and marital love for scientific knowledge, success and power (\"St. Leon\"). It is arguable, therefore, that any similarities between Percy's novels and Frankenstein can be attributed to Percy's emulation of Godwin rather than his supposed authorship of his wife's novel.\n\nIn 1996, [[Charles E. Robinson]] published a transcribed edition of the ''Frankenstein'' manuscripts together with a chronology of the work's composition.<ref name=wu/> From these it is possible to see that Percy Shelley's contribution to the novel is of between 5,000-6,000 words of the novel's 72,000 word total.<ref name=wu>{{cite book |author=Duncan Wu |title=30 Great Myths about the Romantics |publisher=WIley-Blackwell |year=2015 |isbn13= 978-1118843260 |authorlink=Duncan Wu |page=214}}</ref> Robinson wrote that from the manuscripts it was evident that Mary Shelley was the \"creative genius\" behind the work, while Percy's contribution was akin to that which a publisher's editor would provide.<ref name=wu/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Adams, Stephen. \"Percy Bysshe Shelley helped wife Mary write Frankenstein, claims professor: Mary Shelley received extensive help in writing Frankenstein from her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, a leading academic has claimed.\" ''Telegraph'', 24 August 2008.

James Rieger, an English professor and editor, in a publication of the original 1818 edition in 1974, republished in 1982, argued that Shelley made significant contributions to the novel and should be regarded at least as a \"minor collaborator\" or even as a collaborator: \"His assistance at every point in the book's manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator. ... Percy Bysshe Shelley worked on ''Frankenstein'' at every stage, from the earliest drafts through the printer's proofs, with Mary's final 'carte blanche to make what alterations you please.' ...

Bodleian. Oxford.]]Authors have examined and investigated Percy Bysshe Shelley's scientific knowledge and experimentation, his two Gothic horror novels published in 1810 and 1811, his atheistic worldview, his antipathy to church and state, his 1818 Preface to ''Frankenstein'', and his connection to the secret anti-Catholic organization, the [[Illuminati]]. These revelations showed that the novel drew inspiration from Shelley's life, background, his readings such as [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''Ruins of Empires'' (1791) by [[Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney]], which also informed \"[[Ozymandias]]\", also published in 1818, [[Sir Humphry Davy]]'s ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy'' (1812), a textbook which Percy Bysshe Shelley owned,<ref>[http://crossref-it.info/textguide/frankenstein/7/987 Sir Humphry Davy. \"Percy Shelley owned a copy of Davy's textbook, ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy'' (1812) and it is probable that he and Mary studied it together, again in the autumn of 1816, at the time when she was working on ''Frankenstein''.\"]</ref> and the works of Dr. [[Erasmus Darwin]], the grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], whom Shelley had earlier cited as a major influence in ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab]]'' (1813), his views on religion, his poetic style, and his themes and ideas. In letters to William Godwin, Shelley also mentioned his affinity for [[Paracelsus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Heinrich Agrippa]], \"some of the physiological writers of Germany\" cited in his 1818 Preface to ''Frankenstein''.<ref>[http://www.thethinkersgarden.com/2015/12/odd-truths-the-occult-secrets-of-percy-shelley/#.WwB_jkgvzIU \"Odd Truths: The Occult Secrets of Percy Shelley\", ''The Thinker's Garden'', December 23, 2015.

Leslie S. Klinger, in ''The New Annotated Frankenstein'' (2017), argued it is spurious to maintain \"that the biographical coincidences of Victor Frankenstein and Percy Shelley are evidence of Percy's authorship\". Instead, critics rely on the handwriting evidence and Mary's statements in the 1831 Introduction to the novel.<ref>Klinger, Leslie S., editor. ''The New Annotated Frankenstein''. New York: Liveright, 2017.</ref>\n\nProponents of Shelley's authorship such as Scott de Hart<ref>de Hart, Scott D. ''Shelley Unbound: Discovering Frankenstein's True Creator. Foreword by Joseph P. Farrell. Port Townsend, WA: Feral House, 2013.</ref> and Joseph P. Farrell<ref>de Hart, Scott D. and Joseph P. Farrell. ''Transhumanism: A Grimoire of Alchemical Agendas.'' Port Townsend, WA: Feral House, 2012.</ref> claim that Shelley was obsessed with [[electricity]], [[galvanism]], and the reanimation of corpses, and point to the influence of [[James Lind (1736\u20131812)|James Lind]], Shelley's former teacher at [[Eton College]]. Advocates of Shelley's authorship also point out that the novel contains Shelley's poetry such as \"Mutability\" as well as poetry by others, that the novel was imbued with the themes of [[atheism]], [[social tolerance]], [[social justice]], [[reform]], and antipathy to [[monarchism]] that only Shelley advocated, and that there were noticeable motifs and subjects in the novel which only he espoused, such as [[vegetarianism]], [[pantheism]], [[alchemy]], [[incest]], male friendship, and [[scientific discovery]].\n\nHowever, editor Marilyn Butler, in her introduction and explanatory notes to the Oxford Press \"1818 Text\" edition of the novel, attributes these apparent coincidences to Percy's admiration and emulation of Mary's father, novelist William Godwin, whose works share numerous similarities in style, ideology, and subject matter with the novels of both Percy and Mary.\n\nEnglish literature scholars Phyllis Zimmerman, Phillip Wade,<ref>Wade, Phillip. \"Shelley and the Miltonic Element in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\" ''Milton and the Romantics'', 2 (December 1976), 23-25. A scene from Zastrozzi is re-invoked in Frankenstein.</ref> Stephen C. Behrendt,<ref>Shelley, Percy Bysshe. ''Zastrozzi and St. Irvyne.'' Edited by Stephen C. Behrendt.

Another Look at the Dreams in Frankenstein.\" ''Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts'', 7.4: 30\u201347.</ref> compared the two early Shelley Gothic horror novels ''[[Zastrozzi]]'' (1810) and ''[[St. Irvyne]]'' (1811) with ''Frankenstein'' and found them to be precursors of the latter novel, containing the same or similar ideas, themes, structure, plot, and characters. Zastrozzi is a novel of pursuit and revenge where an atheist antagonist seeks to destroy his victim and his progeny. He can kill his victim at any time, but instead seeks to torture and slowly kill his victim by destroying and killing everything he loves. In ''St. Irvyne'', the plot centers around an alchemist, Ginotti, who has a lifelong goal to find the secret of life by the study of \"natural philosophy\", to attain immortality. It is also a plot of pursuit where the alchemist seeks to impart the secret of eternal life to Wolfstein, the protagonist. There is even a poem in ''St. Irvyne'' on the reanimation of a corpse, the nun Rosa. Both novels rely extensively on John Milton's ''Paradise Lost'', containing epigraphs like in ''Frankenstein'', and contain poetry intertwined throughout the novel, a distinctive feature of ''Frankenstein'' as well. These novels were also published anonymously.\n\nOther authors have noted that Percy Shelley did not originate the aforementioned ideas, themes, structure, plots or character types. As Marilyn Butler observes in her introduction and notes to the \"1818 Text\" edition, Percy admired and sought approbation from Mary's famous father, in whose works can be seen numerous similarities with both \"Frankenstein\" and Percy's above-listed novels. Among these similarities are: tragic action narrated in the first person by an isolated intellectual (\"Fleetwood\" and \"Caleb Williams\"); enmity between two powerful characters with antithetical ideologies who pursue each other in a complex and shifting chase (\"Mandeville\" and Caleb Williams); and the story of a selfish intellectual who trades domestic happiness and marital love for scientific knowledge, success and power (\"St. Leon\"). It is arguable, therefore, that any similarities between Percy's novels and Frankenstein can be attributed to Percy's emulation of Godwin rather than his supposed authorship of his wife's novel.\n\nIn 1996, [[Charles E. Robinson]] published a transcribed edition of the ''Frankenstein'' manuscripts together with a chronology of the work's composition.<ref name=wu/> From these it is possible to see that Percy Shelley's contribution to the novel is of between 5,000-6,000 words of the novel's 72,000 word total.<ref name=wu>{{cite book |author=Duncan Wu |title=30 Great Myths about the Romantics |publisher=WIley-Blackwell |year=2015 |isbn13= 978-1118843260 |authorlink=Duncan Wu |page=214}}</ref> Robinson wrote that from the manuscripts it was evident that Mary Shelley was the \"creative genius\" behind the work, while Percy's contribution was akin to that which a publisher's editor would provide.<ref name=wu/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Adams, Stephen. \"Percy Bysshe Shelley helped wife Mary write Frankenstein, claims professor: Mary Shelley received extensive help in writing Frankenstein from her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, a leading academic has claimed.\" ''Telegraph'', 24 August 2008.

It also includes a 10-story office building (now a hotel) opened in 1964, and a saddle-shaped auditorium building originally used as a cinema. The four buildings, access driveways, and a small plaza that originally included an ice rink are built on a raised platform next to the Chicago River.

When finished, the two towers were both the tallest residential buildings and the tallest [[reinforced concrete]] structures in the world. The complex was built as a \"city within a city\", featuring numerous on-site facilities including a theater, gym, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, stores, restaurants, and, of course, a marina.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chicago0000ogor|title=Chicago|last=J.|first=O'Gorman, Thomas|date=2003|publisher=PRC|isbn=9781856486682|edition=1st|location=London|oclc=52429347|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nMarina City was built in a joint venture with Brighton Construction Company (owner: Thomas J.

The bottom 19 floors form an exposed spiral parking ramp operated by valet with approximately 896 parking spaces. The 20th floor of each contains a laundry room and gym with panoramic views of the Loop, while floors 21 through 60 contain apartments (450 per tower). A 360-degree open-air roof deck lies on the 61st and top story. The buildings are accessed from separate lobbies that share a common below-grade [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] level as well as ground-level plaza entrances beside the House of Blues. Originally rental apartments, the complex converted to [[condominium (housing)|condominiums]] in 1977, but still contains a number of rental units.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nMarina City apartments are unusual in containing almost no interior right angles. On each residential floor, a circular hallway surrounds the elevator core, which is {{convert|32|ft}} in diameter, with 16 [[circular sector|sector]]-shaped units arrayed around the hallway. Apartments are composed of these units. Bathrooms and kitchens are located towards the inside of the building. Living areas occupy the outermost areas of each unit. Each unit terminates in a {{convert|175|ft2|adj=on}} semi-circular balcony, separated from living areas by a floor-to-ceiling window wall. Because of this arrangement, every single living room and bedroom in Marina City has a balcony.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe apartments are also unusual in that they function solely on electricity; neither [[natural gas]] nor [[propane]] serves any function. The apartments are not provided with hot water, air conditioning, or heat from a central source, as was the common practice at the time the towers were built. Instead, each unit contains individual water heaters, heating and cooling units, and electric stoves; residents pay individually for the electricity needed to run these appliances. This might have been a financial decision on the part of the building owners; at the time these towers were constructed, local electric utility [[Commonwealth Edison]] provided expensive building [[transformer]]s at little or no charge, provided the buildings were made all-electric.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn addition, the residential towers are noted for the high speed of their elevators.

The multi-building complex opened between 1963 and 1967<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sah-archipedia.org/buildings/IL-01-031-0056|title=Marina City|date=July 16, 2018|website=SAH ARCHIPEDIA}}</ref> and occupies almost an entire [[city block]] on [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] on the north bank of the [[Chicago River]] on the [[Near North Side (Chicago)|Near North Side]], directly across from the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Portions of the complex were designated a Chicago Landmark in 2016.<ref>https://www.architectmagazine.com/design/chicago-names-marina-city-an-official-landmark_o</ref>\n\nThe complex consists of two {{convert|587|ft|m|adj=on}}, 65-story apartment towers, opened in 1963, which include [[physical plant]] penthouses. It also includes a 10-story office building (now a hotel) opened in 1964, and a saddle-shaped auditorium building originally used as a cinema. The four buildings, access driveways, and a small plaza that originally included an ice rink are built on a raised platform next to the Chicago River. Beneath the platform, at river level, is a small [[marina]] for [[pleasure craft]], giving the structures their name.<ref name=\"Brighton Construction Company, Owner: Thomas J.

When finished, the two towers were both the tallest residential buildings and the tallest [[reinforced concrete]] structures in the world. The complex was built as a \"city within a city\", featuring numerous on-site facilities including a theater, gym, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, stores, restaurants, and, of course, a marina.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chicago0000ogor|title=Chicago|last=J.|first=O'Gorman, Thomas|date=2003|publisher=PRC|isbn=9781856486682|edition=1st|location=London|oclc=52429347|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nMarina City was built in a joint venture with Brighton Construction Company (owner: Thomas J. Bowler) and James McHugh Construction Company. [[James McHugh Construction Co.]] subsequently built [[Water Tower Place]] in 1976 and [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump Tower]] in 2009, both of which were also the tallest reinforced concrete structures in the world at the times they were built.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Marina City was the first building in the United States to be constructed with the Linden climbing [[Crane (machine)#Tower crane|tower crane]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[WLS-TV]] (ABC Channel 7) transmitted from an antenna atop Marina City until the [[Willis Tower]] (formerly known as Sears Tower) was completed.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Local radio station [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] operated out of Marina City in the office building of the complex.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Local television station [[WFLD]] (FOX Channel 32) had its studios and transmitter at Marina City for 18 years until they were bought by [[Metromedia]].\n\nMarina City was the first post-war urban [[high-rise]] residential complex in the United States and is widely credited with beginning the residential renaissance of American inner cities. Its model of mixed residential and office uses and high-rise towers with a base of parking has become a primary model for urban development in the United States and throughout the world, and has been widely copied throughout many cities internationally.\n\n<gallery heights=\"200px\" mode=\"packed-hover\">\nFile:Chicago Marina City foundation 1961.JPG|The foundation of Marina City being laid in 1961\nFile:Marina City , Chicago , Kodachrome by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|Marina City under construction\nFile:Marina City - Sun Times - Daily News - by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|Another view of the construction\nFile:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017) 00383 Chicago Loop Christmas time - developed March 1970 (37045992723).jpg|Marina City in 1969.

The bottom 19 floors form an exposed spiral parking ramp operated by valet with approximately 896 parking spaces. The 20th floor of each contains a laundry room and gym with panoramic views of the Loop, while floors 21 through 60 contain apartments (450 per tower). A 360-degree open-air roof deck lies on the 61st and top story. The buildings are accessed from separate lobbies that share a common below-grade [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] level as well as ground-level plaza entrances beside the House of Blues. Originally rental apartments, the complex converted to [[condominium (housing)|condominiums]] in 1977, but still contains a number of rental units.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nMarina City apartments are unusual in containing almost no interior right angles. On each residential floor, a circular hallway surrounds the elevator core, which is {{convert|32|ft}} in diameter, with 16 [[circular sector|sector]]-shaped units arrayed around the hallway. Apartments are composed of these units. Bathrooms and kitchens are located towards the inside of the building. Living areas occupy the outermost areas of each unit. Each unit terminates in a {{convert|175|ft2|adj=on}} semi-circular balcony, separated from living areas by a floor-to-ceiling window wall. Because of this arrangement, every single living room and bedroom in Marina City has a balcony.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe apartments are also unusual in that they function solely on electricity; neither [[natural gas]] nor [[propane]] serves any function. The apartments are not provided with hot water, air conditioning, or heat from a central source, as was the common practice at the time the towers were built. Instead, each unit contains individual water heaters, heating and cooling units, and electric stoves; residents pay individually for the electricity needed to run these appliances. This might have been a financial decision on the part of the building owners; at the time these towers were constructed, local electric utility [[Commonwealth Edison]] provided expensive building [[transformer]]s at little or no charge, provided the buildings were made all-electric.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn addition, the residential towers are noted for the high speed of their elevators. It takes approximately 33 seconds to travel from the lower-level lobby to the 61st floor roof decks.<ref>Building Facts (see Top Elevator Speed)''marinacity.org''. Retrieved from http://www.marinacity.org/bldgfact.htm.</ref>\n\nThe towers were awarded a prize by the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1965 for their innovation.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe appearance of the towers is said to have inspired a similar design for the [[The Corinthian (New York)|Corinthian Tower in New York]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 2007, the condominium board controversially claimed to own the [[common law copyright]] and trademark rights to the name and image of the buildings, although they do not own the parking garage portion of the buildings located below the 20th floor. They have claimed that any commercial use (such as in film or other media, such as on web sites) of pictures of the buildings or of the name \"Marina City\" without permission is a violation of their intellectual property rights.<ref>[http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/09/condo-ass-claims-cop.html Condo ass. claims copyright on Chicago's Marina City Towers] ''boingboing.net''</ref><ref>[http://www.marinacity.org/history/story/name_image.htm Condo board claims ownership of Marina City \u2018name and image\u2019] ''marinacity.org''</ref>\n\nIn celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Marina City was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldinger|first=Mike|title=The proud history of architecture in Illinois|url=https://springfieldbusinessjournal.com/2018/01/the-proud-history-of-architecture-in-illinois/|accessdate=30 January 2018|newspaper=Springfield Business Journal|date=January 30, 2018}}</ref> by the [[American Institute of Architects]] Illinois component (AIA Illinois).\n\n== Current use ==\nThe complex houses the [[House of Blues]] concert hall, restaurant and bar, the Hotel Chicago, 10Pin Bowling Lounge, and four restaurants (Yolk, [[Smith and Wollensky]], Katana, and [[Dick's Last Resort]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe House of Blues concert hall was built in the shell of the complex's long-disused movie theater. Similarly, the hotel was built in what was once the Marina City office building. In order to accommodate Smith and Wollensky, the former skating rink was demolished. Pedestrian and vehicular access to the residential towers and the raised common plaza were redesigned. In 2006, decorative lighting was installed around the circular roofs of the mechanical sheds that top each tower; the towers had not contained any such lighting since the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n<gallery heights=\"200px\" mode=\"packed-hover\">\nFile:Downtown Chicago Marina City CornCob Sky Scrapers.jpg|Marina City balconies\nFile:Marina City Parking.jpg|Close-up of Marina City parking\nFile:Marina City marina by Matthew Bisanz.jpg|The Marina City marina\nFile:Marina City Chicago 2012-0224.jpg|In December 2012.

He is best known for his hit song \"[[The Race (Tay-K song)|The Race]]\", which reached number 44 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]] in January 2018. The song became popular following his arrest in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], after a nationwide manhunt for murder.\n\nMcIntyre was captured by U.S. marshals on June 30, 2017, the same day \"The Race\" was released, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, after a total of three months on the run. After being extradited back to [[Texas]] for his crimes, McIntyre started to receive support from his fans on social media.<ref name=\"support\" /> While being held at Tarrant County Jail in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], Tay-K's management team released his debut mixtape, [[Santana World]], on July 29, 2017, and it received a generally positive response from critics and fans. On March 19, 2018, his song \"Hard\", featuring [[Blocboy JB]], was released via [[hip hop]]-oriented record label [[Adam22|No Jumper]] Records.

H\u00e9bert fled first to [[Rouen]] and then to [[Paris]]. For a while he passed through a difficult financial time and lived through the support of a hairdresser in rue des Noyers. There he found work in a theater, la R\u00e9publique, where he wrote plays in his spare time, but these were never produced. He was fired for stealing. He then entered the service of a doctor. It is said he lived through expediency and scams.\n\nIn 1789, he began his writing with a pamphlet \"la Lanterne magique ou le Fl\u00e9au des Aristocrates\" (Magic Lantern, or Scourge of Aristocrats). He published a few booklets. In 1790, he attracted attention through a pamphlet he published, and became a prominent member of the club of the [[Cordeliers]] in 1791.\n\n==P\u00e8re Duchesne==\nFrom 1790 until his death in 1794 H\u00e9bert became a voice for the working class of Paris through his highly successful and influential journal, [[Le P\u00e8re Duchesne]].  In his journal, H\u00e9bert assumed the voice of a patriotic sans-culotte named P\u00e8re Duchesne and would write first-person narratives in which P\u00e8re Duchesne would often relay fictitious conversations that he had with the French monarchs or government officials.<ref>Sonenscher, Michael. \"The Sans-culottes of the Year II: Rethinking the Language of Labour in Revolutionary France\". Social History Vol. 9 No. 3 (1984): 326.</ref> \n\nThese stories encouraged violent behaviors and utilized foul language; P\u00e8re Duchesne's stories were also witty, reflective, and resonated deeply with Parisian workers. Street hawkers would yell: ''Il est bougrement en col\u00e8re aujourd\u2019hui le p\u00e8re Duchesne!'' (Father Duchesne is very angry today!).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAlthough H\u00e9bert did not create the image of the P\u00e8re Duchesne, his use of the character helped to transform the symbolic image of P\u00e8re Duchesne from that of a comical stove-merchant into a patriotic role model for the [[sans culottes]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Colwill|first=Elizabeth|year=1989|title=Just Another \"Citoyenne?\" Marie-Antoinette on Trial, 1790\u20131793|jstor=4288925|journal=History Workshop|volume=28|issue=28|pages=65|doi=10.1093/hwj/28.1.63}}</ref> In part, H\u00e9bert's use of P\u00e8re Duchesne as a revolutionary symbol can be seen by his appearance as a bristly old man who was portrayed as smoking a pipe and wearing a [[Phrygian cap]]. \n\nBecause he reflected both the speech and dressing style of his audience, his readers listened to and followed his message. The French linguist and historian Ferdinand Brunot called H\u00e9bert \"The Homer of filth\"  because of his ability to use common language to appeal to general audiences<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Press in The Press in the French Revolution|last=Gilchrist|first=John Thomas|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1971|location=New York|pages=21|via=}}</ref> In addition, P\u00e8re Duchesne's appearance played into the tensions of the revolution through the sharp contrast of his clothing and portrayal as a laborer against the crown and aristocracy's formal attire.<ref name=\":0\">Landes, Joan. \"More than Words: The Printing Press and the French Revolution\".

Popkin. Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 25 No. 1 (1991): 85\u201391.</ref> H\u00e9bert was not the only writer during the French Revolution to use the image of P\u00e8re Duchesne nor was he the only author in the period to adopt foul language as a way of appealing to the working class. Another writer at the time, Lemaire, also wrote a newspaper entitled ''P\u00e8re Duch\u00eane'' (although he spelt it differently than H\u00e9bert) from September 1790 until May 1792 in which he assumed the voice of a \"moderate patriot\" who wanted to conserve the relationship between the king and the nation. Lemaire's character also used a slew of profanities and would address France's military. H\u00e9bert's paper, however, became far more popular. In part, this was due to the Paris Commune deciding to buy his papers and distribute them to the French military for distribution to soldiers in training. For example, starting in 1792 the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] and the ministers of war [[Jean-Nicolas Pache]] and, later, [[Jean Baptiste No\u00ebl Bouchotte]] bought several thousand copies of ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' which were distributed free to the public and troops. This happened again in May and June 1793 when the Minister of War bought copies of newspapers in order to \"enlighten and animate their patriotism.\"  It is estimated that H\u00e9bert received 205,000 livres from this purchase.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Indissolubricite.jpg|thumb|120px|left|\n\"The Indignation of P\u00e8re Duchesne\" (1790).\n]]\n\nH\u00e9bert's political commentary between 1790 and 1793 focused on the lavish excesses of the monarchy. Initially, from 1790 and into 1792, ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' supported a [[constitutional monarchy]] and was even favorable towards King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and the opinions of the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de La Fayette]]. His violent attacks of the period were aimed at [[Jean-Sifrein Maury]], a great defender of papal authority and the main opponent of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Although the character of ''P\u00e8re Duchesne'' supported a constitutional monarchy, he was always highly critical of Marie Antoinette. Knowing that the queen was an easy target for ridicule after the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace|Diamond Necklace Affair]], she became a consistent target in the paper as a scapegoat for many of France's political problems. By identifying Marie Antoinette's lavish excesses and alleged sexuality as the core of the monarchy's problems, H\u00e9bert's articles suggested that, if Marie Antoinette would change her ways and renounce aristocratic excesses, then the monarchy could be saved and the queen could return to the good will of the people. Despite his view that the monarchy could be restored, H\u00e9bert was skeptical of the queen's willingness to do so and often characterized her as an evil enemy of the people by referring to [[Marie Antoinette]] as \"Madame Veto\" and even addressing [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] as  \"drunken and lazy; a [[cuckold]]ed pig\".<ref>{{cite journal|year=1989|title=Just Another 'Citoyenne?'

Many of the conversations that P\u00e8re Duchesne carries with her in the newspaper are attempts at either showcasing her supposed nymphomania or attempts to beg her to repent and reverse her wicked ways.<ref>Kaiser, Thomas. \"Who\u2019s Afraid of Marie-Antoinette? Diplomacy, Austrophobia, and the Queen.\" French History, Vol. 14 No. 3 (2000): 241\u2013271.</ref> With the king's failed [[flight to Varennes]] his tone significantly hardened.\n\nMany writers and journalists at the time were greatly influenced by the proclamation of martial law on 21 October 1789. It envoked various questions and patterns of Revolutionary thinking and inspired various forms of writing such as Le P\u00e8re Duchesne.

This put him in the revolutionary mindset, and the ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' adopted a sloppier style to better appeal to the masses.  ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' began to attack Lafayette, [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], and [[Jean Sylvain Bailly|Bailly]]. Following Louis's failed [[flight to Varennes]] he began to attack both Louis and Pope [[Pius VI]] as well.\n\nH\u00e9bert met his future wife [[Marie Marguerite Fran\u00e7oise H\u00e9bert|Marie Goupil]] (born 1756), a 37-year-old former nun who had left convent life at the Sisters of Providence convent at [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]]. Marie's passport from this time shows regular use.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} They married on 7 February 1792, and had a daughter, Virginia Scipion-H\u00e9bert (7 February 1793 \u2013 13 July 1830). During this time, H\u00e9bert had a luxurious, bourgeois life. He entertained [[Jean-Nicolas Pache]], the mayor of Paris and Minister of War, for weeks, as well as other influential men, and liked to dress elegantly and surround himself with beautiful objects such as pretty tapestries\u2014an attitude that can be contrasted to that of Paris Commune president [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]]. Where he got the financial resources to support his lifestyle is unclear; however, there are [[Jean-Nicolas Pache]]'s commissions to print thousands of issues of ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' and his relationship to Delaunay d'Angers, mistress and wife of Andres Maria de Guzman.\n\nAs a member of [[Cordeliers]] club, he had a seat in the revolutionary [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] where on [[10 August (French Revolution)|9 and 10 August 1792]] he was sent to the Bonne-Nouvelle [[Revolutionary sections of Paris|section]] of Paris.  As a public journalist, he supported the [[September Massacres]]. On 22 December 1792, he was appointed the second substitute of the ''procureur'' of the commune, and through to August 1793 supported the attacks against the [[Girondin]] faction.  In April\u2013May 1793 he, along with [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] and others, violently attacked [[Girondins]].\n\nIn February 1793, he voted with fellow bourgeois [[H\u00e9bertists]] against the [[Maximum Price Act]], a [[price ceiling]] on grain, on the grounds it would cause hoarding and stir resentment. On 20 May 1793 the moderate majority of the [[National Convention]] formed the [[Special Commission of Twelve]], which was designed to investigate and prosecute conspirators. At the urging of the Twelve on 24 May 1793 he was arrested.\n\nHowever, H\u00e9bert had been warned in time, and, with the support of the Sans Culottes, the National Convention was forced to order his release three days later.\n\n==Dechristianization==\nDechristianization was a movement that took hold during the French Revolution in which advocates believed that, in order to pursue a secular society, they had to reject the superstitions of the old regime and, as an extension, Catholicism. The trend toward secularization had already begun to take hold throughout France during the eighteenth century; however, between September 1793 and August 1794, French politicians began discussing and embracing notions of \"radical dechristianization.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution|last=Chartier|first=Roger|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1991|pages=105\u2013106|via=}}</ref> While Robespierre advocated for the right to religion and believed that aggressively pursuing dechristianization would spur widespread revolts throughout rural France, H\u00e9bert and his followers, the H\u00e9bertists, wanted to spontaneously and violently overhaul religion.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Furies: Violene and Terror in the French and Russian Revolutions|last=Mayer|first=Arno J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2000|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=441\u2013442|via=}}</ref> The program of dechristianization waged against [[Catholicism]], and eventually against all forms of [[Christianity]], included the [[deportation]] of clergy and the condemnation of many of them to death, the closing of churches, the institution of revolutionary and civic [[cult]]s, the large scale destruction of religious monuments, the outlawing of public and private worship and religious education, forced marriages of the clergy and forced abjurement of their [[priesthood]].<ref name=\"Latreille\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=French Revolution|encyclopedia=[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Thomson-Gale]]|last=Latreille|first=A.|edition=Second Ed. 2003|volume=5|pages=972\u2013973|isbn=978-0-7876-4004-0}}</ref> On 21 October 1793 a law was passed which made all suspected priests and all persons who harbored them liable to death on sight.<ref name=\"Latreille\"/>\n\nOn 10 November 1793, dechristianization reached what many historians consider the climax of the movement when the H\u00e9bertists moved the first celebration of the Festival of Reason, a civic festival celebrating the goddess of Reason, from the Circus of the Palais Royale to the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] and reclaimed the cathedral as a \"Temple of Reason.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> On 7 June Robespierre, who had previously condemned the ''[[Cult of Reason]]'', advocated a new state religion and recommended that the Convention acknowledge the existence of [[God]]. On the next day, the worship of the deistic [[Cult of the Supreme Being|''Supreme Being'']] was inaugurated as an official aspect of the Revolution. Compared with H\u00e9bert's somewhat popular festivals, this austere new religion of Virtue was received with signs of hostility by the Parisian public.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Clash with Robespierre, arrest, conviction, and execution==\nAfter successfully attacking the [[Girondins]], H\u00e9bert continued to attack others whom he viewed as too moderate, including Danton, [[Pierre Philippeaux|Philippeaux]], and [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] in the fall of 1793 among others. When H\u00e9bert accused Marie-Antoinette during her trial of incest with her son, Robespierre called him a fool (\"imb\u00e9cile\").<ref>[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k41180s/f1n73.pdf?download=1 Joachim Vilate (1795) Causes secr\u00e8tes de la r\u00e9volution du 9 au 10 thermidor, p. 12-13]</ref>\n\nThe government, with support from the Jacobins, was exasperated and finally decided to strike on the night of 13 March 1794, despite the reluctance of [[Bertrand Bar\u00e8re|Bar\u00e8re de Vieuzac]], [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne|Billaud-Varenne]]. The order was to arrest the leaders of the [[H\u00e9bertists]]; these included individuals in the War Ministry and others.\n\nIn the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], H\u00e9bert was treated very differently from Danton, more like a thief than a conspirator; his earlier scams were brought to light and criticized. He was sentenced to death with his co-defendants on the third day of deliberations. Their execution by guillotine took place on 24 March 1794.<ref>Doyle (1989); p.270. |\"The trial took place on 21\u20134 March, its result a foregone conclusion.

H\u00e9bert's executioners amused the crowd by adjusting the guillotine so that its blade stopped inches above his neck,<ref>Page 27 BBC History Magazine, September 2015</ref> and it was only after the fourth time the lever (''d\u00e9clic'') was pulled that he was actually beheaded. His corpse was disposed of in the [[Madeleine Cemetery]]. [[Marie Marguerite Fran\u00e7oise H\u00e9bert|His widow]] was executed twenty days later on 13 April 1794, and her corpse was disposed of in the [[Errancis Cemetery]].\n\n==Influence==\nIt is difficult to ascertain the extent to which H\u00e9bert's publication ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' impacted the outcomes of political events between 1790 and 1794. French revolutionary historians such as Jean-Paul Bertraud, Jeremy D. Popkin, and William J. Murray each investigated French Revolutionary press history and determined that while the newspapers and magazines that one read during the revolution may have influenced their political leanings, it did not necessarily create their political leanings. One's class, for example, could be a significant determinant in directing and influencing one's political decisions. Therefore, H\u00e9bert's writings certainly influenced his audience to some extent, but that does not mean that it changed the political outcomes of the French Revolution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jeremy D.|first=Popkin|year=1990|title=The Press and the French Revolution after Two Hundred Years|jstor=286493|journal=French Historical Studies|volume=16|issue=3|pages=688\u2013670}}</ref> That being said, his wide readership and voice throughout the Revolution means that he was a significant public figure and Le P\u00e8re Duchesne's ability to influence the general population of France was indeed notable.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Le_Pere_Duchesne.jpg|Illustration from the P\u00e8re Duchesne broadsides.\nImage:LetterHebertPalloy.jpg|A Letter by Jacques H\u00e9bert to Citizen [[Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Palloy]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=H\u00e9bert, Jacques Ren\u00e9|volume=13|page=167}} The 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', in turn, gives the following references:\n**Louis Duval, \"H\u00e9bert chez lui\", in ''La R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise, revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine'', t. xii. and t. xiii.\n**D.

H\u00e9bert fled first to [[Rouen]] and then to [[Paris]]. For a while he passed through a difficult financial time and lived through the support of a hairdresser in rue des Noyers. There he found work in a theater, la R\u00e9publique, where he wrote plays in his spare time, but these were never produced. He was fired for stealing. He then entered the service of a doctor. It is said he lived through expediency and scams.\n\nIn 1789, he began his writing with a pamphlet \"la Lanterne magique ou le Fl\u00e9au des Aristocrates\" (Magic Lantern, or Scourge of Aristocrats). He published a few booklets. In 1790, he attracted attention through a pamphlet he published, and became a prominent member of the club of the [[Cordeliers]] in 1791.\n\n==P\u00e8re Duchesne==\nFrom 1790 until his death in 1794 H\u00e9bert became a voice for the working class of Paris through his highly successful and influential journal, [[Le P\u00e8re Duchesne]].  In his journal, H\u00e9bert assumed the voice of a patriotic sans-culotte named P\u00e8re Duchesne and would write first-person narratives in which P\u00e8re Duchesne would often relay fictitious conversations that he had with the French monarchs or government officials.<ref>Sonenscher, Michael. \"The Sans-culottes of the Year II: Rethinking the Language of Labour in Revolutionary France\". Social History Vol. 9 No. 3 (1984): 326.</ref> \n\nThese stories encouraged violent behaviors and utilized foul language; P\u00e8re Duchesne's stories were also witty, reflective, and resonated deeply with Parisian workers. Street hawkers would yell: ''Il est bougrement en col\u00e8re aujourd\u2019hui le p\u00e8re Duchesne!'' (Father Duchesne is very angry today!).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAlthough H\u00e9bert did not create the image of the P\u00e8re Duchesne, his use of the character helped to transform the symbolic image of P\u00e8re Duchesne from that of a comical stove-merchant into a patriotic role model for the [[sans culottes]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Colwill|first=Elizabeth|year=1989|title=Just Another \"Citoyenne?\" Marie-Antoinette on Trial, 1790\u20131793|jstor=4288925|journal=History Workshop|volume=28|issue=28|pages=65|doi=10.1093/hwj/28.1.63}}</ref> In part, H\u00e9bert's use of P\u00e8re Duchesne as a revolutionary symbol can be seen by his appearance as a bristly old man who was portrayed as smoking a pipe and wearing a [[Phrygian cap]]. \n\nBecause he reflected both the speech and dressing style of his audience, his readers listened to and followed his message.

Another writer at the time, Lemaire, also wrote a newspaper entitled ''P\u00e8re Duch\u00eane'' (although he spelt it differently than H\u00e9bert) from September 1790 until May 1792 in which he assumed the voice of a \"moderate patriot\" who wanted to conserve the relationship between the king and the nation. Lemaire's character also used a slew of profanities and would address France's military. H\u00e9bert's paper, however, became far more popular. In part, this was due to the Paris Commune deciding to buy his papers and distribute them to the French military for distribution to soldiers in training. For example, starting in 1792 the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] and the ministers of war [[Jean-Nicolas Pache]] and, later, [[Jean Baptiste No\u00ebl Bouchotte]] bought several thousand copies of ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' which were distributed free to the public and troops. This happened again in May and June 1793 when the Minister of War bought copies of newspapers in order to \"enlighten and animate their patriotism.\"  It is estimated that H\u00e9bert received 205,000 livres from this purchase.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Indissolubricite.jpg|thumb|120px|left|\n\"The Indignation of P\u00e8re Duchesne\" (1790).\n]]\n\nH\u00e9bert's political commentary between 1790 and 1793 focused on the lavish excesses of the monarchy. Initially, from 1790 and into 1792, ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' supported a [[constitutional monarchy]] and was even favorable towards King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and the opinions of the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de La Fayette]]. His violent attacks of the period were aimed at [[Jean-Sifrein Maury]], a great defender of papal authority and the main opponent of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Although the character of ''P\u00e8re Duchesne'' supported a constitutional monarchy, he was always highly critical of Marie Antoinette. Knowing that the queen was an easy target for ridicule after the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace|Diamond Necklace Affair]], she became a consistent target in the paper as a scapegoat for many of France's political problems. By identifying Marie Antoinette's lavish excesses and alleged sexuality as the core of the monarchy's problems, H\u00e9bert's articles suggested that, if Marie Antoinette would change her ways and renounce aristocratic excesses, then the monarchy could be saved and the queen could return to the good will of the people. Despite his view that the monarchy could be restored, H\u00e9bert was skeptical of the queen's willingness to do so and often characterized her as an evil enemy of the people by referring to [[Marie Antoinette]] as \"Madame Veto\" and even addressing [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] as  \"drunken and lazy; a [[cuckold]]ed pig\".<ref>{{cite journal|year=1989|title=Just Another 'Citoyenne?'

As a public journalist, he supported the [[September Massacres]]. On 22 December 1792, he was appointed the second substitute of the ''procureur'' of the commune, and through to August 1793 supported the attacks against the [[Girondin]] faction.  In April\u2013May 1793 he, along with [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] and others, violently attacked [[Girondins]].\n\nIn February 1793, he voted with fellow bourgeois [[H\u00e9bertists]] against the [[Maximum Price Act]], a [[price ceiling]] on grain, on the grounds it would cause hoarding and stir resentment. On 20 May 1793 the moderate majority of the [[National Convention]] formed the [[Special Commission of Twelve]], which was designed to investigate and prosecute conspirators. At the urging of the Twelve on 24 May 1793 he was arrested.\n\nHowever, H\u00e9bert had been warned in time, and, with the support of the Sans Culottes, the National Convention was forced to order his release three days later.\n\n==Dechristianization==\nDechristianization was a movement that took hold during the French Revolution in which advocates believed that, in order to pursue a secular society, they had to reject the superstitions of the old regime and, as an extension, Catholicism. The trend toward secularization had already begun to take hold throughout France during the eighteenth century; however, between September 1793 and August 1794, French politicians began discussing and embracing notions of \"radical dechristianization.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution|last=Chartier|first=Roger|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1991|pages=105\u2013106|via=}}</ref> While Robespierre advocated for the right to religion and believed that aggressively pursuing dechristianization would spur widespread revolts throughout rural France, H\u00e9bert and his followers, the H\u00e9bertists, wanted to spontaneously and violently overhaul religion.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Furies: Violene and Terror in the French and Russian Revolutions|last=Mayer|first=Arno J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2000|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=441\u2013442|via=}}</ref> The program of dechristianization waged against [[Catholicism]], and eventually against all forms of [[Christianity]], included the [[deportation]] of clergy and the condemnation of many of them to death, the closing of churches, the institution of revolutionary and civic [[cult]]s, the large scale destruction of religious monuments, the outlawing of public and private worship and religious education, forced marriages of the clergy and forced abjurement of their [[priesthood]].<ref name=\"Latreille\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=French Revolution|encyclopedia=[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Thomson-Gale]]|last=Latreille|first=A.|edition=Second Ed. 2003|volume=5|pages=972\u2013973|isbn=978-0-7876-4004-0}}</ref> On 21 October 1793 a law was passed which made all suspected priests and all persons who harbored them liable to death on sight.<ref name=\"Latreille\"/>\n\nOn 10 November 1793, dechristianization reached what many historians consider the climax of the movement when the H\u00e9bertists moved the first celebration of the Festival of Reason, a civic festival celebrating the goddess of Reason, from the Circus of the Palais Royale to the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] and reclaimed the cathedral as a \"Temple of Reason.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> On 7 June Robespierre, who had previously condemned the ''[[Cult of Reason]]'', advocated a new state religion and recommended that the Convention acknowledge the existence of [[God]]. On the next day, the worship of the deistic [[Cult of the Supreme Being|''Supreme Being'']] was inaugurated as an official aspect of the Revolution. Compared with H\u00e9bert's somewhat popular festivals, this austere new religion of Virtue was received with signs of hostility by the Parisian public.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Clash with Robespierre, arrest, conviction, and execution==\nAfter successfully attacking the [[Girondins]], H\u00e9bert continued to attack others whom he viewed as too moderate, including Danton, [[Pierre Philippeaux|Philippeau]], and [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] in the fall of 1793 among others. When H\u00e9bert accused Marie-Antoinette during her trial of incest with her son, Robespierre called him a fool (\"imb\u00e9cile\").<ref>[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k41180s/f1n73.pdf?download=1 Joachim Vilate (1795) Causes secr\u00e8tes de la r\u00e9volution du 9 au 10 thermidor, p. 12-13]</ref>\n\nThe government, with support from the Jacobins, was exasperated and finally decided to strike on the night of 13 March 1794, despite the reluctance of [[Bertrand Bar\u00e8re|Bar\u00e8re de Vieuzac]], [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne|Billaud-Varenne]]. The order was to arrest the leaders of the [[H\u00e9bertists]]; these included individuals in the War Ministry and others.\n\nIn the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], H\u00e9bert was treated very differently from Danton, more like a thief than a conspirator; his earlier scams were brought to light and criticized. He was sentenced to death with his co-defendants on the third day of deliberations. Their execution by guillotine took place on 24 March 1794.<ref>Doyle (1989); p.270. |\"The trial took place on 21\u20134 March, its result a foregone conclusion. Among those who went to the scaffold with Pere Duchesne on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth were Vincent, Ronsin, and the leader of section Marat, Momoro.\"</ref> H\u00e9bert fainted several times on the way to the guillotine, and screamed hysterically when he was placed under the blade. H\u00e9bert's executioners amused the crowd by adjusting the guillotine so that its blade stopped inches above his neck,<ref>Page 27 BBC History Magazine, September 2015</ref> and it was only after the fourth time the lever (''d\u00e9clic'') was pulled that he was actually beheaded. His corpse was disposed of in the [[Madeleine Cemetery]]. [[Marie Marguerite Fran\u00e7oise H\u00e9bert|His widow]] was executed twenty days later on 13 April 1794, and her corpse was disposed of in the [[Errancis Cemetery]].\n\n==Influence==\nIt is difficult to ascertain the extent to which H\u00e9bert's publication ''Le P\u00e8re Duchesne'' impacted the outcomes of political events between 1790 and 1794. French revolutionary historians such as Jean-Paul Bertraud, Jeremy D. Popkin, and William J. Murray each investigated French Revolutionary press history and determined that while the newspapers and magazines that one read during the revolution may have influenced their political leanings, it did not necessarily create their political leanings. One's class, for example, could be a significant determinant in directing and influencing one's political decisions. Therefore, H\u00e9bert's writings certainly influenced his audience to some extent, but that does not mean that it changed the political outcomes of the French Revolution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jeremy D.|first=Popkin|year=1990|title=The Press and the French Revolution after Two Hundred Years|jstor=286493|journal=French Historical Studies|volume=16|issue=3|pages=688\u2013670}}</ref> That being said, his wide readership and voice throughout the Revolution means that he was a significant public figure and Le P\u00e8re Duchesne's ability to influence the general population of France was indeed notable.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Le_Pere_Duchesne.jpg|Illustration from the P\u00e8re Duchesne broadsides.\nImage:LetterHebertPalloy.jpg|A Letter by Jacques H\u00e9bert to Citizen [[Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Palloy]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=H\u00e9bert, Jacques Ren\u00e9|volume=13|page=167}} The 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', in turn, gives the following references:\n**Louis Duval, \"H\u00e9bert chez lui\", in ''La R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise, revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine'', t. xii. and t. xiii.\n**D.
