The method is used in [[radiology]], [[archaeology]], [[biology]], [[atmospheric science]], [[geophysics]], [[oceanography]], [[plasma physics]], [[materials science]], [[astrophysics]], [[quantum information]], and other areas of science. The word ''tomography'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] \u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ''tomos'', \"slice, section\" and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9 ''graph\u014d'', \"to write\" or, in this context as well, \" to describe.\" A device used in tomography is called a tomograph, while the image produced is a tomogram.\n\nIn many cases, the production of these images is based on the mathematical procedure [[tomographic reconstruction]], such as [[CT scan|X-ray computed tomography]] technically being produced from multiple [[projectional radiograph]]s. Many different [[reconstruction algorithm]]s exist. Most algorithms fall into one of two categories: [[filtered back projection]] (FBP) and [[iterative reconstruction]] (IR). These procedures give inexact results: they represent a compromise between accuracy and computation time required. FBP demands fewer computational resources, while IR generally produces fewer artifacts (errors in the reconstruction) at a higher computing cost.<ref name=\"ref1\">Herman, G. T., Fundamentals of computerized tomography: Image reconstruction from projection,  2nd edition, Springer, 2009</ref>\n\nAlthough [[MRI]] and [[ultrasound]] are transmission methods, they typically do not require movement of the transmitter to acquire data from different directions. In MRI, both projections and higher spatial harmonics are sampled by applying spatially-varying magnetic fields; no moving parts are necessary to generate an image. On the other hand, since ultrasound uses time-of-flight to spatially encode the received signal, it is not strictly a tomographic method and does not require multiple acquisitions at all.\n\n==Types of tomography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n !

By the laws of electrodynamics this acceleration leads to the emission of electromagnetic radiation (Jackson, 1975). Linear particle acceleration is one possibility, but apart from the very high electric fields one would need it is more practical to hold the charged particles on a\nclosed trajectory in order to obtain a source of continuous radiation. Magnetic fields are used to force the particles onto the desired orbit and prevent them from flying in a straight line. The radial acceleration associated with the change of direction then generates radiation.<ref>Banhart, John, ed. Advanced Tomographic Methods in Materials Research and Engineering.

A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired, for example, by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], or [[Microtomography|MicroCT]] [[Image scanner|scanner]]. These are usually acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern.\nThis is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\nTo render a 2D projection of the 3D data set, one first needs to define a [[Virtual camera|camera]] in space relative to the volume.  Also, one needs to define the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] and color of every voxel.\nThis is usually defined using an [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] (for red, green, blue, alpha) [[transfer function]] that defines the RGBA value for every possible voxel value.\n\nFor example, a volume may be viewed by extracting [[isosurface]]s (surfaces of equal values) from the volume and rendering them as [[Polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]] or by rendering the volume directly as a block of data.  The [[marching cubes]] algorithm is a common technique for extracting an isosurface from volume data. Direct volume rendering is a computationally intensive task that may be performed in several ways.\n\n==History==\n[[Focal plane tomography]] was developed in the 1930s by the radiologist [[Alessandro Vallebona]], and proved useful in reducing the problem of superimposition of structures in [[projectional radiography]]. In a 1953 article in the medical journal [[Chest (journal)|''Chest'']], B. Pollak of the [[Fort William Sanatorium]] described the use of planography, another term for tomography.<ref>{{cite journal\n |title      = Experiences with Planography\n |first      = B.\n |last       = Pollak\n |journal    = Chest\n |doi        = 10.1378/chest.24.6.663\n |pmid = 13107564\n |date       = December 1953\n |volume     = 24\n |issue      = 6\n |pages      = 663\u2013669\n |url        = http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/24/6/663.abstract\n |issn       = 0012-3692\n |accessdate = July 10, 2011\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> Focal plane tomography remained the conventional form of tomography until being largely replaced by mainly [[computed tomography]] the late-1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Littleton|first=J.T.|title=A History of the Radiological Sciences|publisher=[[American Roentgen Ray Society]]|chapter-url=http://www.arrs.org/publications/HRS/diagnosis/RCI_D_c15.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2014|chapter=Conventional Tomography}}</ref> Focal plane tomography uses the fact that the focal plane appears sharper, while structures in other planes appear blurred.

By the laws of electrodynamics this acceleration leads to the emission of electromagnetic radiation (Jackson, 1975). Linear particle acceleration is one possibility, but apart from the very high electric fields one would need it is more practical to hold the charged particles on a\nclosed trajectory in order to obtain a source of continuous radiation. Magnetic fields are used to force the particles onto the desired orbit and prevent them from flying in a straight line. The radial acceleration associated with the change of direction then generates radiation.<ref>Banhart, John, ed. Advanced Tomographic Methods in Materials Research and Engineering.

A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired, for example, by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], or [[Microtomography|MicroCT]] [[Image scanner|scanner]]. These are usually acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern.\nThis is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\nTo render a 2D projection of the 3D data set, one first needs to define a [[Virtual camera|camera]] in space relative to the volume.  Also, one needs to define the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] and color of every voxel.\nThis is usually defined using an [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] (for red, green, blue, alpha) [[transfer function]] that defines the RGBA value for every possible voxel value.\n\nFor example, a volume may be viewed by extracting [[isosurface]]s (surfaces of equal values) from the volume and rendering them as [[Polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]] or by rendering the volume directly as a block of data.  The [[marching cubes]] algorithm is a common technique for extracting an isosurface from volume data. Direct volume rendering is a computationally intensive task that may be performed in several ways.\n\n==History==\n[[Focal plane tomography]] was developed in the 1930s by the radiologist [[Alessandro Vallebona]], and proved useful in reducing the problem of superimposition of structures in [[projectional radiography]]. In a 1953 article in the medical journal [[Chest (journal)|''Chest'']], B. Pollak of the [[Fort William Sanatorium]] described the use of planography, another term for tomography.<ref>{{cite journal\n |title      = Experiences with Planography\n |first      = B.\n |last       = Pollak\n |journal    = Chest\n |doi        = 10.1378/chest.24.6.663\n |pmid = 13107564\n |date       = December 1953\n |volume     = 24\n |issue      = 6\n |pages      = 663\u2013669\n |url        = http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/24/6/663.abstract\n |issn       = 0012-3692\n |accessdate = July 10, 2011\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> Focal plane tomography remained the conventional form of tomography until being largely replaced by mainly [[computed tomography]] the late-1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Littleton|first=J.T.|title=A History of the Radiological Sciences|publisher=[[American Roentgen Ray Society]]|chapter-url=http://www.arrs.org/publications/HRS/diagnosis/RCI_D_c15.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2014|chapter=Conventional Tomography}}</ref> Focal plane tomography uses the fact that the focal plane appears sharper, while structures in other planes appear blurred.

The announcement of the winner has coincided with the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] weekend, with an award ceremony the following Wednesday which was hosted by the Detroit Rotary Club at the [[Detroit Athletic Club]] through 2013.<ref name=\"The Award Selection Process\"/> Beginning with the 2014 award to Odyssey Sims of Baylor University, the Nancy Lieberman Award has been presented by the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Final Four proceedings, and is now presented at the annual convention of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA).\n\nThe 2017\u201318 season started a new era for the award. Since that season, the WBCA has partnered with the Naismith Hall in the presentation of the award. The two bodies also incorporated the Lieberman Award into a new set of awards known as the \"Naismith Starting Five\", presented at the WBCA convention (except in 2020, when the convention was not held due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]) to players at each of the five traditional basketball positions. These awards parallel a previously existing set of men's basketball positional awards also presented by the Hall. The other four are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wbca.org/recognize/player-awards/naismith-starting-5 |title=Naismith Starting 5 |publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association |accessdate=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Ann Meyers Drysdale Award|Ann Meyers Drysdale Shooting Guard Award]]\n* [[Cheryl Miller Award|Cheryl Miller Small Forward Award]]\n* [[Katrina McClain Award|Katrina McClain Power Forward Award]]\n* [[Lisa Leslie Award|Lisa Leslie Center Award]]\n\nThe voting body for the Lieberman Award also changed upon its incorporation into the Naismith Starting Five. Each of the Starting Five awards is now determined by a selection committee consisting of Hall of Famers, WBCA coaching members, and media, and headed by the award's namesake. Fan voting through the Hall's website is also incorporated into the selection process.\n\n[[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]] is the only program that has produced more than one Lieberman Award recipient, having had four players combine for a total of eight awards (Bird, [[Diana Taurasi]], [[Renee Montgomery]], and [[Moriah Jefferson]]). The only other programs with more than one award, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball|Notre Dame]] and [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]], have each had a single player win all of that program's awards, respectively [[Skylar Diggins-Smith|Skylar Diggins]] (twice) and Ionescu (three times).\n\n==Key==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |*\n|Awarded, in addition, a national Player of the Year award: <br>the [[Naismith College Player of the Year]], [[Wade Trophy]] or the [[John R.

The announcement of the winner has coincided with the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] weekend, with an award ceremony the following Wednesday which was hosted by the Detroit Rotary Club at the [[Detroit Athletic Club]] through 2013.<ref name=\"The Award Selection Process\"/> Beginning with the 2014 award to Odyssey Sims of Baylor University, the Nancy Lieberman Award has been presented by the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Final Four proceedings, and is now presented at the annual convention of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA).\n\nThe 2017\u201318 season started a new era for the award. Since that season, the WBCA has partnered with the Naismith Hall in the presentation of the award. The two bodies also incorporated the Lieberman Award into a new set of awards known as the \"Naismith Starting Five\", presented at the WBCA convention (except in 2020, when the convention was not held due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]) to players at each of the five traditional basketball positions. These awards parallel a previously existing set of men's basketball positional awards also presented by the Hall. The other four are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wbca.org/recognize/player-awards/naismith-starting-5 |title=Naismith Starting 5 |publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association |accessdate=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Ann Meyers Drysdale Award|Ann Meyers Drysdale Shooting Guard Award]]\n* [[Cheryl Miller Award|Cheryl Miller Small Forward Award]]\n* [[Katrina McClain Award|Katrina McClain Power Forward Award]]\n* [[Lisa Leslie Award|Lisa Leslie Center Award]]\n\nThe voting body for the Lieberman Award also changed upon its incorporation into the Naismith Starting Five. Each of the Starting Five awards is now determined by a selection committee consisting of Hall of Famers, WBCA coaching members, and media, and headed by the award's namesake. Fan voting through the Hall's website is also incorporated into the selection process.\n\n[[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]] is the only program that has produced more than one Lieberman Award recipient, having had four players combine for a total of eight awards (Bird, [[Diana Taurasi]], [[Renee Montgomery]], and [[Moriah Jefferson]]). The only other programs with more than one award, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball|Notre Dame]] and [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]], have each had a single player win all of that program's awards, respectively [[Skylar Diggins-Smith|Skylar Diggins]] (twice) and Ionescu (three times).\n\n==Key==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |*\n|Awarded, in addition, a national Player of the Year award: <br>the [[Naismith College Player of the Year]], [[Wade Trophy]] or the [[John R.

In relation to the third ground, the court ruled that the requirement for the jury to be present during arraignment did not require physical presence and that presence via video link (as was the case here) was adequate to satisfy this requirement.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\n=== Acquittal ===\nOn 17 September, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]], the final court of appeal in Australia.<ref>There is no automatic right to appeal to the High Court; special leave is always required.</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal lodge ABCNews\">{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/george-pell-to-appeal-to-the-high-court/11437796 |title=George Pell seeks leave to appeal child sex abuse convictions in High Court |first=Sarah |last=Farnsworth |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=17 September 2019 |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/choirboy-can-be-believed-and-pell-freed-cardinal-s-lawyers-say-20190920-p52t8f.html|last=Le Grand|first=Chip|title=Choirboy can be believed \u2013 and Pell freed, Cardinal's lawyers say|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 September 2019|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> On 13 November, two justices of the High Court referred the decision on leave to appeal to a full court \"for argument as on an appeal\".<ref name=\"HCA appeal grant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2019/217.html |title=Pell v The Queen [2019] HCATrans 217 (13 November 2019) |website=High Court of Australia Transcripts |date=13 November 2019 |accessdate=13 November 2019}}  This decision was made \"on the papers\".

Review after outcome of HCA appeal. -->\nOn the first ground of appeal, that the verdict was unreasonable, the court granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal by a majority (2\u20131) decision. Chief Justice Ferguson and Justice Maxwell dismissed the appeal. Ferguson stated that, for the appeal to succeed, the court needed to find that the jury ''must'' have had doubt as to the defendant's guilt, not merely that they ''could'' have had doubt. Justice Weinberg issued a dissenting judgment and would have allowed the appeal on the first ground.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\nWhilst Chief Justice Ferguson and Justice Maxwell stated that they \"did not experience a doubt\" in the case, the dissenting Judge Weinberg likened the case to that of [[Lindy Chamberlain]], which had seen wrongful conviction by a jury and appeal court based on faulty evidence:<ref>[https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/dissenting-judge-used-lindy-chamberlains-case-to-dismiss-guilty-pell-verdict/ar-AAGa8h1 \"Dissenting judge used Lindy Chamberlain's case to dismiss guilty Pell verdict\"], www.msn.com, 22 August 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/case-summaries/court-of-appeal-proceedings/george-pell-v-the-queen \"George Pell v The Queen\"], Victorian Court of Appeal.</ref> Weinberg wrote that \"there is, to my mind, a 'significant possibility' that the applicant in this case may not have committed these offences. That means that, in my respectful opinion, these convictions cannot be permitted to stand. The only order that can properly be made is that the applicant be acquitted on each charge.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/21/he-was-a-witness-of-truth-why-the-judges-decided-cardinal-george-pell-was-guilty \"He was a witness of truth: why the judges decided Cardinal George Pell was guilty\"], ''The Guardian'', 21 August 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/vic/VSCA//2019/186.html \"Pell v The Queen &#91;2019&#93;\"], VSCA 186, 21 August 2019.</ref>\n\nThe court unanimously refused leave to appeal on the second and third grounds. In relation to the second ground, Chief Justice Ferguson described the visual aid that Pell's lawyer sought to present in his closing address as tendentious, as potentially misleading or confusing and as including material that was unsupported by evidence in the trial record. The court ruled that the trial judge had been correct to exclude it. In relation to the third ground, the court ruled that the requirement for the jury to be present during arraignment did not require physical presence and that presence via video link (as was the case here) was adequate to satisfy this requirement.<ref name=\"VCA dismissal\" />\n\n=== Acquittal ===\nOn 17 September, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]], the final court of appeal in Australia.<ref>There is no automatic right to appeal to the High Court; special leave is always required.</ref><ref name=\"HCA appeal lodge ABCNews\">{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/george-pell-to-appeal-to-the-high-court/11437796 |title=George Pell seeks leave to appeal child sex abuse convictions in High Court |first=Sarah |last=Farnsworth |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=17 September 2019 |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/choirboy-can-be-believed-and-pell-freed-cardinal-s-lawyers-say-20190920-p52t8f.html|last=Le Grand|first=Chip|title=Choirboy can be believed \u2013 and Pell freed, Cardinal's lawyers say|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 September 2019|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> On 13 November, two justices of the High Court referred the decision on leave to appeal to a full court \"for argument as on an appeal\".<ref name=\"HCA appeal grant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2019/217.html |title=Pell v The Queen [2019] HCATrans 217 (13 November 2019) |website=High Court of Australia Transcripts |date=13 November 2019 |accessdate=13 November 2019}}  This decision was made \"on the papers\".

The film is based on [[Stephen King]]'s 1977 novel [[The Shining (novel)|of the same name]] and stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Shelley Duvall]], [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Danny Lloyd]].\n\nThe  central character in ''The Shining'' is [[Jack Torrance]] (Nicholson), an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the [[Southern Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rockies]]. Wintering over with Jack are his wife, [[Wendy Torrance]] (Duvall) and young son, [[Danny Torrance]] (Lloyd). Danny possesses \"the shining\", psychic abilities that enable him to see into the hotel's horrific past. The hotel cook, [[Dick Hallorann (The Shining)|Dick Hallorann]] (Crothers), also has this ability and is able to communicate with Danny telepathically. The hotel had a previous winter caretaker who went insane and killed his family and himself. After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel, placing his wife and son in danger.\n\nProduction took place almost exclusively at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|EMI Elstree Studios]], with sets based on real locations. Kubrick often worked with a small crew, which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new [[Steadicam]] mount was used to shoot several scenes, giving the film an innovative and immersive look and feel. There has been much speculation into the meanings and actions in the film because of inconsistencies, ambiguities, symbolism, and differences from the book.\n\nThe film was released in the [[United States]] on May 23, 1980, and in the [[United Kingdom]] on October 2, 1980, by [[Warner Bros.]] There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut shorter than the one preceding it; about 27 minutes were cut in total. Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; Stephen King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. Critical opinion has become more favorable and it is now widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential horror films ever made]] and has become a staple of pop culture. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Landrum Jr. |url=https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40 |title='Jurassic Park,' 'Shining' added to National Film Registry |website=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 12, 2018 |accessdate=December 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181212090412/https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40|archive-date=December 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA sequel, ''[[Doctor Sleep (2019 film)|Doctor Sleep]]'', was released on November 8, 2019, in the United States, and on October 31, 2019, in Europe.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nSchool teacher-turned-writer [[Jack Torrance]] arrives at the remote Overlook Hotel in the [[Rocky Mountains]] to be interviewed for the position of winter caretaker. The hotel, which opened in 1909 and was built on the site of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] burial ground, closes during the snowed-in months. Once hired, Jack plans to use the hotel's solitude to write. Manager Stuart Ullman tells Jack about the hotel's history and warns him about its reputation: a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, supposedly developed [[cabin fever]] and killed his family and himself. Despite the troubling story, Jack is impressed with the hotel and gets the job. In [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Jack's son, [[Danny Torrance|Danny]], has a terrifying premonition about the hotel, and Jack's wife, [[Wendy Torrance|Wendy]], tells a doctor about Danny's imaginary friend, Tony.\n\nWhen the family moves into the hotel on closing day, head chef [[Dick Hallorann (The Shining)|Dick Hallorann]] surprises Danny by [[telepathy|telepathically]] offering him ice cream. Hallorann explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls \"shining\". Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel has a \"shine\" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good. He also tells Danny to stay away from room 237.<!-- Changed from novel's room 217. Please do not change -->\n\nA month passes; while Jack's writing goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze and Hallorann goes to [[Florida]]. Wendy learns that the phone lines are out due to the heavy snowfall, and Danny has frightening visions. Jack behaves strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts. Danny's curiosity about room 237 overcomes him when he sees the room's door open. Later, Wendy finds Jack screaming during a nightmare while asleep at his typewriter. After she awakens him, Jack says he dreamed that he killed her and Danny. Danny arrives, visibly traumatized and bruised. Wendy accuses Jack of abusing him, which Jack denies.\n\nJack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room and meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd, to whom he complains about his marriage. Wendy tells Jack that Danny told her a \"crazy woman\" in room 237 attempted to strangle him. Jack investigates room 237 and encounters a dead woman's ghost, but he tells Wendy that he saw nothing. Wendy and Jack argue over whether Danny should be removed from the hotel, and Jack angrily returns to the Gold Room, which is now filled with ghosts attending a ball. While participating, he meets a ghostly waiter who identifies himself as Delbert Grady. Grady informs Jack that Danny has reached out to Hallorann using his \"talent\", and says that Jack must \"correct\" his wife and child. Hallorann grows concerned about what is going on at the hotel and flies back to Colorado. Danny calls out \"redrum\" and goes into another trance, referring to himself as \"Tony\".{{anchor|all work}}\n\nWhile searching for Jack, Wendy discovers that her now-deranged husband has been typing pages filled with the phrase \"[[All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy]]\". She begs Jack to leave the hotel with Danny, but he threatens her. Wendy knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat and locks him in the kitchen pantry, but she and Danny are both trapped as Jack has disabled the hotel's two-way radio and [[snowcat]]. Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady. Moments later the door is unlocked, freeing Jack.\n\nDanny continues chanting and drawing the word \"REDRUM\". When Wendy sees the word reversed in the bedroom mirror, the word is revealed to be \"MURDER\". Jack hacks through the quarters' main door with an axe. Wendy sends Danny through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to pass. Jack breaks through the door, but retreats after Wendy slashes his hand with a knife. Hearing Hallorann arriving in a snowcat, Jack ambushes and murders him in the lobby, then pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering ghosts, a cascade of blood Danny envisioned in Boulder, and Hallorann's corpse. Danny lays a false trail to mislead Jack and hides behind a snowdrift.\n\nDanny escapes from the maze and reunites with Wendy; they leave in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death after losing Danny's trail. In a photograph in the hotel hallway, Jack is pictured standing amid a crowd of party revelers from 1921.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Jack Torrance]]\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as [[Wendy Torrance]]\n* [[Danny Lloyd]] as [[Danny Torrance]]\n* [[Scatman Crothers]] as [[Dick Hallorann]]\n* [[Barry Nelson]] as Stuart Ullman\n* [[Philip Stone]] as Delbert Grady\n* [[Joe Turkel]] as Lloyd\n* [[Anne Jackson]] as Doctor\n* [[Tony Burton]] as Larry Durkin\n* Lia Beldam as Young Woman in Bath\n* Billie Gibson as Old Woman in Bath\n* [[Barry Dennen]] as Bill Watson\n* Lisa and Louise Burns as Grady Twins\n* [[Robin Pappas]] as Nurse\n* Norman Gay as Apparition with Gash\n}}\n\nIn the European cut, all of the scenes involving Jackson and Burton were removed but the credits remained unchanged.

Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with ''Barry Lyndon''{{'}}s lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.\"<ref>LoBrutto, Vincent, \"Stanley Kubrick, A Biography,\" (1997), p. 412</ref>\n\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".<ref name=\"Duncan, Paul 2003 9\">{{citation |title=Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films |year=2003 |author=Duncan, Paul |page=9 |publisher=Taschen GmbH |isbn=978-3836527750}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nNicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included [[Robert De Niro]] (who claims the film gave him nightmares for a month),<ref>[[Robert De Niro]] (speaking about which films scared him), [[B105 FM]] interview on September 20, 2007</ref> [[Robin Williams]], and [[Harrison Ford]], all of whom met with [[Stephen King]]'s disapproval.<ref>[[Stephen King]], [[B105 FM]] on November 21, 2007</ref> In his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband and wife team, Leon and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period. These cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent which fell in between Jack Nicholson's and Shelley Duvall's speech patterns.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 420</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n==== Interior sets ====\n[[File:Ahwahnee Hotel - Lobby.jpeg|thumb|The lobby and lounge of the Overlook Hotel was modeled on the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] and was created at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios.]]]]\n\nHaving chosen King's novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had [[set construction|sets constructed]] on soundstages at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|EMI Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], England. Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]. To enable him to shoot the scenes in chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production. The set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel.<ref>[http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/shining_closing_day.htm Kubrick's The Shining \u2013 Closing Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219031116/http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/shining_closing_day.htm |date=December 19, 2013 }} idyllopuspress.com</ref> In February 1979, the set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stanley Kubrick on the burned down set of ''The Shining'' |url=http://filmmakeriq.com/images/stanley-kubrick-on-the-burnt-down-set-of-the-shining/ |accessdate=March 13, 2017 |work=FilmMaker IQ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313220526/http://filmmakeriq.com/images/stanley-kubrick-on-the-burnt-down-set-of-the-shining/|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kubrick at Elstree: The fire that almost axed The Shining |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p027vf9p |accessdate=March 13, 2017 |work=BBC Arts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016152112/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p027vf9p|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Exterior locations ====\n[[File:Timberline Lodge, Oregon (2013) - 04.JPG|thumb|left|[[Timberline Lodge]] in [[Oregon]] served as the exterior of the Overlook Hotel.]]\nWhile most of the interior shots, and even some of the Overlook exterior shots, were shot on studio sets, a few exterior shots were shot on location by a second-unit crew headed by [[Jan Harlan]].

(8648670619).jpg|thumb|Page from ''The Shining'' screenplay|right]]\n''The Shining'' had a prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays. Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature. Actress Shelley Duvall did not get along with Kubrick, frequently arguing with him on set about lines in the script, her acting techniques and numerous other things. Duvall eventually became so overwhelmed by the stress of her role that she became physically ill for months. At one point, she was under so much stress that her hair began to fall out. The shooting script was being changed constantly, sometimes several times a day, adding more stress. Nicholson eventually became so frustrated with the ever-changing script that he would throw away the copies that the production team had given him to memorize, knowing that it was going to change anyway. He learned most of his lines just minutes before filming them. Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend [[Anjelica Huston]] and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days.<ref>Huston, Allegra. ''Love Child, a Memoir of Family Lost and Found''. Simon & Schuster (2009) p. 214</ref> Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the \"bar scene\" for six weeks, and that the shoot day lasted from 9{{nbsp}}a.m. to 10:30{{nbsp}}p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in perspiration by the end of the day's shoot. He also added that it was his favorite scene in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3B10XziCZU?t=50s |title=Joe Turkel, Co Star of \"Blade Runner\" and \"The Shining\", at Days Of The Dead Horror Con |last=ZFOnline |date=October 6, 2014 |via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nFor the final Gold Room sequence, Kubrick instructed the extras (via megaphone) not to talk, \"but to mime conversation to each other. Kubrick knew from years of scrutinizing thousands of films that extras could often mime their business by nodding and using large gestures that look fake.

It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, [[Garrett Brown]], was heavily involved with the production of ''The Shining''. Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets, which offered \"further possibilities for the Steadicam\". This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not \"just talking of stunt shots and staircases\". Rather he would use the Steadicam \"as it was intended to be used&nbsp;\u2014 as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane\". Brown used an 18&nbsp;mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 426</ref> Brown published an article in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' about his experience,<ref>Brown, G. (1980) The Steadicam and The Shining. American Cinematographer. Reproduced at [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/page2.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413131605/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/page2.htm |date=April 13, 2012 }} without issue date or pages given</ref> and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.\n\n[[File:Ahwahnee Hotel - Great Lounge.jpg|thumb|The Overlook Hotel's Colorado Lounge set was modeled in large part on the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]]'s Great Lounge.]]\nKubrick personally aided in modifying the Steadicam's video transmission technology. Brown states his own abilities to operate the Steadicam were refined by working on Kubrick's film. For this film, Brown developed a two-handed technique, which enabled him to maintain the camera at one height while panning and tilting the camera. In addition to tracking shots from behind, the Steadicam enabled shooting in constricted rooms without flying out walls, or backing the camera into doors. Brown notes that:\n{{cquote|One of the most talked-about shots in the picture is the eerie tracking sequence which follows Danny as he pedals at high speed through corridor after corridor on his plastic [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel]] tricycle. The soundtrack explodes with noise when the wheel is on wooden flooring and is abruptly silent as it crosses over carpet. We needed to have the lens just a few inches from the floor and to travel rapidly just behind or ahead of the bike.}}\n\nThis required the Steadicam to be on a special mount, modeled on a wheelchair, in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires, however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform successive identical takes.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 436</ref> Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.\n\n==Music and soundtrack==\nThe stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Although the repertoire was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of [[music editor]] Gordon Stainforth, whose work on this film is known for the attention to fine details and remarkably precise synchronization without excessive splicing.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barham |first1=J.M. |title=Terror Tracks: Music and Sound in Horror Cinema |date=2009 |publisher=Equinox Press |location=London, U.K.|chapter-url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/1956/ |isbn=978-1845532024 |pages=137\u2013170 |chapter=Incorporating Monsters: Music as Context, Character and Construction in Kubrick\u2019s ''The Shining''|access-date=July 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804133256/http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/1956/|archive-date=August 4, 2017}}{{oa}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack album on LP was withdrawn due to problems with licensing of the music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gengaro |first=Christine Lee |date=2013 |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |url= |location= |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=190 |isbn=9780810885646 |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |date=1999 |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |url= |location= |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=448 |isbn=9780306809064 |access-date=}}</ref> The LP soundtrack omits some pieces heard in the film, and also includes complete versions of pieces of which only fragments are heard in the film.\n\nThe non-original music on the soundtrack is as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiviokubrick.it/risorse/saggi/The_Music_in_The_Shining.pdf |title=The Music in ''The Shining'' |last=Sbravatti |first=Valerio |date=2010 |website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024042850/http://www.archiviokubrick.it/risorse/saggi/The_Music_in_The_Shining.pdf|archive-date=October 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n# \"Lontano\" by [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Ernest Bour]] [[conducting]] the [[Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra]] ([[WERGO|Wergo Records]])\n# \"[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]\" by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] ([[Deutsche Grammophon]])\n# \"[[Utrenja]]\" \u2013 excerpts from the \"Ewangelia\" and \"Kanon Paschy\" movements by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Andrzej Markowski]] conducting the [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra]] ([[Polskie Nagrania Muza|Polskie Nagrania Records]])\n# \"[[The Dream of Jacob|The Awakening of Jacob]]\", \"[[De Natura Sonoris|De Natura Sonoris No. 1]]\" (the latter not on the soundtrack album, [[Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[Henryk Czy\u017c]]) and \"[[De Natura Sonoris|De Natura Sonoris No. 2]]\" by Krzysztof Penderecki (Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrzej Markowski, Polskie Nagrania Records)\n# \"Home\", performed by [[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Hall]] and the [[Gleneagles Hotel]] Band ([[Columbia Records]])\n# \"It's All Forgotten Now\" by [[Al Bowlly]], performed by [[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble]] and His Orchestra (not on the soundtrack album)\n# \"Masquerade\", performed by [[Jack Hylton]] and His Orchestra (not on soundtrack)\n# \"[[Kanon (liturgy)|Kanon]] (for string orchestra)\" by Krzysztof Penderecki (not on soundtrack)\n# \"[[Polymorphia]] (for string orchestra)\" by Krzysztof Penderecki, Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Henryk Czy\u017c (not on soundtrack)\n\nUpon their arrival at Elstree Studios, [[Wendy Carlos]] and [[Rachel Elkind]] were shown the first version of the film by Kubrick: \"The film was a little on the long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been arranged in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot of those. We didn't know what was going to be used for sure\".<ref>LoBrutto, p.447</ref> After having something similar happen to her on ''Clockwork Orange,'' Carlos has said that she was so disillusioned by Kubrick's actions that she vowed never to work with him again.

''Stanley Kubrick: A Biography'', p. 449 <!-- additional book info. needed --></ref> The European release of ''The Shining'' a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to Kubrick's removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.\n\n===Post-release edit===\nAfter its premiere and a week into the general run (with a running time of 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a scene at the end that took place in a hospital. The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr. Ullman who explains that Jack's body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel. This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of [[Warner Bros.]], the film's distributor. This cut the film's running time to 144 minutes. [[Roger Ebert]] commented: {{quote|If Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found \u2013 and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack's body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past and does that explain Jack's presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel party-goers in 1921? Did Jack's violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy's imagination, or Danny's, or theirs?&nbsp;... Kubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.<ref name=Ebert06/>}}\n\n===European version===\nFor its release in Europe, Kubrick cut about 25 minutes from the film.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Monthly Film Bulletin |author=Combs, Richard |date=November 1980 |volume=47 |issue=562 |page=221 |title=The Shining |url=http://sightandsounddigital.bfi.org.uk |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shine On...and Out |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/films/cutshining.htm |website=www.visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020151547/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/films/cutshining.htm|archive-date=2016-10-20|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wurm |first1=Gerald |date=2010-11-30 |title=Shining (Comparison: International Version - US Version) - Movie-Censorship.com |url=http://movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=1215 |website=movie-censorship.com|access-date=2011-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714122053/http://movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=1215|archive-date=2011-07-14|url-status=live}}</ref> The excised scenes included: a longer meeting between Jack and Watson at the hotel; Danny being attended by a doctor ([[Anne Jackson]]), including references to Tony and how Danny was once injured by Jack in a drunken rage; more footage of Hallorann's attempts to get to the hotel during the snowstorm, including a sequence with a garage attendant ([[Tony Burton]]); extended dialogue scenes at the hotel; and a scene where Wendy discovers a group of skeletons in the hotel lobby during the climax.

King expressed disappointment that some themes, such as the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism, are less present in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would go mad, due to Nicholson's famous role as of McMurphy in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975).

The decisions his characters make&nbsp;\u2013 whether it's to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety&nbsp;\u2013 are what matter to him. But in Kubrick's ''The Shining'', the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It's a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King's novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like \"insects\" because the director doesn't really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick's highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King's ''The Shining'', the monster is Jack. In Kubrick's, the monster is Kubrick.</blockquote>\n\nKing's oft-cited remark about Kubrick being a man who \"thinks too much and feels too little\" is often misconstrued as a remark on Kubrick's obsessive and detached approach to directing actors, but it is actually a less disparaging reference to Kubrick's skepticism regarding the verisimilitude of the supernatural, which emerged in pre-production conversations between King and Kubrick.{{Editorializing|date=November 2019}} The full context of King's quote is:\n<blockquote> Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of ''The Shining'' is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thewordslinger.com/posts.php?id=37 |title=Quoted in |publisher=Thewordslinger.com |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2011-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831023834/http://thewordslinger.com/posts.php?id=37 |archivedate=August 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nMark Browning, a critic of King's work, observed that King's novels frequently contain a narrative closure that completes the story, which Kubrick's film lacks.<ref>Stephen King on the big screen by Mark Browning p. 239</ref> Browning has in fact argued that King has exactly the opposite problem of which he accused Kubrick. King, he believes, \"feels too much and thinks too little\".\n\nKing was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at [[The Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park, Colorado]], which inspired the story (a decision Kubrick made since the hotel lacked sufficient snow and electricity). However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled ''[[The Shining (miniseries)|The Shining]]'', filmed at The Stanley Hotel.\n\nThe animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\".

It is also assigned in many college film courses, and discussed ubiquitously on the Internet</ref><ref>Blakemore is best known as a spearhead for global warming issues and having been ABC News' Vatican Correspondent since 1970.</ref>  He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are seen. Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground.\n\nBlakemore's general argument is that the film is a metaphor for the genocide of Native Americans. He notes that when Jack kills Hallorann, the dead body is seen lying on a rug with an Indian motif. The blood in the elevator shafts is, for Blakemore, the blood of the Indians in the burial ground on which the hotel was built. The date of the final photograph, July 4th, is meant to be ironic. Blakemore writes:<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blakemore |first1=Bill |title=Kubrik's Shining' Secret |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1987/07/12/kubricks-shining-secret/a7e3433d-e92e-4171-b46f-77817f1743f0/ |accessdate=12 November 2019 |work=Washington Post |publisher=Washington Post |date=July 12, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=KUBRICK SHINING |url=http://williamblakemore.com/Blakemore-%20Kubrick%20Shining.pdf |website=williamblakemore.com |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nAs with some of his other movies, Kubrick ends ''The Shining'' with a powerful visual puzzle that forces the audience to leave the theater asking, \"What was that all about?\" ''The Shining'' ends with an extremely long camera shot moving down a hallway in the Overlook, reaching eventually the central photo among 21 photos on the wall, each capturing previous good times in the hotel. At the head of the party is none other than the Jack we've just seen in 1980. The caption reads: \"Overlook Hotel&nbsp;\u2013 July 4th Ball&nbsp;\u2013 1921.\" The answer to this puzzle, which is a master key to unlocking the whole movie, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries.\n</blockquote>\n\nFilm writer John Capo sees the film as an allegory of [[American imperialism]]. This is exemplified by many clues, such as the closing photo of Jack in the past at a [[4th of July]] party, or Jack's earlier reference to the [[Rudyard Kipling]] poem \"[[The White Man's Burden]]\", which was written to advocate the American colonial seizure of the Philippine islands, justifying imperial conquest as a mission-of-civilization.<ref>{{cite web |last=Capo |first=John |url=http://www.tailslate.net/articles/index.asp?ID=36&lst=n&dpt=articles |title=Tailslate.net |publisher=Tailslate.net |date=September 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803070711/http://www.tailslate.net/articles/index.asp?ID=36&lst=n&dpt=articles |archive-date=August 3, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Jack's line has been interpreted as referring to alcoholism, from which he suffers.\n\n===Geoffrey Cocks and Kubrick's concern with the Holocaust===\nFilm historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore's idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans by arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the [[Holocaust]] (Both Cocks' book and [[Michael Herr]]'s memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life to make a film dealing directly with the Holocaust but could never quite make up his mind). Cocks is a cultural historian best known for describing the impact of the Holocaust on Western culture. Cocks, writing in his book ''The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust'', proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, he says, a strong (though hidden) holocaust subtext in ''The Shining''. This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick's screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel's supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone.<ref name=\"SeeCocks\">{{Anchor|SeeCocks}}{{cite book |title=Depth of Field: Stanley Kubrick, Film, and the Uses of History |year=2006 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wis. |isbn=978-0299216146 |page=174 |edition=1st |editor1=Geoffrey Cocks |editor2=James Diedrick |editor3=Glenn Perusek}}</ref>  Cocks places Kubrick's vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from [[Stephen Crane]]'s short story \"[[The Blue Hotel]]\" (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|p=201|ref=SeeCocks}} In keeping with this tradition, Kubrick's film focuses on domesticity and the Torrances' attempt to use this imposing building as a home which Jack Torrance describes as \"homey\".\n\nCocks claims that Kubrick has elaborately coded many of his historical concerns into the film with manipulations of numbers and colors and his choice of musical numbers, many of which are post-war compositions influenced by the horrors of World War II. Of particular note is Kubrick's use of [[Penderecki]]'s ''The Awakening of Jacob'' to accompany Jack Torrance's dream of killing his family and Danny's vision of past carnage in the hotel, a piece of music originally associated with the horrors of the Holocaust.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|loc=ch. 11|ref=SeeCocks}} Kubrick's pessimistic ending in contrast to Stephen King's optimistic one is in keeping with the motifs that Kubrick wove into the story.\n\nCocks's work has been anthologized and discussed in other works on Stanley Kubrick films, though sometimes with skepticism. Julian Rice, writing in the opening chapter of his book ''Kubrick's Hope'', believes Cocks's views are excessively speculative and contain too many strained \"critical leaps\" of faith. Rice holds that what went on in Kubrick's mind cannot be replicated or corroborated beyond a broad vision of the nature of good and evil (which included concern about the Holocaust) but Kubrick's art is not governed by this one obsession.<ref>Rice, Julian (2008). ''Kubrick's Hope: Discovering Optimism from ''2001 ''to ''Eyes Wide Shut. Scarecrow Press, pp. 11\u201313</ref> Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter for ''The Shining'', commented on Cocks's observations, saying that preoccupation with the Holocaust on Kubrick's part could very likely have motivated his decision to place the hotel on a Native American burial ground, although Kubrick never directly mentioned it to her.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|ref=SeeCocks|p=59, {{Anchor|essayDJ}}''Writing The Shining'', essay by Diane Johnson}}\n\n==Literary allusions==\nGeoffrey Cocks notes that the film contains many allusions to fairy tales, both ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' and the ''[[Three Little Pigs]]'',<ref name=\"SeeCocks\"/> with Jack Torrance identified as the [[Big Bad Wolf]], which [[Bruno Bettelheim]] interprets as standing for \"all the asocial unconscious devouring powers\" that must be overcome by a child's ego.\n\nThe saying \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" appeared first in [[James Howell|James Howell's]] ''Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish'' (1659).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html |title=James Howell Quotes |publisher=Famousquotesandauthors.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215124957/http://famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html |archive-date=December 15, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Ambiguities in the film==\n[[Roger Ebert]] notes that the film does not really have a \"reliable observer\", with the possible exception of Dick Hallorann.

The film critic [[James Berardinelli]], who is generally much less impressed with the film than Ebert, notes that \"King would have us believe that the hotel is haunted. Kubrick is less definitive in the interpretations he offers.\" He dubs the film a failure as a ghost story, but brilliant as a study of \"madness and the [[unreliable narrator]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1482 |title=The Shining (1980) |author=James Berardinelli |date=February 18, 2009 |publisher=REELVIEWS.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019094136/http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1482 |archive-date=October 19, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Ghosts vs. cabin fever===\nIn some sequences, there is a question of whether or not there are ghosts present. In the scenes in which Jack sees ghosts, he is always facing a mirror or, in the case of his storeroom conversation with Grady, a reflective, highly polished door. Film reviewer James Berardinelli notes \"It has been pointed out that there's a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to wonder whether the spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1482 |title=Reelviews Movie Reviews |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019094136/http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1482 |archive-date=October 19, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\nIn ''Hollywood's Stephen King'', [[Tony Magistrale]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>\nKubrick's reliance on mirrors as visual aids for underscoring the thematic meaning of this film portrays visually the internal transformations and oppositions that are occurring to Jack Torrance psychologically. Through&nbsp;... these devices, Kubrick dramatizes the hotel's methodical assault on Torrance's identity, its ability to stimulate the myriad of self-doubts and anxieties by creating opportunities to warp Torrance's perspective on himself and [his family]. Furthermore the fact that Jack looks into a mirror whenever he \"speaks\" to the hotel means, to some extent, that Kubrick implicates him directly into the hotel's \"consciousness\", because Jack is, in effect, talking to himself.<ref>Hollywood's Stephen King by Tony Magistrale Palgrave Macmillan 2003 pp.95\u201396</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nGhosts are the implied explanation for Jack's seemingly physically impossible escape from the locked storeroom. In an interview of Kubrick by scholar [[Michel Ciment]], the director made comments about the scene in the book that may imply he similarly thought of the scene in the film as a key reveal in this dichotomy:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt seemed to strike an extraordinary balance between the psychological and the supernatural in such a way as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing&nbsp;... It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.<ref>''Kubrick'' by Michel Ciment, 1983, Holt Rinehart Winston</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===<span id=\"The two Gradys\">The two Gradys, and other doubles</span>===\nEarly in the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack of a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who, in 1970, succumbed to cabin fever, murdered his family and then killed himself. Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady. Jack says that he knows about the murders, claiming to recognize Grady from pictures, but the butler introduces himself as ''Delbert'' Grady.\n\n[[Gordon Dahlquist]] of ''The Kubrick FAQ'' argues that the name change \"deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the 1920s July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous situation and the man who has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that ''The Shining'' brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance \u2013 once more, perhaps \u2013 to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may have had a chance to escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to.\"<ref name=\"visual-memory1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/html/shining/shining2.html#slot1120 |title=Kubrick FAQ \u2013 The Shining Part 2 |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |date=July 4, 1921 |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420133530/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/html/shining/shining2.html#slot1120 |archive-date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance but nor is he someone different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook; Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor, Gordon Stainforth, has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; \"I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [it is] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'.\"<ref name=\"visual-memory1\" />\n\nAmong Kubrick's other doubling/mirroring effects in the film:\n* In the U.S. version, Jack's interview with Ullman, whose confident affability contrasts with Jack's seemingly forced nonchalance, is paired with Wendy's meeting with a female doctor, whose somber and professional manner contrasts with Wendy's nervousness.<ref name=Nelson>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Kubrick.html?id=wabgZNgT9OgC |title=Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze |last=Nelson |first=Thomas Allen |date=2000 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=0253213908 |access-date=October 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228010649/https://books.google.com/books/about/Kubrick.html?id=wabgZNgT9OgC |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* During the interview, Jack and Ullman are joined by a hotel employee named Bill Watson, who looks similar to Jack from behind, creating a pseudo\u2013mirror image effect as they sit in chairs to the front-left and front-right of Ullman's desk.<ref name=Nelson />\n* The Grady sisters look so similar that they appear to be twins, though they are different ages (Ullman states that he thinks that they were about eight and ten).<ref name=Nelson />\n* On two occasions, Ullman says goodbye to two young female employees and in the second case, they closely resemble each other.<ref name=Nelson />\n* The film contains two mazes, the hedges outside and, per Wendy's characterization, the Overlook. The hedge maze appears in two forms, the 13-foot-high version outside and the model inside the Overlook. In the overhead shot zooming down on Wendy and Danny in the center of the maze, the maze differs from the map outside and from the model having far more corridors, and the left and right sides are mirror images of each other.

Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wrote\n\n<blockquote>As the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it?

The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with the film).<ref name=\"visual-memory2\" />\n\n===Motivation of ghosts===\nIn the film, the motive of the ghosts is apparently to \"reclaim\" Jack (even though Grady expresses an interest in Danny's \"shining\" ability), who seems to be a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, as suggested by the 1920s photograph of Jack at the end of the film and Jack's repeated claims to have \"not just a ''[[d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]]''\".<ref>Among many other places, this is suggested in ''The Modern Weird Tale'' by S.T. Joshi, p. 72.</ref> The film is even more focused on Jack (as opposed to Danny) than the novel.\n\n===Room number===\nThe room number 217 has been changed to 237. [[Timberline Lodge]], located on [[Mt. Hood]] in [[Oregon]], was used for the exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel. The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in ''The Shining'', because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film. Contrary to the hotel's expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timberlinelodge.com/about-us/history |title=History |publisher=Timberline Lodge |accessdate=August 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508102838/http://www.timberlinelodge.com/about-us/history|archive-date=May 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomdeering.com/thesis/ch4/images/4-25-Bot_a.jpg |title=Deering Thesis: Timberline Lodge Second Floor Plan |last=Jr. |first=Thomas P.

Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by what he sees as the evil forces in the hotel.\nAt the novel's conclusion, it is suggested that the evil hotel forces have possessed Jack's body and proceeded to destroy all that is left of his mind during a final showdown with Danny. He leaves a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Hallorann escape.<ref name=ch55>See Chapter 55, ''That Which Was Forgotten''.</ref>\nThe film's Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner. Jack kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel. King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, on the grounds that he seemed vaguely sinister from the very beginning of the film, and had suggested [[Jon Voight]] among others for the role.<ref> King discusses this in an interview he gave at the time of the TV remake of ''The Shining'' in the ''New York Daily News''{{cite news |title=The Shining By the Book |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/shining-book-article-1.759715|access-date=March 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731005332/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/shining-book-article-1.759715|archive-date=July 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>''Creepshows: The Illustrated Stephen King Movie Guide'' By Stephen Jones Published by Watson-Guptill, 2002 p. 20</ref>\n\nOnly in the novel does Jack hear the haunting, heavy-handed voice of his father, with whom he had a troubled relationship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magistrale |first=Tony |title=Stephen King: America's Storyteller, p. 120 |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO, 2010 |isbn=9780313352287 |accessdate=|year=2010 }} See also novel, Chapter 26, ''Dreamland''.</ref> In both the novel and film, Jack's encounter with the ghostly bartender is pivotal to Jack's deterioration. However, the novel gives much more detail about Jack's problems with drinking and alcohol.\n\nThe film prolongs Jack's struggle with writer's block. Kubrick's co-screenwriter Diane Johnson believes that in King's novel, Jack's discovery of the scrapbook of clippings in the boiler room of the hotel, which gives him new ideas for a novel, catalyzes his possession by the ghosts of the hotel, while at the same time unblocking his writing. Jack is no longer a blocked writer, but now filled with energy. In her contribution to the screenplay, Johnson wrote an adaptation of this scene, which to her regret Kubrick later excised, as she felt this left the father's change less motivated.{{sfn|Johnson essay|2006|ref=essayDJ|p=58}} Kubrick showed Jack's continued blockage quite late in the film with the \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" scene, which does not appear in the novel.\n\nStephen King stated on the DVD commentary of the 1997 mini-series of ''The Shining'' that the character of Jack Torrance was partially autobiographical, as he was struggling with both alcoholism and unprovoked rage toward his family at the time of writing.<ref>DVD of The Shining TV mini-series directed by Mick Garris Studio: Warner Home Video DVD Release Date: January 7, 2003</ref> [[Tony Magistrale]] wrote about Kubrick's version of Jack Torrance in ''Hollywood's Stephen King'':\n{{quote|[[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick's]] version of Torrance is much closer to the tyrannical Hal (from Kubrick's ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and Alex (from Kubrick's ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'') than he is to King's more conflicted, more sympathetically human characterization.<ref>p. 100 of Hollywood's Stephen King By Tony Magistrale Published by Macmillan, 2003</ref>}}\n\nFrom Thomas Allen Nelson's ''Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze'': \"When Jack moves through the reception area on his way to a 'shining' over the model maze, he throws a yellow tennis ball past a stuffed bear and Danny's Big Wheel, which rests on the very spot (a Navajo circle design) where Hallorann will be murdered.\"\nJack's tennis ball mysteriously rolls into Danny's circle of toy cars just before the boy walks through the open door of Room 237.\n\n\"In the film's opening, the camera from above moves over water and through mountains with the ease of a bird in flight. Below, on a winding mountain road, Jack's diminutive yellow Volkswagen journeys through a tree-lined maze, resembling one of Danny's toy cars or the yellow tennis ball seen later outside of Room 237.\"<ref>Nelson, Thomas Allen, Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze p.203, 209, 214</ref>\n\n===Danny Torrance===\nDanny Torrance is considerably more open about his supernatural abilities in the novel, discussing them with strangers such as his doctor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rasmussen |first=Randy |date= |title=Stanley Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed p.233 |url= |location= |publisher=McFarland |isbn= |accessdate=}}See novel's Chapter 17, ''The Doctor's Office'', and chapter 20, ''Talking with Mr. Ullman''</ref> In the film, he is quite secretive about them even with his prime mentor Dick Hallorann, who also has these abilities. The same is true of Dick Hallorann, who in his journey back to the Overlook in the book, talks with others with the \"shining\" ability, while in the film he lies about his reason for returning to the Overlook. Danny in the novel is generally portrayed as unusually intelligent across the board.<ref>Rasmussen, 233\u20134. See also novelChapter 16, ''Danny''.</ref> In the film, he is more ordinary, though with a preternatural gift.\n\nAlthough Danny has supernatural powers in both versions, the novel makes it clear that his apparent imaginary friend \"Tony\" really is a projection of hidden parts of his own psyche, though heavily amplified by Danny's psychic \"shining\" abilities. At the end it is revealed that Danny Torrance's middle name is \"Anthony\".<ref>Tony's real identity is revealed in Chapter 54.</ref>{{Original research inline|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Wendy Torrance===\nWendy Torrance in the film is relatively meek, submissive, passive, gentle, and mousy; this is shown by the way she defends Jack even in his absence to the doctor examining Danny. It is implied that she has perhaps been abused by Jack as well. In the novel, she is a far more self-reliant and independent personality, who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Dale |date= June 2011|title=American Nightmares: The Haunted House Formula in American Popular Fiction, p. 95 |url= |location= |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299268732 |accessdate=}} See also the novel Chapter 5, ''Phone Booth'', and Chapter 6, ''Night Thoughts''.</ref> In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does in the film, but remains cool and self-reliant. Writing in ''Hollywood's Stephen King'', author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake:\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Rebecca De Mornay|De Mornay]] restores much of the steely resilience found in the protagonist of King's novel and this is particularly noteworthy when compared to Shelley Duvall's exaggerated portrayal of Wendy as [[Olive Oyl]] revisited: A simpering fatality of forces beyond her capacity to understand, much less surmount.<ref>Magistrale, p. 202.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nCo-screenwriter Diane Johnson stated that in her contributions to the script, Wendy had more dialogue, and that Kubrick cut many of her lines, possibly due to his dissatisfaction with actress Shelley Duvall's delivery. Johnson believes that the earlier draft of the script portrayed Wendy as a more-rounded character.{{sfn|Johnson essay|2006|ref=essayDJ|p=56}}\n\n===Stuart Ullman===\nIn the novel, Jack's authority issues are triggered by the fact that his interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet. The film's Ullman is far more humane and concerned about Jack's well-being, as well as smooth and self-assured. Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired.<ref>Jack's disdain for Ullman is the main subject of Chapter 1 of the novel, setting up Jack's authority issues.</ref> Ullman's bossy nature in the novel is one of the first steps in Jack's deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.\n\nIn ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation'', author Greg Jenkins writes \"A toadish figure in the book, Ullman has been utterly reinvented for the film; he now radiates charm, grace and gentility.\"<ref>p. 74 of ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins, published by McFarland, 1997</ref>\n\nFrom ''Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze'': Ullman tells Jack that the hotel's season runs from May 15 to October 30, meaning that the Torrances moved in on [[Halloween]] (October 31). On Ullmann's desk next to a small American flag sits a metal cup containing pencils and a pen&nbsp;\u2013 and a miniature replica of an ax.\n\n\"When Ullman, himself all smiles, relates as a footnote the story about the former caretaker who 'seemed perfectly normal' but nevertheless cut up his family with an ax, Jack's obvious interest (as if he's recalling one of his own nightmares) and his insincere congeniality (early signs of a personality malfunction) lead the viewer to believe that the film's definition of his madness will be far more complex.\"<ref>Nelson, p. 200, 206, 210</ref>\n\n===Family dynamics===\nStephen King provides the reader with a great deal of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story,<ref>Rasmussen, 233\u20134. See also novel Chapter 6, ''Night Thoughts'.</ref> including revelations of Jack's physical abuse of Danny and Wendy's fear of Danny's mysterious spells. Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than does King. In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him.\n\n===Plot differences===\nIn the novel Jack recovers his sanity and goodwill through the intervention of Danny while this does not occur in the film. Writing in ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine, Frederick Clarke suggests, \"Instead of playing a normal man who becomes insane, Nicholson portrays a crazy man attempting to remain sane.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clarke |first1=Frederick |year=1996 |title=The Shining |journal=Cinefastique |volume=28 |issue= |pages= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> In the novel, Jack's final act is to enable Wendy and Danny to escape the hotel before it explodes due to a defective boiler, killing him.<ref>{{cite book |title=American nightmares: the haunted house formula in American popular fiction |last=Bailey |first=Dale |year=1999 |publisher=Popular Press |location= |isbn=978-0-879727-89-5 |page=62}}</ref> The film ends with the hotel still standing.

In the novel, the reason for the hotel's manifestation of evil is possibly explained by a theme present in King's previous novel ''[[Salem's Lot]]'' as well as [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'': a physical place may absorb the evils that transpire there and manifest them as a vaguely sentient malevolence.<ref>''Cinema of the occult: new age, satanism, Wicca, and spiritualism in film'', by Carrol Lee Fry, notes similarities to both the Jackson story and Poe's ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' (p. 230).</ref> The film's Hallorann speaks to Danny about that phenomenon occurring at the Overlook.

The film is based on [[Stephen King]]'s 1977 novel [[The Shining (novel)|of the same name]] and stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Shelley Duvall]], [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Danny Lloyd]].\n\nThe  central character in ''The Shining'' is [[Jack Torrance]] (Nicholson), an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the [[Southern Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rockies]]. Wintering over with Jack are his wife, [[Wendy Torrance]] (Duvall) and young son, [[Danny Torrance]] (Lloyd). Danny possesses \"the shining\", psychic abilities that enable him to see into the hotel's horrific past. The hotel cook, [[Dick Hallorann (The Shining)|Dick Hallorann]] (Crothers), also has this ability and is able to communicate with Danny telepathically. The hotel had a previous winter caretaker who went insane and killed his family and himself. After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel, placing his wife and son in danger.\n\nProduction took place almost exclusively at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|EMI Elstree Studios]], with sets based on real locations. Kubrick often worked with a small crew, which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new [[Steadicam]] mount was used to shoot several scenes, giving the film an innovative and immersive look and feel. There has been much speculation into the meanings and actions in the film because of inconsistencies, ambiguities, symbolism, and differences from the book.\n\nThe film was released in the [[United States]] on May 23, 1980, and in the [[United Kingdom]] on October 2, 1980, by [[Warner Bros.]] There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut shorter than the one preceding it; about 27 minutes were cut in total. Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; Stephen King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. Critical opinion has become more favorable and it is now widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential horror films ever made]] and has become a staple of pop culture. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Landrum Jr. |url=https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40 |title='Jurassic Park,' 'Shining' added to National Film Registry |website=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 12, 2018 |accessdate=December 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181212090412/https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40|archive-date=December 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA sequel, ''[[Doctor Sleep (2019 film)|Doctor Sleep]]'', was released on November 8, 2019, in the United States, and on October 31, 2019, in Europe.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nSchool teacher-turned-writer [[Jack Torrance]] arrives at the remote Overlook Hotel in the [[Rocky Mountains]] to be interviewed for the position of winter caretaker. The hotel, which opened in 1909 and was built on the site of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] burial ground, closes during the snowed-in months. Once hired, Jack plans to use the hotel's solitude to write. Manager Stuart Ullman tells Jack about the hotel's history and warns him about its reputation: a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, supposedly developed [[cabin fever]] and killed his family and himself. Despite the troubling story, Jack is impressed with the hotel and gets the job. In [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Jack's son, [[Danny Torrance|Danny]], has a terrifying premonition about the hotel, and Jack's wife, [[Wendy Torrance|Wendy]], tells a doctor about Danny's imaginary friend, Tony.\n\nWhen the family moves into the hotel on closing day, head chef [[Dick Hallorann (The Shining)|Dick Hallorann]] surprises Danny by [[telepathy|telepathically]] offering him ice cream. Hallorann explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls \"shining\". Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel has a \"shine\" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good. He also tells Danny to stay away from room 237.<!-- Changed from novel's room 217. Please do not change -->\n\nA month passes; while Jack's writing goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze and Hallorann goes to [[Florida]]. Wendy learns that the phone lines are out due to the heavy snowfall, and Danny has frightening visions. Jack behaves strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts. Danny's curiosity about room 237 overcomes him when he sees the room's door open. Later, Wendy finds Jack screaming during a nightmare while asleep at his typewriter. After she awakens him, Jack says he dreamed that he killed her and Danny. Danny arrives, visibly traumatized and bruised. Wendy accuses Jack of abusing him, which Jack denies.\n\nJack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room and meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd, to whom he complains about his marriage. Wendy tells Jack that Danny told her a \"crazy woman\" in room 237 attempted to strangle him. Jack investigates room 237 and encounters a dead woman's ghost, but he tells Wendy that he saw nothing. Wendy and Jack argue over whether Danny should be removed from the hotel, and Jack angrily returns to the Gold Room, which is now filled with ghosts attending a ball. While participating, he meets a ghostly waiter who identifies himself as Delbert Grady. Grady informs Jack that Danny has reached out to Hallorann using his \"talent\", and says that Jack must \"correct\" his wife and child. Hallorann grows concerned about what is going on at the hotel and flies back to Colorado. Danny calls out \"redrum\" and goes into another trance, referring to himself as \"Tony\".{{anchor|all work}}\n\nWhile searching for Jack, Wendy discovers that her now-deranged husband has been typing pages filled with the phrase \"[[All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy]]\". She begs Jack to leave the hotel with Danny, but he threatens her. Wendy knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat and locks him in the kitchen pantry, but she and Danny are both trapped as Jack has disabled the hotel's two-way radio and [[snowcat]]. Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady. Moments later the door is unlocked, freeing Jack.\n\nDanny continues chanting and drawing the word \"REDRUM\". When Wendy sees the word reversed in the bedroom mirror, the word is revealed to be \"MURDER\". Jack hacks through the quarters' main door with an axe. Wendy sends Danny through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to pass. Jack breaks through the door, but retreats after Wendy slashes his hand with a knife. Hearing Hallorann arriving in a snowcat, Jack ambushes and murders him in the lobby, then pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering ghosts, a cascade of blood Danny envisioned in Boulder, and Hallorann's corpse. Danny lays a false trail to mislead Jack and hides behind a snowdrift.\n\nDanny escapes from the maze and reunites with Wendy; they leave in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death after losing Danny's trail. In a photograph in the hotel hallway, Jack is pictured standing amid a crowd of party revelers from 1921.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Jack Torrance]]\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as [[Wendy Torrance]]\n* [[Danny Lloyd]] as [[Danny Torrance]]\n* [[Scatman Crothers]] as [[Dick Hallorann]]\n* [[Barry Nelson]] as Stuart Ullman\n* [[Philip Stone]] as Delbert Grady\n* [[Joe Turkel]] as Lloyd\n* [[Anne Jackson]] as Doctor\n* [[Tony Burton]] as Larry Durkin\n* Lia Beldam as Young Woman in Bath\n* Billie Gibson as Old Woman in Bath\n* [[Barry Dennen]] as Bill Watson\n* Lisa and Louise Burns as Grady Twins\n* [[Robin Pappas]] as Nurse\n* Norman Gay as Apparition with Gash\n}}\n\nIn the European cut, all of the scenes involving Jackson and Burton were removed but the credits remained unchanged.

Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with ''Barry Lyndon''{{'}}s lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.\"<ref>LoBrutto, Vincent, \"Stanley Kubrick, A Biography,\" (1997), p. 412</ref>\n\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".<ref name=\"Duncan, Paul 2003 9\">{{citation |title=Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films |year=2003 |author=Duncan, Paul |page=9 |publisher=Taschen GmbH |isbn=978-3836527750}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nNicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included [[Robert De Niro]] (who claims the film gave him nightmares for a month),<ref>[[Robert De Niro]] (speaking about which films scared him), [[B105 FM]] interview on September 20, 2007</ref> [[Robin Williams]], and [[Harrison Ford]], all of whom met with [[Stephen King]]'s disapproval.<ref>[[Stephen King]], [[B105 FM]] on November 21, 2007</ref> In his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband and wife team, Leon and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period. These cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent which fell in between Jack Nicholson's and Shelley Duvall's speech patterns.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 420</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n==== Interior sets ====\n[[File:Ahwahnee Hotel - Lobby.jpeg|thumb|The lobby and lounge of the Overlook Hotel was modeled on the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] and was created at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios.]]]]\n\nHaving chosen King's novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had [[set construction|sets constructed]] on soundstages at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|EMI Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], England. Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]. To enable him to shoot the scenes in chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production. The set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel.<ref>[http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/shining_closing_day.htm Kubrick's The Shining \u2013 Closing Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219031116/http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/shining_closing_day.htm |date=December 19, 2013 }} idyllopuspress.com</ref> In February 1979, the set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stanley Kubrick on the burned down set of ''The Shining'' |url=http://filmmakeriq.com/images/stanley-kubrick-on-the-burnt-down-set-of-the-shining/ |accessdate=March 13, 2017 |work=FilmMaker IQ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313220526/http://filmmakeriq.com/images/stanley-kubrick-on-the-burnt-down-set-of-the-shining/|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kubrick at Elstree: The fire that almost axed The Shining |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p027vf9p |accessdate=March 13, 2017 |work=BBC Arts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016152112/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p027vf9p|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Exterior locations ====\n[[File:Timberline Lodge, Oregon (2013) - 04.JPG|thumb|left|[[Timberline Lodge]] in [[Oregon]] served as the exterior of the Overlook Hotel.]]\nWhile most of the interior shots, and even some of the Overlook exterior shots, were shot on studio sets, a few exterior shots were shot on location by a second-unit crew headed by [[Jan Harlan]].

(8648670619).jpg|thumb|Page from ''The Shining'' screenplay|right]]\n''The Shining'' had a prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays. Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature. Actress Shelley Duvall did not get along with Kubrick, frequently arguing with him on set about lines in the script, her acting techniques and numerous other things. Duvall eventually became so overwhelmed by the stress of her role that she became physically ill for months. At one point, she was under so much stress that her hair began to fall out. The shooting script was being changed constantly, sometimes several times a day, adding more stress. Nicholson eventually became so frustrated with the ever-changing script that he would throw away the copies that the production team had given him to memorize, knowing that it was going to change anyway. He learned most of his lines just minutes before filming them. Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend [[Anjelica Huston]] and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days.<ref>Huston, Allegra. ''Love Child, a Memoir of Family Lost and Found''. Simon & Schuster (2009) p. 214</ref> Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the \"bar scene\" for six weeks, and that the shoot day lasted from 9{{nbsp}}a.m. to 10:30{{nbsp}}p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in perspiration by the end of the day's shoot. He also added that it was his favorite scene in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3B10XziCZU?t=50s |title=Joe Turkel, Co Star of \"Blade Runner\" and \"The Shining\", at Days Of The Dead Horror Con |last=ZFOnline |date=October 6, 2014 |via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nFor the final Gold Room sequence, Kubrick instructed the extras (via megaphone) not to talk, \"but to mime conversation to each other. Kubrick knew from years of scrutinizing thousands of films that extras could often mime their business by nodding and using large gestures that look fake.

It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, [[Garrett Brown]], was heavily involved with the production of ''The Shining''. Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets, which offered \"further possibilities for the Steadicam\". This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not \"just talking of stunt shots and staircases\". Rather he would use the Steadicam \"as it was intended to be used&nbsp;\u2014 as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane\". Brown used an 18&nbsp;mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 426</ref> Brown published an article in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' about his experience,<ref>Brown, G. (1980) The Steadicam and The Shining. American Cinematographer. Reproduced at [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/page2.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413131605/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/page2.htm |date=April 13, 2012 }} without issue date or pages given</ref> and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.\n\n[[File:Ahwahnee Hotel - Great Lounge.jpg|thumb|The Overlook Hotel's Colorado Lounge set was modeled in large part on the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]]'s Great Lounge.]]\nKubrick personally aided in modifying the Steadicam's video transmission technology. Brown states his own abilities to operate the Steadicam were refined by working on Kubrick's film. For this film, Brown developed a two-handed technique, which enabled him to maintain the camera at one height while panning and tilting the camera. In addition to tracking shots from behind, the Steadicam enabled shooting in constricted rooms without flying out walls, or backing the camera into doors. Brown notes that:\n{{cquote|One of the most talked-about shots in the picture is the eerie tracking sequence which follows Danny as he pedals at high speed through corridor after corridor on his plastic [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel]] tricycle. The soundtrack explodes with noise when the wheel is on wooden flooring and is abruptly silent as it crosses over carpet. We needed to have the lens just a few inches from the floor and to travel rapidly just behind or ahead of the bike.}}\n\nThis required the Steadicam to be on a special mount, modeled on a wheelchair, in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires, however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform successive identical takes.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 436</ref> Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.\n\n==Music and soundtrack==\nThe stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Although the repertoire was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of [[music editor]] Gordon Stainforth, whose work on this film is known for the attention to fine details and remarkably precise synchronization without excessive splicing.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barham |first1=J.M. |title=Terror Tracks: Music and Sound in Horror Cinema |date=2009 |publisher=Equinox Press |location=London, U.K.|chapter-url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/1956/ |isbn=978-1845532024 |pages=137\u2013170 |chapter=Incorporating Monsters: Music as Context, Character and Construction in Kubrick\u2019s ''The Shining''|access-date=July 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804133256/http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/1956/|archive-date=August 4, 2017}}{{oa}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack album on LP was withdrawn due to problems with licensing of the music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gengaro |first=Christine Lee |date=2013 |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |url= |location= |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=190 |isbn=9780810885646 |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |date=1999 |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |url= |location= |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=448 |isbn=9780306809064 |access-date=}}</ref> The LP soundtrack omits some pieces heard in the film, and also includes complete versions of pieces of which only fragments are heard in the film.\n\nThe non-original music on the soundtrack is as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiviokubrick.it/risorse/saggi/The_Music_in_The_Shining.pdf |title=The Music in ''The Shining'' |last=Sbravatti |first=Valerio |date=2010 |website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024042850/http://www.archiviokubrick.it/risorse/saggi/The_Music_in_The_Shining.pdf|archive-date=October 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n# \"Lontano\" by [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Ernest Bour]] [[conducting]] the [[Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra]] ([[WERGO|Wergo Records]])\n# \"[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]\" by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] ([[Deutsche Grammophon]])\n# \"[[Utrenja]]\" \u2013 excerpts from the \"Ewangelia\" and \"Kanon Paschy\" movements by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Andrzej Markowski]] conducting the [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra]] ([[Polskie Nagrania Muza|Polskie Nagrania Records]])\n# \"[[The Dream of Jacob|The Awakening of Jacob]]\", \"[[De Natura Sonoris|De Natura Sonoris No. 1]]\" (the latter not on the soundtrack album, [[Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[Henryk Czy\u017c]]) and \"[[De Natura Sonoris|De Natura Sonoris No. 2]]\" by Krzysztof Penderecki (Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrzej Markowski, Polskie Nagrania Records)\n# \"Home\", performed by [[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Hall]] and the [[Gleneagles Hotel]] Band ([[Columbia Records]])\n# \"It's All Forgotten Now\" by [[Al Bowlly]], performed by [[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble]] and His Orchestra (not on the soundtrack album)\n# \"Masquerade\", performed by [[Jack Hylton]] and His Orchestra (not on soundtrack)\n# \"[[Kanon (liturgy)|Kanon]] (for string orchestra)\" by Krzysztof Penderecki (not on soundtrack)\n# \"[[Polymorphia]] (for string orchestra)\" by Krzysztof Penderecki, Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Henryk Czy\u017c (not on soundtrack)\n\nUpon their arrival at Elstree Studios, [[Wendy Carlos]] and [[Rachel Elkind]] were shown the first version of the film by Kubrick: \"The film was a little on the long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been arranged in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot of those. We didn't know what was going to be used for sure\".<ref>LoBrutto, p.447</ref> After having something similar happen to her on ''Clockwork Orange,'' Carlos has said that she was so disillusioned by Kubrick's actions that she vowed never to work with him again.

''Stanley Kubrick: A Biography'', p. 449 <!-- additional book info. needed --></ref> The European release of ''The Shining'' a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to Kubrick's removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.\n\n===Post-release edit===\nAfter its premiere and a week into the general run (with a running time of 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a scene at the end that took place in a hospital. The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr. Ullman who explains that Jack's body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel. This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of [[Warner Bros.]], the film's distributor. This cut the film's running time to 144 minutes. [[Roger Ebert]] commented: {{quote|If Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found \u2013 and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack's body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past and does that explain Jack's presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel party-goers in 1921? Did Jack's violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy's imagination, or Danny's, or theirs?&nbsp;... Kubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.<ref name=Ebert06/>}}\n\n===European version===\nFor its release in Europe, Kubrick cut about 25 minutes from the film.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Monthly Film Bulletin |author=Combs, Richard |date=November 1980 |volume=47 |issue=562 |page=221 |title=The Shining |url=http://sightandsounddigital.bfi.org.uk |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shine On...and Out |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/films/cutshining.htm |website=www.visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020151547/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/films/cutshining.htm|archive-date=2016-10-20|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wurm |first1=Gerald |date=2010-11-30 |title=Shining (Comparison: International Version - US Version) - Movie-Censorship.com |url=http://movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=1215 |website=movie-censorship.com|access-date=2011-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714122053/http://movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=1215|archive-date=2011-07-14|url-status=live}}</ref> The excised scenes included: a longer meeting between Jack and Watson at the hotel; Danny being attended by a doctor ([[Anne Jackson]]), including references to Tony and how Danny was once injured by Jack in a drunken rage; more footage of Hallorann's attempts to get to the hotel during the snowstorm, including a sequence with a garage attendant ([[Tony Burton]]); extended dialogue scenes at the hotel; and a scene where Wendy discovers a group of skeletons in the hotel lobby during the climax.

King expressed disappointment that some themes, such as the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism, are less present in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would go mad, due to Nicholson's famous role as of McMurphy in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975).

The decisions his characters make&nbsp;\u2013 whether it's to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety&nbsp;\u2013 are what matter to him. But in Kubrick's ''The Shining'', the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It's a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King's novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like \"insects\" because the director doesn't really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick's highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King's ''The Shining'', the monster is Jack. In Kubrick's, the monster is Kubrick.</blockquote>\n\nKing's oft-cited remark about Kubrick being a man who \"thinks too much and feels too little\" is often misconstrued as a remark on Kubrick's obsessive and detached approach to directing actors, but it is actually a less disparaging reference to Kubrick's skepticism regarding the verisimilitude of the supernatural, which emerged in pre-production conversations between King and Kubrick.{{Editorializing|date=November 2019}} The full context of King's quote is:\n<blockquote> Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of ''The Shining'' is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thewordslinger.com/posts.php?id=37 |title=Quoted in |publisher=Thewordslinger.com |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2011-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831023834/http://thewordslinger.com/posts.php?id=37 |archivedate=August 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nMark Browning, a critic of King's work, observed that King's novels frequently contain a narrative closure that completes the story, which Kubrick's film lacks.<ref>Stephen King on the big screen by Mark Browning p. 239</ref> Browning has in fact argued that King has exactly the opposite problem of which he accused Kubrick. King, he believes, \"feels too much and thinks too little\".\n\nKing was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at [[The Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park, Colorado]], which inspired the story (a decision Kubrick made since the hotel lacked sufficient snow and electricity). However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled ''[[The Shining (miniseries)|The Shining]]'', filmed at The Stanley Hotel.\n\nThe animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\".

It is also assigned in many college film courses, and discussed ubiquitously on the Internet</ref><ref>Blakemore is best known as a spearhead for global warming issues and having been ABC News' Vatican Correspondent since 1970.</ref>  He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are seen. Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground.\n\nBlakemore's general argument is that the film is a metaphor for the genocide of Native Americans. He notes that when Jack kills Hallorann, the dead body is seen lying on a rug with an Indian motif. The blood in the elevator shafts is, for Blakemore, the blood of the Indians in the burial ground on which the hotel was built. The date of the final photograph, July 4th, is meant to be ironic. Blakemore writes:<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blakemore |first1=Bill |title=Kubrik's Shining' Secret |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1987/07/12/kubricks-shining-secret/a7e3433d-e92e-4171-b46f-77817f1743f0/ |accessdate=12 November 2019 |work=Washington Post |publisher=Washington Post |date=July 12, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=KUBRICK SHINING |url=http://williamblakemore.com/Blakemore-%20Kubrick%20Shining.pdf |website=williamblakemore.com |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nAs with some of his other movies, Kubrick ends ''The Shining'' with a powerful visual puzzle that forces the audience to leave the theater asking, \"What was that all about?\" ''The Shining'' ends with an extremely long camera shot moving down a hallway in the Overlook, reaching eventually the central photo among 21 photos on the wall, each capturing previous good times in the hotel. At the head of the party is none other than the Jack we've just seen in 1980. The caption reads: \"Overlook Hotel&nbsp;\u2013 July 4th Ball&nbsp;\u2013 1921.\" The answer to this puzzle, which is a master key to unlocking the whole movie, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries.\n</blockquote>\n\nFilm writer John Capo sees the film as an allegory of [[American imperialism]]. This is exemplified by many clues, such as the closing photo of Jack in the past at a [[4th of July]] party, or Jack's earlier reference to the [[Rudyard Kipling]] poem \"[[The White Man's Burden]]\", which was written to advocate the American colonial seizure of the Philippine islands, justifying imperial conquest as a mission-of-civilization.<ref>{{cite web |last=Capo |first=John |url=http://www.tailslate.net/articles/index.asp?ID=36&lst=n&dpt=articles |title=Tailslate.net |publisher=Tailslate.net |date=September 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803070711/http://www.tailslate.net/articles/index.asp?ID=36&lst=n&dpt=articles |archive-date=August 3, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Jack's line has been interpreted as referring to alcoholism, from which he suffers.\n\n===Geoffrey Cocks and Kubrick's concern with the Holocaust===\nFilm historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore's idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans by arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the [[Holocaust]] (Both Cocks' book and [[Michael Herr]]'s memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life to make a film dealing directly with the Holocaust but could never quite make up his mind). Cocks is a cultural historian best known for describing the impact of the Holocaust on Western culture. Cocks, writing in his book ''The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust'', proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, he says, a strong (though hidden) holocaust subtext in ''The Shining''. This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick's screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel's supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone.<ref name=\"SeeCocks\">{{Anchor|SeeCocks}}{{cite book |title=Depth of Field: Stanley Kubrick, Film, and the Uses of History |year=2006 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wis. |isbn=978-0299216146 |page=174 |edition=1st |editor1=Geoffrey Cocks |editor2=James Diedrick |editor3=Glenn Perusek}}</ref>  Cocks places Kubrick's vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from [[Stephen Crane]]'s short story \"[[The Blue Hotel]]\" (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|p=201|ref=SeeCocks}} In keeping with this tradition, Kubrick's film focuses on domesticity and the Torrances' attempt to use this imposing building as a home which Jack Torrance describes as \"homey\".\n\nCocks claims that Kubrick has elaborately coded many of his historical concerns into the film with manipulations of numbers and colors and his choice of musical numbers, many of which are post-war compositions influenced by the horrors of World War II. Of particular note is Kubrick's use of [[Penderecki]]'s ''The Awakening of Jacob'' to accompany Jack Torrance's dream of killing his family and Danny's vision of past carnage in the hotel, a piece of music originally associated with the horrors of the Holocaust.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|loc=ch. 11|ref=SeeCocks}} Kubrick's pessimistic ending in contrast to Stephen King's optimistic one is in keeping with the motifs that Kubrick wove into the story.\n\nCocks's work has been anthologized and discussed in other works on Stanley Kubrick films, though sometimes with skepticism. Julian Rice, writing in the opening chapter of his book ''Kubrick's Hope'', believes Cocks's views are excessively speculative and contain too many strained \"critical leaps\" of faith. Rice holds that what went on in Kubrick's mind cannot be replicated or corroborated beyond a broad vision of the nature of good and evil (which included concern about the Holocaust) but Kubrick's art is not governed by this one obsession.<ref>Rice, Julian (2008). ''Kubrick's Hope: Discovering Optimism from ''2001 ''to ''Eyes Wide Shut. Scarecrow Press, pp. 11\u201313</ref> Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter for ''The Shining'', commented on Cocks's observations, saying that preoccupation with the Holocaust on Kubrick's part could very likely have motivated his decision to place the hotel on a Native American burial ground, although Kubrick never directly mentioned it to her.{{sfn|Cocks|Diedrich|Perusek|2006|ref=SeeCocks|p=59, {{Anchor|essayDJ}}''Writing The Shining'', essay by Diane Johnson}}\n\n==Literary allusions==\nGeoffrey Cocks notes that the film contains many allusions to fairy tales, both ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' and the ''[[Three Little Pigs]]'',<ref name=\"SeeCocks\"/> with Jack Torrance identified as the [[Big Bad Wolf]], which [[Bruno Bettelheim]] interprets as standing for \"all the asocial unconscious devouring powers\" that must be overcome by a child's ego.\n\nThe saying \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" appeared first in [[James Howell|James Howell's]] ''Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish'' (1659).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html |title=James Howell Quotes |publisher=Famousquotesandauthors.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215124957/http://famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html |archive-date=December 15, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Ambiguities in the film==\n[[Roger Ebert]] notes that the film does not really have a \"reliable observer\", with the possible exception of Dick Hallorann.

The film critic [[James Berardinelli]], who is generally much less impressed with the film than Ebert, notes that \"King would have us believe that the hotel is haunted. Kubrick is less definitive in the interpretations he offers.\" He dubs the film a failure as a ghost story, but brilliant as a study of \"madness and the [[unreliable narrator]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1482 |title=The Shining (1980) |author=James Berardinelli |date=February 18, 2009 |publisher=REELVIEWS.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019094136/http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1482 |archive-date=October 19, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Ghosts vs. cabin fever===\nIn some sequences, there is a question of whether or not there are ghosts present. In the scenes in which Jack sees ghosts, he is always facing a mirror or, in the case of his storeroom conversation with Grady, a reflective, highly polished door. Film reviewer James Berardinelli notes \"It has been pointed out that there's a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to wonder whether the spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1482 |title=Reelviews Movie Reviews |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019094136/http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1482 |archive-date=October 19, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\nIn ''Hollywood's Stephen King'', [[Tony Magistrale]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>\nKubrick's reliance on mirrors as visual aids for underscoring the thematic meaning of this film portrays visually the internal transformations and oppositions that are occurring to Jack Torrance psychologically. Through&nbsp;... these devices, Kubrick dramatizes the hotel's methodical assault on Torrance's identity, its ability to stimulate the myriad of self-doubts and anxieties by creating opportunities to warp Torrance's perspective on himself and [his family]. Furthermore the fact that Jack looks into a mirror whenever he \"speaks\" to the hotel means, to some extent, that Kubrick implicates him directly into the hotel's \"consciousness\", because Jack is, in effect, talking to himself.<ref>Hollywood's Stephen King by Tony Magistrale Palgrave Macmillan 2003 pp.95\u201396</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nGhosts are the implied explanation for Jack's seemingly physically impossible escape from the locked storeroom. In an interview of Kubrick by scholar [[Michel Ciment]], the director made comments about the scene in the book that may imply he similarly thought of the scene in the film as a key reveal in this dichotomy:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt seemed to strike an extraordinary balance between the psychological and the supernatural in such a way as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing&nbsp;... It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.<ref>''Kubrick'' by Michel Ciment, 1983, Holt Rinehart Winston</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===<span id=\"The two Gradys\">The two Gradys, and other doubles</span>===\nEarly in the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack of a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who, in 1970, succumbed to cabin fever, murdered his family and then killed himself. Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady. Jack says that he knows about the murders, claiming to recognize Grady from pictures, but the butler introduces himself as ''Delbert'' Grady.\n\n[[Gordon Dahlquist]] of ''The Kubrick FAQ'' argues that the name change \"deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the 1920s July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous situation and the man who has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that ''The Shining'' brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance \u2013 once more, perhaps \u2013 to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may have had a chance to escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to.\"<ref name=\"visual-memory1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/html/shining/shining2.html#slot1120 |title=Kubrick FAQ \u2013 The Shining Part 2 |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |date=July 4, 1921 |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420133530/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/html/shining/shining2.html#slot1120 |archive-date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance but nor is he someone different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook; Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor, Gordon Stainforth, has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; \"I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [it is] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'.\"<ref name=\"visual-memory1\" />\n\nAmong Kubrick's other doubling/mirroring effects in the film:\n* In the U.S. version, Jack's interview with Ullman, whose confident affability contrasts with Jack's seemingly forced nonchalance, is paired with Wendy's meeting with a female doctor, whose somber and professional manner contrasts with Wendy's nervousness.<ref name=Nelson>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Kubrick.html?id=wabgZNgT9OgC |title=Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze |last=Nelson |first=Thomas Allen |date=2000 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=0253213908 |access-date=October 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228010649/https://books.google.com/books/about/Kubrick.html?id=wabgZNgT9OgC |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* During the interview, Jack and Ullman are joined by a hotel employee named Bill Watson, who looks similar to Jack from behind, creating a pseudo\u2013mirror image effect as they sit in chairs to the front-left and front-right of Ullman's desk.<ref name=Nelson />\n* The Grady sisters look so similar that they appear to be twins, though they are different ages (Ullman states that he thinks that they were about eight and ten).<ref name=Nelson />\n* On two occasions, Ullman says goodbye to two young female employees and in the second case, they closely resemble each other.<ref name=Nelson />\n* The film contains two mazes, the hedges outside and, per Wendy's characterization, the Overlook. The hedge maze appears in two forms, the 13-foot-high version outside and the model inside the Overlook. In the overhead shot zooming down on Wendy and Danny in the center of the maze, the maze differs from the map outside and from the model having far more corridors, and the left and right sides are mirror images of each other.

Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wrote\n\n<blockquote>As the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it?

The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with the film).<ref name=\"visual-memory2\" />\n\n===Motivation of ghosts===\nIn the film, the motive of the ghosts is apparently to \"reclaim\" Jack (even though Grady expresses an interest in Danny's \"shining\" ability), who seems to be a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, as suggested by the 1920s photograph of Jack at the end of the film and Jack's repeated claims to have \"not just a ''[[d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]]''\".<ref>Among many other places, this is suggested in ''The Modern Weird Tale'' by S.T. Joshi, p. 72.</ref> The film is even more focused on Jack (as opposed to Danny) than the novel.\n\n===Room number===\nThe room number 217 has been changed to 237. [[Timberline Lodge]], located on [[Mt. Hood]] in [[Oregon]], was used for the exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel. The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in ''The Shining'', because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film. Contrary to the hotel's expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timberlinelodge.com/about-us/history |title=History |publisher=Timberline Lodge |accessdate=August 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508102838/http://www.timberlinelodge.com/about-us/history|archive-date=May 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomdeering.com/thesis/ch4/images/4-25-Bot_a.jpg |title=Deering Thesis: Timberline Lodge Second Floor Plan |last=Jr. |first=Thomas P.

Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by what he sees as the evil forces in the hotel.\nAt the novel's conclusion, it is suggested that the evil hotel forces have possessed Jack's body and proceeded to destroy all that is left of his mind during a final showdown with Danny. He leaves a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Hallorann escape.<ref name=ch55>See Chapter 55, ''That Which Was Forgotten''.</ref>\nThe film's Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner. Jack kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel. King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, on the grounds that he seemed vaguely sinister from the very beginning of the film, and had suggested [[Jon Voight]] among others for the role.<ref> King discusses this in an interview he gave at the time of the TV remake of ''The Shining'' in the ''New York Daily News''{{cite news |title=The Shining By the Book |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/shining-book-article-1.759715|access-date=March 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731005332/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/shining-book-article-1.759715|archive-date=July 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>''Creepshows: The Illustrated Stephen King Movie Guide'' By Stephen Jones Published by Watson-Guptill, 2002 p. 20</ref>\n\nOnly in the novel does Jack hear the haunting, heavy-handed voice of his father, with whom he had a troubled relationship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magistrale |first=Tony |title=Stephen King: America's Storyteller, p. 120 |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO, 2010 |isbn=9780313352287 |accessdate=|year=2010 }} See also novel, Chapter 26, ''Dreamland''.</ref> In both the novel and film, Jack's encounter with the ghostly bartender is pivotal to Jack's deterioration. However, the novel gives much more detail about Jack's problems with drinking and alcohol.\n\nThe film prolongs Jack's struggle with writer's block. Kubrick's co-screenwriter Diane Johnson believes that in King's novel, Jack's discovery of the scrapbook of clippings in the boiler room of the hotel, which gives him new ideas for a novel, catalyzes his possession by the ghosts of the hotel, while at the same time unblocking his writing. Jack is no longer a blocked writer, but now filled with energy. In her contribution to the screenplay, Johnson wrote an adaptation of this scene, which to her regret Kubrick later excised, as she felt this left the father's change less motivated.{{sfn|Johnson essay|2006|ref=essayDJ|p=58}} Kubrick showed Jack's continued blockage quite late in the film with the \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" scene, which does not appear in the novel.\n\nStephen King stated on the DVD commentary of the 1997 mini-series of ''The Shining'' that the character of Jack Torrance was partially autobiographical, as he was struggling with both alcoholism and unprovoked rage toward his family at the time of writing.<ref>DVD of The Shining TV mini-series directed by Mick Garris Studio: Warner Home Video DVD Release Date: January 7, 2003</ref> [[Tony Magistrale]] wrote about Kubrick's version of Jack Torrance in ''Hollywood's Stephen King'':\n{{quote|[[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick's]] version of Torrance is much closer to the tyrannical Hal (from Kubrick's ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and Alex (from Kubrick's ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'') than he is to King's more conflicted, more sympathetically human characterization.<ref>p. 100 of Hollywood's Stephen King By Tony Magistrale Published by Macmillan, 2003</ref>}}\n\nFrom Thomas Allen Nelson's ''Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze'': \"When Jack moves through the reception area on his way to a 'shining' over the model maze, he throws a yellow tennis ball past a stuffed bear and Danny's Big Wheel, which rests on the very spot (a Navajo circle design) where Hallorann will be murdered.\"\nJack's tennis ball mysteriously rolls into Danny's circle of toy cars just before the boy walks through the open door of Room 237.\n\n\"In the film's opening, the camera from above moves over water and through mountains with the ease of a bird in flight. Below, on a winding mountain road, Jack's diminutive yellow Volkswagen journeys through a tree-lined maze, resembling one of Danny's toy cars or the yellow tennis ball seen later outside of Room 237.\"<ref>Nelson, Thomas Allen, Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze p.203, 209, 214</ref>\n\n===Danny Torrance===\nDanny Torrance is considerably more open about his supernatural abilities in the novel, discussing them with strangers such as his doctor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rasmussen |first=Randy |date= |title=Stanley Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed p.233 |url= |location= |publisher=McFarland |isbn= |accessdate=}}See novel's Chapter 17, ''The Doctor's Office'', and chapter 20, ''Talking with Mr. Ullman''</ref> In the film, he is quite secretive about them even with his prime mentor Dick Hallorann, who also has these abilities. The same is true of Dick Hallorann, who in his journey back to the Overlook in the book, talks with others with the \"shining\" ability, while in the film he lies about his reason for returning to the Overlook. Danny in the novel is generally portrayed as unusually intelligent across the board.<ref>Rasmussen, 233\u20134. See also novelChapter 16, ''Danny''.</ref> In the film, he is more ordinary, though with a preternatural gift.\n\nAlthough Danny has supernatural powers in both versions, the novel makes it clear that his apparent imaginary friend \"Tony\" really is a projection of hidden parts of his own psyche, though heavily amplified by Danny's psychic \"shining\" abilities. At the end it is revealed that Danny Torrance's middle name is \"Anthony\".<ref>Tony's real identity is revealed in Chapter 54.</ref>{{Original research inline|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Wendy Torrance===\nWendy Torrance in the film is relatively meek, submissive, passive, gentle, and mousy; this is shown by the way she defends Jack even in his absence to the doctor examining Danny. It is implied that she has perhaps been abused by Jack as well. In the novel, she is a far more self-reliant and independent personality, who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Dale |date= June 2011|title=American Nightmares: The Haunted House Formula in American Popular Fiction, p. 95 |url= |location= |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299268732 |accessdate=}} See also the novel Chapter 5, ''Phone Booth'', and Chapter 6, ''Night Thoughts''.</ref> In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does in the film, but remains cool and self-reliant. Writing in ''Hollywood's Stephen King'', author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake:\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Rebecca De Mornay|De Mornay]] restores much of the steely resilience found in the protagonist of King's novel and this is particularly noteworthy when compared to Shelley Duvall's exaggerated portrayal of Wendy as [[Olive Oyl]] revisited: A simpering fatality of forces beyond her capacity to understand, much less surmount.<ref>Magistrale, p. 202.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nCo-screenwriter Diane Johnson stated that in her contributions to the script, Wendy had more dialogue, and that Kubrick cut many of her lines, possibly due to his dissatisfaction with actress Shelley Duvall's delivery. Johnson believes that the earlier draft of the script portrayed Wendy as a more-rounded character.{{sfn|Johnson essay|2006|ref=essayDJ|p=56}}\n\n===Stuart Ullman===\nIn the novel, Jack's authority issues are triggered by the fact that his interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet. The film's Ullman is far more humane and concerned about Jack's well-being, as well as smooth and self-assured. Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired.<ref>Jack's disdain for Ullman is the main subject of Chapter 1 of the novel, setting up Jack's authority issues.</ref> Ullman's bossy nature in the novel is one of the first steps in Jack's deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.\n\nIn ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation'', author Greg Jenkins writes \"A toadish figure in the book, Ullman has been utterly reinvented for the film; he now radiates charm, grace and gentility.\"<ref>p. 74 of ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins, published by McFarland, 1997</ref>\n\nFrom ''Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze'': Ullman tells Jack that the hotel's season runs from May 15 to October 30, meaning that the Torrances moved in on [[Halloween]] (October 31). On Ullmann's desk next to a small American flag sits a metal cup containing pencils and a pen&nbsp;\u2013 and a miniature replica of an ax.\n\n\"When Ullman, himself all smiles, relates as a footnote the story about the former caretaker who 'seemed perfectly normal' but nevertheless cut up his family with an ax, Jack's obvious interest (as if he's recalling one of his own nightmares) and his insincere congeniality (early signs of a personality malfunction) lead the viewer to believe that the film's definition of his madness will be far more complex.\"<ref>Nelson, p. 200, 206, 210</ref>\n\n===Family dynamics===\nStephen King provides the reader with a great deal of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story,<ref>Rasmussen, 233\u20134. See also novel Chapter 6, ''Night Thoughts'.</ref> including revelations of Jack's physical abuse of Danny and Wendy's fear of Danny's mysterious spells. Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than does King. In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him.\n\n===Plot differences===\nIn the novel Jack recovers his sanity and goodwill through the intervention of Danny while this does not occur in the film. Writing in ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine, Frederick Clarke suggests, \"Instead of playing a normal man who becomes insane, Nicholson portrays a crazy man attempting to remain sane.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clarke |first1=Frederick |year=1996 |title=The Shining |journal=Cinefastique |volume=28 |issue= |pages= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> In the novel, Jack's final act is to enable Wendy and Danny to escape the hotel before it explodes due to a defective boiler, killing him.<ref>{{cite book |title=American nightmares: the haunted house formula in American popular fiction |last=Bailey |first=Dale |year=1999 |publisher=Popular Press |location= |isbn=978-0-879727-89-5 |page=62}}</ref> The film ends with the hotel still standing.

In the novel, the reason for the hotel's manifestation of evil is possibly explained by a theme present in King's previous novel ''[[Salem's Lot]]'' as well as [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'': a physical place may absorb the evils that transpire there and manifest them as a vaguely sentient malevolence.<ref>''Cinema of the occult: new age, satanism, Wicca, and spiritualism in film'', by Carrol Lee Fry, notes similarities to both the Jackson story and Poe's ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' (p. 230).</ref> The film's Hallorann speaks to Danny about that phenomenon occurring at the Overlook.

It was released on September 25, 2000, as the album's third single. The song was written by [[Diane Warren]] and produced by [[David Foster]]. It was never released as a commercial single in the United States, where the song reached number 98 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nIn 2010, the song was covered by flamenco guitarist [[Benise]] (with [[Kimberley Locke]] providing vocals) for his album ''The Spanish Guitar''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song received mixed reviews from [[music critics]].

The scene quickly changes to a crowded cafe and centers on a man (portrayed by [[Kamar de los Reyes]]) playing the guitar. The scene changes to a modern white and red room where Braxton, wearing a red dress, sings her longing to be in his arms. There are several shots of him playing the guitar with the guitar morphing into Braxton in his arms. Towards the end, he and Braxton have a dance scene together. The video was directed by [[Billie Woodruff]], who also directed the videos for \"[[Un-Break My Heart]]\", \"[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]\", and \"[[Just Be a Man About It]]\".\n\n==Track listings==\n*'''German and Australian CD maxi single'''\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 4:30\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Radio Mix) \u2013 4:07\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (HQ\u00b2 Radio Edit) \u2013 4:11\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Royal Garden Flamenco Mix) \u2013 4:35\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Eiffel 65 Radio Edit) \u2013 4:30\n\n*'''German and Australian CD maxi single (The Remixes)'''\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 4:30\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Extended Mix) \u2013 6:53\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (HQ\u00b2 Mix) \u2013 8:54\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Deep Vocal Mix) \u2013 8:32\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Eiffel 65 Extended Mix) \u2013 6:54\n\n*'''German CD single'''\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 4:20\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Royal Garden's Flamenco Mix) \u2013 4:35\n\n*'''US 12\" single set'''\n:A1. \"Spanish Guitar\" (HQ\u00b2 Mix) \u2013 8:54\n:A2. \"Spanish Guitar\" (HQ\u00b2 Radio Edit) \u2013 4:10\n:B3. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Deep Vocal Mix) \u2013 8:32\n:B4. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Radio Edit) \u2013 4:02\n:C5. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Eiffel 65 Extended Mix) \u2013 6:54\n:C6. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Eiffel 65 TV Edit) \u2013 6:53\n:D7. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Extended Mix) \u2013 6:53\n:D8. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Royal Garden Flamenco Mix) \u2013 4:34\n:D9. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Album Version) \u2013 4:25\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It was released on September 25, 2000, as the album's third single. The song was written by [[Diane Warren]] and produced by [[David Foster]]. It was never released as a commercial single in the United States, where the song reached number 98 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nIn 2010, the song was covered by flamenco guitarist [[Benise]] (with [[Kimberley Locke]] providing vocals) for his album ''The Spanish Guitar''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song received mixed reviews from [[music critics]]. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] called it \"an effective ballad\" and picked it one of the best songs of the album, alongside \"[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]\" and \"[[Just Be a Man About It]]\".<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album |id=r473144 |tab=review |label=''The Heat'' review |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> [[CD Universe]] was largely positive, writing that \"the appropriately titled 'Spanish Guitar' marks an interruption of the other songs' predominantly electronic textures while remaining consistent with the sensuous, romantic mood.\"<ref name=\"cduniverse\">{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Toni Braxton - Heat CD Album|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8215431|work=[[CD Universe]]|accessdate=16 February 2012}}</ref> Barry Walters wrote favorably for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', stating that \"Braxton's supple alto rests easily within mainstream [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]'s smooove sonic furniture, her croons displaying husky quirks as the track goes through the multiplatinum motions on 'Spanish Guitar,' a Latin-conscious '[[Un-Break My Heart]]' clone.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite magazine|last=Walters |first=Barry |title=''The Heat'' review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2012-02-15 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/tonibraxton/albums/album/229292/review/5946676/the_heat |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726014552/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/tonibraxton/albums/album/229292/review/5946676/the_heat |archivedate=July 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, Colin Ross wrote a mixed review for ''[[PopMatters]]'', writing that the song is \"overly dramatic and fairly uninspiring.\"<ref name=\"popmatters\">{{Cite web | last = Ross | first = Colin | title = ''The Heat'' review | work = [[PopMatters]] | accessdate = 2012-02-15 | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/braxtontoni-heat/}}</ref> [[Amazon (website)|Amazon]]'s Bob Roget agreed, calling it a \"weightless trifle\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Roget |first=Bob |url=https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Toni-Braxton/dp/B00004R7SN |title=The Heat: Toni Braxton |website=[[Amazon (website)|Amazon]] |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for \"Spanish Guitar\" opens with Braxton floating on top of the water. The scene quickly changes to a crowded cafe and centers on a man (portrayed by [[Kamar de los Reyes]]) playing the guitar. The scene changes to a modern white and red room where Braxton, wearing a red dress, sings her longing to be in his arms. There are several shots of him playing the guitar with the guitar morphing into Braxton in his arms. Towards the end, he and Braxton have a dance scene together. The video was directed by [[Billie Woodruff]], who also directed the videos for \"[[Un-Break My Heart]]\", \"[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]\", and \"[[Just Be a Man About It]]\".\n\n==Track listings==\n*'''German and Australian CD maxi single'''\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 4:30\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Radio Mix) \u2013 4:07\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (HQ\u00b2 Radio Edit) \u2013 4:11\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Royal Garden Flamenco Mix) \u2013 4:35\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Eiffel 65 Radio Edit) \u2013 4:30\n\n*'''German and Australian CD maxi single (The Remixes)'''\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 4:30\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Extended Mix) \u2013 6:53\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (HQ\u00b2 Mix) \u2013 8:54\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Deep Vocal Mix) \u2013 8:32\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Eiffel 65 Extended Mix) \u2013 6:54\n\n*'''German CD single'''\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 4:20\n#\"Spanish Guitar\" (Royal Garden's Flamenco Mix) \u2013 4:35\n\n*'''US 12\" single set'''\n:A1. \"Spanish Guitar\" (HQ\u00b2 Mix) \u2013 8:54\n:A2. \"Spanish Guitar\" (HQ\u00b2 Radio Edit) \u2013 4:10\n:B3. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Deep Vocal Mix) \u2013 8:32\n:B4. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Radio Edit) \u2013 4:02\n:C5. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Eiffel 65 Extended Mix) \u2013 6:54\n:C6. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Eiffel 65 TV Edit) \u2013 6:53\n:D7. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Mousse T.'s Extended Mix) \u2013 6:53\n:D8. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Royal Garden Flamenco Mix) \u2013 4:34\n:D9. \"Spanish Guitar\" (Album Version) \u2013 4:25\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The university offers bachelor's, master's and doctorate degree programs in engineering disciplines to nearly 8000 students.\n\nYTU is also a member of [[ASEAN University Network]], Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-Net), and [[Greater Mekong Sub-region Academic and Research Network]] (GMSARN).<ref name=\"coe\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yangon Technological University.JPG|thumb|Yangon Technological University]]\nThe university traces its origins to [[Rangoon University]]'s '''Department of Engineering''' established in 1924 during the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial period]]. In the beginning, the department was located in the extended compound of [[Rangoon General Hospital]] in downtown Yangon and consisted of two lecturers and 17 students.<ref name=\"ex-rit\"/> In 1927, it became a separate entity, '''BOC College of Engineering and Mining''', named after [[Burmah Oil Company]], and was moved four miles north. Civil Engineering was the only program offered until 1938 when a combined Mechanical and Electrical Engineering program was added.<ref name=\"coe\"/><ref name=\"ex-rit\"/>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], in 1946, the college became the '''Faculty of Engineering''' of Rangoon University. After Burma's independence in 1948, the college added Mining, Chemical, Metallurgy and Architecture programs in 1954 and a Textile Engineering program in 1955.\n\nIn 1961, the college became '''Burma Institute of Technology (BIT)''' of Rangoon University and was moved to the current building complex in Gyogone built by the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"ex-rit\"/> In 1964, BIT was renamed '''Rangoon Institute of Technology (RIT)''' and, more importantly, made an independent university under the Ministry of Education.<ref name=\"coe\"/><ref name=\"MST\"/> RIT began conferring Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Engineering degrees instead of Bachelor of Science (Engineering) and Master Science (Engineering) degrees, hitherto offered at Rangoon University. The university expanded its bachelor's and master's degree offerings to the current 11 disciplines over the years. The PhD programs were added only in 1997.\n\nThe university was renamed Yangon Institute of Technology (YIT) in 1990 and was placed under the Ministry of Science and Technology in 1997.<ref name=\"coe\"/> In 1998, the name of the university was changed to Yangon Technological University (YTU). In 1999, a new campus located six miles west of Gyogone in [[Hlaingthaya Township|Hlaingtharya]] was opened.<ref name=\"ex-rit\"/> Until 1991, when [[Mandalay Technological University|Mandalay Institute of Technology]] was founded, the university was the only senior engineering university in the country, along with several Government Technical Institutes (GTIs), which offered two-year engineering diplomas. In 2012, both Yangon Technological University (YTU) and Mandalay Technological University (MTU) started to accept the best and most outstanding students around the country to undergraduate programs and they are called as Center of Excellence (COE). Only 250 students are accepted to YTU annually based on their scores from the annual university entrance examinations.

In the beginning, the department was located in the extended compound of [[Rangoon General Hospital]] in downtown Yangon and consisted of two lecturers and 17 students.<ref name=\"ex-rit\"/> In 1927, it became a separate entity, '''BOC College of Engineering and Mining''', named after [[Burmah Oil Company]], and was moved four miles north. Civil Engineering was the only program offered until 1938 when a combined Mechanical and Electrical Engineering program was added.<ref name=\"coe\"/><ref name=\"ex-rit\"/>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], in 1946, the college became the '''Faculty of Engineering''' of Rangoon University. After Burma's independence in 1948, the college added Mining, Chemical, Metallurgy and Architecture programs in 1954 and a Textile Engineering program in 1955.\n\nIn 1961, the college became '''Burma Institute of Technology (BIT)''' of Rangoon University and was moved to the current building complex in Gyogone built by the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"ex-rit\"/> In 1964, BIT was renamed '''Rangoon Institute of Technology (RIT)''' and, more importantly, made an independent university under the Ministry of Education.<ref name=\"coe\"/><ref name=\"MST\"/> RIT began conferring Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Engineering degrees instead of Bachelor of Science (Engineering) and Master Science (Engineering) degrees, hitherto offered at Rangoon University. The university expanded its bachelor's and master's degree offerings to the current 11 disciplines over the years. The PhD programs were added only in 1997.\n\nThe university was renamed Yangon Institute of Technology (YIT) in 1990 and was placed under the Ministry of Science and Technology in 1997.<ref name=\"coe\"/> In 1998, the name of the university was changed to Yangon Technological University (YTU). In 1999, a new campus located six miles west of Gyogone in [[Hlaingthaya Township|Hlaingtharya]] was opened.<ref name=\"ex-rit\"/> Until 1991, when [[Mandalay Technological University|Mandalay Institute of Technology]] was founded, the university was the only senior engineering university in the country, along with several Government Technical Institutes (GTIs), which offered two-year engineering diplomas. In 2012, both Yangon Technological University (YTU) and Mandalay Technological University (MTU) started to accept the best and most outstanding students around the country to undergraduate programs and they are called as Center of Excellence (COE). Only 250 students are accepted to YTU annually based on their scores from the annual university entrance examinations. YTU remains the best university which students need best scores among all the students around Myanmar to get acceptance.\n\n==Programs==\nYTU maintains 18 academic departments: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Power Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Mechatronic Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Textile Engineering, Mining Engineering,\nPetroleum Engineering, Materials Science and Metallurgy Engineering, Biotechnology, Architecture, Engineering Geology, Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry, Engineering Mathematics, and Languages.<ref name=\"coe\"/>\n\nMost YTU students are enrolled full-time in engineering programs although over 2000 students are also enrolled in part-time programs.
