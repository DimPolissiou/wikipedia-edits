He is generally considered the greatest of the 19th-century [[Starets|startsy]] (elders).  Seraphim extended the [[monasticism|monastic]] teachings of [[contemplation]], [[theoria]] and [[self-denial]] to the [[layperson]]. He taught that the purpose of the Christian life was to acquire the [[Holy Spirit]]. Perhaps his most popular quotation amongst Orthodox believers is ''\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and thousands around you will be saved.\"''\n\nSeraphim was [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1903. Alongside his veneration in the Catholic calendar, [[Pope John Paul II]] also referred to him as a Saint.<ref>Pope John Paul II, ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'', (Knopf, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-679-76561-5}}, page 18.</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}[[File:Serafim and a bear.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Seraphim feeding a bear outside of his [[hermitage (religious retreat)]] (from lithograph ''The Way to Sarov'', 1903).]]\n[[File:Seraphim of Sarov - pilgrim spot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pilgrim spot]]\n\nBorn 19 July (O.S.) 1754, the future saint was [[baptism|baptized]] with the name of Prochor, after [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], one of the first [[Seven Deacons]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] of [[John the Evangelist]]. His parents, Isidore and Agathia Moshnin, lived in [[Kursk, Russia]]. His father was a merchant. According to [[Orthodox Church]] tradition, a [[wonderworking]] [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Virgin Mary]]), [[Our Lady of Kursk]], healed the young boy. Seraphim later experienced a number of [[vision (religion)|visions]].\n\nIn 1775, at the age of 17, he visited Dorothea of Kiev.\n\nIn 1777, at the age of 19, he joined the [[Sarov]] monastery as a [[novice]] (''poslushnik''). He was officially [[tonsure]]d (took his [[Monk#Eastern Christianity|monastic vows]]) in 1786 and given the religious name of Seraphim (which means \"fiery\" or \"burning\" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). Shortly afterwards, he was [[ordained]] a [[hierodeacon]] (monastic [[deacon]]). In 1793, he was ordained as a [[hieromonk]] (monastic [[priest]]) and became the spiritual leader of the Diveyevo Convent, which has since come to be known as the [[Serafimo-Diveevsky Monastery|Seraphim-Diveyevo Convent]].\n\nSoon after this, Seraphim retreated to a log cabin in the woods outside [[Sarov]] monastery and led a solitary lifestyle as a [[hermit]] for 25 years. During this time his feet became swollen to the point that he had trouble walking. Sarov's eating and [[fasting]] habits became more strict.<ref name=\"Johnson 2000\">Johnston, William M. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers. p. 1146. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-090-2}}</ref> At first he ate bread obtained from the monastery and vegetables from his garden, then only vegetables. For three years, he ate only grass.<ref name=\"Johnson 2000\"/>\n\n[[File:Motovilov.gif|thumb|[[Nicholas Motovilov]], one of Seraphim's most well-known [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]].]]\n\nOne day, while chopping wood, Seraphim was attacked by a gang of thieves who beat him mercilessly with the handle of his own axe. He never resisted, and was left for dead. The robbers never found the money they sought, only an [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) in his hut. Seraphim had a hunched back for the rest of his life. However, at the thieves' trial he pleaded to the judge for mercy on their behalf.\n\n\"After this incident, Seraphim spent 5 months in the monastery, recovering, and there again returned to the desert, for the former spiritual feats.\" (\"\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043c \u0421\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446\" \u2013 \u0441\u0442\u0440. 14)\n\nAfter this incident Seraphim spent 1,000 successive nights on a rock in continuous prayer with his arms raised to the sky, a feat of [[asceticism]] deemed miraculous by the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially considering the pain from his injuries.\n\nIn 1815, in obedience to a reputed [[vision (religion)|spiritual experience]] that he attributed to the Virgin Mary, Seraphim began admitting [[pilgrims]] to his hermitage as a [[confessor]]. He soon became immensely popular due to his reputation for [[thaumaturge|healing powers]] and gift of [[prophecy]]. Hundreds of pilgrims per day visited him, drawn as well by his ability to answer his guests' questions before they could ask.\n\nAs extraordinarily harsh as Seraphim often was to himself, he was kind and gentle toward others \u2014 always greeting his guests with a [[prostration]], a [[kiss of peace|kiss]], and exclaiming [[Paschal greeting|\"Christ is risen!\"]], and calling everyone \"My joy.\" He died while kneeling before an ''Umilenie'' icon of the Theotokos which he called \"Joy of all Joys\".

These would be the last prayers offered for Seraphim as a departed servant of God; from that time forward, prayers would instead be addressed to him as a saint. On 19 July, Seraphim's birthday, the late liturgy began at 8 o'clock. At the [[Little Entrance]], twelve [[archimandrite]]s lifted the coffin from the middle of the church and carried it around the [[Holy Table]] (altar), then placed it into a special shrine which had been constructed for them.\n\nThe festivities at Sarov ended with the [[consecration]] of the first two churches dedicated to St. Seraphim. The first had been constructed over his [[monastic cell]] in the wilderness of Sarov. The second church was consecrated on 22 July at the [[Diveyevo]] [[convent]].\n\nFollowing the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities severely persecuted religious groups.  As part of their [[persecution of Christians]], they confiscated many relics of saints, including St. Seraphim. Furthermore, his biographer [[Seraphim Chichagov]], who came to become a [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]], was arrested, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in 1937 (and is also celebrated as a Russian Orthodox saint).\n\nIn 1991, St. Seraphim's relics were rediscovered after being hidden in a [[religion in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-religious]] museum for seventy years. This caused a sensation in post-Soviet Russia and throughout the Orthodox world. A [[crucession]] (religious [[procession]]) escorted the relics, on foot, all the way from Moscow to Diveyevo Convent, where they remain to this day.\n\nOn 19 October 2016, relics of Seraphim were launched into space aboard the [[Soyuz MS-02]].<ref name=\"tass\">{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/science/907848|title=Soyuz MS-02 spacecraft docking the International Space Station|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeraphim is a patron saint of Russia's nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"tass\">{{cite web|url=https://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2019/07/11/russian-orthodox-church-considers-ending-blessings-for-nuclear-weapons/|title=Russian Orthodox Church considers ending blessings for nuclear weapons||publisher=Catholic Herald|accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n<blockquote>\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and around you thousands will be saved.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"It is necessary that the Holy Spirit enter our heart.

He is generally considered the greatest of the 19th-century [[Starets|startsy]] (elders).  Seraphim extended the [[monasticism|monastic]] teachings of [[contemplation]], [[theoria]] and [[self-denial]] to the [[layperson]]. He taught that the purpose of the Christian life was to acquire the [[Holy Spirit]]. Perhaps his most popular quotation amongst Orthodox believers is ''\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and thousands around you will be saved.\"''\n\nSeraphim was [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1903. Alongside his veneration in the Catholic calendar, [[Pope John Paul II]] also referred to him as a Saint.<ref>Pope John Paul II, ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'', (Knopf, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-679-76561-5}}, page 18.</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}[[File:Serafim and a bear.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Seraphim feeding a bear outside of his [[hermitage (religious retreat)]] (from lithograph ''The Way to Sarov'', 1903).]]\n[[File:Seraphim of Sarov - pilgrim spot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pilgrim spot]]\n\nBorn 19 July (O.S.) 1754, the future saint was [[baptism|baptized]] with the name of Prochor, after [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], one of the first [[Seven Deacons]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] of [[John the Evangelist]]. His parents, Isidore and Agathia Moshnin, lived in [[Kursk, Russia]]. His father was a merchant. According to [[Orthodox Church]] tradition, a [[wonderworking]] [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Virgin Mary]]), [[Our Lady of Kursk]], healed the young boy. Seraphim later experienced a number of [[vision (religion)|visions]].\n\nIn 1775, at the age of 17, he visited Dorothea of Kiev.\n\nIn 1777, at the age of 19, he joined the [[Sarov]] monastery as a [[novice]] (''poslushnik''). He was officially [[tonsure]]d (took his [[Monk#Eastern Christianity|monastic vows]]) in 1786 and given the religious name of Seraphim (which means \"fiery\" or \"burning\" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). Shortly afterwards, he was [[ordained]] a [[hierodeacon]] (monastic [[deacon]]). In 1793, he was ordained as a [[hieromonk]] (monastic [[priest]]) and became the spiritual leader of the Diveyevo Convent, which has since come to be known as the [[Serafimo-Diveevsky Monastery|Seraphim-Diveyevo Convent]].\n\nSoon after this, Seraphim retreated to a log cabin in the woods outside [[Sarov]] monastery and led a solitary lifestyle as a [[hermit]] for 25 years. During this time his feet became swollen to the point that he had trouble walking. Sarov's eating and [[fasting]] habits became more strict.<ref name=\"Johnson 2000\">Johnston, William M. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers. p. 1146. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-090-2}}</ref> At first he ate bread obtained from the monastery and vegetables from his garden, then only vegetables. For three years, he ate only grass.<ref name=\"Johnson 2000\"/>\n\n[[File:Motovilov.gif|thumb|[[Nicholas Motovilov]], one of Seraphim's most well-known [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]].]]\n\nOne day, while chopping wood, Seraphim was attacked by a gang of thieves who beat him mercilessly with the handle of his own axe. He never resisted, and was left for dead. The robbers never found the money they sought, only an [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) in his hut. Seraphim had a hunched back for the rest of his life. However, at the thieves' trial he pleaded to the judge for mercy on their behalf.\n\n\"After this incident, Seraphim spent 5 months in the monastery, recovering, and there again returned to the desert, for the former spiritual feats.\" (\"\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043c \u0421\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446\" \u2013 \u0441\u0442\u0440. 14)\n\nAfter this incident Seraphim spent 1,000 successive nights on a rock in continuous prayer with his arms raised to the sky, a feat of [[asceticism]] deemed miraculous by the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially considering the pain from his injuries.\n\nIn 1815, in obedience to a reputed [[vision (religion)|spiritual experience]] that he attributed to the Virgin Mary, Seraphim began admitting [[pilgrims]] to his hermitage as a [[confessor]]. He soon became immensely popular due to his reputation for [[thaumaturge|healing powers]] and gift of [[prophecy]]. Hundreds of pilgrims per day visited him, drawn as well by his ability to answer his guests' questions before they could ask.\n\nAs extraordinarily harsh as Seraphim often was to himself, he was kind and gentle toward others \u2014 always greeting his guests with a [[prostration]], a [[kiss of peace|kiss]], and exclaiming [[Paschal greeting|\"Christ is risen!\"]], and calling everyone \"My joy.\" He died while kneeling before an ''Umilenie'' icon of the Theotokos which he called \"Joy of all Joys\". This icon is kept currently in the chapel of the residence of the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\n==Relics, Canonization, Veneration==\n{{multiple image\n | width = 120\n | align = left\n | image1 = Seraphim of Sarov - wishing well.jpg\n | caption1 = Wishing well at the pilgrim spot\n | image2 = Seraphim of Sarov - Display board.jpg\n | caption2 = Life sketch on a board\n }}\n[[File:Seraphim of Sarov - hut.jpg|thumb|120px|hut where he lived]]\nThere was a widespread popular belief in Russia that a saint's remains were supposed to be [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]], which was not the case with Seraphim as was officially ascertained by a commission that researched his grave in January 1903.

These would be the last prayers offered for Seraphim as a departed servant of God; from that time forward, prayers would instead be addressed to him as a saint. On 19 July, Seraphim's birthday, the late liturgy began at 8 o'clock. At the [[Little Entrance]], twelve [[archimandrite]]s lifted the coffin from the middle of the church and carried it around the [[Holy Table]] (altar), then placed it into a special shrine which had been constructed for them.\n\nThe festivities at Sarov ended with the [[consecration]] of the first two churches dedicated to St. Seraphim. The first had been constructed over his [[monastic cell]] in the wilderness of Sarov. The second church was consecrated on 22 July at the [[Diveyevo]] [[convent]].\n\nFollowing the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities severely persecuted religious groups.  As part of their [[persecution of Christians]], they confiscated many relics of saints, including St. Seraphim. Furthermore, his biographer [[Seraphim Chichagov]], who came to become a [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]], was arrested, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in 1937 (and is also celebrated as a Russian Orthodox saint).\n\nIn 1991, St. Seraphim's relics were rediscovered after being hidden in a [[religion in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-religious]] museum for seventy years. This caused a sensation in post-Soviet Russia and throughout the Orthodox world. A [[crucession]] (religious [[procession]]) escorted the relics, on foot, all the way from Moscow to Diveyevo Convent, where they remain to this day.\n\nOn 19 October 2016, relics of Seraphim were launched into space aboard the [[Soyuz MS-02]].<ref name=\"tass\">{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/science/907848|title=Soyuz MS-02 spacecraft docking the International Space Station|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeraphim is a patron saint of Russia's nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"tass\">{{cite web|url=https://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2019/07/11/russian-orthodox-church-considers-ending-blessings-for-nuclear-weapons/|title=Russian Orthodox Church considers ending blessings for nuclear weapons||publisher=Catholic Herald|accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n<blockquote>\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and around you thousands will be saved.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"It is necessary that the Holy Spirit enter our heart.

When the band's singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions, Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing. Word of Rollins' ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington; [[Bad Brains]] singer [[H.R.]] would sometimes get Rollins on stage to sing with him.<ref name=\"a26\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 26</ref> In 1980, the Washington punk band the Extorts lost their frontman [[Lyle Preslar]] to [[Minor Threat]]. Rollins joined the others of the band to form State of Alert (S.O.A.) and became its frontman and vocalist. He put words to the band's five songs and wrote several more. S.O.A. recorded their sole EP, ''No Policy'', and released it in 1981 on MacKaye's [[Dischord Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p442659|pure_url=yes}} |title=State of Alert > Overview |accessdate=2007-08-16 |author=DePasquale, Ron |website=Allmusic}}</ref>\n\nAround April 1981, drummer Simon Jacobsen was replaced by Ivor Hanson. At the time, Hanson's father was a top admiral in the [[U.S. Navy]] and his family shared living quarters with the [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] in the [[United States Naval Observatory|Naval Observatory]].

Rollins had enjoyed being the band's frontman, and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows. He later said, \"I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam and ''loved'' to get in the dust-ups.\" By this time, Rollins had become the assistant manager of the Georgetown [[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]] ice cream store; his steady employment had helped to finance the S.O.A. EP.<ref name=\"a27\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 27</ref>\n\n===Black Flag===\n{{Main|Black Flag (band)}}\n\nIn 1980, a friend gave Rollins and MacKaye a copy of Black Flag's ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' EP. Rollins soon became a fan of the band, exchanging letters with bassist [[Chuck Dukowski]] and later inviting the band to stay in his parents' home when Black Flag toured the East Coast in December 1980.<ref>Azzerad, 2001. p. 27-28</ref> When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981, Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could. At an impromptu show in a New York bar, Black Flag's vocalist [[Dez Cadena]] allowed Rollins to sing \"Clocked In\", a song Rollins had asked the band to play in light of the fact that he had to drive back to Washington, D.C. to begin work.<ref name=\"a28\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 28</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena wanted to switch to guitar, and the band was looking for a new vocalist.<ref name=\"a28\" /> The band was impressed with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder [[Greg Ginn]] was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple, three-chord punk.<ref name=\"a29\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 29</ref>\n\n[[Image:Black Flag logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|The band's logo was created by artist [[Raymond Pettibon]]]]\nAfter joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins quit his job at H\u00e4agen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles.

He released ''Everything'', a recording of a chapter of his book ''[[Eye Scream]]'' with free jazz backing, in 1996. He continued to appear in various films, including ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' and ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''. The Rollins Band signed to [[Dreamworks Records]] in 1997 and soon released ''[[Come in and Burn]]'', but it did not receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material.

I remember hearing that and thinking 'Well, that's something. This guy is pissed ''off'', those guitars are ''rude''.' What a revelation!<ref name=\"a28\"/>}}\n\nFrom 1979 to 1980, Rollins was working as a roadie for Washington bands, including [[Teen Idles]]. When the band's singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions, Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing. Word of Rollins' ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington; [[Bad Brains]] singer [[H.R.]] would sometimes get Rollins on stage to sing with him.<ref name=\"a26\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 26</ref> In 1980, the Washington punk band the Extorts lost their frontman [[Lyle Preslar]] to [[Minor Threat]]. Rollins joined the others of the band to form State of Alert (S.O.A.) and became its frontman and vocalist. He put words to the band's five songs and wrote several more. S.O.A. recorded their sole EP, ''No Policy'', and released it in 1981 on MacKaye's [[Dischord Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p442659|pure_url=yes}} |title=State of Alert > Overview |accessdate=2007-08-16 |author=DePasquale, Ron |website=Allmusic}}</ref>\n\nAround April 1981, drummer Simon Jacobsen was replaced by Ivor Hanson. At the time, Hanson's father was a top admiral in the [[U.S. Navy]] and his family shared living quarters with the [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] in the [[United States Naval Observatory|Naval Observatory]]. The band held their practices there and would have to be let in by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/a-brief-oral-history-of-henry-rollins-s-brief-career-in-d-c--8387 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119194742/https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/a-brief-oral-history-of-henry-rollins-s-brief-career-in-d-c--8387 |archivedate=November 19, 2018 |title=An incomplete oral history of Henry Rollins' D.C. years | first=Ryan | last=Kearney | date=February 9, 2012 | work= \"wjla.com\" | access-date=November 19, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nS.O.A. disbanded after a total of a dozen concerts and one EP. Rollins had enjoyed being the band's frontman, and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows. He later said, \"I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam and ''loved'' to get in the dust-ups.\" By this time, Rollins had become the assistant manager of the Georgetown [[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]] ice cream store; his steady employment had helped to finance the S.O.A. EP.<ref name=\"a27\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 27</ref>\n\n===Black Flag===\n{{Main|Black Flag (band)}}\n\nIn 1980, a friend gave Rollins and MacKaye a copy of Black Flag's ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' EP. Rollins soon became a fan of the band, exchanging letters with bassist [[Chuck Dukowski]] and later inviting the band to stay in his parents' home when Black Flag toured the East Coast in December 1980.<ref>Azzerad, 2001. p. 27-28</ref> When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981, Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could. At an impromptu show in a New York bar, Black Flag's vocalist [[Dez Cadena]] allowed Rollins to sing \"Clocked In\", a song Rollins had asked the band to play in light of the fact that he had to drive back to Washington, D.C. to begin work.<ref name=\"a28\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 28</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena wanted to switch to guitar, and the band was looking for a new vocalist.<ref name=\"a28\" /> The band was impressed with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder [[Greg Ginn]] was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple, three-chord punk.<ref name=\"a29\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 29</ref>\n\n[[Image:Black Flag logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|The band's logo was created by artist [[Raymond Pettibon]]]]\nAfter joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins quit his job at H\u00e4agen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Rollins got the Black Flag logo [[tattoo]]ed on his left biceps<ref name=\"popenter\" /> and also on the back of his neck, chose the stage name of Rollins, a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers.<ref name=\"a29\" /> Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21, 1981 at Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa, California.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Flag at the Cuckoo's Nest|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21|work=It All Happened \u2013 A Living History of Live Music|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101030125/http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21|archivedate=January 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag, and he was hassled as a result. Rollins later said: \"That really scared me. It freaked me out that an adult would do that. ... My little eyes were opened big time.\"<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 31</ref>\n\nBefore concerts, as the others of the band tuned up, Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only in a pair of black shorts, grinding his teeth; to focus before the show, he would squeeze a pool ball.<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 34</ref> His stage persona impressed several critics; after a 1982 show in [[Anacortes, Washington]], ''Sub Pop'' critic [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] wrote: \"Henry was incredible. Pacing back and forth, lunging, lurching, growling; it was all real, the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen.\"<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 38</ref>\n\nBy 1983, Rollins' stage persona was increasingly alienating him from the rest of Black Flag. During a show in England, Rollins assaulted a member of the audience who attacked Ginn; Ginn later scolded Rollins, calling him a \"macho asshole\".<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 39</ref> A legal dispute with [[Unicorn Records]] held up further Black Flag releases until 1984, and Ginn was slowing the band's tempo down so that they would remain innovative. In August 1983, guitarist [[Dez Cadena]] had left the band; a stalemate lingered between Dukowski and Ginn, who wanted Dukowski to leave, before Ginn fired Dukowski outright.<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 41</ref> 1984's [[heavy metal music]]-influenced ''[[My War]]'' featured Rollins screaming and wailing throughout many of the songs; the band's members also grew their hair to confuse the band's hardcore punk audience.<ref name=\"a47\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 47</ref>\n\nBlack Flag's change in musical style and appearance alienated many of their original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reilly|first1=Dan|title=10 Concert Fights Caught on Tape|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-concert-fights-caught-on-tape-20130625|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref> Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote \"When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I really want to do to them.\"<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 46</ref> During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist [[Michael Azerrad]] later commented that \"his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself.\"<ref name=\"a47\" /> <!-- Get in the Van book release? --> Rollins has since replied that \"no, the training was just basically a way to push myself.\"<ref name=\"smhinterview\">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/henry-rollins/2008/04/03/1206851089537.html |title=Henry Rollins interview |accessdate=2008-04-04 |author=Jensen, Erik|work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=2008-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Rollins Band and solo releases===\n{{Main|Rollins Band}}\n[[File:HenryRollins Performing 1993.jpg|thumb|300px|Rollins performing with the [[Rollins Band]] in 1993]]\nBefore Black Flag disbanded in August 1986, Rollins had already toured as a solo spoken word artist.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php |title=Lip Service \u2013 Henry Rollins |accessdate=2007-09-14 |author=Waggoner, Eric |newspaper=[[Seattle Weekly]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014220714/http://seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php |archivedate = October 14, 2007}}</ref> He released two solo records in 1987, ''[[Hot Animal Machine]]'', a collaboration with guitarist [[Chris Haskett]], and ''[[Drive by Shooting]]'', recorded as \"Henrietta Collins and the Wifebeating Childhaters\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/punk_newwave_postpunk/support/Rollins.htm |title=Henry Rollins/Black Flag |accessdate=2007-09-09 |author=Hoffmann, Frank |publisher=Survey of American Popular Music}}</ref> Rollins also released his second spoken word album, ''[[Big Ugly Mouth]]'' in the same year.

However, in December 1991, Rollins and his best friend [[Joe Cole (roadie)|Joe Cole]] were accosted by two armed robbers outside Rollins's home. Cole was murdered by a gunshot to the head, Rollins escaped without injury but police suspected him in the murder and detained him for ten hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edwebproject.org/rollins.html |title=Primal Scream: Henry Rollins speaks |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author1=Carvin, Andy |author2=Crone, Chris |publisher=EdWebProject.org}}</ref> Although traumatized by Cole's death, as chronicled in his book ''Now Watch Him Die'', Rollins continued to release new material; the spoken-word album ''[[Human Butt]]'' appeared in 1992 on his own record label, [[2.13.61]]. The Rollins Band released ''[[The End of Silence]]'', Rollins's first charting album.<ref name=\"amghenry\" />\n\nThe following year, Rollins released a spoken-word double album, ''The Boxed Life''.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r77934|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Boxed Life > Overview |accessdate=2007-08-23 |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |website=Allmusic}}</ref> The Rollins Band embarked upon the ''End of Silence'' tour; bassist Weiss was fired toward its end, and replaced by funk and jazz bassist [[Melvin Gibbs]]. According to critic Steve Huey, 1994 was Rollins's \"breakout year\".<ref name=\"amghenry\" /> The Rollins Band appeared at [[Woodstock 94]] and released ''[[Weight (album)|Weight]]'', which ranked on the Billboard Top 40. Rollins released ''[[Get in the Van|Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag]]'', a double-disc set of him reading from his Black Flag tour diary of the same name; he won the Grammy for [[Best Spoken Word Recording]] as a result. Rollins was named 1994's \"Man of the Year\" by the American men's magazine ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' and became a contributing columnist to the magazine. With the increased exposure, Rollins made several appearances on American music channels MTV and [[VH1]] around this time, and made his Hollywood film debut in 1994 in ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'' playing a police officer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022646/bio |title=Henry Rollins Biography |accessdate=2007-09-14 |publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the Rollins Band's record label, Imago Records, declared itself bankrupt. Rollins began focusing on his spoken word career. He released ''Everything'', a recording of a chapter of his book ''[[Eye Scream]]'' with free jazz backing, in 1996. He continued to appear in various films, including ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' and ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''. The Rollins Band signed to [[Dreamworks Records]] in 1997 and soon released ''[[Come in and Burn]]'', but it did not receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material. Rollins continued to release spoken-word book readings, releasing ''[[Black Coffee Blues]]'' in the same year. In 1998, Rollins released ''[[Think Tank (Rollins)|Think Tank]]'', his first set of non-book-related spoken material in five years.\n\nBy 1998, Rollins felt that the relationship with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles [[hard rock]] band called [[Mother Superior (band)|Mother Superior]], and invited them to form a new incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, ''[[Get Some Go Again]]'', was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's ''[[Nice (Rollins Band album)|Nice]]'' and 2003's ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]''.

Rollins then abandoned his [[State of Alert]] \"bark\" and adopted the band's swing.<ref name=\"a32\">Azerrad, 2001. p. 32</ref> Rollins later explained: \"What I was doing kind of matched the vibe of the music. The music was intense and, well, I was as intense as you needed.\"<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 33</ref>\n\nIn both incarnations of the Rollins Band, Rollins combined spoken word with his traditional vocal style in songs such as \"[[Liar (Rollins Band song)|Liar]]\" (the song begins with a one-minute spoken diatribe by Rollins), barked his way through songs (such as \"Tearing\" and \"Starve\"), and employed the loud-quiet dynamic.

He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX.

Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

He was convicted for [[war crimes]] after the war. During [[World War I]], he was a [[flying ace]] who claimed shooting down twenty planes and an [[airship]]; he was credited with thirteen{{sfn|Guttman|2003|p=19}} of those claims.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Wyk auf F\u00f6hr]], [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]], into an old seafaring family, the son of a sea captain. The generations-long seafaring tradition within his family charted an obvious course for his future. In 1895 he joined the merchant marine, serving for 7 years{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and volunteering in 1901 for MTBs.<ref name=AL92>Franks et al., p. 92.</ref> After one year, he returned to the merchant marine, serving several years aboard the 5-masted ''[[Preussen (ship)|Preussen]]'' (at the time, the largest sailing ship in the world,) as Second Officer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In 1913 he decided to deviate from this career, and learned to fly. Having graduated and gaining licence No. 707, he became a flying instructor at a civilian flying school.<ref name=AL92/>\n\n==Service during World War I==\n[[File:Friedrichchristiansen.jpg|thumb|left|Christiansen in 1918]]\nIn August 1914, Christiansen was called up and posted to [[Zeebrugge]] as naval aviator. He flew [[Hansa-Brandenburg W.12]] seaplanes over the North Sea, the English Channel, and Britain. For his bombing missions on [[Dover]] and [[Ramsgate]], he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class. From 1915 to 1916 Christiansen went on numerous reconnaissance and bombing missions, helping to make his unit at [[Zeebrugge]] one of the most successful in the [[Marineflieger|German Naval Air Service]]. On 27 April 1916, as ''Leutnant der Matrosen Artillerie'' (Lieutenant of Naval Artillery,) Christiansen was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class and Knights Cross with Swords of the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]].<ref name=AL92/>\n\nChristiansen claimed his first air-to-air victory 15 May 1917 by shooting down a [[Sopwith Pup]] off Dover. On 1 September 1917 he took command of Naval Air Station at Zeebrugge, and being promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'', shot down a [[Felixstowe Porte Baby|Porte FB2 Baby]] off Felixstowe the same day. On 11 December 1917 he shot down the non-rigid [[Coastal class blimp|coastal class]] airship ''C-27'', Cdr. Flight Lieutenant John Francis Dixon, [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]], near the Belgian coast.<ref>Franks et al., pp. 92\u201393.</ref>\n\nChristiansen continued to carry out reconnaissance, rescue, and bombing missions, such that by December 1917, he had completed 440 missions,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} including shooting down Airship C27. At this time he was also awarded the [[Pour le M\u00e9rite|Pour le M\u00e9rite (\"Blue Max\")]], the first of only three given to naval aviators and the only one to a seaplane pilot.<ref>O'Connor, p. 50.</ref> He was promoted to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' in 1918.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOn 15 February 1918 Christiansen shot down a [[Curtiss Model H|Curtiss H12B flying boat]] off Felixstowe, followed by 2 more on 24 April and 25 April. In June he claimed three more [[Felixstowe F.2|Felixstowe F2As]]. On 6 July he surprised and damaged British submarine {{HMS|C25}} in the Thames estuary, killing its captain and five crewmen (the submarine reached harbour). By 11 November 1918 he raised his personal tally to 13,<ref>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/christiansen.php The Aerodrome forum]</ref> as well as some shared victories, which cumulatively may have brought his total to 21.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://archive.org/details/influenceofairpo0000boyn | url-access= registration |title=The Influence of Air Power upon History |first=Walter J. |last=Boyne |year=2003 |publisher=Pelican Publishing |isbn=978-1-58980-034-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/influenceofairpo0000boyn/page/72 72]| quote=Christiansen, who had 21 victories... and sank a British submarine.}}</ref>\n\n==Activity between wars==\nFollowing the German Revolution of late 1918, Christiansen was a member of the 3rd Marinebrigade commanded by Wilfried von Loewenfeld. In 1922 Christiansen was active again in the merchant marine, as ship's captain. He continued in this pursuit until 1929, when he was employed as a pilot by the Claude Dornier Company. While with Dornier, he flew what was at the time the largest seaplane in the world, the [[Dornier Do X]] on its maiden Atlantic flight to New York in 1930.<ref name=AL93>Franks et al., p. 93.</ref> \nChristiansen's distinguished career led him eventually to being called to a post in the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]] (RLM/Reich Aviation Ministry) from 1933 to 1937, and in 1936 he was promoted to ''Generalmajor''. On 15 April 1937 he was appointed ''Korpsf\u00fchrer'' of the [[National Socialist Flyers Corps]], or ''NSFK''.<ref name=AL93/> He was also promoted to ''Generalleutnant''. On 1 January 1939 he was named ''[[General der Flieger]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Service during World War II==\n\nFrom 29 May 1940 until 7 April 1945 Christiansen was ''[[Wehrmachtbefehlshaber]] in den Niederlanden'' (Supreme Commander of the ''Wehrmacht'' in the Netherlands), and until 26 June 1943 was concurrently still Korpsf\u00fchrer of the NSFK.

He was convicted for [[war crimes]] after the war. During [[World War I]], he was a [[flying ace]] who claimed shooting down twenty planes and an [[airship]]; he was credited with thirteen{{sfn|Guttman|2003|p=19}} of those claims.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Wyk auf F\u00f6hr]], [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]], into an old seafaring family, the son of a sea captain. The generations-long seafaring tradition within his family charted an obvious course for his future. In 1895 he joined the merchant marine, serving for 7 years{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and volunteering in 1901 for MTBs.<ref name=AL92>Franks et al., p. 92.</ref> After one year, he returned to the merchant marine, serving several years aboard the 5-masted ''[[Preussen (ship)|Preussen]]'' (at the time, the largest sailing ship in the world,) as Second Officer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In 1913 he decided to deviate from this career, and learned to fly. Having graduated and gaining licence No. 707, he became a flying instructor at a civilian flying school.<ref name=AL92/>\n\n==Service during World War I==\n[[File:Friedrichchristiansen.jpg|thumb|left|Christiansen in 1918]]\nIn August 1914, Christiansen was called up and posted to [[Zeebrugge]] as naval aviator. He flew [[Hansa-Brandenburg W.12]] seaplanes over the North Sea, the English Channel, and Britain. For his bombing missions on [[Dover]] and [[Ramsgate]], he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class. From 1915 to 1916 Christiansen went on numerous reconnaissance and bombing missions, helping to make his unit at [[Zeebrugge]] one of the most successful in the [[Marineflieger|German Naval Air Service]]. On 27 April 1916, as ''Leutnant der Matrosen Artillerie'' (Lieutenant of Naval Artillery,) Christiansen was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class and Knights Cross with Swords of the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]].<ref name=AL92/>\n\nChristiansen claimed his first air-to-air victory 15 May 1917 by shooting down a [[Sopwith Pup]] off Dover. On 1 September 1917 he took command of Naval Air Station at Zeebrugge, and being promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'', shot down a [[Felixstowe Porte Baby|Porte FB2 Baby]] off Felixstowe the same day. On 11 December 1917 he shot down the non-rigid [[Coastal class blimp|coastal class]] airship ''C-27'', Cdr. Flight Lieutenant John Francis Dixon, [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]], near the Belgian coast.<ref>Franks et al., pp. 92\u201393.</ref>\n\nChristiansen continued to carry out reconnaissance, rescue, and bombing missions, such that by December 1917, he had completed 440 missions,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} including shooting down Airship C27. At this time he was also awarded the [[Pour le M\u00e9rite|Pour le M\u00e9rite (\"Blue Max\")]], the first of only three given to naval aviators and the only one to a seaplane pilot.<ref>O'Connor, p. 50.</ref> He was promoted to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' in 1918.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOn 15 February 1918 Christiansen shot down a [[Curtiss Model H|Curtiss H12B flying boat]] off Felixstowe, followed by 2 more on 24 April and 25 April. In June he claimed three more [[Felixstowe F.2|Felixstowe F2As]]. On 6 July he surprised and damaged British submarine {{HMS|C25}} in the Thames estuary, killing its captain and five crewmen (the submarine reached harbour). By 11 November 1918 he raised his personal tally to 13,<ref>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/christiansen.php The Aerodrome forum]</ref> as well as some shared victories, which cumulatively may have brought his total to 21.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://archive.org/details/influenceofairpo0000boyn | url-access= registration |title=The Influence of Air Power upon History |first=Walter J. |last=Boyne |year=2003 |publisher=Pelican Publishing |isbn=978-1-58980-034-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/influenceofairpo0000boyn/page/72 72]| quote=Christiansen, who had 21 victories... and sank a British submarine.}}</ref>\n\n==Activity between wars==\nFollowing the German Revolution of late 1918, Christiansen was a member of the 3rd Marinebrigade commanded by Wilfried von Loewenfeld. In 1922 Christiansen was active again in the merchant marine, as ship's captain. He continued in this pursuit until 1929, when he was employed as a pilot by the Claude Dornier Company. While with Dornier, he flew what was at the time the largest seaplane in the world, the [[Dornier Do X]] on its maiden Atlantic flight to New York in 1930.<ref name=AL93>Franks et al., p. 93.</ref> \nChristiansen's distinguished career led him eventually to being called to a post in the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]] (RLM/Reich Aviation Ministry) from 1933 to 1937, and in 1936 he was promoted to ''Generalmajor''. On 15 April 1937 he was appointed ''Korpsf\u00fchrer'' of the [[National Socialist Flyers Corps]], or ''NSFK''.<ref name=AL93/> He was also promoted to ''Generalleutnant''. On 1 January 1939 he was named ''[[General der Flieger]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Service during World War II==\n\nFrom 29 May 1940 until 7 April 1945 Christiansen was ''Wehrmachtbefehlshaber in den Niederlanden'' (Supreme Commander of the ''Wehrmacht'' in the Netherlands), and until 26 June 1943 was concurrently still Korpsf\u00fchrer of the NSFK. In addition, from 10 November 1944 until 28 January 1945 supreme commander of the [[25th Army (Wehrmacht)|25th Army]].\nChristiansen also was responsible for the food embargo in winter 1944, causing famine in western Holland resulting in the death of 22000 civilian men, women and children.\n\nAfter the war Christiansen was arrested for [[war crime]]s. On 2 October 1944 he had ordered a [[Putten raid|raid on the village of Putten]] in [[Gelderland]], the Netherlands, in retaliation, after one of his officers, a ''Leutnant'' Sommers, was killed there by the Dutch resistance. When he heard about the actions of the resistance near Putten, Christiansen is reported to have said, \"''Das ganze Nest muss angesteckt werden und die ganze Bande an die Wand gestellt!''\" (\"Put them all against the wall and burn the place down!\") In compliance with this retributive sentiment, several members of the civilian population were shot, the village was burned, and 661 of the males of the town were deported to labor camps, the vast majority of whom never returned.\n\nChristiansen was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in 1948 in [[Arnhem]] for war crimes but was released in December 1951. He died in [[Aukrug]] in 1972.\n\nHis release from imprisonment in 1951 was an occasion for his native town, Wyk auf F\u00f6hr, to renew Christiansen's honorary citizenship and reinstate a street name in his honor, previously changed by the British military administration in 1945.

The former involves the peripheral nerves and the lower parts of the spinal cord, whereas the latter involves the [[limbic system]] of the [[Human brain|brain]]. In both cases, an intact neural system is required for a successful and complete erection. Stimulation of the penile shaft by the [[nervous system]] leads to the secretion of [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which causes the relaxation of the smooth muscles of the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] (the main erectile tissue of the penis), and subsequently penile erection.  Additionally, adequate levels of [[testosterone]] (produced by the [[testes]]) and an intact [[pituitary gland]] are required for the development of a healthy erectile system. As can be understood from the mechanisms of a normal erection, impotence may develop due to hormonal deficiency, disorders of the neural system, lack of adequate penile blood supply or psychological problems.<ref>{{cite book | author1 = Rany Shamloul | author2 = Anthony J Bella | title = Erectile Dysfunction | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=elg-AwAAQBAJ&pg=PR6 | date = 2014-03-01 | publisher = Biota Publishing | isbn = 978-1-61504-653-9 | pages = 6\u2013 }}</ref> [[Spinal cord injury]] causes [[Sexuality after spinal cord injury|sexual dysfunction]], including ED.

Most cases of ED of organic causes are related to changes in blood flow in the corpora cavernosa, represented by occlusive artery disease, most often of atherosclerotic origin, or due to failure of the veno-occlusive mechanism. Preceding the ultrasound examination with Doppler, the penis should be examined in B mode, in order to identify possible tumors, fibrotic plaques, calcifications, or hematomas, as well as to evaluate the appearance of the cavernous arteries, which can be tortuous or atheromatous.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\">Originally copied from:<br>{{cite journal|last1=Fernandes|first1=Mait\u00ea Aline Vieira|last2=Souza|first2=Luis Ronan Marquez Ferreira de|last3=Cartafina|first3=Luciano Pousa|title=Ultrasound evaluation of the penis|journal=Radiologia Brasileira|volume=51|issue=4|year=2018|pages=257\u2013261|issn=1678-7099|doi=10.1590/0100-3984.2016.0152|pmid=30202130|pmc=6124582}}<br>[[Creative Commons|CC-BY]] license</ref>\n\nErection can be induced by injecting 10-20&nbsp;\u00b5g of prostaglandin E1, with evaluations of the arterial flow every five minutes for 25-30 min (see image). The use of prostaglandin E1 is contraindicated in patients with a predisposition to priapism (e.g., those with sickle cell anemia), as well as in those with an anatomical deformity of the penis or a penile implant. Phentolamine (2&nbsp;mg) is often added. Visual and tactile stimulation produces better results. Some authors recommend the use of sildenafil by mouth to replace the injectable drugs in cases of contraindications, although the efficacy of such medication is controversial.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\"/>\n\nPrior to the injection of the chosen drug, the flow pattern is monophasic, with low systolic velocities and an absence of diastolic flow. After injection, it is expected that systolic and diastolic peak velocities will increase, decreasing progressively with vein occlusion and becoming negative when the penis becomes rigid (see image below). The reference values vary across studies, ranging from > 25&nbsp;cm/s to > 35&nbsp;cm/s. Values above 35&nbsp;cm/s indicate the absence of arterial disease, values below 25&nbsp;cm/s indicate arterial insufficiency, and values of 25\u201335&nbsp;cm/s are indeterminate because they are less specific (see image below). The data obtained should be correlated with the degree of erection observed. If the peak systolic velocities are normal, the final diastolic velocities should be evaluated, those above 5&nbsp;cm/s being associated with venogenic ED.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Doppler ultrasonography of cavernous artery flow in flaccid and erected state.jpg|Graphs representing the color Doppler spectrum of the flow pattern of the cavernous arteries during the erection phases.

The physician squeezes the glans (head) of the penis, which immediately causes the anus to contract if nerve function is normal. A physician measures the latency between squeeze and contraction by observing the anal sphincter or by feeling it with a gloved finger inserted past the anus.\n\n;Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT):It is normal for a man to have five to six erections during sleep, especially during [[REM sleep|rapid eye movement (REM)]]. Their absence may indicate a problem with nerve function or blood supply in the penis. There are two methods for measuring changes in penile rigidity and circumference during nocturnal erection: snap gauge and strain gauge. A significant proportion of men who have no sexual dysfunction nonetheless do not have regular nocturnal erections.\n\n;Penile biothesiometry:This test uses electromagnetic vibration to evaluate sensitivity and nerve function in the glans and shaft of the penis.\n\n;Dynamic infusion cavernosometry (DICC): technique in which fluid is pumped into the penis at a known rate and pressure. It gives a measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum during an erection.\n\n;Corpus cavernosometry:[[#Corpus Cavernosometry|Cavernosography]] measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum.  Saline is infused under pressure into the corpus cavernosum with a butterfly needle, and the flow rate needed to maintain an erection indicates the degree of venous leakage.

In both cases, an intact neural system is required for a successful and complete erection. Stimulation of the penile shaft by the [[nervous system]] leads to the secretion of [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which causes the relaxation of the smooth muscles of the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] (the main erectile tissue of the penis), and subsequently penile erection.  Additionally, adequate levels of [[testosterone]] (produced by the [[testes]]) and an intact [[pituitary gland]] are required for the development of a healthy erectile system. As can be understood from the mechanisms of a normal erection, impotence may develop due to hormonal deficiency, disorders of the neural system, lack of adequate penile blood supply or psychological problems.<ref>{{cite book | author1 = Rany Shamloul | author2 = Anthony J Bella | title = Erectile Dysfunction | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=elg-AwAAQBAJ&pg=PR6 | date = 2014-03-01 | publisher = Biota Publishing | isbn = 978-1-61504-653-9 | pages = 6\u2013 }}</ref> [[Spinal cord injury]] causes [[Sexuality after spinal cord injury|sexual dysfunction]], including ED.

Most cases of ED of organic causes are related to changes in blood flow in the corpora cavernosa, represented by occlusive artery disease, most often of atherosclerotic origin, or due to failure of the veno-occlusive mechanism. Preceding the ultrasound examination with Doppler, the penis should be examined in B mode, in order to identify possible tumors, fibrotic plaques, calcifications, or hematomas, as well as to evaluate the appearance of the cavernous arteries, which can be tortuous or atheromatous.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\">Originally copied from:<br>{{cite journal|last1=Fernandes|first1=Mait\u00ea Aline Vieira|last2=Souza|first2=Luis Ronan Marquez Ferreira de|last3=Cartafina|first3=Luciano Pousa|title=Ultrasound evaluation of the penis|journal=Radiologia Brasileira|volume=51|issue=4|year=2018|pages=257\u2013261|issn=1678-7099|doi=10.1590/0100-3984.2016.0152|pmid=30202130|pmc=6124582}}<br>[[Creative Commons|CC-BY]] license</ref>\n\nErection can be induced by injecting 10-20&nbsp;\u00b5g of prostaglandin E1, with evaluations of the arterial flow every five minutes for 25-30 min (see image). The use of prostaglandin E1 is contraindicated in patients with a predisposition to priapism (e.g., those with sickle cell anemia), as well as in those with an anatomical deformity of the penis or a penile implant. Phentolamine (2&nbsp;mg) is often added. Visual and tactile stimulation produces better results. Some authors recommend the use of sildenafil by mouth to replace the injectable drugs in cases of contraindications, although the efficacy of such medication is controversial.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\"/>\n\nPrior to the injection of the chosen drug, the flow pattern is monophasic, with low systolic velocities and an absence of diastolic flow. After injection, it is expected that systolic and diastolic peak velocities will increase, decreasing progressively with vein occlusion and becoming negative when the penis becomes rigid (see image below). The reference values vary across studies, ranging from > 25&nbsp;cm/s to > 35&nbsp;cm/s. Values above 35&nbsp;cm/s indicate the absence of arterial disease, values below 25&nbsp;cm/s indicate arterial insufficiency, and values of 25\u201335&nbsp;cm/s are indeterminate because they are less specific (see image below). The data obtained should be correlated with the degree of erection observed.

The physician squeezes the glans (head) of the penis, which immediately causes the anus to contract if nerve function is normal. A physician measures the latency between squeeze and contraction by observing the anal sphincter or by feeling it with a gloved finger inserted past the anus.\n\n;Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT):It is normal for a man to have five to six erections during sleep, especially during [[REM sleep|rapid eye movement (REM)]]. Their absence may indicate a problem with nerve function or blood supply in the penis. There are two methods for measuring changes in penile rigidity and circumference during nocturnal erection: snap gauge and strain gauge. A significant proportion of men who have no sexual dysfunction nonetheless do not have regular nocturnal erections.\n\n;Penile biothesiometry:This test uses electromagnetic vibration to evaluate sensitivity and nerve function in the glans and shaft of the penis.\n\n;Dynamic infusion cavernosometry (DICC): technique in which fluid is pumped into the penis at a known rate and pressure. It gives a measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum during an erection.\n\n;Corpus cavernosometry:[[#Corpus Cavernosometry|Cavernosography]] measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum.  Saline is infused under pressure into the corpus cavernosum with a butterfly needle, and the flow rate needed to maintain an erection indicates the degree of venous leakage.

In 1896, Loyola College was established at the corner of [[Bleury Street]] and [[Saint Catherine Street]]. Loyola College was named in honour of [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus]]. On March 10, 1898, the institution was incorporated by the Government of Quebec and became a full-fledged college. The same year, following a fire, the college was relocated, further west on [[Drummond Street, Montreal|Drummond Street]], south of Saint Catherine. Although founded as a ''coll\u00e8ge classique'' (the forerunners of Quebec's [[College education in Quebec|college system]]), Loyola began granting university degrees through [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] in 1903.\n\nThe college moved into the present west-end campus on [[Sherbrooke Street|Sherbrooke Street West]] in [[Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce]] in 1916. The School of [[Sociology]] opened in 1918. Because Loyola College never became a chartered university, it did not have the ability to grant its own university degrees. In 1920, the institution became affiliated with the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]], which began granting its degrees instead of Universit\u00e9 Laval.\n\nMemorial bronze honour roll plaques in the entrance hall near the administrative offices are dedicated to those from Loyola College who fought in the First World War, Second World War and Korean War.<ref>[http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=6619 Memorial bronze honour roll plaques] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021152216/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=6619 |date=October 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe inter-war period was marked by the shift of education in the institution, the \"coll\u00e8ge classique\" education was replaced by [[humanistic education]] ([[Liberal Arts College]]) in 1940, and Loyola became a four-year institution. [[Theology]] and [[philosophy]] were taught to all students until 1972.\n\nIn 1940, the Faculty of Science and the Department of Engineering, which became a faculty in 1964, were created. In addition to providing the same undergraduate programs as other colleges, the institution also offered innovative fields of study at the time, such as [[exercise science]] and [[communication studies]]. Students could enrol in [[academic majors]] starting in 1953 and [[Honours degree|honours programs]] in 1958. Students graduating from Loyola could afterwards pursue [[Graduate school|graduate-level]] education in other universities, with a few earning [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s.\n\nStarting in 1958, Loyola also began offering its first evening courses for students not being able to go to school full-time. New courses were given in [[library science]] and [[faith community nursing]]. Since its creation, Loyola College had welcomed almost exclusively young English-speaking Catholic men as students. It became [[co-ed]] in 1959 and became less homogeneous with the ever-increasing number of foreign students.\n\nObtaining a university charter was an important issue in the 1960s. Although many wanted Loyola College to become Loyola University, the Quebec government preferred to annex it to Sir George Williams University. Negotiations began in 1968 and ended with the creation of Concordia University on August 24, 1974.\n\n===Sir George Williams University===\n{{main|Sir George Williams University}}\n[[File:Sir george william 1970.jpg|thumb|right|Sir George Williams University's [[Henry F.

Helene Street in Old Montreal.<ref>[http://www.ymcaquebec.org/en/centre/overview/downtown-y-centre/1/ YMCA History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202051006/http://www.ymcaquebec.org/en/centre/overview/downtown-y-centre/1/ |date=February 2, 2013 }} YMCA International.</ref> Beginning in 1873, the YMCA offered evening classes to allow working people in the [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking community]] to pursue their education while working during the day. Sixty years later, the Montreal YMCA relocated to its current location on [[Stanley Street (Montreal)|Stanley Street]] in [[Downtown Montreal]]. In 1926, the education program at the YMCA was re-organized as Sir George Williams College, named after [[George Williams (YMCA)|George Williams]], founder of the original YMCA in [[London]], upon which the Montreal YMCA was based. In 1934, Sir George Williams College offered the first undergraduate credit course in adult education in Canada.\n\nSir George Williams College received its university charter from the provincial government in 1948, though it remained the education arm of the Montreal YMCA. SGWU expanded into its first standalone building, the Norris Building, in 1956. In 1959, the college requested that the Quebec legislature amend its university charter, changing its name to Sir George Williams University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/archives/stories/sgw.html|title=Sir George Williams University History|website=concordia.ca|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref> It established a Centre for Human Relations and Community Studies in 1963. Sir George Williams continued to hold classes in the YMCA building until the construction of the [[Henry F. Hall Building]] in 1966.\n\nThe university gained international attention in 1969 when a group of students occupied and destroyed the Hall Building's ninth floor computer lab (see [[Sir George Williams Affair]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/archives/stories/computer-centre-incident.html|title=Computer Centre Incident|website=Concordia University|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nFollowing several years of discussions and planning, Sir George Williams University merged with Loyola College to create Concordia University in 1974. Concordia provided students with representative student organizations and greater power over administrative decisions at the university.\n\n===Merger===\nIn 1968, in the wake of the Parent Commission Report, which recommended the [[secularism|secularization]] of Quebec's educational system, the Quebec government asked Loyola College and Sir George Williams University to consider some form of union. The proposed merger was discussed by the Loyola-Sir George Williams Joint Steering Committee, a committee created to analyze all forms of possible mergers of the two institutions.<ref name=\"CUmerger\">{{cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/offices/archives/stories/merger.html|title=Merger of Loyola College and Sir George Williams University|publisher=Concordia University|accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref> It was proposed, in 1969, to create a university federation that allowed students to take courses at both campuses without paying additional fees. There was also mention of a [[shuttle bus service]] linking the remote facilities {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}} apart.<ref name=CUmerger />\n\nCriticized for the difficulties encountered by the cohesion of the various departments and faculties, this option was set aside, but not totally rejected by the Joint Steering Committee. The Joint Committee of Representatives of the Board of Trustees of Loyola College and the Board of Governors of Sir George Williams University was formed in December 1971 and in fall 1972 produced a document outlining the basis of a university with two campuses.<ref name=CUmerger /> While the committee considered a number of possible models, including that of a loose federation, the solution finally adopted was that of an integrated institution, Concordia University, operating under the existing charter of Sir George Williams University. Following several revisions in November 1972, the document became the main plan of the proposed merger. It was accepted by both institutions, which began the process of consolidating their operations.<ref name=CUmerger />\n\nIn early 1973, the two institutions announced the merger would take place that fall. However, legal and administrative procedures delayed the merger for another year.<ref name=CUmerger /> On August 24, 1974, the Government of Quebec recognized the merger, thus creating Concordia University.

The integration of the various faculties of the two institutions into a coherent whole took several years. The five faculties of the new university were a combination of existing faculties and departments prior to the merger. There was a Faculty of Commerce, a Faculty of Science and Faculty of Arts at Sir George Williams University. Additionally, there was a Faculty of Arts and Science from Loyola College. The Faculty of Engineering of both institutions had previously been combined.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/concordia-university|title=Concordia University|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Faculty of Fine Arts was created in 1976.\n\nThe first phase of combination of the Faculties of Arts and Science began in 1977 and ended in 1985.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Georges P. Vanier Library on the Loyola Campus was enlarged, while in 1992, the library on Sir George Williams Campus moved to the new J.W. McConnell Building. The Norris Building was closed the same year.\n\nOn August 24, 1992, [[Valery Fabrikant]], a mechanical engineering professor, [[Concordia University massacre|shot five colleagues]], killing four, on the ninth floor of the Hall Building. Fabrikant was convicted of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. The university erected a memorial to the slain professors (four granite tables) in the Hall Building lobby.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/archives/stories/memorial.html|title=Memorial in Hall Building Lobby|website=concordia.ca|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1998, the university entered a major phase of expansion to meet its growing student enrolment. In August 2003, Concordia inaugurated the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex on Loyola Campus.\n\nIn 2005, the university launched a major urban redevelopment project in the neighbourhood surrounding Sir George Williams Campus known as the Quartier Concordia. That same year, the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex opened its doors on [[Saint Catherine Street|Saint Catherine Street West]] between [[Guy Street]] and [[Mackay Street]].\n\nIn September 2009, the university marked the opening of the new building for the John Molson School of Business.\n\nIn September 2015, the university held a ribbon cutting for the [[District 3 Innovation Centre|District 3 Innovation Center]]'s new space on the sixth floor of Concordia's Faubourg Building.<ref name=\"District 3 receives $1M\">{{cite web\n|url = https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/offices/vpaer/aar/2015/09/28/district-3-receives-1million-startup-gift.html|title = District 3 receives $1M startup gift, christens new collaborative space|publisher = Concordia University|accessdate = September 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n[[File:Loyola concordia.jpg|thumb|220px|Concordia's Loyola Campus in the fall.]]\n[[Image:Concordia University.jpg|thumb|220px|The Henry F.

The large property will house the faculty of Fine Arts and possibly the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, and other departments. Concordia Residence Life currently houses nearly 250 students each year in the Grey Nuns Building. The dorm rooms are among the largest in the country, as many of the rooms have been transformed from when the section of the Grey Nuns Building was occupied by the Grey Nuns.

The [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Quebec Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports]], [[Jean-Marc Fournier]], on October 30, 2006, announced an investment of $60 million towards the construction of the new building. The minister made the announcement during a ceremony at Concordia. The government's $60 million represents about half of the total construction costs. Construction started on January 22, 2006, and the building was completed and opened in September 2009. The 15-story building now houses the JMSB's 6,000 full and part-time students under the same roof for the very first time. The departments of contemporary dance, theatre and music also moved into the new JMSB Building.

In 1896, Loyola College was established at the corner of [[Bleury Street]] and [[Saint Catherine Street]]. Loyola College was named in honour of [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus]]. On March 10, 1898, the institution was incorporated by the Government of Quebec and became a full-fledged college. The same year, following a fire, the college was relocated, further west on [[Drummond Street, Montreal|Drummond Street]], south of Saint Catherine. Although founded as a ''coll\u00e8ge classique'' (the forerunners of Quebec's [[College education in Quebec|college system]]), Loyola began granting university degrees through [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] in 1903.\n\nThe college moved into the present west-end campus on [[Sherbrooke Street|Sherbrooke Street West]] in [[Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce]] in 1916. The School of [[Sociology]] opened in 1918. Because Loyola College never became a chartered university, it did not have the ability to grant its own university degrees. In 1920, the institution became affiliated with the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]], which began granting its degrees instead of Universit\u00e9 Laval.\n\nMemorial bronze honour roll plaques in the entrance hall near the administrative offices are dedicated to those from Loyola College who fought in the First World War, Second World War and Korean War.<ref>[http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=6619 Memorial bronze honour roll plaques] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021152216/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=6619 |date=October 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe inter-war period was marked by the shift of education in the institution, the \"coll\u00e8ge classique\" education was replaced by [[humanistic education]] ([[Liberal Arts College]]) in 1940, and Loyola became a four-year institution. [[Theology]] and [[philosophy]] were taught to all students until 1972.\n\nIn 1940, the Faculty of Science and the Department of Engineering, which became a faculty in 1964, were created. In addition to providing the same undergraduate programs as other colleges, the institution also offered innovative fields of study at the time, such as [[exercise science]] and [[communication studies]]. Students could enrol in [[academic majors]] starting in 1953 and [[Honours degree|honours programs]] in 1958. Students graduating from Loyola could afterwards pursue [[Graduate school|graduate-level]] education in other universities, with a few earning [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s.\n\nStarting in 1958, Loyola also began offering its first evening courses for students not being able to go to school full-time. New courses were given in [[library science]] and [[faith community nursing]]. Since its creation, Loyola College had welcomed almost exclusively young English-speaking Catholic men as students. It became [[co-ed]] in 1959 and became less homogeneous with the ever-increasing number of foreign students.\n\nObtaining a university charter was an important issue in the 1960s. Although many wanted Loyola College to become Loyola University, the Quebec government preferred to annex it to Sir George Williams University. Negotiations began in 1968 and ended with the creation of Concordia University on August 24, 1974.\n\n===Sir George Williams University===\n{{main|Sir George Williams University}}\n[[File:Sir george william 1970.jpg|thumb|right|Sir George Williams University's [[Henry F.

Helene Street in Old Montreal.<ref>[http://www.ymcaquebec.org/en/centre/overview/downtown-y-centre/1/ YMCA History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202051006/http://www.ymcaquebec.org/en/centre/overview/downtown-y-centre/1/ |date=February 2, 2013 }} YMCA International.</ref> Beginning in 1873, the YMCA offered evening classes to allow working people in the [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking community]] to pursue their education while working during the day. Sixty years later, the Montreal YMCA relocated to its current location on [[Stanley Street (Montreal)|Stanley Street]] in [[Downtown Montreal]]. In 1926, the education program at the YMCA was re-organized as Sir George Williams College, named after [[George Williams (YMCA)|George Williams]], founder of the original YMCA in [[London]], upon which the Montreal YMCA was based. In 1934, Sir George Williams College offered the first undergraduate credit course in adult education in Canada.\n\nSir George Williams College received its university charter from the provincial government in 1948, though it remained the education arm of the Montreal YMCA. SGWU expanded into its first standalone building, the Norris Building, in 1956. In 1959, the college requested that the Quebec legislature amend its university charter, changing its name to Sir George Williams University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/archives/stories/sgw.html|title=Sir George Williams University History|website=concordia.ca|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref> It established a Centre for Human Relations and Community Studies in 1963. Sir George Williams continued to hold classes in the YMCA building until the construction of the [[Henry F. Hall Building]] in 1966.\n\nThe university gained international attention in 1969 when a group of students occupied and destroyed the Hall Building's ninth floor computer lab (see [[Sir George Williams Affair]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/archives/stories/computer-centre-incident.html|title=Computer Centre Incident|website=Concordia University|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nFollowing several years of discussions and planning, Sir George Williams University merged with Loyola College to create Concordia University in 1974. Concordia provided students with representative student organizations and greater power over administrative decisions at the university.\n\n===Merger===\nIn 1968, in the wake of the Parent Commission Report, which recommended the [[secularism|secularization]] of Quebec's educational system, the Quebec government asked Loyola College and Sir George Williams University to consider some form of union. The proposed merger was discussed by the Loyola-Sir George Williams Joint Steering Committee, a committee created to analyze all forms of possible mergers of the two institutions.<ref name=\"CUmerger\">{{cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/offices/archives/stories/merger.html|title=Merger of Loyola College and Sir George Williams University|publisher=Concordia University|accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref> It was proposed, in 1969, to create a university federation that allowed students to take courses at both campuses without paying additional fees. There was also mention of a [[shuttle bus service]] linking the remote facilities {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}} apart.<ref name=CUmerger />\n\nCriticized for the difficulties encountered by the cohesion of the various departments and faculties, this option was set aside, but not totally rejected by the Joint Steering Committee. The Joint Committee of Representatives of the Board of Trustees of Loyola College and the Board of Governors of Sir George Williams University was formed in December 1971 and in fall 1972 produced a document outlining the basis of a university with two campuses.<ref name=CUmerger /> While the committee considered a number of possible models, including that of a loose federation, the solution finally adopted was that of an integrated institution, Concordia University, operating under the existing charter of Sir George Williams University. Following several revisions in November 1972, the document became the main plan of the proposed merger. It was accepted by both institutions, which began the process of consolidating their operations.<ref name=CUmerger />\n\nIn early 1973, the two institutions announced the merger would take place that fall. However, legal and administrative procedures delayed the merger for another year.<ref name=CUmerger /> On August 24, 1974, the Government of Quebec recognized the merger, thus creating Concordia University. The name was taken from the motto of the city of Montreal, ''Concordia salus'' (meaning \"well-being through harmony\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/history.html|title=Concordia University History|website=Concordia University|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"When you join together two lively institutions, each with its own philosophies and ways of doing things, each firmly dedicated to freedom of thought and speech, you must expect a measure of friction.

The integration of the various faculties of the two institutions into a coherent whole took several years. The five faculties of the new university were a combination of existing faculties and departments prior to the merger. There was a Faculty of Commerce, a Faculty of Science and Faculty of Arts at Sir George Williams University. Additionally, there was a Faculty of Arts and Science from Loyola College. The Faculty of Engineering of both institutions had previously been combined.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/concordia-university|title=Concordia University|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Faculty of Fine Arts was created in 1976.\n\nThe first phase of combination of the Faculties of Arts and Science began in 1977 and ended in 1985.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Georges P. Vanier Library on the Loyola Campus was enlarged, while in 1992, the library on Sir George Williams Campus moved to the new J.W. McConnell Building. The Norris Building was closed the same year.\n\nOn August 24, 1992, [[Valery Fabrikant]], a mechanical engineering professor, [[Concordia University massacre|shot five colleagues]], killing four, on the ninth floor of the Hall Building. Fabrikant was convicted of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. The university erected a memorial to the slain professors (four granite tables) in the Hall Building lobby.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/archives/stories/memorial.html|title=Memorial in Hall Building Lobby|website=concordia.ca|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1998, the university entered a major phase of expansion to meet its growing student enrolment. In August 2003, Concordia inaugurated the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex on Loyola Campus.\n\nIn 2005, the university launched a major urban redevelopment project in the neighbourhood surrounding Sir George Williams Campus known as the Quartier Concordia. That same year, the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex opened its doors on [[Saint Catherine Street|Saint Catherine Street West]] between [[Guy Street]] and [[Mackay Street]].\n\nIn September 2009, the university marked the opening of the new building for the John Molson School of Business.\n\nIn September 2015, the university held a ribbon cutting for the [[District 3 Innovation Centre|District 3 Innovation Center]]'s new space on the sixth floor of Concordia's Faubourg Building.<ref name=\"District 3 receives $1M\">{{cite web\n|url = https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/offices/vpaer/aar/2015/09/28/district-3-receives-1million-startup-gift.html|title = District 3 receives $1M startup gift, christens new collaborative space|publisher = Concordia University|accessdate = September 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n[[File:Loyola concordia.jpg|thumb|220px|Concordia's Loyola Campus in the fall.]]\n[[Image:Concordia University.jpg|thumb|220px|The Henry F.

These other MRCs were formed by locals but agents from the Petrograd MRC were often in positions to give advice or direction.  By the end of October 1917, representatives from the Petrograd MRC were on assignments in at least forty-four cities as well as 113 military units throughout [[Russia]], [[Turkestan]], and [[the Caucasus]].<ref>Rigby, pp. 42-43</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Revolutionary Military Council]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Albert Resis|Resis, Albert]] (July 1977).

The album was primarily composed of recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs \"On the Way Home\" and \"I Am a Child\", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.

Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group \u2013 winners of the 1969 \"Best New Artist\" [[Grammy Award]] \u2013 was renamed [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=313}} The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous [[Woodstock Festival]], during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: \"One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=318\u2013320}} During the making of their first album, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he \"wanted to play folk music in a rock band.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=324}} Despite the tension, Young's tenure with CSN&Y coincided with the band's most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.\n\nYoung wrote \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\" following the [[Kent State massacre]] on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSN&Y and immediately released as a single, even though CSN&Y's \"Teach Your Children\" was still climbing the singles charts.\n\n===''After the Gold Rush'', acoustic tour and ''Harvest'' (1970\u20131972)===\nLater in the year, Young released his third solo album, ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, [[Nils Lofgren]], [[Stephen Stills]], and CSNY bassist [[Greg Reeves]]. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than ''Everybody Knows This is Nowhere'', with a wider range of sounds. Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including \"[[Tell Me Why (Neil Young song)|Tell Me Why]]\" and \"[[Don't Let It Bring You Down]]\", the country-influenced singles \"[[Only Love Can Break Your Heart]]\" and \"[[When You Dance I Can Really Love]]\", and the title track, \"[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]\", played on piano, with dream-like lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]]. Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]].\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man [[Ronnie Van Zant]] was later photographed wearing a ''Tonight's the Night'' T-shirt [[Street Survivors|on the cover of an album]].\n\n[[File:Neil Young-early promo.jpg|thumb|Young in the 1970s]]\nIn the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like \"Journey through the Past\", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like \"See the Sky About to Rain\", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young's tour, now entitled \"Journey Through the Past\", continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto's [[Massey Hall]], which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young's Archive series.\n\nNear the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash]]'' TV show. \"[[The Needle and the Damage Done]]\", a somber lament on the pain caused by [[heroin addiction]], had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member [[Danny Whitten]], who eventually died while battling his drug problems.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=279}} While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of [[Quadrafonic Sound Studios]] owner [[Elliot Mazer]] to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute.

The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album's live acoustic performance of \"Needle and the Damage Done.\"\n\nAfter his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California (\"Broken Arrow Ranch\", where he lived until his divorce in 2014.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-neil-youngs-nature-themed-opus-20160705|title=Inside Neil Young's Nature-Themed Opus|website=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>). He wrote the song \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" in honor of the land's longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song \"[[A Man Needs a Maid (song)|A Man Needs a Maid]]\" was inspired by his relationship with actress [[Carrie Snodgress]]. \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" was released as the first single from ''Harvest'', the only No.&nbsp;1 hit in his career. \"Old Man\" was also popular.\n\nThe album's recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'' (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described \"Heart of Gold\" as the song that \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\"\n\n===The \"Ditch\" Trilogy and personal struggles (1972\u20131974)===\nAlthough a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of ''Harvest'', it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]/[[diazepam]] overdose. Young described the incident to ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]] in 1975:<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview|title=Neil Young: The RS Interview|magazine=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> \"[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd OD'd. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.\"\n\nOn the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]], a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the [[hard rock]] milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer [[Johnny Barbata]], while [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as \"[his] least favorite record\", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's [[Neil Young Archives#Official Release Series 05:|Official Release Series]]). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. ''Time Fades Away'', for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. ''Time'' was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the \"Ditch Trilogy\", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972).<ref name=\"UnCut\">{{cite news|last=Pinnock|first=Tom|title=Neil Young's 'Time Fades Away': 'Harvest's unlikely follow-up|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/neil-young/neil-young-s-time-fades-away-harvests-unlikely-follow-up-feature|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2010|issue=156}}</ref> These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time.\n\n[[File:Neil Young in Austin, 1976.jpg|thumb|Young in [[Austin, Texas]], on November 9, 1976]]\n\nIn the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by [[Nils Lofgren]] on guitar and piano and ''Harvest''/''Time Fades Away'' veteran [[Ben Keith]] on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and [[roadie]] [[Bruce Berry]], Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (June 20, 1975). The album's dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=430}} While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'' (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song \"See the Sky About to Rain\", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like ''Time Fades Away'', it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young's most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of ''On the Beach'' described the music as \"mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary\".<ref name=\"sven\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/a&e/soundfury904.htm |title=Neil Young \u2013 On the Beach (Reprise) |newspaper=The Santa Barbara Independent |date=March 18, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421143346/http://www.independent.com/a%26e/soundfury904.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter completing ''On the Beach'', Young reunited with ''Harvest'' producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, ''[[Homegrown (Neil Young album)|Homegrown]]''. Most of the songs were written after Young's break-up with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though ''Homegrown'' was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, ''Tonight's the Night'', at the suggestion of [[The Band|Band]] bassist [[Rick Danko]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Young further explained his move by saying: \"It was a little too personal ... it scared me\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Most of the songs from ''Homegrown'' were later incorporated into other Young albums, but the original album never surfaced. ''Tonight's the Night'' when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the \"ditch\" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=433}}\n\n===Reunions, retrospectives and ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1974\u20131979)===\nYoung reunited with [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour which was recorded and released in 2014 as [[CSNY 1974]]. It was one of the first ever stadium tours, and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=452}}\n\nIn 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with [[Frank Sampedro]] on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, ''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; \"[[Cortez the Killer]]\", a retelling of the [[Spanish conquest]] of Mexico from the viewpoint of the [[Aztec]]s, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. ''Zuma''{{'}}s closing track, \"Through My Sails\", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.\n\nIn 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (September 20, 1976), credited to [[The Stills-Young Band]]; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a [[telegram]] that read: \"Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way.

Performers on the record included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Emmylou Harris]] and Young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Nicolette Larson]] along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'', a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.\n\n''[[Comes a Time]]'' (October 2, 1978), Young's first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, also featured Larson and Crazy Horse.  The album became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time and marked a return to his folk roots, including a cover of [[Ian Tyson]]'s \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada.  Another of the album's songs, \"[[Lotta Love]]\", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979.  In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young's film ''[[Human Highway]]'', which took its name from a song featured on ''Comes a Time''. Over four years, Young would spend [[United States dollar|$]]3,000,000 of his own money on production (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000000|1978}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the post-punk band [[Devo]], whose members appeared in the film.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=575\u2013577}}\n\nYoung set out in 1978 on the lengthy \"Rust Never Sleeps\" tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the punk rock [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1970s and, provided a stark contrast from Young's previous, folk-inspired album ''Comes a Time''.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=529\u2013537}} Two new songs, the acoustic \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\" and electric \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" were the centerpiece of the new material. Young had collaborated with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]] on a cacophonous version of Hey Hey, My My at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The album has also widely been considered a precursor of grunge music and many grunge artists have said they were inspired by Young's distorted guitars on the B side to this album. Young also compared the rise of [[Johnny Rotten]] with that of the recently deceased \"King\" [[Elvis Presley]], who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an [[Pop icon|icon]]. Rotten returned the favour by playing one of Young's songs, \"Revolution Blues\" from ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'', on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Martin|title=DJ Johnny Rotten plays music from his own record collection on the radio, 1977|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/dj_johnny_rotten_plays_music_from_his_own_record_collection_on_the_radio_19|website=Dangerousminds.net|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nYoung's two accompanying albums ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (July 2, 1979; new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and ''[[Live Rust]]'' (November 19, 1979) (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B.  A movie version of the concerts, also called ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\". Young worked with rock artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to create the poster art for the film, using the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Jawas]] as a theme. Young's work since ''Harvest'' (1972) had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of ''Rolling Stone'' voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rolling.htm#1979 |title=Albums Of The Year And End Of Year Critic Lists |publisher=Rocklist.net |accessdate=5 February 2020 }}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' named ''Rust Never Sleeps'' as the year's winner in the [[Pazz & Jop]] Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.

Young was backed by the Shocking Pinks for the supporting US tour. ''Trans'' (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head [[David Geffen]] for its lack of commercial appeal, and with ''Everybody's Rockin''{{'}} following only seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music \"unrepresentative\" of himself.<ref>{{cite book|title=A fiction of the past: the sixties in American history|last=Cavallo|first=Dominick|year=1999|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-21930-7|oclc=39981636|url=https://archive.org/details/fictionofpastsix00cava}}</ref> The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos \u2013 [[Tim Pope]] directed the videos for \"Wonderin'\" and \"Cry, Cry, Cry\".

Young's lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1982 country album ''[[Old Ways]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22521|pure_url=yes}}|title=Old Ways album review|website=allmusic|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> It was also the year when Young's third child was born, a girl named Amber Jean.

Young recorded 1986's ''[[Landing on Water]]'' without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, ''[[Life (1987 album)|Life]]'', which emerged in 1987.

The addition of a [[brass instruments|brass]] section provided a new [[jazz]]ier sound, and the title track of 1988's ''[[This Note's For You]]'' became Young's first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and [[Michael Jackson]], the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, \"What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?\" Despite this, the video was eventually named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|best video of the year]] by the network in 1989.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=24\u201332}} By comparison, the major music cable network of Young's home nation, [[Muchmusic]], ran the video immediately.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour.

The album's lyrics were often overtly political; \"Rockin' in the Free World\" deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President [[George H.W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young Lyrics Analysis: Rockin' in the Free World|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/fot/ritfw.htm|website=Thrasherswheat.org|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe use of heavy [[feedback]] and distortion on several ''Freedom'' tracks was reminiscent of the ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of [[grunge]].

A tribute album called ''[[The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young]]'' was released in 1989, featuring covers by alternative and grunge acts including [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Dinosaur Jr]], and the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]].\n\nYoung's 1990 album ''[[Ragged Glory]]'', recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his [[Northern California]] ranch, continued this distortion-heavy esthetic.

The title track was a minor hit and the record was well received by critics, winning the [[Juno Award for Album of the Year]] in 1994. Young also contributed to [[Randy Bachman]]'s nostalgic 1992 tune \"Prairie Town\", and garnered a 1993 [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award]] nomination for his song \"Philadelphia\", from the soundtrack of the [[Jonathan Demme]] movie [[Philadelphia (movie)|of the same name]]. An ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with [[Booker T. and the M.G.s]] for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with [[Blues Traveler]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Pearl Jam]] also on the bill.

While doing errands on a visit to his daughter, Young had seen a newspaper photo of wounded U.S. veterans on a transport plane to Germany, and noticing that the same paper devoted little actual coverage to the story, he was unable to get the image out of his head, realizing the suffering caused to families by the war had not truly registered to him and most Americans who were not directly affected by it. Young cried, and immediately got his guitar out and began to write multiple songs at once. Within a few days he had completed work and assembled a band.

That summer, [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] reunited for the supporting \"Freedom of Speech Tour '06\", in which they played Young's new protest songs alongside the group's older material, meeting with both enthusiasm and anger from different fans, some of whom were supportive of Bush politically.

They include:\n* 1953 [[Gibson Les Paul]] Goldtop. Nicknamed \"[[Old Black]]\", this is Young's primary electric guitar and is featured on ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) and other albums. Old Black got its name from an amateur paintjob applied to the originally gold body of the instrument, some time before Young acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini [[humbucker]] pick-up from a [[Gibson Firebird]] was installed in the lead/treble position. This pick-up, severely [[microphonic]], is considered a crucial component of Young's sound. A [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]] was installed as early as 1969, and can be heard during the opening of \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" from ''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]''. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Martin D-45]].

It was one of four instruments bought by Stephen Stills for himself and his bandmates in CSNY to celebrate their first full concert at the Greek Theater in 1969.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Martin D-28. Nicknamed \"Hank\" after its previous owner, [[Hank Williams]]. [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], had traded it for some shotguns; it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from [[Tut Taylor]]. Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and the song it inspired, \"This Old Guitar\", can be seen about 50 minutes into the film ''[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Vintage Martin D-18: Young used an old D-18 throughout his early days performing in coffee houses in Canada and on some early [[Buffalo Springfield]] work, before he received the D-45 from Stills.

Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar during his [[Buffalo Springfield]] days.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Gretsch White Falcon]]. Young purchased a late 1950s model near the end of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] era; in 1969 he bought a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stephen Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early 1970s period, and can be heard on tracks like \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\", \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", \"Alabama\", \"Words (Between the Lines of Age)\", and \"L.A.\". It was Young's primary electric guitar during the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) era, since Young's deteriorating back condition (eventually fixed with surgery) made playing the much heavier Les Paul difficult.<ref>David Simons, \"Recording Harvest: The Making of Neil Young's Classic 1972 Album.\" ''Acoustic Guitar'' 103 (July 2001): 38\u201340.</ref> This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps, a Fender Deluxe and either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) song \"Words\".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Gibson Flying V]], on the ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Fender Broadcaster]], on the ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1975) album and tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Guild M-20, seen in the film ''[[Neil Young Journeys]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Harmonicas===\nYoung plays Hohner Marine Band harmonicas and is often seen using a harmonica holder{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hohnerusa.com/index.php?6 |title=Hohner Musikinstrumente GmbH & Co.

The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on \"See the Sky About to Rain\". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an [[effects pedal]].

Young's involvement stemmed at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have [[cerebral palsy]] and his daughter, like Young himself, has [[epilepsy]].\n\nYoung was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1994 for his song \"Philadelphia\" from the film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''. Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song \"[[Streets of Philadelphia]]\" from the same film. In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that \"the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song\". That same night, [[Tom Hanks]], when accepting the Oscar for Best Actor, gave credit for his inspiration to Young's song.\n\nYoung has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an honorary doctorate of music from [[Lakehead University]] in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, in 1992, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from [[San Francisco State University]] in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School. In 2006, Young was given Manitoba's highest civilian honour when he was appointed to the [[Order of Manitoba]]. In 2009, he was appointed to Canada's second highest civilian order, the [[Order of Canada]].\n\n''Rolling Stone'' magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/neil-young-19691231|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> and in 2003, included five of his albums in its list of [[500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/|title=Greatest Albums of All Time &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Lists|magazine=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2000, Young was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"cwof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|title=Neil Young \u2013 2000 Inductee|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|accessdate=November 13, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604203513/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|archivedate=June 4, 2008}}</ref>\nIn 2006, when ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine compiled a \"Greatest Living Songwriters\" list, Young was ranked second behind [[Bob Dylan]]. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other's records.) He ranked thirty-ninth on ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock'' that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has \"avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young's peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.\"<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/>\n\nYoung's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as [[Blind Melon]], [[Phish]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Young is referred to as \"the Godfather of [[Grunge]]\" because of the influence he had on [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Eddie Vedder]] and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the [[experimental rock]] group [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]]. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favourably compared his singing voice to Young's. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (1970), and \"immediately fell in love\" with his work, calling it \"extraordinary\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/thomyorke/|title=BBC - Neil Young: Don't be denied. - Video - Thom Yorke|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Yorke later covered the title track in concert. [[Dave Matthews]] lists Young as one of his favourite songwriters and most important inspirations and covers his songs on occasion. The British indie band [[The Bluetones]] named their number one [[Expecting to Fly (album)|debut album]] after the song \"[[Expecting to Fly (song)|Expecting to Fly]]\" (written by Young when still with Buffalo Springfield) and have covered the song while touring. Young also inspired the singer-songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who covered \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" on the live album ''[[Familiar to Millions]]'' (2000).\n\nThe Australian rock group [[Powderfinger]] named themselves after Young's song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" from ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979). The members of the [[Constantines]] have occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jason Crock |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |title=Interviews: The Constantines |date=October 16, 2005 |website=Pitchfork.com |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105084641/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |archive-date=January 5, 2009}}</ref> While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008, during the Canadian leg of his tour, Bob Dylan visited Young's former home in River Heights, where Young spent his teenage years.

Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group \u2013 winners of the 1969 \"Best New Artist\" [[Grammy Award]] \u2013 was renamed [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=313}} The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous [[Woodstock Festival]], during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: \"One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=318\u2013320}} During the making of their first album, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he \"wanted to play folk music in a rock band.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=324}} Despite the tension, Young's tenure with CSN&Y coincided with the band's most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.\n\nYoung wrote \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\" following the [[Kent State massacre]] on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSN&Y and immediately released as a single, even though CSN&Y's \"Teach Your Children\" was still climbing the singles charts.\n\n===''After the Gold Rush'', acoustic tour and ''Harvest'' (1970\u20131972)===\nLater in the year, Young released his third solo album, ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, [[Nils Lofgren]], [[Stephen Stills]], and CSNY bassist [[Greg Reeves]]. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than ''Everybody Knows This is Nowhere'', with a wider range of sounds. Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including \"[[Tell Me Why (Neil Young song)|Tell Me Why]]\" and \"[[Don't Let It Bring You Down]]\", the country-influenced singles \"[[Only Love Can Break Your Heart]]\" and \"[[When You Dance I Can Really Love]]\", and the title track, \"[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]\", played on piano, with dream-like lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]]. Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]].\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man [[Ronnie Van Zant]] was later photographed wearing a ''Tonight's the Night'' T-shirt [[Street Survivors|on the cover of an album]].\n\n[[File:Neil Young-early promo.jpg|thumb|Young in the 1970s]]\nIn the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like \"Journey through the Past\", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like \"See the Sky About to Rain\", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young's tour, now entitled \"Journey Through the Past\", continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto's [[Massey Hall]], which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young's Archive series.\n\nNear the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash]]'' TV show. \"[[The Needle and the Damage Done]]\", a somber lament on the pain caused by [[heroin addiction]], had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member [[Danny Whitten]], who eventually died while battling his drug problems.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=279}} While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of [[Quadrafonic Sound Studios]] owner [[Elliot Mazer]] to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them [[The Stray Gators]], and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]] were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals. Against the advice of his producer [[David Briggs (producer)|David Briggs]], he scrapped plans for the imminent release<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 |title=Neil comments on massey hall release :: Bad News Beat :: on Neil Young |website=Bad-news-beat.org |accessdate=July 11, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010740/http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> of the live acoustic recording in favour of a studio album consisting of the Nashville sessions, electric-guitar oriented sessions recorded later in his barn, and two recordings made with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at Barking (credited as Barking Town Hall and now the [[The Broadway (theatre)|Broadway Theatre]]) during March 1971.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.longlivevinyl.net/classic-album-neil-young-harvest/ |title=Classic Album: Neil Young - Harvest|date=June 2, 2017 |work=Long Live Vinyl |access-date=October 10, 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref> The result was Young's fourth album, ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (February 14, 1972). The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album's live acoustic performance of \"Needle and the Damage Done.\"\n\nAfter his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California (\"Broken Arrow Ranch\", where he lived until his divorce in 2014.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-neil-youngs-nature-themed-opus-20160705|title=Inside Neil Young's Nature-Themed Opus|website=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>). He wrote the song \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" in honor of the land's longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song \"[[A Man Needs a Maid (song)|A Man Needs a Maid]]\" was inspired by his relationship with actress [[Carrie Snodgress]]. \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" was released as the first single from ''Harvest'', the only No.&nbsp;1 hit in his career. \"Old Man\" was also popular.\n\nThe album's recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'' (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described \"Heart of Gold\" as the song that \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\"\n\n===The \"Ditch\" Trilogy and personal struggles (1972\u20131974)===\nAlthough a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of ''Harvest'', it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]/[[diazepam]] overdose. Young described the incident to ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]] in 1975:<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview|title=Neil Young: The RS Interview|magazine=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> \"[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd OD'd. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.\"\n\nOn the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]], a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the [[hard rock]] milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer [[Johnny Barbata]], while [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as \"[his] least favorite record\", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's [[Neil Young Archives#Official Release Series 05:|Official Release Series]]). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. ''Time Fades Away'', for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. ''Time'' was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the \"Ditch Trilogy\", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972).<ref name=\"UnCut\">{{cite news|last=Pinnock|first=Tom|title=Neil Young's 'Time Fades Away': 'Harvest's unlikely follow-up|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/neil-young/neil-young-s-time-fades-away-harvests-unlikely-follow-up-feature|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2010|issue=156}}</ref> These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time.\n\n[[File:Neil Young in Austin, 1976.jpg|thumb|Young in [[Austin, Texas]], on November 9, 1976]]\n\nIn the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by [[Nils Lofgren]] on guitar and piano and ''Harvest''/''Time Fades Away'' veteran [[Ben Keith]] on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and [[roadie]] [[Bruce Berry]], Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (June 20, 1975). The album's dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=430}} While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'' (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song \"See the Sky About to Rain\", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like ''Time Fades Away'', it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young's most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of ''On the Beach'' described the music as \"mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary\".<ref name=\"sven\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/a&e/soundfury904.htm |title=Neil Young \u2013 On the Beach (Reprise) |newspaper=The Santa Barbara Independent |date=March 18, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421143346/http://www.independent.com/a%26e/soundfury904.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter completing ''On the Beach'', Young reunited with ''Harvest'' producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, ''[[Homegrown (Neil Young album)|Homegrown]]''. Most of the songs were written after Young's break-up with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though ''Homegrown'' was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, ''Tonight's the Night'', at the suggestion of [[The Band|Band]] bassist [[Rick Danko]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Young further explained his move by saying: \"It was a little too personal ... it scared me\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Most of the songs from ''Homegrown'' were later incorporated into other Young albums, but the original album never surfaced. ''Tonight's the Night'' when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the \"ditch\" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=433}}\n\n===Reunions, retrospectives and ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1974\u20131979)===\nYoung reunited with [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour which was recorded and released in 2014 as [[CSNY 1974]]. It was one of the first ever stadium tours, and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=452}}\n\nIn 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with [[Frank Sampedro]] on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, ''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; \"[[Cortez the Killer]]\", a retelling of the [[Spanish conquest]] of Mexico from the viewpoint of the [[Aztec]]s, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. ''Zuma''{{'}}s closing track, \"Through My Sails\", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.\n\nIn 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (September 20, 1976), credited to [[The Stills-Young Band]]; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a [[telegram]] that read: \"Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way.

Performers on the record included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Emmylou Harris]] and Young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Nicolette Larson]] along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'', a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.\n\n''[[Comes a Time]]'' (October 2, 1978), Young's first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, also featured Larson and Crazy Horse.  The album became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time and marked a return to his folk roots, including a cover of [[Ian Tyson]]'s \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada.  Another of the album's songs, \"[[Lotta Love]]\", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979.  In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young's film ''[[Human Highway]]'', which took its name from a song featured on ''Comes a Time''. Over four years, Young would spend [[United States dollar|$]]3,000,000 of his own money on production (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000000|1978}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the post-punk band [[Devo]], whose members appeared in the film.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=575\u2013577}}\n\nYoung set out in 1978 on the lengthy \"Rust Never Sleeps\" tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the punk rock [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1970s and, provided a stark contrast from Young's previous, folk-inspired album ''Comes a Time''.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=529\u2013537}} Two new songs, the acoustic \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\" and electric \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" were the centerpiece of the new material. Young had collaborated with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]] on a cacophonous version of Hey Hey, My My at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The album has also widely been considered a precursor of grunge music and many grunge artists have said they were inspired by Young's distorted guitars on the B side to this album. Young also compared the rise of [[Johnny Rotten]] with that of the recently deceased \"King\" [[Elvis Presley]], who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an [[Pop icon|icon]]. Rotten returned the favour by playing one of Young's songs, \"Revolution Blues\" from ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'', on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Martin|title=DJ Johnny Rotten plays music from his own record collection on the radio, 1977|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/dj_johnny_rotten_plays_music_from_his_own_record_collection_on_the_radio_19|website=Dangerousminds.net|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nYoung's two accompanying albums ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (July 2, 1979; new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and ''[[Live Rust]]'' (November 19, 1979) (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B.  A movie version of the concerts, also called ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\". Young worked with rock artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to create the poster art for the film, using the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Jawas]] as a theme. Young's work since ''Harvest'' (1972) had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of ''Rolling Stone'' voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rolling.htm#1979 |title=Albums Of The Year And End Of Year Critic Lists |publisher=Rocklist.net |accessdate=5 February 2020 }}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' named ''Rust Never Sleeps'' as the year's winner in the [[Pazz & Jop]] Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.

''Trans'' (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head [[David Geffen]] for its lack of commercial appeal, and with ''Everybody's Rockin''{{'}} following only seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music \"unrepresentative\" of himself.<ref>{{cite book|title=A fiction of the past: the sixties in American history|last=Cavallo|first=Dominick|year=1999|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-21930-7|oclc=39981636|url=https://archive.org/details/fictionofpastsix00cava}}</ref> The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos \u2013 [[Tim Pope]] directed the videos for \"Wonderin'\" and \"Cry, Cry, Cry\".

Young's lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1982 country album ''[[Old Ways]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22521|pure_url=yes}}|title=Old Ways album review|website=allmusic|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> It was also the year when Young's third child was born, a girl named Amber Jean.

Young recorded 1986's ''[[Landing on Water]]'' without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, ''[[Life (1987 album)|Life]]'', which emerged in 1987.

The addition of a [[brass instruments|brass]] section provided a new [[jazz]]ier sound, and the title track of 1988's ''[[This Note's For You]]'' became Young's first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and [[Michael Jackson]], the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, \"What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?\" Despite this, the video was eventually named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|best video of the year]] by the network in 1989.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=24\u201332}} By comparison, the major music cable network of Young's home nation, [[Muchmusic]], ran the video immediately.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour.

Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young Lyrics Analysis: Rockin' in the Free World|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/fot/ritfw.htm|website=Thrasherswheat.org|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe use of heavy [[feedback]] and distortion on several ''Freedom'' tracks was reminiscent of the ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of [[grunge]]. The rising stars of the genre, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Eddie Vedder]], frequently cited Young as a major influence, contributing to his popular revival. A tribute album called ''[[The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young]]'' was released in 1989, featuring covers by alternative and grunge acts including [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Dinosaur Jr]], and the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]].\n\nYoung's 1990 album ''[[Ragged Glory]]'', recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his [[Northern California]] ranch, continued this distortion-heavy esthetic. Young toured for the album with Orange County, California country-punk band [[Social Distortion]] and [[alternative rock]] pioneers [[Sonic Youth]] as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans.<ref name=\"sonic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/jammin/sonic_youth.htm|title=Sonic Youth and Neil Young|publisher=Thrasher's Wheat \u2013 A Neil Young Archives|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Weld (album)|Weld]]'', a two-disc live album documenting the tour, was released in 1991.<ref name=\"sonic\" /> Sonic Youth's influence was most evident on ''[[Arc (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Arc]]'', a 35-minute collage of feedback and distortion spliced together at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's [[Thurston Moore]] and originally packaged with some versions of ''Weld''.<ref name=\"sonic\" />\n\n1992's ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' marked an abrupt return to the country and folk-rock stylings of ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) and reunited him with some of the musicians from that album, including singers [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]]. The title track was a minor hit and the record was well received by critics, winning the [[Juno Award for Album of the Year]] in 1994. Young also contributed to [[Randy Bachman]]'s nostalgic 1992 tune \"Prairie Town\", and garnered a 1993 [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award]] nomination for his song \"Philadelphia\", from the soundtrack of the [[Jonathan Demme]] movie [[Philadelphia (movie)|of the same name]]. An ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with [[Booker T. and the M.G.s]] for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with [[Blues Traveler]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Pearl Jam]] also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of \"Rockin' in the Free World\" played with [[Pearl Jam]], foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later.\n\n[[File:Neil Young, Heart of Gold.jpg|thumb|Young on stage in [[Barcelona]]]]\n\nIn 1994 Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for ''[[Sleeps with Angels]]'', a record whose dark, somber mood was influenced by [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain's life and death, without mentioning him by name. Cobain had quoted Young's lyric \"It's better to burn out than fade away\" (a line from \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)|My My, Hey Hey]]\") in [[Death of Kurt Cobain#Suicide note|his suicide note]].

A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, ''[[Year of the Horse]]'', emerged in 1997.

While doing errands on a visit to his daughter, Young had seen a newspaper photo of wounded U.S. veterans on a transport plane to Germany, and noticing that the same paper devoted little actual coverage to the story, he was unable to get the image out of his head, realizing the suffering caused to families by the war had not truly registered to him and most Americans who were not directly affected by it. Young cried, and immediately got his guitar out and began to write multiple songs at once. Within a few days he had completed work and assembled a band. He later said he had restrained himself for a long time from writing any [[protest song]]s, waiting for someone younger, with a different perspective, but no one seemed to be saying anything.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nMost of the album's songs rebuked the Bush administration's policy of war by examining its human costs to soldiers, their loved ones, and civilians, but Young also included a few songs on other themes, and an outright protest titled, \"[[Let's Impeach the President]]\",<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Living With War Review|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/10149965/review/10191400/livingwithwar|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=May 1, 2006|accessdate=March 31, 2009}}</ref> in which he stated that Bush had lied to lead the country into war. Young's lyrics in another song named Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had not declared any intention to run for president at the time and was widely unexpected to be able to win either the Democratic Party nomination or a general election, as potentially a replacement for Bush. That summer, [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] reunited for the supporting \"Freedom of Speech Tour '06\", in which they played Young's new protest songs alongside the group's older material, meeting with both enthusiasm and anger from different fans, some of whom were supportive of Bush politically.

They include:\n* 1953 [[Gibson Les Paul]] Goldtop. Nicknamed \"[[Old Black]]\", this is Young's primary electric guitar and is featured on ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) and other albums. Old Black got its name from an amateur paintjob applied to the originally gold body of the instrument, some time before Young acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini [[humbucker]] pick-up from a [[Gibson Firebird]] was installed in the lead/treble position. This pick-up, severely [[microphonic]], is considered a crucial component of Young's sound. A [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]] was installed as early as 1969, and can be heard during the opening of \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" from ''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]''. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Martin D-45]].

It was one of four instruments bought by Stephen Stills for himself and his bandmates in CSNY to celebrate their first full concert at the Greek Theater in 1969.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Martin D-28. Nicknamed \"Hank\" after its previous owner, [[Hank Williams]]. [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], had traded it for some shotguns; it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from [[Tut Taylor]]. Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and the song it inspired, \"This Old Guitar\", can be seen about 50 minutes into the film ''[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Vintage Martin D-18: Young used an old D-18 throughout his early days performing in coffee houses in Canada and on some early [[Buffalo Springfield]] work, before he received the D-45 from Stills.

Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar during his [[Buffalo Springfield]] days.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Gretsch White Falcon]]. Young purchased a late 1950s model near the end of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] era; in 1969 he bought a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stephen Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early 1970s period, and can be heard on tracks like \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\", \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", \"Alabama\", \"Words (Between the Lines of Age)\", and \"L.A.\". It was Young's primary electric guitar during the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) era, since Young's deteriorating back condition (eventually fixed with surgery) made playing the much heavier Les Paul difficult.<ref>David Simons, \"Recording Harvest: The Making of Neil Young's Classic 1972 Album.\" ''Acoustic Guitar'' 103 (July 2001): 38\u201340.</ref> This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps, a Fender Deluxe and either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) song \"Words\".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Gibson Flying V]], on the ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Fender Broadcaster]], on the ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1975) album and tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Guild M-20, seen in the film ''[[Neil Young Journeys]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Harmonicas===\nYoung plays Hohner Marine Band harmonicas and is often seen using a harmonica holder{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hohnerusa.com/index.php?6 |title=Hohner Musikinstrumente GmbH & Co.

The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on \"See the Sky About to Rain\". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations.

For one weekend each October, in [[Mountain View, California]], Young and his ex-wife have hosted the [[Bridge School Benefit|Bridge School Concerts]], which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Who]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Metallica]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Dave Matthews]]. He announced in June 2017, however, that he would no longer host the concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeschool.org/2017/06/no-bridge-school-benefit-concert-in-2017/|title=No Bridge School Benefit Concert in 2017|date=June 21, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}</ref>  The concerts are a benefit for the Bridge School, which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stemmed at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have [[cerebral palsy]] and his daughter, like Young himself, has [[epilepsy]].\n\nYoung was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1994 for his song \"Philadelphia\" from the film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''. Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song \"[[Streets of Philadelphia]]\" from the same film. In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that \"the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song\". That same night, [[Tom Hanks]], when accepting the Oscar for Best Actor, gave credit for his inspiration to Young's song.\n\nYoung has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an honorary doctorate of music from [[Lakehead University]] in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, in 1992, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from [[San Francisco State University]] in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School. In 2006, Young was given Manitoba's highest civilian honour when he was appointed to the [[Order of Manitoba]]. In 2009, he was appointed to Canada's second highest civilian order, the [[Order of Canada]].\n\n''Rolling Stone'' magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/neil-young-19691231|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> and in 2003, included five of his albums in its list of [[500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/|title=Greatest Albums of All Time &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Lists|magazine=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2000, Young was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"cwof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|title=Neil Young \u2013 2000 Inductee|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|accessdate=November 13, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604203513/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|archivedate=June 4, 2008}}</ref>\nIn 2006, when ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine compiled a \"Greatest Living Songwriters\" list, Young was ranked second behind [[Bob Dylan]]. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other's records.) He ranked thirty-ninth on ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock'' that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has \"avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young's peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.\"<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/>\n\nYoung's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as [[Blind Melon]], [[Phish]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Young is referred to as \"the Godfather of [[Grunge]]\" because of the influence he had on [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Eddie Vedder]] and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the [[experimental rock]] group [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]]. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favourably compared his singing voice to Young's. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (1970), and \"immediately fell in love\" with his work, calling it \"extraordinary\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/thomyorke/|title=BBC - Neil Young: Don't be denied. - Video - Thom Yorke|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Yorke later covered the title track in concert. [[Dave Matthews]] lists Young as one of his favourite songwriters and most important inspirations and covers his songs on occasion. The British indie band [[The Bluetones]] named their number one [[Expecting to Fly (album)|debut album]] after the song \"[[Expecting to Fly (song)|Expecting to Fly]]\" (written by Young when still with Buffalo Springfield) and have covered the song while touring. Young also inspired the singer-songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who covered \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" on the live album ''[[Familiar to Millions]]'' (2000).\n\nThe Australian rock group [[Powderfinger]] named themselves after Young's song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" from ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979). The members of the [[Constantines]] have occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jason Crock |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |title=Interviews: The Constantines |date=October 16, 2005 |website=Pitchfork.com |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105084641/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |archive-date=January 5, 2009}}</ref> While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008, during the Canadian leg of his tour, Bob Dylan visited Young's former home in River Heights, where Young spent his teenage years.
