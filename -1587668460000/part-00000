He is the only show jumper to have won five Olympic gold medals and a total of seven Olympic medals, and to compete and win medals in six different Olympic Games. In the 1950s and 1960s Winkler was one of Germany's most popular athletes.\n\n== Career ==\nWinkler was born in [[Barmen]], today part of [[Wuppertal]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, the son of a riding teacher.<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /> His father, Paul Winkler, died as a soldier during the last week of World War II.<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /> The boy was drafted as a ''[[Luftwaffenhelfer|Flakhelfer]]'' and was a prisoner of war for a short time. The house of his mother in Frankfurt was destroyed by bombing. He made money, to support his mother and himself, as a [[Groom (profession)|groom]] in the stable of the Landgravine of [[Hesse]] in [[Kronberg im Taunus]].<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /> He was also a riding teacher of the Americans who occupied the area. He began an apprenticeship in a textile store in Frankfurt in 1948.<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /><ref name=\"Kettenbach\" />\n\nWinkler participated in show jumping competitions and won for the first time on 10 October 1948, in H\u00fcnfeld, on Falkner. A new Olympic Committee for Riding (DOKR) was founded in 1949 by [[Gustav Rau (hippologist)|Gustav Rau]], who moved it to [[Warendorf]]. He called Winkler to join in 1950. In the morning, Winkler trained horses for the committee, in the afternoon he worked as a carpenter.<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /> \n\n[[Halla (horse)|Halla]] was a horse that the committee intended for [[eventing]]. Rau found her unsuitable for the task and called her owner and breeder Gustav Vierling in [[Darmstadt]] to take her back. Vierling came and asked Winkler to take care of the mare, which he accepted.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> The mare became an important part of his equestrian career.\n\nWinkler won his first German championship in 1952, but could not participate in the [[Olympic Games]] in Helsinki that year because he was classified as a professional due to his teaching in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> On an initiative of {{ill|Willi Daume|de}}, he was qualified as an amateur by the end of the same year.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> Winkler won the World Championship with Halla in 1954, again in 1955,<ref name=\"Washington Post\" /> and became one of the favorites for the 1956 Olympic Games.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> In 1956 the [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|Equestrian Games]] were held in [[Stockholm]], as the athletes and their horses were not allowed to travel to [[Melbourne]] due to quarantine restrictions.<ref name=\"WDR\" /> In the first round Winkler pulled a groin muscle at the penultimate obstacle after his mare took off early and threw him out of position. \n\nDespite the pain Winkler decided to ride in the second round as the German team would be eliminated without him. After he was given tranquilizers Winkler found that he was comfortable sitting, but riding was difficult and painful.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> Any drugs that could reduce the pain enough to make him comfortable in the saddle also would reduce his mental capacity, and therefore, he was only given black coffee before his ride to try to help reduce his dizziness and double-vision.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> Halla apparently sensed that her rider was not right and performed the entire course clear with only steering from Winkler, and their performance won them the individual and team gold.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /><ref name=\"Olympic\" />\n\n[[File:Hans G\u00fcnter Winkler, Deutsches Spring-Derby 2012.JPG|thumb|upright|Hans G\u00fcnter Winkler at the 2012 German show jumping and dressage derby in Hamburg]]\nWinkler won five gold medals in jumping (in addition to the four individual medals with the German team) between 1956 and 1976, as well as a silver medal and a bronze medal.<ref name=\"Olympic\" /> He is one of the most successful German Olympic athletes, third only to [[Isabell Werth]] and [[Reiner Klimke]] for gold medals produced in German equestrian competition. He was [[German Sportspersonality of the Year]] in 1955 and 1956.<ref name=\"Warendorf\" /><ref name=\"Simeoni\" /> Winkler retired from jumping on 13 July 1986 with the conclusion of the Aachen tournament.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> Winkler worked as a trainer for the German Olympic teams, along with [[Paul Schockem\u00f6hle]] and [[Herbert Mayer]], leading them to success in Seoul in 1988.<ref name=\"Kettenbach\" /> He consulted companies who wanted to sponsor equestrian sport, organized tournaments, and worked for the development of young riders.<ref name=\"Simeoni\" />\n\nHe later published numerous books on riding and in 1991 founded the HGW-Marketinggesellschaft, a sports marketing firm that has helped produce various equestrian competitions.<ref name=\"Welt\" /><ref name=\"Warendorf\" /> He was also a member of the [[German Equestrian Federation]]'s Jumping Committee and helped to select the 2000 Olympic Team for Germany.<ref name=\"Warendorf\" /> The German Equestrian Federation announced his death in [[Warendorf]] on 9 July 2018.<ref name=\"Washington Post\" /><ref name=\"Welt\" />\n\n== Awards ==\nIn May 2000, Winkler was the first recipient of the award, ''Goldene Sportpyramide'', of the {{ill|Stiftung Deutsche Sporthilfe|de}}.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /><ref name=\"Sportpyramide\" /> On 12 June 2008, he received the [[Federal Cross of Merit]] in Warendorf from {{ill|Ingo Wolf|de}}, minister of interior and sport in North Rhine-Westphalia.

He is the only show jumper to have won five Olympic gold medals and a total of seven Olympic medals, and to compete and win medals in six different Olympic Games. In the 1950s and 1960s Winkler was one of Germany's most popular athletes.\n\n== Career ==\nWinkler was born in [[Barmen]], today part of [[Wuppertal]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, the son of a riding teacher.<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /> His father, Paul Winkler, died as a soldier during the last week of World War II.<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /> The boy was drafted as a ''[[Luftwaffenhelfer|Flakhelfer]]'' and was a prisoner of war for a short time. The house of his mother in Frankfurt was destroyed by bombing. He made money, to support his mother and himself, as a [[Groom (profession)|groom]] in the stable of the Landgravine of [[Hesse]] in [[Kronberg im Taunus]].<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /> He was also a riding teacher of the Americans who occupied the area. He began an apprenticeship in a textile store in Frankfurt in 1948.<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /><ref name=\"Kettenbach\" />\n\nWinkler participated in show jumping competitions and won for the first time on 10 October 1948, in H\u00fcnfeld, on Falkner. A new Olympic Committee for Riding (DOKR) was founded in 1949 by [[Gustav Rau (hippologist)|Gustav Rau]], who moved it to [[Warendorf]]. He called Winkler to join in 1950. In the morning, Winkler trained horses for the committee, in the afternoon he worked as a carpenter.<ref name=\"Munzigner\" /> \n\n[[Halla (horse)|Halla]] was a horse that the committee intended for [[eventing]]. Rau found her unsuitable for the task and called her owner and breeder Gustav Vierling in [[Darmstadt]] to take her back. Vierling came and asked Winkler to take care of the mare, which he accepted.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> The mare became an important part of his equestrian career.\n\nWinkler won his first German championship in 1952, but could not participate in the [[Olympic Games]] in Helsinki that year because he was classified as a professional due to his teaching in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> On an initiative of {{ill|Willi Daume|de}}, he was qualified as an amateur by the end of the same year.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> Winkler won the World Championship with Halla in 1954, again in 1955,<ref name=\"Washington Post\" /> and became one of the favorites for the 1956 Olympic Games.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> In 1956 the [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|Equestrian Games]] were held in [[Stockholm]], as the athletes and their horses were not allowed to travel to [[Melbourne]] due to quarantine restrictions.<ref name=\"WDR\" /> In the first round Winkler pulled a groin muscle at the penultimate obstacle after his mare took off early and threw him out of position. \n\nDespite the pain Winkler decided to ride in the second round as the German team would be eliminated without him. After he was given tranquilizers Winkler found that he was comfortable sitting, but riding was difficult and painful.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> Any drugs that could reduce the pain enough to make him comfortable in the saddle also would reduce his mental capacity, and therefore, he was only given black coffee before his ride to try to help reduce his dizziness and double-vision.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> Halla apparently sensed that her rider was not right and performed the entire course clear with only steering from Winkler, and their performance won them the individual and team gold.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /><ref name=\"Olympic\" />\n\n[[File:Hans G\u00fcnter Winkler, Deutsches Spring-Derby 2012.JPG|thumb|upright|Hans G\u00fcnter Winkler at the 2012 German show jumping and dressage derby in Hamburg]]\nWinkler won five gold medals in jumping (in addition to the four individual medals with the German team) between 1956 and 1976, as well as a silver medal and a bronze medal.<ref name=\"Olympic\" /> He is one of the most successful German Olympic athletes, third only to [[Isabell Werth]] and [[Reiner Klimke]] for gold medals produced in German equestrian competition. He was [[German Sportspersonality of the Year]] in 1955 and 1956.<ref name=\"Warendorf\" /><ref name=\"Simeoni\" /> Winkler retired from jumping on 13 July 1986 with the conclusion of the Aachen tournament.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /> Winkler worked as a trainer for the German Olympic teams, along with [[Paul Schockem\u00f6hle]] and [[Herbert Mayer]], leading them to success in Seoul in 1988.<ref name=\"Kettenbach\" /> He consulted companies who wanted to sponsor equestrian sport, organized tournaments, and worked for the development of young riders.<ref name=\"Simeoni\" />\n\nHe later published numerous books on riding and in 1991 founded the HGW-Marketinggesellschaft, a sports marketing firm that has helped produce various equestrian competitions.<ref name=\"Welt\" /><ref name=\"Warendorf\" /> He was also a member of the [[German Equestrian Federation]]'s Jumping Committee and helped to select the 2000 Olympic Team for Germany.<ref name=\"Warendorf\" /> The German Equestrian Federation announced his death in [[Warendorf]] on 9 July 2018.<ref name=\"Washington Post\" /><ref name=\"Welt\" />\n\n== Awards ==\nIn May 2000, Winkler was the first recipient of the award, ''Goldene Sportpyramide'', of the {{ill|Stiftung Deutsche Sporthilfe|de}}.<ref name=\"Ludwig\" /><ref name=\"Sportpyramide\" /> On 12 June 2008, he received the [[Federal Cross of Merit]] in Warendorf from {{ill|Ingo Wolf|de}}, minister of interior and sport in North Rhine-Westphalia. He also received the media prize [[Bambi Award]].<ref name=\"Ludwig\" />\n\n== Major achievements ==\n*Olympic Games<ref name=\"Olympic\" />\n** 1956 Stockholm: Team gold medal and individual gold medal on ''Halla''\n** 1960 [[Rome]]: Team gold medal.

Filming began in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], in November 2008, and ended in January 2009. To qualify for awards season, the film opened in a limited release on December 10, 2010. It is based on a true story about a popular [[Go-Go dancing|go-go]] dancer/stripper in the 1970s who has [[dissociative identity disorder]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrankie is performing at a Los Angeles club in 1973. She is one of the best strippers at the club, and often attracts the attention of wealthy businessmen. One night, the club's female employees go out for a \"Girls Night\". As the girls observe all the men at the bar, Frankie gets the attention of a well-known bartender. She agrees to go to his home for casual sex. Before the two can engage in any sexual activity, Frankie switches to an alter ego, and cracks the man's head open with a picture frame. Word of Frankie's violent activity spreads to the strip club quickly, and Frankie is fired from the needed job. The same manic episodes occur while Frankie is at the laundromat and a wedding.\n\nFrankie starts psychiatric therapy with Doctor Oz. During a session, Frankie learns that she has two alters: Genius, a seven-year-old child; and Alice, a Southern white racist woman, whom Frankie struggles to overcome. Through regular sessions with Dr. Oz, Frankie begins to recall the traumatic events that led to her split personality. She realizes that, when she was a teenager, she was in love with a white man who died in a car accident while they were on the road. In the same session, she also uncovers the memory of the birth of her child. Moments after the birth, Frankie's mother realizes that the child is half-white, and kills it, thus triggering Frankie's personality to split.\n\nAfter she watches the taped sessions, and puts everything together, Frankie begins the healing process, taking control of her life and semi-integrating the personalities that Dr. Oz assures her will always be present.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Frankie/Genius/Alice\n** [[Vanessa Morgan]] as 16-year-old Frankie\n** Michayla McKenzie as 8-year-old Frankie\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Dr. Joseph Oswald aka \"Dr. Oz\"\n* [[Phylicia Rashad]] as Edna Murdoch\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Dr. Strassfield\n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Dr. Backman\n* [[Chandra Wilson]] as Maxine Murdoch\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Paige Prescott\n** [[Emily Tennant]] as 16-year-old Paige\n** [[Megan Charpentier]] as 8-year-old Paige\n* [[Scott Lyster]] as Pete Prescott\n* [[Kira Clavell]] as Wanda\n* [[Joanne Baron]] as Nurse Susan Shaw\n\n==Release==\nIt had a limited release in the United States on December 10, 2010, to qualify for awards.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", ''Lover'' celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release, including the fourth single \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" that peaked at number 23. ''Lover'' received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and growth; however, a few of them found the album lengthy and inconsistent.  \n\n''Lover'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US; it was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling studio album of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift was set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, in 2020, but postponed to 2021 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. ''Lover'' appeared on several year-end best music lists of 2019, with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] naming it the number-one best album of 2019.\n\n==Background==\nSpeculation of the album started on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees to her [[Instagram]] account,<ref>{{cite web |last=Elizabeth |first=De |title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref name=\"EWMay\">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 13, Swift released a countdown on her official website, counting down to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] ([[UTC\u221204:00]]) on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|title=Taylor Swift Updates Her Website With Countdown Clock, Teases April 26 Date|first=Katie|last=Atkinson|website=Billboard|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416134018/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 25, several news outlets reported that a [[mural]] of a butterfly in [[The Gulch, Nashville, Tennessee|The Gulch]] neighborhood of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], painted by street artist Kelsey Montague,<ref name=\"Tennessean\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/04/25/taylor-swift-announcement-2019-nashville-gulch-mural/3572564002/|title=Is Taylor Swift's announcement linked to activity in Nashville's Gulch?

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", ''Lover'' celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release, including the fourth single \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" that peaked at number 23. ''Lover'' received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and growth; however, a few of them found the album lengthy and inconsistent.  \n\n''Lover'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US; it was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling studio album of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide.

Chart data is powered by analytics firm Alpha Data (formerly BuzzAngle Music) and results are published on the website of pop culture magazine  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', both of which are properties of the United States-based [[Penske Media Corporation]].\n\nThe ''Rolling Stone'' charts compete with the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], which are powered by [[Nielsen SoundScan]] and published by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. The ''Rolling Stone'' charts are differentiated by their emphasis in [[streaming media]] and daily updates while still publishing a weekly final version on the Monday following the Friday-to-Thursday tracking week. They were announced on May 7, 2019, and were expected to launch on May 13, but were ultimately launched on July 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8510461/rolling-stone-magazine-music-charts|title=Rolling Stone Magazine to Launch Music Charts|last=Christman|first=Ed|work=Billboard|date=May 7, 2019|accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8518591/rolling-stone-music-charts-launch-two-month-delay|title=After Nearly Two-Month Delay, Rolling Stone Launches Music Charts|last=Eggertsen|first=Chris|work=Billboard|date=July 2, 2019|accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSince ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' began publishing its first ranked [[record chart]]s in 1944 (after publishing an unranked \"hit parade\" list since 1936), the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] have been considered the standard in gauging the popularity of music in the United States. Throughout the 20th century, several competitors came and went, including charts published in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' (1952\u201396), ''[[Record World]]'' (1954\u201382) and ''[[Radio & Records]]'' (1973\u20132009). Over time, incomplete distinctions between album sales, album shipments, digital downloads, and streaming media have been sources of criticism regarding the charts' validities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/07/05/billboards-charts-used-to-be-our-barometer-for-music-success-are-they-meaningless-in-the-streaming-age/|title=Billboard's charts used to be our barometer for music success. Are they meaningless in the streaming age?|last=Andrews|first=Travis|work=The Washington Post|date=July 9, 2018|accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Rolling Stone'' first announced it would be launching a group of record charts on May 7, 2019. The scheduled launch date for the project was announced by the magazine as May 13, 2019. It was included in the announcement that the charts would be powered by information supplied by data analytics company Alpha Data, previously known as \"BuzzAngle Music\" prior to their rebranding on May 13, 2019. Alpha Data is owned by the parent company of ''Rolling Stone'', [[Penske Media Corporation]], which had fully acquired the magazine at the start of 2019. On May 11, it was announced that the public launch would be delayed indefinitely and the project would remain in private beta, citing intentions to \"optimize with industry partners\" and \"fully ensure smoothness\" of the project.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8510461/rolling-stone-magazine-music-charts | title=Rolling Stone Magazine to Launch Music Charts | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=May 7, 2019 | accessdate=July 3, 2019 | author=Christman, Ed}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/an-update-on-the-rolling-stone-charts-834234/ | title=An Update on the Rolling Stone Charts | work=Rolling Stone | date=May 11, 2019 | accessdate=July 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe record charts serve as a competitor to the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], which have been published by New York City-based magazine ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' since 1958.

The final weekly charts are published on the Monday following the previous tracking week. (For example, for a tracking week beginning on Friday, January 1 and ending on Thursday, January 7, the final weekly charts would be published on Monday, January 11.)<ref name=\"GeneralMethodology\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/charts-methodology/|title=General Methodology of the Rolling Stone Charts|work=RollingStone|accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA song must be sold for at least $0.49 for that sale to be logged for a given tracking week; units sold for less than the minimum price requirement in the first three months of release will not be considered for weekly charts. A \"song unit\" is determined by an algorithm that weights a digital song sale as 1 and respectively values 120 subscription-based streams and 360 ad-supported streams as a song-equivalent unit. With regard to [[album-equivalent unit]]s, a song is generally considered to be part of the first album in which it was included, with the exception of the first four weeks in which a song experiences a surge in consumption because of inclusion on a compilation or greatest hits album. For charts were streaming is the only metric for chart positioning, the type of stream is disregarded and weighted equivalent to each other.<ref name=\"GeneralMethodology\"/>\n\nAn album must be sold for at least $3.75 for that sale to be logged for a given tracking week; units sold for less than the minimum price requirement in the first month of release will not be considered for weekly charts, but would be reflected in its lifetime sales. An \"album unit\" is determined by an algorithm that weights a digital, CD, and cassette standard-format album sale as 1; a digital and CD deluxe-format album sales as 1.3; a vinyl standard-format album sales as 2; a vinyl deluxe-format album sales as 2.5; and respectively values 10 digital song sales, 1,200 subscription-based streams, and 3,600 ad-supported streams as an album-equivalent unit. An album edition is considered \"deluxe\" if the bonus content does not exceed the duration of the standard edition, in which case the standard and deluxe editions would chart as a single album. An album edition is considered \"super deluxe\" if the bonus content exceeds the duration of the standard edition, in which case the super deluxe edition would chart as a separate album from the standard and deluxe versions.

The ''Rolling Stone'' charts are differentiated by their emphasis in [[streaming media]] and daily updates while still publishing a weekly final version on the Monday following the Friday-to-Thursday tracking week. They were announced on May 7, 2019, and were expected to launch on May 13, but were ultimately launched on July 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8510461/rolling-stone-magazine-music-charts|title=Rolling Stone Magazine to Launch Music Charts|last=Christman|first=Ed|work=Billboard|date=May 7, 2019|accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8518591/rolling-stone-music-charts-launch-two-month-delay|title=After Nearly Two-Month Delay, Rolling Stone Launches Music Charts|last=Eggertsen|first=Chris|work=Billboard|date=July 2, 2019|accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSince ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' began publishing its first ranked [[record chart]]s in 1944 (after publishing an unranked \"hit parade\" list since 1936), the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] have been considered the standard in gauging the popularity of music in the United States. Throughout the 20th century, several competitors came and went, including charts published in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' (1952\u201396), ''[[Record World]]'' (1954\u201382) and ''[[Radio & Records]]'' (1973\u20132009). Over time, incomplete distinctions between album sales, album shipments, digital downloads, and streaming media have been sources of criticism regarding the charts' validities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/07/05/billboards-charts-used-to-be-our-barometer-for-music-success-are-they-meaningless-in-the-streaming-age/|title=Billboard's charts used to be our barometer for music success.

The scheduled launch date for the project was announced by the magazine as May 13, 2019. It was included in the announcement that the charts would be powered by information supplied by data analytics company Alpha Data, previously known as \"BuzzAngle Music\" prior to their rebranding on May 13, 2019. Alpha Data is owned by the parent company of ''Rolling Stone'', [[Penske Media Corporation]], which had fully acquired the magazine at the start of 2019. On May 11, it was announced that the public launch would be delayed indefinitely and the project would remain in private beta, citing intentions to \"optimize with industry partners\" and \"fully ensure smoothness\" of the project.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8510461/rolling-stone-magazine-music-charts | title=Rolling Stone Magazine to Launch Music Charts | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=May 7, 2019 | accessdate=July 3, 2019 | author=Christman, Ed}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/an-update-on-the-rolling-stone-charts-834234/ | title=An Update on the Rolling Stone Charts | work=Rolling Stone | date=May 11, 2019 | accessdate=July 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe record charts serve as a competitor to the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], which have been published by New York City-based magazine ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' since 1958.

The final weekly charts are published on the Monday following the previous tracking week. (For example, for a tracking week beginning on Friday, January 1 and ending on Thursday, January 7, the final weekly charts would be published on Monday, January 11.)<ref name=\"GeneralMethodology\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/charts-methodology/|title=General Methodology of the Rolling Stone Charts|work=RollingStone|accessdate=July 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA song must be sold for at least $0.49 for that sale to be logged for a given tracking week; units sold for less than the minimum price requirement in the first three months of release will not be considered for weekly charts. A \"song unit\" is determined by an algorithm that weights a digital song sale as 1 and respectively values 120 subscription-based streams and 360 ad-supported streams as a song-equivalent unit. With regard to [[album-equivalent unit]]s, a song is generally considered to be part of the first album in which it was included, with the exception of the first four weeks in which a song experiences a surge in consumption because of inclusion on a compilation or greatest hits album. For charts were streaming is the only metric for chart positioning, the type of stream is disregarded and weighted equivalent to each other.<ref name=\"GeneralMethodology\"/>\n\nAn album must be sold for at least $3.75 for that sale to be logged for a given tracking week; units sold for less than the minimum price requirement in the first month of release will not be considered for weekly charts, but would be reflected in its lifetime sales. An \"album unit\" is determined by an algorithm that weights a digital, CD, and cassette standard-format album sale as 1; a digital and CD deluxe-format album sales as 1.3; a vinyl standard-format album sales as 2; a vinyl deluxe-format album sales as 2.5; and respectively values 10 digital song sales, 1,200 subscription-based streams, and 3,600 ad-supported streams as an album-equivalent unit. An album edition is considered \"deluxe\" if the bonus content does not exceed the duration of the standard edition, in which case the standard and deluxe editions would chart as a single album. An album edition is considered \"super deluxe\" if the bonus content exceeds the duration of the standard edition, in which case the super deluxe edition would chart as a separate album from the standard and deluxe versions. Bundled sales (for example, with concert tickets or merchandise) are considered valid so long as the product listing specifically states that the album is included with the purchase; sales are logged upon redemption of a digital download code or fulfillment of a physical order.<ref name=\"GeneralMethodology\"/>\n\n==Song charts==\n===''Rolling Stone'' Top 100===\nThe '''''Rolling Stone'' Top 100''' compiles the 100 most popular songs in the United States.
