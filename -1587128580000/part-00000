It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts.

His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 of his years which consists of 360-day years.
