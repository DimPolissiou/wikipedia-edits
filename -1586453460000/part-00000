When Houston joined the [[Southwest Conference]] in 1972, the two schools were conference mates until the conference dissolved in 1996. After a brief hiatus, SMU would join [[Conference USA]] in 2005 and the rivalry would continue when both schools moved to the [[American Athletic Conference]] in the midst of [[2010\u20132014 NCAA conference realignment]]. The two schools are the only [[Texas]] universities in the American, making the in-state rivalry all the more competitive. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedailycougar.com/2018/08/15/uh-rivalries/|title=UH rivalries you should know about|publisher=The Daily Cougar|accessdate=2019-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedailycougar.com/2018/08/15/uh-rivalries/|title=UH rivalries you should know about|publisher=The Daily Cougar|accessdate=2019-12-28}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry has intensified recently, especially in [[college football|football]].

Mustangs|Mustangs]]. When Houston joined the [[Southwest Conference]] in 1972, the two schools were conference mates until the conference dissolved in 1996. After a brief hiatus, SMU would join [[Conference USA]] in 2005 and the rivalry would continue when both schools moved to the [[American Athletic Conference]] in the midst of [[2010\u20132014 NCAA conference realignment]]. The two schools are the only [[Texas]] universities in the American, making the in-state rivalry all the more competitive. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedailycougar.com/2018/08/15/uh-rivalries/|title=UH rivalries you should know about|publisher=The Daily Cougar|accessdate=2019-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedailycougar.com/2018/08/15/uh-rivalries/|title=UH rivalries you should know about|publisher=The Daily Cougar|accessdate=2019-12-28}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry has intensified recently, especially in [[college football|football]].

Located north of the [[Gleniffer Braes]], the town borders the city of [[Glasgow]] to the east, and straddles the banks of the [[White Cart Water]], a tributary of the [[River Clyde]].\n\nIt serves as the [[administrative centre]] for the [[Renfrewshire]] [[council areas of Scotland|council area]], and is the largest town in the [[counties of Scotland|historic county]] of the [[Renfrewshire (historic)|same name]]. Paisley is often cited as \"Scotland's largest town\" and is the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|fifth largest settlement in the country]], although it does not have city status.\n\nThe town became prominent in the 12th century, with the establishment of [[Paisley Abbey]], an important religious hub which formerly had control over other local churches.\n\nBy the 19th century, Paisley was a centre of the [[weaving]] industry, giving its name to the [[Paisley shawl]] and the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley Pattern]]. The town's associations with political [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] were highlighted by its involvement in the [[Radical War]] of 1820, with striking weavers being instrumental in the protests. By 1993, all of Paisley's mills had closed, although they are memorialised in the town's museums and civic history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/scotgaz/towns/townfirst383.html|title=Paisley|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:(Coates Memorial Church, Paisley, Scotland) (LOC) (3449508871).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Coats Memorial Baptist Church]], Paisley, Scotland, ca. 1890\u20131900.]]\n[[File:PaisleyMap1923.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Paisley in early 1900s]]\nFormerly and variously known as ''Paislay'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47680 |title=Extracts from the records \u2013 1588 &#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=22 June 2003 }}</ref> ''Passelet'', ''Passeleth'', and ''Passelay''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=135820 |title=Paisley &#124; As described in F.H.

However, some Scottish place-name books suggest \"P\u00e6ssa's wood/clearing\", from the Old English personal name ''P\u00e6ssa'', \"clearing\", and ''le\u0101h'', \"wood\". Pasilege (1182) and Paslie (1214) are recorded previous spellings of the name. The Gaelic translation is ''P\u00e0islig''.\n[[File:Paisley mill.jpg|thumb|The Anchor Mills (1886) \u2013 a remnant of Paisley's Victorian industrial heritage.]]\nPaisley has monastic origins. A chapel is said to have been established by the 6th-/7th-century Irish monk, [[Saint Mirin]] at a site near a waterfall on the White Cart Water known as the Hammils. Though Paisley lacks contemporary documentation it may have been, along with [[Glasgow]] and [[Govan]], a major religious centre of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. A priory was established in 1163 from the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[priory]] at [[Wenlock Priory|Wenlock]] in Shropshire, England at the behest of [[Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland]] (d. 1177). In 1245 this was raised to the status of an Abbey. The restored [[Abbey]] and adjacent 'Place' (palace), constructed out of part of the medieval claustral buildings, survive as a [[Church of Scotland]] parish church. One of Scotland's major religious houses, [[Paisley Abbey]] was much favoured by the [[Bruce]] and [[Clan Stewart|Stewart]] royal families. King [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]] (1390\u20131406) was buried in the Abbey. His tomb has not survived, but that of Princess [[Marjorie Bruce]] (1296\u20131316), ancestor of the Stewarts, is one of [[Scotland]]'s few royal monuments to survive the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nPaisley coalesced under [[James II of Scotland|James II's]] wish that the lands should become a single regality and, as a result, markets, trading and commerce began to flourish. In 1488 the town's status was raised by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Burgh of barony]]. Many trades sprang up and the first school was established in 1577 by the Town Council.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Witch Trials===\nThe [[Paisley witches]], also known as the Bargarran witches or the Renfrewshire witches, were tried in Paisley in 1697. Seven were convicted and five were hanged and then burnt on the Gallow Green. Their remains were buried at Maxwelton Cross in the west end of the town.

Its location attracted English mill owners; immigrants from [[Ayrshire]] and the Highlands poured into a town that offered jobs to women and children. However, silk fell out of fashion in 1790.<ref>Kimberly Chrisman Campbell, \"Paisley Before the Shawl: The Scottish Silk Gauze Industry,\" ''Textile History'' (2002) 33#2 pp 162-176</ref> The mills switched to the imitation Kashmir (cashmere) [[shawl]]s called \"Paisley\". Under the leadership of [[Thomas Coats]] (1809-1893), Paisley became the world centre for thread making. The high-status skilled weavers mobilised themselves in radical protests after 1790, culminating in the failed \"Radical War\" of 1820. Overproduction, the collapse of the shawl market and a general depression in the textile industry led to technical changes that reduced the importance of weavers. Politically the mill owners remained in control of the town.<ref>A. Dickson and W. Speirs, \"Changes in Class Structure in Paisley, 1750-1845,\" ''Scottish Historical Review'' (1980) 59#1 pp 54-72.</ref>\n\n=== Origins of Paisley Shawls ===\nBy the mid-19th century weaving had become the town's principal industry. The Paisley weavers' most famous products were the shawls, which bore the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley Pattern]] made fashionable after being worn by a young [[Queen Victoria]]. Despite being of a [[Kashmir]]i design and manufactured in other parts of Europe, the teardrop-like pattern soon became known by Paisley's name across the western world.<ref name=\"renfrewshire1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/els-jh-TextileIndustry |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Textile industry |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |date=11 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315024436/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/els-jh-TextileIndustry |archivedate=15 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriana.com/library/paisley/shawl.html|title=Beyond the Fringe: Shawls of Paisley Design|last=Andrews|first=Meg|website=victoriana.com}}</ref> Although the shawls dropped out of fashion in the 1870s, the Paisley pattern remains an important symbol of the town: the Paisley Museum maintains a significant collection of the original shawls in this design, and it has been used, for example, in the modern logo of [[Renfrewshire Council]], the local authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/content/els-jcp-shawlscollection |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Textiles |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |date=5 May 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805151939/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/content/els-jcp-shawlscollection |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss,<ref>{{Cite book|last=L\u00e9vi-Strauss|first=Monique|title=Cachemires|publisher=Adam Biro|year=1987|isbn=2-87660-000-5|location=Paris|pages=7, 9, 43, 48}}</ref> informations on the history of Kashmir Shawls's weaving techniques had been described in books, but in a very unintelligible language. John Irwin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-john-irwin-1280546.html|title=Obituary: John Irwin|last=Irwin|first=John|date=1997|website=INDEPENDENT|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Irwin|first=John|title=Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences|publisher=|year=1955|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> published in 1955 a book named Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences, in which he relates the Kashmir Shawls history and how these Shawls spread on the European Market during the XIX\u00b0 century. The book showed images of Shawls woven in India and also 15 images of Shawls woven in United-Kingdom, amongst which one assigned to a Paisley Manufacture, circa 1850. But according to Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss, it resembles by many details a Shawl designed by a French designer named Antony Berrus, born in 1815 at N\u00eemes-France and died in 1883.<ref>{{Cite book|last=L\u00e9vi-Strauss|first=Monique|title=Cachemires|publisher=Adam Biro|year=1987|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=43}}</ref> The designer studied at the drawing School of N\u00eemes, before settling in Paris and opening in the French Capital his own successful design studio, which employed 200 designers. His textile drawings were sold to Lyon in France, in Scotland, in England, in Austria and also in Kashmir. The fact that Shawls patterns drawings were made in Europe, sold there and also to India, made as a result  the research work extremely difficult, as to give a precise location of manufacture. Therefore, in 1973, John Irwin published an update of his book, named as The Kashmir Shawl,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Irwin|first=John|title=The Kashmir Shawl|publisher=|year=1973|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> in which he removed all the images of the Shawls related to a European manufacturing. Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss clearly states that her research led her to focus on the Shawls Creative Industries in France in the XIX\u00b0 century, for the reason that the Shawl industries in the United-Kingdoms (Paisley), Austria (Vienna), Germany(Elberfeld) widely got their inspiration from France (Paris) and never the opposite. The Author was then inviting textile specialists from these countries to conduct research on their own field. However, Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss clearly specifies the large influence that Kashmir had on the French Shawl creative industries. So the French history of Kashmir Shawls is narrowly linked to the Indian one.\n\n===Political Radicalism===\nThrough its weaving fraternity, Paisley gained notoriety as being a literate and somewhat radical town and between 1816 and 1820 became the scene of a [[Radical War]]. Political intrigue, early trades unionism and reforming zeal came together to produce mass demonstrations, cavalry charges down the high street, public riots and trials for treason. Documentation from the period indicates that overthrow of the government was even contemplated by some.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowand|first=David|title=Pictorial History of Paisley|year=1993|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=978-1-84033-435-7|pages=4\u201317|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=549}}</ref> The weavers of Paisley were certainly active in the 'Radical War'. A mixture of religious opinions and healthy drink-fueled debate raged at night amongst the weavers, poets, merchants, masons and others. The perceived radical nature of the inhabitants prompted the Tory Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] to comment \"Keep your eye on Paisley\". The poet [[Robert Tannahill]] lived in this setting, working as a weaver. Paisley's annual Sma' Shot Day celebrations held on the first Saturday of July <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paisleyonline.co.uk/html/sma_shot.html |title=Paisley Online |publisher=paisleyonline.co.uk |date=7 July 2012 }}</ref> were initiated in 1856 to commemorate a 19th-century dispute between weavers and employers over payment for \"sma' shot\" \u2013 a small cotton thread which, although unseen, was necessary in holding together garments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/Navigation-els-SmaShotDayHomePage |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Sma' Shot Day |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817090809/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/Navigation-els-SmaShotDayHomePage |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of [[Paisley Barracks]] in 1822.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory383.html|title=Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and Historical|first=Francis H. |last=Groome |publisher= Thomas C. Jack, Grange Publishing Works, Edinburgh |year= 1882}}</ref>\n\n===Economic Hardship===\nThe economic crisis of 1841&ndash;43 hit Paisley hard as most of the mills shut down. Among the mill owners, 67 of 112 went bankrupt. A quarter of the population was on poor relief. The Prime Minister, Sir [[Robert Peel]] decided to act. He secured additional funds for relief and sent his own representative to the city to supervise its distribution. He convinced Queen Victoria to wear Paisley products in order to popularise the products and stimulate demand.<ref>Tony Dickson and Tony Clarke, \"Social Concern and Social Control in Nineteenth Century Scotland: Paisley 1841-1843,\"  ''Scottish Historical Review'' (1986) 65#1 pp 48-60.</ref>\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] of 1861&ndash;1865 [[King Cotton|cut off cotton supplies]] to the [[textile mill]]s of Paisley. The mills in 1861 had a stock of cotton in reserve, but by 1862 there was large-scale shortages and shutdowns. There were no alternative jobs for the workers, and local authorities refused to provide relief. Voluntary relief efforts were inadequate, and the unemployed workers refused to go to workhouses. Workers blamed not the United States, but rather the officials in London for their hardship and did not support the idea of war with the United States.<ref>Lorraine Peters, \"Paisley and the Cotton Famine of 1862\u20141863,\" ''Scottish Economic and Social History'' (2001) 21#2 pp 121-39</ref>\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:Paisley War Memorial.JPG|thumb|Paisley War Memorial]]\nPaisley suffered heavy losses in the [[First World War]]. The town's war memorial was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] (other sources say [[Harold Tarbolton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100213|title=Basic Biographical Details - Harold Ogle Tarbolton}}</ref>) in 1922 and depicts [[Robert the Bruce]] going into battle on horseback escorted by footsoldiers dressed as [[First World War]] infantry soldiers. It was sculpted by [[Alice Meredith Williams]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\n===Paisley Snail===\nPaisley was also the site of an incident that gave rise to a major legal precedent. In a Paisley cafe in 1928, a woman allegedly found a dead snail in a bottle of ginger beer, and became ill. She sued the manufacturer for negligence. At the time a manufacturer was considered liable only if there was a contract in place with the harmed party. However, after [[Donoghue v Stevenson]] wound through the courts, a precedent was established that manufacturers (and other \"neighbours\" or fellow citizens) owe a duty not to do foreseeable harm to others by negligence, regardless of contractual obligations, which paved the way for modern [[tort]] law. The case is often called the \"Paisley snail.\"\n\n===Second World War===\nOwing to its industrial roots, Paisley, like many industrial towns in [[Renfrewshire]], became a target for German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombers during [[World War II]]. Although it was not bombed as heavily as nearby [[Glasgow]] (see [[Clydebank Blitz]]), air raids still occurred periodically during the early years of the war, killing nearly a hundred people in several separate incidents; on 6 May 1941, a parachute mine was dropped in the early hours of the morning claiming 92 victims; this is billed the worst disaster in Paisley's history.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tale of Buddies who perished in World War II|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2011/01/19/tale-of-buddies-who-perished-in-world-war-ii-87085-28007301/|publisher=Paisley Daily Express|date=19 January 2011}}</ref> The [[Gleniffer Braes]], on the southern outskirts of Paisley, are home to a number of \"decoy ponds\" (mock airfields) used by the RAF after the [[Battle of Britain]] as part of a project code-named \"Starfish Decoy\" designed to confuse German spies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paisley's contribution to the Second World War|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/2011/10/17/paisley-s-contribution-to-the-second-world-war-87085-29596687/|publisher=Paisley Daily Express|date=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Industrial Decline===\nPaisley, as with other areas in Renfrewshire, was at one time famous for its [[weaving]] and [[textile industry|textile]] industries. As a consequence, the [[Paisley pattern]] has long symbolic associations with the town. Until the [[Jacquard loom]] was introduced in the 1820s, weaving was a [[cottage industry]]. This innovation led to the industrialisation of the process and many larger mills were created in the town. Also as a consequence of greater mechanisation, many weavers lost their livelihoods and left for Canada and Australia. Paisley was for many years a centre for the manufacture of cotton sewing [[yarn|thread]]. At the heyday of Paisley thread manufacture in the 1930s, there were 28,000 people employed in the huge Anchor and Ferguslie mills of J & P Coats Ltd, said to be the largest of their kind in the world at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120302.html |title=Coats Viyella |publisher=Archiveshub.ac.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719062445/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120302.html |archivedate=19 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the 1950s, the mills diversified into the production of synthetic threads but production diminished rapidly as a result of less expensive imports from overseas and the establishment of mills in [[India]] and [[Brazil]] by J & P Coats. By the end of the 1993, there was no thread being produced in Paisley. Both industries have left a permanent mark on the town in the form of the many places with textile related names, for example, Dyer's Wynd, Cotton Street, Thread Street, Shuttle Street, Lawn Street, Silk Street, Mill Street, Gauze Street and Incle Street.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe town also supported a number of engineering works some of which relied on the textile industry, others on [[shipbuilding]]. Paisley once had five shipyards including John Fullerton and Company (1866\u20131928), [[Bow, McLachlan and Company]] (1872\u20131932) and [[Fleming and Ferguson]] (1877\u20131969).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Brown & Polson's.JPG|thumb|left|Advertisement for Brown & Polson's, 1894]]\n[[File:Ferguslie Thread Works, Paisley, Scotland.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Ferguslie Thread Works in the 1867 Paris World Fair catalogue]]\n\nA number of food manufacture companies existed in Paisley. The preserve manufacturer [[James Robertson (grocer)|Robertsons]] began in Paisley as a grocer whose wife started making [[marmalade]] from oranges in 1860.<ref>{{harv|McCarthy|1988|p=98}}</ref> This product was successful and a factory was opened in Storie Street, Paisley, to produce it in 1866 and additional factories were later opened in Manchester, London and Bristol.<ref name=\"Moisley 1962 297\">{{harv|Moisley|Thain|1962|p=297}}</ref> The company was taken over by [[Rank Hovis McDougall]] who closed its Stevenson Street factory and transferred production to England in the 1970s.

There are some hills and ridges which have been absorbed as the town has expanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory383.html |title=Historical perspective for Paisley |publisher=Scottish-places.info }}</ref> The settlement is historically centred on Oakshaw, an area surrounding a hill to the north of the current High Street. Oakshaw is a [[conservation area]], and on the high ground many of Paisley's significant buildings can be found, such as the [[High Kirk]], the [[Coats Observatory, Paisley|Coats Observatory]] and the former John Neilson Institution, which was once a school and is now converted into residential flats.\n\nAround the centre there are a large number of older residential buildings. The town centre, Whitehaugh, Seedhill and Charleston areas contain many examples of [[tenement|Scottish tenement flats]]. Three to four storeys tall, with shops on the ground floor and constructed of local pale and red [[sandstone]], these tenement flats have been extensively restored and modernised over the last two decades{{when|date=June 2017}}.\n\nPaisley expanded steadily, particularly in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s, creating many suburbs. [[Castlehead, Paisley|Castlehead]] is a wooded [[conservation area]] primarily made up of Victorian villas where many of the town's leading industrialists made their homes in the late 19th century. [[Thornly Park]] is another conservation area, to the south of the town, just off Neilston Road heading towards [[Barrhead]]. It contains a variety of architecture ranging from [[mock Tudor]] to [[Art Deco]]. Many of the houses were designed by W. D. McLennan, a contemporary of [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]]. McLennan also designed several local churches such as St Matthew's and St Nazarene, which is located on Gordon Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nParticularly following the Housing Act 1946, modern Paisley grew into the surrounding countryside, and several large residential areas were created in the post-war period. These include portions of [[Glenburn, Paisley|Glenburn]] (south), [[Foxbar]] (south west), [[Ferguslie Park]] (north west), [[Gallowhill]] (North East) and Hunterhill (South East). [[Gockston]] in the far north of the town has many terraced houses, and after regeneration has many detached and semi-detached houses as well as several blocks of flats. [[Dykebar, Paisley|Dykebar]], to the south east of the town centre, is a residential area which is also the site of [[Dykebar Hospital]], a secure psychiatric hospital.\n\nOn the outskirts of the town are a number of settlements such as [[Ralston, Renfrewshire|Ralston]], a residential area in the far east bordering the city of [[Glasgow]].

Paisley Town Hall, adjacent to the Abbey, was funded by the will of [[George Aitken Clark]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clark, George Aitken|volume=10}}</ref> one of the Clark family, owners of the Anchor Mills. In competition, Sir Peter Coats funded the construction of the modern [[Paisley Museum and Art Gallery|Paisley Museum]] and Central Library (1871), also in a neo-Classical style. The Clarks and Coats families dominated Paisley industry until their companies merged in 1896.<ref name=\"renfrewshire1\"/> Renfrewshire's former County Buildings, Police Station and Jail on County Square have been since demolished, and the County Council then met in a newer neo-classical building which now houses Paisley Sheriff Court.\n\nRenfrewshire House, the modern headquarters of Renfrewshire Council, was constructed as Paisley Civic Centre. Designed by Hutchison, Locke and Monk following a competition, the building was designed to house offices of both the county and town councils. It was intended to become a civic hub for Paisley but the absence of any shops and non-council premises prevented this from happening.<ref>{{cite book| author = Frank Arneil Walker| title = The South Clyde estuary: an illustrated architectural guide to Inverclyde and Renfrew| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vOvbNQAACAAJ| year = 1986| publisher = Scottish Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-7073-0476-2 }}</ref> It became the home of the Renfrew sub-region of [[Strathclyde]] Regional Council in 1975 and of [[Renfrewshire]] Council in 1996.

The earliest surviving architecture is the south-east doorway in the nave from the cloister, which has a round arched doorway typical of Romanesque or Norman architecture which was the prevalent architectural style before the adoption of Gothic. The choir (east end) and tower date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are examples of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. They were reconstructed in three main phases of restorations with the tower and choir conforming to the designs of Dr Peter MacGregor Chalmers. The roof in the nave is the most recent of restorations with the plaster ceiling by Rev Dr Boog which was added in the 1790s being replaced by a timber roof in 1981.\n[[File:PaisleyCoatsChurch.jpg|thumb|Thomas Coats Memorial Church]]\n[[File:High Church - geograph.org.uk - 387075.jpg|thumb|Trinity Church (Episcopal)]]\n[[Thomas Coats Memorial Baptist Church]], named for the industrialist [[Thomas Coats]] (1809\u20131883), is an example of [[Gothic Revival architecture]].

The exterior is made of old red sandstone. Inside, the church is decorated with wood carvings, mosaic floors and marble fonts. The church also contains a 3040 pipe Hill Organ.\n\nThe [[St Mirin's Cathedral]] in Incle Street is the seat of the Catholic [[Bishop of Paisley]]. The church was completed in 1931 to replace an earlier building, in nearby East Buchanan Street, which dated from 1808. The original St Mirin's church was the first Catholic church to be built in Scotland since the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. With the erection of the [[Diocese of Paisley]] in 1947 the church was raised to cathedral status.\n\n[[St Matthew's Church, Paisley|St Matthew's Church]] ([[Church of the Nazarene]]) at the junction of Gordon Street and Johnston Street is [[Art Nouveau]] in style. Designed by local architect William Daniel McLennan, a contemporary of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], it was built in 1905\u201307.\n\n===Other===\nDating from circa 1160 [[Blackhall Manor]] is the oldest building in Paisley. It was given to the Burgh of Paisley by the Shaw-Stewart family in 1940, but was threatened with demolition in 1978.

It was moved from its original site at the corner of Neilston Road and Rowan Street to its present location in Brodie Park.

The [[further education]] college [[West College Scotland]] has a campus in the town; this institution was previously known as [[Reid Kerr College]].\n\nThere are currently four [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]] [[state school|state]] secondary schools in Paisley: [[Paisley Grammar School]], [[Castlehead High School]], St. Andrew's Academy and [[Gleniffer High School]]. The oldest of these is Paisley Grammar which was founded in 1576 and was one of two former [[grammar school]]s in the town \u2013 alongside the former John Neilson Institution (latterly John Neilson High School) founded in 1852. Other former secondary schools in the area include Merksworth High School (to the north west of the town), [[St Mirin's Academy]] or High School (on the west side of the town), St Aelred's High School and Stanely Green High School (both on the south side of the town). Of the current secondary schools in the town, all are [[non-denominational]] save for St Andrew's Academy which is a Roman Catholic school.\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:Saint Mirin's Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1191127.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Roman Catholic Cathedral of Saint Mirin]]\nPaisley is home to a number of religious denominations and is an important historical centre for the Christian faith in Scotland.

It served as an ecclesiastical centre for a wide area surrounding the county of [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]] for centuries until the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] when such religious centres were reduced to the status of [[parish church]]es. For the [[Church of Scotland]], Paisley forms part of the [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]] of Greenock and Paisley in the [[Synod]] of [[Clydesdale]] (''see: [[List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries]]'').\n\nOther Christian communities have a number of churches in Paisley, many of which were the result of the [[Industrial Revolution]] where people from around the [[British Isles]] came to Paisley for work.<ref name=\"paisley1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.paisley.org.uk/paisley-history/cradle-stewarts/ |title=The Cradle of the Stewarts &#124; Paisley Scotland |publisher=Paisley.org.uk }}</ref> The Roman Catholic [[Diocese of Paisley]], created in 1947, is centred upon the town's [[St Mirin's Cathedral]], the seat of the [[Bishop of Paisley]].

A chapel is said to have been established by the 6th-/7th-century Irish monk, [[Saint Mirin]] at a site near a waterfall on the White Cart Water known as the Hammils. Though Paisley lacks contemporary documentation it may have been, along with [[Glasgow]] and [[Govan]], a major religious centre of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. A priory was established in 1163 from the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[priory]] at [[Wenlock Priory|Wenlock]] in Shropshire, England at the behest of [[Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland]] (d. 1177). In 1245 this was raised to the status of an Abbey. The restored [[Abbey]] and adjacent 'Place' (palace), constructed out of part of the medieval claustral buildings, survive as a [[Church of Scotland]] parish church. One of Scotland's major religious houses, [[Paisley Abbey]] was much favoured by the [[Bruce]] and [[Clan Stewart|Stewart]] royal families. King [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]] (1390\u20131406) was buried in the Abbey. His tomb has not survived, but that of Princess [[Marjorie Bruce]] (1296\u20131316), ancestor of the Stewarts, is one of [[Scotland]]'s few royal monuments to survive the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nPaisley coalesced under [[James II of Scotland|James II's]] wish that the lands should become a single regality and, as a result, markets, trading and commerce began to flourish. In 1488 the town's status was raised by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Burgh of barony]]. Many trades sprang up and the first school was established in 1577 by the Town Council.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Witch Trials===\nThe [[Paisley witches]], also known as the Bargarran witches or the Renfrewshire witches, were tried in Paisley in 1697. Seven were convicted and five were hanged and then burnt on the Gallow Green. Their remains were buried at Maxwelton Cross in the west end of the town. This was the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe.<ref>Isabel Adam, ''Witch hunt: The Great Scottish Witchcraft Trials of 1697'' (1978)</ref> A horse shoe was placed on top of the site to lock in the evil.

Its location attracted English mill owners; immigrants from [[Ayrshire]] and the Highlands poured into a town that offered jobs to women and children. However, silk fell out of fashion in 1790.<ref>Kimberly Chrisman Campbell, \"Paisley Before the Shawl: The Scottish Silk Gauze Industry,\" ''Textile History'' (2002) 33#2 pp 162-176</ref> The mills switched to the imitation Kashmir (cashmere) [[shawl]]s called \"Paisley\". Under the leadership of [[Thomas Coats]] (1809-1893), Paisley became the world centre for thread making. The high-status skilled weavers mobilised themselves in radical protests after 1790, culminating in the failed \"Radical War\" of 1820. Overproduction, the collapse of the shawl market and a general depression in the textile industry led to technical changes that reduced the importance of weavers. Politically the mill owners remained in control of the town.<ref>A. Dickson and W. Speirs, \"Changes in Class Structure in Paisley, 1750-1845,\" ''Scottish Historical Review'' (1980) 59#1 pp 54-72.</ref>\n\n=== Origins of Paisley Shawls ===\nBy the mid-19th century weaving had become the town's principal industry. The Paisley weavers' most famous products were the shawls, which bore the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley Pattern]] made fashionable after being worn by a young [[Queen Victoria]]. Despite being of a [[Kashmir]]i design and manufactured in other parts of Europe, the teardrop-like pattern soon became known by Paisley's name across the western world.<ref name=\"renfrewshire1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/els-jh-TextileIndustry |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Textile industry |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |date=11 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315024436/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/els-jh-TextileIndustry |archivedate=15 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriana.com/library/paisley/shawl.html|title=Beyond the Fringe: Shawls of Paisley Design|last=Andrews|first=Meg|website=victoriana.com}}</ref> Although the shawls dropped out of fashion in the 1870s, the Paisley pattern remains an important symbol of the town: the Paisley Museum maintains a significant collection of the original shawls in this design, and it has been used, for example, in the modern logo of [[Renfrewshire Council]], the local authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/content/els-jcp-shawlscollection |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Textiles |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |date=5 May 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805151939/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/content/els-jcp-shawlscollection |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss,<ref>{{Cite book|last=L\u00e9vi-Strauss|first=Monique|title=Cachemires|publisher=Adam Biro|year=1987|isbn=2-87660-000-5|location=Paris|pages=7, 9, 43, 48}}</ref> informations on the history of Kashmir Shawls's weaving techniques had been described in books, but in a very unintelligible language. John Irwin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-john-irwin-1280546.html|title=Obituary: John Irwin|last=Irwin|first=John|date=1997|website=INDEPENDENT|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Irwin|first=John|title=Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences|publisher=|year=1955|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> published in 1955 a book named Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences, in which he relates the Kashmir Shawls history and how these Shawls spread on the European Market during the XIX\u00b0 century. The book showed images of Shawls woven in India and also 15 images of Shawls woven in United-Kingdom, amongst which one assigned to a Paisley Manufacture, circa 1850. But according to Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss, it resembles by many details a Shawl designed by a French designer named Antony Berrus, born in 1815 at N\u00eemes-France and died in 1883.<ref>{{Cite book|last=L\u00e9vi-Strauss|first=Monique|title=Cachemires|publisher=Adam Biro|year=1987|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=43}}</ref> The designer studied at the drawing School of N\u00eemes, before settling in Paris and opening in the French Capital his own successfull design studio, which employed 200 designers. His textile drawings were sold to Lyon in France, in Scotland, in England, in Austria and also in Kashmir. The fact that Shawls patterns drawings were made in Europe, sold there and also to India, made as a result  the research work extremely difficult, as to give a precise location of manufacture. Therefore in 1973, John Irwin published an update of his book, named as The Kashmir Shawl,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Irwin|first=John|title=The Kashmir Shawl|publisher=|year=1973|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> in which he removed all the images of the Shawls related to a European manufacturing. Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss clearly states that her research led her to focus on the Shawls Creative Industries in France in the XIX\u00b0 century, for the reason that the Shawl industries in the United-Kingdoms (Paisley), Austria (Vienna), Germany(Elberfeld) widely got their inspiration from France (Paris) and never the opposite. The Author was then inviting textile specialists from these countries to conduct research on their own field. However, Monique L\u00e9vi-Strauss clearly specifies the large influence that Kashmir had on the French Shawl creative industries. So the French history of Kashmir Shawls is narrowly linked to the Indian one.\n\n===Political Radicalism===\nThrough its weaving fraternity, Paisley gained notoriety as being a literate and somewhat radical town and between 1816 and 1820 became the scene of a [[Radical War]]. Political intrigue, early trades unionism and reforming zeal came together to produce mass demonstrations, cavalry charges down the high street, public riots and trials for treason. Documentation from the period indicates that overthrow of the government was even contemplated by some.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowand|first=David|title=Pictorial History of Paisley|year=1993|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=978-1-84033-435-7|pages=4\u201317|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=549}}</ref> The weavers of Paisley were certainly active in the 'Radical War'. A mixture of religious opinions and healthy drink-fueled debate raged at night amongst the weavers, poets, merchants, masons and others. The perceived radical nature of the inhabitants prompted the Tory Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] to comment \"Keep your eye on Paisley\". The poet [[Robert Tannahill]] lived in this setting, working as a weaver. Paisley's annual Sma' Shot Day celebrations held on the first Saturday of July <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paisleyonline.co.uk/html/sma_shot.html |title=Paisley Online |publisher=paisleyonline.co.uk |date=7 July 2012 }}</ref> were initiated in 1856 to commemorate a 19th-century dispute between weavers and employers over payment for \"sma' shot\" \u2013 a small cotton thread which, although unseen, was necessary in holding together garments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/Navigation-els-SmaShotDayHomePage |title=Renfrewshire Community Website \u2013 Sma' Shot Day |publisher=Renfrewshire.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817090809/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/ilwwcm/publishing.nsf/Content/Navigation-els-SmaShotDayHomePage |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of [[Paisley Barracks]] in 1822.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory383.html|title=Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and Historical|first=Francis H. |last=Groome |publisher= Thomas C. Jack, Grange Publishing Works, Edinburgh |year= 1882}}</ref>\n\n===Economic Hardship===\nThe economic crisis of 1841&ndash;43 hit Paisley hard as most of the mills shut down. Among the mill owners, 67 of 112 went bankrupt. A quarter of the population was on poor relief. The Prime Minister, Sir [[Robert Peel]] decided to act. He secured additional funds for relief and sent his own representative to the city to supervise its distribution. He convinced Queen Victoria to wear Paisley products in order to popularise the products and stimulate demand.<ref>Tony Dickson and Tony Clarke, \"Social Concern and Social Control in Nineteenth Century Scotland: Paisley 1841-1843,\"  ''Scottish Historical Review'' (1986) 65#1 pp 48-60.</ref>\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] of 1861&ndash;1865 [[King Cotton|cut off cotton supplies]] to the [[textile mill]]s of Paisley. The mills in 1861 had a stock of cotton in reserve, but by 1862 there was large-scale shortages and shutdowns. There were no alternative jobs for the workers, and local authorities refused to provide relief. Voluntary relief efforts were inadequate, and the unemployed workers refused to go to workhouses. Workers blamed not the United States, but rather the officials in London for their hardship and did not support the idea of war with the United States.<ref>Lorraine Peters, \"Paisley and the Cotton Famine of 1862\u20141863,\" ''Scottish Economic and Social History'' (2001) 21#2 pp 121-39</ref>\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:Paisley War Memorial.JPG|thumb|Paisley War Memorial]]\nPaisley suffered heavy losses in the [[First World War]]. The town's war memorial was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] (other sources say [[Harold Tarbolton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100213|title=Basic Biographical Details - Harold Ogle Tarbolton}}</ref>) in 1922 and depicts [[Robert the Bruce]] going into battle on horseback escorted by footsoldiers dressed as [[First World War]] infantry soldiers. It was sculpted by [[Alice Meredith Williams]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\n===Paisley Snail===\nPaisley was also the site of an incident that gave rise to a major legal precedent. In a Paisley cafe in 1928, a woman allegedly found a dead snail in a bottle of ginger beer, and became ill. She sued the manufacturer for negligence. At the time a manufacturer was considered liable only if there was a contract in place with the harmed party. However, after [[Donoghue v Stevenson]] wound through the courts, a precedent was established that manufacturers (and other \"neighbours\" or fellow citizens) owe a duty not to do foreseeable harm to others by negligence, regardless of contractual obligations, which paved the way for modern [[tort]] law. The case is often called the \"Paisley snail.\"\n\n===Second World War===\nOwing to its industrial roots, Paisley, like many industrial towns in [[Renfrewshire]], became a target for German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombers during [[World War II]]. Although it was not bombed as heavily as nearby [[Glasgow]] (see [[Clydebank Blitz]]), air raids still occurred periodically during the early years of the war, killing nearly a hundred people in several separate incidents; on 6 May 1941, a parachute mine was dropped in the early hours of the morning claiming 92 victims; this is billed the worst disaster in Paisley's history.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tale of Buddies who perished in World War II|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2011/01/19/tale-of-buddies-who-perished-in-world-war-ii-87085-28007301/|publisher=Paisley Daily Express|date=19 January 2011}}</ref> The [[Gleniffer Braes]], on the southern outskirts of Paisley, are home to a number of \"decoy ponds\" (mock airfields) used by the RAF after the [[Battle of Britain]] as part of a project code-named \"Starfish Decoy\" designed to confuse German spies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paisley's contribution to the Second World War|url=http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/2011/10/17/paisley-s-contribution-to-the-second-world-war-87085-29596687/|publisher=Paisley Daily Express|date=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Industrial Decline===\nPaisley, as with other areas in Renfrewshire, was at one time famous for its [[weaving]] and [[textile industry|textile]] industries. As a consequence, the [[Paisley pattern]] has long symbolic associations with the town. Until the [[Jacquard loom]] was introduced in the 1820s, weaving was a [[cottage industry]]. This innovation led to the industrialisation of the process and many larger mills were created in the town. Also as a consequence of greater mechanisation, many weavers lost their livelihoods and left for Canada and Australia. Paisley was for many years a centre for the manufacture of cotton sewing [[yarn|thread]]. At the heyday of Paisley thread manufacture in the 1930s, there were 28,000 people employed in the huge Anchor and Ferguslie mills of J & P Coats Ltd, said to be the largest of their kind in the world at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120302.html |title=Coats Viyella |publisher=Archiveshub.ac.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719062445/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120302.html |archivedate=19 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the 1950s, the mills diversified into the production of synthetic threads but production diminished rapidly as a result of less expensive imports from overseas and the establishment of mills in [[India]] and [[Brazil]] by J & P Coats. By the end of the 1993, there was no thread being produced in Paisley. Both industries have left a permanent mark on the town in the form of the many places with textile related names, for example, Dyer's Wynd, Cotton Street, Thread Street, Shuttle Street, Lawn Street, Silk Street, Mill Street, Gauze Street and Incle Street.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe town also supported a number of engineering works some of which relied on the textile industry, others on [[shipbuilding]]. Paisley once had five shipyards including John Fullerton and Company (1866\u20131928), [[Bow, McLachlan and Company]] (1872\u20131932) and [[Fleming and Ferguson]] (1877\u20131969).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Brown & Polson's.JPG|thumb|left|Advertisement for Brown & Polson's, 1894]]\n[[File:Ferguslie Thread Works, Paisley, Scotland.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Ferguslie Thread Works in the 1867 Paris World Fair catalogue]]\n\nA number of food manufacture companies existed in Paisley.

There are some hills and ridges which have been absorbed as the town has expanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory383.html |title=Historical perspective for Paisley |publisher=Scottish-places.info }}</ref> The settlement is historically centred on Oakshaw, an area surrounding a hill to the north of the current High Street. Oakshaw is a [[conservation area]], and on the high ground many of Paisley's significant buildings can be found, such as the [[High Kirk]], the [[Coats Observatory, Paisley|Coats Observatory]] and the former John Neilson Institution, which was once a school and is now converted into residential flats.\n\nAround the centre there are a large number of older residential buildings. The town centre, Whitehaugh, Seedhill and Charleston areas contain many examples of [[tenement|Scottish tenement flats]]. Three to four storeys tall, with shops on the ground floor and constructed of local pale and red [[sandstone]], these tenement flats have been extensively restored and modernised over the last two decades{{when|date=June 2017}}.\n\nPaisley expanded steadily, particularly in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s, creating many suburbs. [[Castlehead, Paisley|Castlehead]] is a wooded [[conservation area]] primarily made up of Victorian villas where many of the town's leading industrialists made their homes in the late 19th century. [[Thornly Park]] is another conservation area, to the south of the town, just off Neilston Road heading towards [[Barrhead]]. It contains a variety of architecture ranging from [[mock Tudor]] to [[Art Deco]]. Many of the houses were designed by W. D. McLennan, a contemporary of [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]]. McLennan also designed several local churches such as St Matthew's and St Nazarene, which is located on Gordon Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nParticularly following the Housing Act 1946, modern Paisley grew into the surrounding countryside, and several large residential areas were created in the post-war period. These include portions of [[Glenburn, Paisley|Glenburn]] (south), [[Foxbar]] (south west), [[Ferguslie Park]] (north west), [[Gallowhill]] (North East) and Hunterhill (South East).

Paisley Town Hall, adjacent to the Abbey, was funded by the will of [[George Aitken Clark]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clark, George Aitken|volume=10}}</ref> one of the Clark family, owners of the Anchor Mills. In competition, Sir Peter Coats funded the construction of the modern [[Paisley Museum and Art Gallery|Paisley Museum]] and Central Library (1871), also in a neo-Classical style. The Clarks and Coats families dominated Paisley industry until their companies merged in 1896.<ref name=\"renfrewshire1\"/> Renfrewshire's former County Buildings, Police Station and Jail on County Square have been since demolished, and the County Council then met in a newer neo-classical building which now houses Paisley Sheriff Court.\n\nRenfrewshire House, the modern headquarters of Renfrewshire Council, was constructed as Paisley Civic Centre. Designed by Hutchison, Locke and Monk following a competition, the building was designed to house offices of both the county and town councils. It was intended to become a civic hub for Paisley but the absence of any shops and non-council premises prevented this from happening.<ref>{{cite book| author = Frank Arneil Walker| title = The South Clyde estuary: an illustrated architectural guide to Inverclyde and Renfrew| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vOvbNQAACAAJ| year = 1986| publisher = Scottish Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-7073-0476-2 }}</ref> It became the home of the Renfrew sub-region of [[Strathclyde]] Regional Council in 1975 and of [[Renfrewshire]] Council in 1996.

The earliest surviving architecture is the south-east doorway in the nave from the cloister, which has a round arched doorway typical of Romanesque or Norman architecture which was the prevalent architectural style before the adoption of Gothic. The choir (east end) and tower date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are examples of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. They were reconstructed in three main phases of restorations with the tower and choir conforming to the designs of Dr Peter MacGregor Chalmers. The roof in the nave is the most recent of restorations with the plaster ceiling by Rev Dr Boog which was added in the 1790s being replaced by a timber roof in 1981.\n[[File:PaisleyCoatsChurch.jpg|thumb|Thomas Coats Memorial Church]]\n[[File:High Church - geograph.org.uk - 387075.jpg|thumb|Trinity Church (Episcopal)]]\n[[Thomas Coats Memorial Baptist Church]], named for the industrialist [[Thomas Coats]] (1809\u20131883), is an example of [[Gothic Revival architecture]].

The exterior is made of old red sandstone. Inside, the church is decorated with wood carvings, mosaic floors and marble fonts. The church also contains a 3040 pipe Hill Organ.\n\nThe [[St Mirin's Cathedral]] in Incle Street is the seat of the Catholic [[Bishop of Paisley]]. The church was completed in 1931 to replace an earlier building, in nearby East Buchanan Street, which dated from 1808. The original St Mirin's church was the first Catholic church to be built in Scotland since the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. With the erection of the [[Diocese of Paisley]] in 1947 the church was raised to cathedral status.\n\n[[St Matthew's Church, Paisley|St Matthew's Church]] ([[Church of the Nazarene]]) at the junction of Gordon Street and Johnston Street is [[Art Nouveau]] in style. Designed by local architect William Daniel McLennan, a contemporary of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], it was built in 1905\u201307.\n\n===Other===\nDating from circa 1160 [[Blackhall Manor]] is the oldest building in Paisley. It was given to the Burgh of Paisley by the Shaw-Stewart family in 1940, but was threatend with demolition in 1978.

The oldest of these is Paisley Grammar which was founded in 1576 and was one of two former [[grammar school]]s in the town \u2013 alongside the former John Neilson Institution (latterly John Neilson High School) founded in 1852. Other former secondary schools in the area include Merksworth High School (to the north west of the town), [[St Mirin's Academy]] or High School (on the west side of the town), St Aelred's High School and Stanely Green High School (both on the south side of the town). Of the current secondary schools in the town, all are [[non-denominational]] save for St Andrew's Academy which is a Roman Catholic school.\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:Saint Mirin's Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1191127.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Roman Catholic Cathedral of Saint Mirin]]\nPaisley is home to a number of religious denominations and is an important historical centre for the Christian faith in Scotland.

The Riviera Maya includes the municipalities of Solidaridad in the north and Tulum in the south, and extends approximately {{convert|40|km}} inland, to the border with the state of [[Yucat\u00e1n]].\n\n==Tourism==\nThe Riviera Maya is famous for its large scale [[all-inclusive resort]]s and a historical tourism base of smaller boutique hotels as well as the many fine-dining restaurants available along the Fed 307 and on or near the beaches. Luxury travel entities have been instrumental in increasing luxury villa rentals and yacht charters in the area however these only represent a small fraction of the total tourism accommodation available.\n\nGovernment development plans include establishing a number of medium-sized cities of ~200,000 inhabitants within the Riviera Maya with initial planning spanning 20 years. Target areas for urbanization include the towns and villages of: [[Puerto Morelos]], the Riviera Maya), [[Puerto Aventuras]], [[Akumal]], [https://travelyucatan.com/chemuyil-mexico/ Chemuyil], and [[Tulum, Quintana Roo|Tulum]].\n\nA major attraction throughout the Riviera Maya are coastal and reef aquatic activities dependent on the coastal water and the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]] (also known as the [[Belize Barrier Reef]]) which begins near Cancun and continues along the whole length of the Riviera Maya continuing southward to Guatemala. This barrier reef system is the second longest in the world<ref>{{Citation|title=Belize Barrier Reef|date=2020-03-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belize_Barrier_Reef&oldid=944634092|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>.\n\nActivities at the most visited locations include [[Personal water craft|jet-skiing]], [[snorkeling]], [[scuba diving]], swimming in [[cenote]]s, [[swimming with dolphins]], [[Zip-line|zip-lining]], [[horse]] riding, sailing, and guided jungle tours.

The climate is dominated by a rainy season from May through November, and within the dry season there is a period dominated by northerly winds, called El Norte, which usually occurs in the months of January and February.

While the Caribbean coast of the Yucat\u00e1n experiences a large number of [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricane]]s, the storm tracks and therefore landfalls of these are divergent to both the north (Cancun) and the south (south of Tulum and down to [[Belize]]) striking generally outside the Riviera Maya. Groundwater and therefore cenote water temperatures are {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} year round. Coastal waters range from {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in August.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Punta Maroma3.tif|right|thumb|[[Punta Maroma]], Riviera Maya, Mexico]]\nThe Riviera Maya is completely within the state of [[Quintana Roo]] on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico. The terrain is flat and covered by low tropical jungle. The geology is high purity carbonates down to a depth of 0.5 - 1.5&nbsp;km below the surface. Mean annual rainfall is 1.5 m per year and the efficient infiltration results in the complete absence of any surface rivers. As is common in [[karst]], underground river networks have formed by dissolution, and these have been explored and mapped by [[cave diving]] through [[sinkhole]] collapses, locally called [[cenote]]s. The whole of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is underlain by a density-stratified coastal aquifer system with a lens-shaped freshwater body floating on top of intruding saline water.

It straddles the coastal [[Mexican Federal Highway 307|Federal Highway 307]], along the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coastline of the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Quintana Roo]], located in the eastern portion of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]].

At the time, he was the [[municipal president]] of [[Solidaridad, Quintana Roo]]. The Riviera Maya includes the municipalities of Solidaridad in the north and Tulum in the south, and extends approximately {{convert|40|km}} inland, to the border with the state of [[Yucat\u00e1n]].\n\n==Tourism==\nThe Riviera Maya is famous for its large scale [[all-inclusive resort]]s and a historical tourism base of smaller boutique hotels as well as the many fine-dining restaurants available along the Fed 307 and on or near the beaches. Luxury travel entities have been instrumental in increasing luxury villa rentals and yacht charters in the area however these only represent a small fraction of the total tourism accommodation available.\n\nGovernment development plans include establishing a number of medium-sized cities of ~200,000 inhabitants within the Riviera Maya with initial planning spanning 20 years. Target areas for urbanization include the towns and villages of: [[Puerto Morelos]], the Riviera Maya), [[Puerto Aventuras]], [[Akumal]], [https://travelyucatan.com/chemuyil-mexico/ Chemuyil], and [[Tulum, Quintana Roo|Tulum]].\n\nA major attraction throughout the Riviera Maya are coastal and reef aquatic activities dependent on the coastal water and the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]] (also known as the [[Belize Barrier Reef]]) which begins near Cancun and continues along the whole length of the Riviera Maya continuing southward to Guatemala. This barrier reef system is the second longest in the world<ref>{{Citation|title=Belize Barrier Reef|date=2020-03-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belize_Barrier_Reef&oldid=944634092|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>.\n\nActivities at the most visited locations include [[Personal water craft|jet-skiing]], [[snorkeling]], [[scuba diving]], swimming in [[cenote]]s, [[swimming with dolphins]], [[Zip-line|zip-lining]], [[horse]] riding, sailing, and guided jungle tours. [[Archeology]] is also a big tourist draw in the area, including the popular archeological sites operated by the Instituto [https://www.inah.gob.mx/ Nacional de Antropologia y Historia] such as [[Tulum]] on the coast, and [[Chichen Itza]] and [[Coba]] located some distance inland.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Matt|title=Mayan Ruins of Mexico|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/mayan-ruins-mexico-4203.html|accessdate=15 May 2017|publisher=USA Today}}</ref> The self-named ecoparks of [[Xcaret Park|Xcaret]] and [[Xel-Ha Park|Xel-Ha]] also include some smaller archeological ruins as part of their attractions, but these natural water theme parks operated by private business consortia attract much larger crowds due to the diversity and range of activities provided, such as swimming with captive dolphins.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xcaret Eco Park - Nature Theme Park|url=https://www.locogringo.com/mexico/ways-to-play/riviera-maya/eco-adventure-parks/xcaret/|website=Loco Gringo|accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Lisa|title=Our Top 5 Tips for Xcaret Park|url=https://www.playadelcarmen.com/blog/xcaret-park-top-5-tips|website=PlayadelCarmen.com|accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe mean annual temperature is {{convert|24|-|25|C|F}}. The climate is dominated by a rainy season from May through November, and within the dry season there is a period dominated by northerly winds, called El Norte, which usually occurs in the months of January and February. The maximum mean annual precipitation throughout the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] occurs along the coast of the Riviera Maya with {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} of rainfall with a general decline to the NW with only {{convert|400|mm|ft}} per year or less on the opposite side of the Peninsula. While the Caribbean coast of the Yucat\u00e1n experiences a large number of [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricane]]s, the storm tracks and therefore landfalls of these are divergent to both the north (Cancun) and the south (south of Tulum and down to [[Belize]]) striking generally outside the Riviera Maya. Groundwater and therefore cenote water temperatures are {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} year round. Coastal waters range from {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in August.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Punta Maroma3.tif|right|thumb|[[Punta Maroma]], Riviera Maya, Mexico]]\nThe Riviera Maya is completely within the state of [[Quintana Roo]] on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico. The terrain is flat and covered by low tropical jungle. The geology is high purity carbonates down to a depth of 0.5 - 1.5&nbsp;km below the surface. Mean annual rainfall is 1.5 m per year and the efficient infiltration results in the complete absence of any surface rivers. As is common in [[karst]], underground river networks have formed by dissolution, and these have been explored and mapped by [[cave diving]] through [[sinkhole]] collapses, locally called [[cenote]]s. The whole of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is underlain by a density-stratified coastal aquifer system with a lens-shaped freshwater body floating on top of intruding saline water. The formation of caves ([[speleogenesis]]) within this coastal carbonate aquifer is principally associated with carbonate dissolution at the fresh-saline water contact within the aquifer.

Nagoshi, who had previously worked under [[Sega AM2]]'s [[Yu Suzuki]] and been credited as the creator of the arcade titles ''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona USA]]'' and ''[[Virtua Striker]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/sega_toshihiro_nagoshi_iv_jun06_p3.asp|title=Toshihiro Nagoshi Interview Summer 2006|work=Kikizo|date=June 22, 2006|accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.segasammy.co.jp/japanese/ir/library/pdf/printing_archive/2002/sega/sega_annual_tuuki_2002.pdf|title=Sega Corporation Annual Report 2002|publisher=Sega Corporation|page=18|date=July 2002|accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref> devised the concept of rolling spheres through [[maze]]s based on his desire to create a game that was instantly possible to understand and play, as a contrast to increasingly complex games at Japanese arcades at the time. AV developed it initially as an arcade title, ''Monkey Ball''. ''Monkey Ball'' was first released in Japanese arcades in June 2001, and then received an upgraded version \u2014 ''[[Super Monkey Ball (video game)|Super Monkey Ball]]'' \u2014 as a GameCube launch title in all regions.\n\nAfter the success of the first ''Super Monkey Ball'', it spawned a direct sequel on the GameCube. Following that, a collaboration with [[Nintendo]] happened. AV would develop ''[[F-Zero GX]]'', while Nintendo would be responsible for the supervision of their IP. In the end, Nintendo was impressed with the product, considering it a step forward for the ''[[F-Zero]]'' franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115191254/http://cube.ign.com/articles/427/427647p2.html|title=IGN: The F-Zero Press Conference|date=January 15, 2008|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''F-Zero GX'', the non-sports staff of [[Smilebit]] (developers of games like  ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]'' and ''[[Panzer Dragoon Orta]]'' on [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]) would be merged with Amusement Vision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/news/200307/037.asp|title=Kikizo &#124; News: Sega Studio Mergers: Full Details|website=archive.videogamesdaily.com}}</ref> It is worth mentioning that Smilebit merged into AV, as the latter still got to keep their name. The only two projects (which still kept the AV moniker) were the arcade title, ''[[Ollie King]]'' in March 2004, and ''[[Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon]]'' in June 2004 on the [[Game Boy Advance]].\n\nBy July 2004, Amusement Vision was dissolved as part of the [[New Entertainment R&D Dept.]], and the development of ''[[Yakuza (video game)|Yakuza]]'' started. The first ''Yakuza'' game had a difficult development cycle, as the first pitch was rejected by the higher-ups, due to expecting something different out of Nagoshi. At the time, Sega and [[Sammy Corporation|Sammy]] merged to form [[Sega Sammy Holdings]]. The new owner and CEO of Sega Sammy, [[Hajime Satomi]] saw footage of ''Yakuza'' that was forcibly sneaked in a preview of upcoming Sega games, even tough it wasn't officially a project yet. Satomi took an interrest in it although the Sega executives were unhappy about this move. Through perseverance however, Nagoshi managed to get the project started.\n\nThe project was risky with a high budget and many people working on it, and there was no estimate on how the market would accept a game aimed at only adult Japanese males, based in the Japanese underworld. The highest estimate was only 70.000 copies in Japan. However, over time, the game sold over 1 million copies. Nagoshi said that it gave the team confidence to press on and continue to evolve into a series. The staff from Amusement Vision and Smilebit worked on many different console and arcade games and they had confidence in their genres and careers. However, ''Yakuza'' did not match not any of their past experiences. Every element of the game had to go through Nagoshi first. When the game grew into a franchise, the staff gained more freedom and independence which elements to put into the game, due to established rules by Nagoshi. Therefore, the games become more varied as the series went on. The initial target of adult Japanese males expanded into females and also overseas players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.siliconera.com/yakuza-director-says-20-players-female-theyll-still-keep-manly-series/|title=Yakuza Director Says 20% Of Their Players Are Female, But They\u2019ll Still Keep It A Manly Series|last=Sato|first=|date=|website=Siliconera|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nNagoshi says that the development team of the ''Yakuza'' series always neeeds to have a sense of challenge. For ''Yakuza 2'', they first thought about having a two-year development cycle, however after discussion, it was thought that releasing and developing the game just one year later would be better to keep audiences attention, even tough it meant more work for them.

It was spun off from Sega CS1 R&D after the development of ''[[Yakuza: Dead Souls]]'' was completed. The very first game to use the studio's original logo was ''[[Binary Domain]]'' in Japan, released in February 2012.\n\nEventually, the RGG Studio's logo became used consistently and the way they brand themselves and give themselves an identity of their own. \n\nAccording to Masayoshi Yokoyama, one of the leads of the studio, the studio is not a company organization but rather a \"concept\" or a \"production team\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201507/30082564.html|title=\u3010\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\uff01\u4f1a\u793e\u63a2\u8a2a(27)\u3011\u6975\u4e0a\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u4f5c\u54c1\u300e\u9f8d\u304c\u5982\u304f\u300f\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u624b\u304c\u3051\u308b\u30bb\u30ac\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9 \u30b3\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30ab\u30f3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u3092\u8a2a\u554f|website=\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a.com}}</ref> Nevertheless, the studio's logo and name have become more recognizable internationally, and the logo has been used consistently.\n\n==History==\nThough the RGG Studio logo was only officially established in late August 2011, and first used to promote ''[[Binary Domain]]'' in Japan back in February 2012, the studio's origins can very much be traced back to the first 2 ''[[Super Monkey Ball]]'' titles on the [[GameCube]].\n\nIn 2000, [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]] was the president of AV ([[Amusement Vision]]), whose their first title on [[home consoles]] was actually a remake of Nagoshi's ''Daytona USA'', as ''[[Daytona USA 2001]]'' on the [[Dreamcast]]. Nagoshi, who had previously worked under [[Sega AM2]]'s [[Yu Suzuki]] and been credited as the creator of the arcade titles ''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona USA]]'' and ''[[Virtua Striker]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/sega_toshihiro_nagoshi_iv_jun06_p3.asp|title=Toshihiro Nagoshi Interview Summer 2006|work=Kikizo|date=June 22, 2006|accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.segasammy.co.jp/japanese/ir/library/pdf/printing_archive/2002/sega/sega_annual_tuuki_2002.pdf|title=Sega Corporation Annual Report 2002|publisher=Sega Corporation|page=18|date=July 2002|accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref> devised the concept of rolling spheres through [[maze]]s based on his desire to create a game that was instantly possible to understand and play, as a contrast to increasingly complex games at Japanese arcades at the time. AV developed it initially as an arcade title, ''Monkey Ball''. ''Monkey Ball'' was first released in Japanese arcades in June 2001, and then received an upgraded version \u2014 ''[[Super Monkey Ball (video game)|Super Monkey Ball]]'' \u2014 as a GameCube launch title in all regions.\n\nAfter the success of the first ''Super Monkey Ball'', it spawned a direct sequel on the GameCube. Following that, a collaboration with [[Nintendo]] happened. AV would develop ''[[F-Zero GX]]'', while Nintendo would be responsible for the supervision of their IP. In the end, Nintendo was impressed with the product, considering it a step forward for the ''[[F-Zero]]'' franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115191254/http://cube.ign.com/articles/427/427647p2.html|title=IGN: The F-Zero Press Conference|date=January 15, 2008|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''F-Zero GX'', the non-sports staff of [[Smilebit]] (developers of games like  ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]'' and ''[[Panzer Dragoon Orta]]'' on [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]) would be merged with Amusement Vision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/news/200307/037.asp|title=Kikizo &#124; News: Sega Studio Mergers: Full Details|website=archive.videogamesdaily.com}}</ref> It is worth mentioning that Smilebit merged into AV, as the latter still got to keep their name. The only two projects (which still kept the AV moniker) were the arcade title, ''[[Ollie King]]'' in March 2004, and ''[[Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon]]'' in June 2004 on the [[Game Boy Advance]].\n\nBy July 2004, Amusement Vision was dissolved as part of the [[New Entertainment R&D Dept.]], and the development of ''[[Yakuza (video game)|Yakuza]]'' started. The first ''Yakuza'' game had a difficult development cycle, as the first pitch was rejected by the higher-ups, due to expecting something different out of Nagoshi. At the time, Sega and [[Sammy Corporation|Sammy]] merged together to form [[Sega Sammy Holdings]]. The new owner and CEO of Sega Sammy, [[Hajime Satomi]] saw footage of ''Yakuza'' that was forcibly sneaked in a preview of upcoming Sega games, even tough it wasn't officially a project yet. Satomi took an interrest in it altough the Sega executives were unhappy about this move. Through perseverance however, Nagoshi managed to get the project started.\n\nThe project was risky with a high budget and many people working on it, and there was no estimate on how the market would accept a game aimed at only adult Japanese males, based in the Japanese underworld. The highest estimate was only 70.000 copies in Japan. However, over time, the game sold over 1 million copies. Nagoshi said that it gave the team confidence to press on and continue to evolve into a series. The staff from Amusement Vision and Smilebit worked on many different console and arcade games and they had confidence in their genres and careers. However, ''Yakuza'' did not match not any of their past experiences. Every element of the game had to go through Nagoshi first. When the game grew into a franchise, the staff gained more freedom and indepedence which elements to put into the game, due to established rules by Nagoshi. Therefore the games become more varied as the series went on. The initial target of adult Japanese males expanded into females and also overseas players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.siliconera.com/yakuza-director-says-20-players-female-theyll-still-keep-manly-series/|title=Yakuza Director Says 20% Of Their Players Are Female, But They\u2019ll Still Keep It A Manly Series|last=Sato|first=|date=|website=Siliconera|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nNagoshi says that the development team of the ''Yakuza'' series always neeeds to have a sense of challenge. For ''Yakuza 2'', they first thought about having a two year development cycle, however after discussion, it was thought that releasing and developing the game just one year later would be better to keep audiences attention, even tough it meant more work for them. For the first spin-off ''[[Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Kenzan!|Ryu Ga Gotoku Kenzan]]'', the team initially made fun of Nagoshis goal of making the game for the new [[PlayStation 3]] while also moving to a different setting.
