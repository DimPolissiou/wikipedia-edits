A spiritual successor to 2003's ''[[Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]]'', ''Star Citizen'' is being led by director [[Chris Roberts (video game developer)|Chris Roberts]] and has become highly controversial during its production. Development of the game began in 2011 and was announced in 2013 through a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign which drew in over US$2 million. While its launch was originally anticipated for 2014, significant expansion of gameplay features and scope have led to repeated delays. In 2013, Cloud Imperium Games began releasing parts of the game, known as \"modules\", to provide players with the opportunity to experience gameplay features prior to release. The latest of these modules, known as the \"Persistent Universe\", was released in 2015 and continues to receive updates.\n\nThe game is noted for being the highest crowdfunded video game and one of the [[List of highest-funded crowdfunding projects|highest-funded crowdfunding projects]] overall. Cloud Imperium Games' methods of generating crowdfunded revenue has led to criticisms and legal issues surrounding the project, though the company still actively campaigns for funding through the sale of ships, land claims, and other in-game items.\n\n''Squadron 42'', a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] game set in the same universe, was initially announced as an included campaign in ''Star Citizen''<nowiki/>'s Kickstarter announcement, but has since been separated into a standalone release.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Star Citizen'' combines features from [[Space flight simulation game|space simulator]], [[First-person shooter|first person shooter]], and [[Massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer online]] genres across its four playable modes. These modes, called modules, provide different player experiences from one another. Three of the modules, Hangar, Arena Commander, and Star Marine, provide examples of gameplay features that would appear in the Persistent Universe module, but also have their own mechanics.\n\n=== Hangar module ===\nThe Hangar Module is the first mode of ''Star Citizen'', released on August 29, 2013.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|last=Davies|first=Kevin|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/star-citizen-hangar-module,24065.html|title=Chris Roberts' Star Citizen Hangar Module Goes Live|date=August 29, 2013|work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=live|language=en}}</ref> While in the Hangar Module, players can explore or modify their purchased ships that have been publicly released and interact with the ship's systems, though no flying options are available in the module.

He argued that changes to the game would limit his ability to play due to disability. In court, Cloud Imperium Games argued that the backer's involvement in an early tester program called \"Evocati\" proved that they were actively providing a product to him. When an [[arbitration]] clause from the project's terms of service was brought up, the backer argued that he was covered under the original terms of service as he had backed the project prior to changes to the terms of service. Cloud Imperium Games provided evidence that a \"vast majority\" of the backer's purchases were made after the change and that he would have had to accept the revised terms of service when making any new purchase.

A spiritual successor to 2003's ''[[Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]]'', ''Star Citizen'' is being led by director [[Chris Roberts (video game developer)|Chris Roberts]] and has become highly controversial during its production. Development of the game began in 2011 and was announced in 2013 through a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign which drew in over US$2 million. While its launch was originally anticipated for 2014, significant expansion of gameplay features and scope have led to repeated delays. In 2013, Cloud Imperium Games began releasing parts of the game, known as \"modules\", to provide players with the opportunity to experience gameplay features prior to release. The latest of these modules, known as the \"Persistent Universe\", was released in 2015 and continues to receive updates.\n\nThe game is noted for being the highest crowdfunded video game and one of the [[List of highest-funded crowdfunding projects|highest-funded crowdfunding projects]] overall. Cloud Imperium Games' methods of generating crowdfunded revenue has led to criticisms and legal issues surrounding the project, though the company still actively campaigns for funding through the sale of ships, land claims, and other in-game items.\n\n''Squadron 42'', a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] game set in the same universe, was initially announced as an included campaign in ''Star Citizen''<nowiki/>'s Kickstarter announcement, but has since been separated into a standalone release.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Star Citizen'' combines features from [[Space flight simulation game|space simulator]], [[First-person shooter|first person shooter]], and [[Massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer online]] genres across its four playable modes. These modes, called modules, provide different player experiences from one another. Three of the modules, Hangar, Arena Commander, and Star Marine, provide examples of gameplay features that would appear in the Persistent Universe module, but also have their own mechanics.\n\n=== Hangar module ===\nThe Hangar Module is the first mode of ''Star Citizen'', released on August 29, 2013.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|last=Davies|first=Kevin|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/star-citizen-hangar-module,24065.html|title=Chris Roberts' Star Citizen Hangar Module Goes Live|date=August 29, 2013|work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=live|language=en}}</ref> While in the Hangar Module, players can explore or modify their purchased ships that have been publicly released and interact with the ship's systems, though no flying options are available in the module.

According to ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', \"an  internal survey posted on the ''Star Citizen'' message boards revealed as many as 25 percent of the game's backers expressing an interest in a process for getting their money back.

In the previous terms of service, backers could procure a refund if the game had not been released within 18 months of its original estimated delivery date. The revision changed the terms to reflect that backers could only procure refunds if the project was abandoned by developers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-21-star-citizen-terms-of-service-update-makes-it-a-bit-harder-to-get-a-refund|title=Star Citizen Terms of Service update makes it a bit harder to get a refund|last=Purchese|first=Robert|date=2016-06-21|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> Exceptions to this change covered backers who spent money prior to the terms change and stated that they would retain the 18 month clause if they pursued a refund.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/06/20/star-citizen-changes-terms-of-service-to-make-it-more-difficult-to-get-a-refund|title=Star Citizen Changes Terms of Service to Make it More Difficult to Get a Refund|website=Kotaku UK|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> A month later, it was reported that a backer filed a formal complaint to both the [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]] and the Los Angeles Country Department of Consumer and Business Affairs after his attempts to gain a refund failed following the terms of service change. The backer stated that they had initially been interested in the project for its [[virtual reality]] support, which would help them enjoy the game with their disability. Upon postponement of virtual reality support and changes to the terms of service, the backer stated it was \"the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me.\" The DCBA investigator assigned to the case made an arrangement with Cloud Imperium Games to process the US$2550 refund as the backer had not downloaded the [[game client]] and therefore not accepted the revised terms of service.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/07/14/star-citizen-refund/|title=Star Citizen Backer Gets $2550 Refund After Attorney General of Los Angeles Gets Involved|date=July 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/15/12198614/how-one-frustrated-star-citizen-backer-got-thousands-of-dollars|title=How one frustrated Star Citizen backer got thousands of dollars refunded|date=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAdditional cases regarding ''Star Citizen'' refunds have received attention from the media. A hoax perpetrated by an anonymous [[Reddit|Redditor]] in September 2017 claimed that they had worked over the course of five weeks to procure a US$45,000 refund was reported by ''[[Ars Technica]]'' and forced the outlet to retract the story after it was disproven.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/15/16308452/star-citizen-scam-hoax-45000-dollar-refund|title=The fight over Star Citizen\u2019s production delay is getting dirty|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2017-09-15|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> A few months later, in December, it was reported that a backer had spent almost three months requesting a US$24,000 refund and had initiated a [[small claims court]] case against Cloud Imperium Games. In the same report, a second backer stated they were attempting to receive a US$16,700 refund from the project. The first case was forwarded to the [[Better Business Bureau]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/13/16767590/star-citizen-refund|title=Star Citizen backer\u2019s $25,000 refund has taken months, still in dispute (update)|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2017-12-13|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a discussion with the Better Business Bureau, Cloud Imperium Games made changes to their website and further revised their terms of service.

It was reported that he had \"grown disillusioned with the title's numerous delays, broken promises, and changes in scope\". He argued that changes to the game would limit his ability to play due to disability. In court, Cloud Imperium Games argued that the backer's involvement in an early tester program called \"Evocati\" proved that they were actively providing a product to him. When an [[arbitration]] clause from the project's terms of service was brought up, the backer argued that he was covered under the original terms of service as he had backed the project prior to changes to the terms of service. Cloud Imperium Games provided evidence that a \"vast majority\" of the backer's purchases were made after the change and that he would have had to accept the revised terms of service when making any new purchase. The judge presiding the case sided with Cloud Imperium Games and ruled against the backer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/07/court-denies-star-citizen-backers-4500-refund-lawsuit/|title=Court Denies Star Citizen Backer's $4,500 Refund Lawsuit|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/star-citizen-backer-sues-to-get-4-500-back-loses-1827666550|title=Star Citizen Backer Sues To Get $4,500 Back, Loses|access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref> In a report from 2019, it was alleged that the backer continued to purchase ships after the lawsuit was closed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2019/05/01/exclusive-the-saga-of-star-citizen-a-video-game-that-raised-300-millionbut-may-never-be-ready-to-play/|title=Exclusive: The Saga Of 'Star Citizen,' A Video Game That Raised $300 Million\u2014But May Never Be Ready To Play|last=Perez|first=Matt|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Crytek lawsuit ===\n[[Crytek]], the developers of [[CryEngine]], filed a lawsuit in December 2017 for [[copyright infringement]] and [[breach of contract]] against Cloud Imperium Games.

Even worse, they fail to wipe his mind correctly following a bar fight. Initially, they decide to let the playwright be as they got what they came for. However, Sara refuses to accept this and forces her team to return and convince Shakespeare to write ''Romeo and Juliet'' as intended. After his boss withdraws his actors before a performance, Shakespeare becomes despondent until the Legends offer to fill in for them. Following this, Ray and Nora leave the Legends to live their lives together. Meanwhile, Astra attains a special viewing device to spy on Constantine. However, he catches on quickly and uses a spell to knock her out. When she comes to, she realizes what Constantine is really searching for.\n |LineColor       = CF905C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 76\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = Zari, Not Zari\n |RTitle          = <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20200409cw07/|title=(#509) \"Zari, Not Zari\"|website=The Futon Critic |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy      = Kevin Mock\n |WrittenBy       = Morgan Faust & Tyron Carter\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|21}}\n |ProdCode        = T13.21909<ref>{{Cite tweet |number=1187442474815328256 |user=ketomizu |title=#LegendsOfTomorrow episode 509 is now in production!

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batwoman]] and shares continuity with the other television series in the [[Arrowverse]]. The series premiered on [[The CW]] on October 6, 2019, and is primarily filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, with location filming in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. ''Batwoman'' follows Kate Kane overcoming her demons and past to become Gotham City's new symbol of hope as the vigilante Batwoman.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Batwoman would appear in \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the Arrowverse series' 2018 crossover, with an announcement two months later that a series centered on the character was in development from Dries. [[Ruby Rose]] was cast in the title role in August of the same year. In January 2019, the series received a pilot order from the CW, to be considered for a series order in the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320 television season]]. The show was picked up to series in May 2019 and in October 2019 a full season of 22 episodes was ordered. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a second season. Production was delayed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] so the remaining episodes were not finished.\n\n== Premise ==\nThree years after billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter ego [[Batman]] disappeared,{{efn|It is stated by Kate Kane in the ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'' crossover that both Batman and Bruce Wayne have \"gone missing.\"}} his cousin Kate Kane sets out to overcome her demons and become a symbol of hope by protecting the streets of [[Gotham City]] as [[Batwoman]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |title=Batwoman trailer reveals origin of Ruby Rose's LGBTQ+ superhero |date=May 16, 2019 |work=Digital Spy |access-date=June 3, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034728/https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |archive-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BatwomanSeries\" />\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<!--Can someone split the character section when Season Two begins?-->\n=== Main ===\n<!--Main cast order is according to original broadcasting credits (the pilot episode).

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batwoman]] and shares continuity with the other television series in the [[Arrowverse]]. The series premiered on [[The CW]] on October 6, 2019, and is primarily filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, with location filming in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. ''Batwoman'' follows Kate Kane overcoming her demons and past to become Gotham City's new symbol of hope as the vigilante Batwoman.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Batwoman would appear in \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the Arrowverse series' 2018 crossover, with an announcement two months later that a series centered on the character was in development from Dries. [[Ruby Rose]] was cast in the title role in August of the same year. In January 2019, the series received a pilot order from the CW, to be considered for a series order in the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320 television season]]. The show was picked up to series in May 2019 and in October 2019 a full season of 22 episodes was ordered. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a second season. Production was delayed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] so the remaining episodes were not finished.\n\n== Premise ==\nThree years after billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter ego [[Batman]] disappeared,{{efn|It is stated by Kate Kane in the ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'' crossover that both Batman and Bruce Wayne have \"gone missing.\"}} his cousin Kate Kane sets out to overcome her demons and become a symbol of hope by protecting the streets of [[Gotham City]] as [[Batwoman]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |title=Batwoman trailer reveals origin of Ruby Rose's LGBTQ+ superhero |date=May 16, 2019 |work=Digital Spy |access-date=June 3, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034728/https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |archive-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BatwomanSeries\" />\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<!--Can someone split the character section when Season Two begins?-->\n=== Main ===\n<!--Main cast order is according to original broadcasting credits (the pilot episode).
