Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist serving as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Johnson has tested positive for COVID-19 and on 6 April 2020, he was admitted to intensive care.<!--Please be careful when updating the above, only update with very significant updates. Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

Written by Melvin Hough II, Rivelino Wouter, Timothy Thomas, Theron Thomas and Onika Maraj, and produced by Mel & Mus, the song was sent to [[Urban contemporary|urban]] radio on December 7, 2010, as the album's third single in the United States, and was re-sent to urban radio on January 25, 2011. A [[hip hop music|hip hop]] song, it features rap vocals by [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[instrumentation]] consisting of [[Siren (noisemaker)|sirens]] and [[Bass (instrument)|bass]]. The song's lyrics revolve around how there is an endless supply of men available in the world. The song garnered a mixed response from [[Music journalism|music critics]]; some praised the chemistry between Rihanna and Minaj, while others commented that it bore strong resemblances to [[Beyonc\u00e9]]'s song \"[[Diva (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Diva]]\" with regard to its composition, and were critical of the notion.\n\nUpon the release of ''Loud'', \"Raining Men\" charted on the singles charts in South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States on the strength of [[Music download|digital download sales]].

In the United States, it peaked at number 11 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]], making this Rihanna's third single that failed to reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart (\"[[We Ride]]\", \"[[Wait Your Turn]]\"). Following the song's release to US urban radio, \"Raining Men\" peaked at number 48 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. No [[music video]] was shot for the song, and it received no televised performances as part of promotion. The song was included on the [[set list]] of the [[Loud Tour]] (2011).

A [[hip hop music|hip hop]] song, it features rap vocals by [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[instrumentation]] consisting of [[Siren (noisemaker)|sirens]] and [[Bass (instrument)|bass]]. The song's lyrics revolve around how there is an endless supply of men available in the world.
