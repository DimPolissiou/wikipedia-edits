The main mathematical object in the Keldysh formalism is the non-equilibrium [[Green's function]] (NEGF), which is a two-point function of particle fields. In this way, it resembles the [[Matsubara formalism]], which is based on equilibrium Green functions in imaginary-time and treats only equilibrium systems.\n\n== Time evolution of a quantum system  ==\n\nConsider a general quantum mechanical system. This system has the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] <math>H_0</math>. Let the initial state of the system be <math>|n \\rangle</math>, which can either be a pure state or a mixed state. If we now add a time-dependent perturbation to this Hamiltonian, say <math>H'(t)</math>, the full Hamiltonian is <math>H(t) = H_0+H'(t)</math> and hence the system will evolve in time under the full Hamiltonian. In this section, we will see how time evolution actually works in quantum mechanics.\n\nConsider a [[Hermitian]] operator <math>\\mathcal{O}</math>. In the [[Heisenberg Picture]] of quantum mechanics, this operator is time-dependent and the state is not. The expectation value of the operator <math>\\mathcal{O}(t)</math> is given by\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}(t) \\rangle &= \\langle n | {U}^{\\dagger}(t,0) \\, \\mathcal{O}(0) \\, U(t,0) | n \\rangle\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhere, due to time evolution of operators in the Heisenberg Picture, <math>\\mathcal{O}(t) = U^{\\dagger}(t,0) \\mathcal{O}(0) U(t, 0)</math>. The [[Time evolution|time-evolution unitary operator]] <math>U(t_2, t_1)</math>is the [[time-ordered]] exponential of an integral <math>U(t_2,t_1)=T(e^{-i\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} H(t') dt'})</math> (Note that if the Hamiltonian at one time commutes with the Hamiltonian at different times, then this can be simplified to <math>U(t_2,t_1)=e^{-i\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} H(t') dt'}</math>)\n\nFor perturbative quantum mechanics and [[quantum field theory]], it is often more convenient to use the [[interaction picture]]. The interaction picture operator is\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\n \\mathcal{O_I}(t)  &=  {U_0}^{\\dagger}(t,0) \\, \\mathcal{O}(0) \\, U_0(t,0)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhere <math> U_0(t_1,t_2) = e^{-iH_0(t_1-t_2)}\n</math>. Then defining <math> S(t_1,t_2) = U_0^{\\dagger}(t_1,t_2)U(t_1, t_2)\n</math> we have\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}(t) \\rangle &= \\langle n | {S}^{\\dagger}(t,0) \\mathcal{O_I}(t) S(t,0) | n \\rangle\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince the time-evolution unitary operators satisfy <math>U(t_3, t_2) U(t_2, t_1) = U(t_3, t_1)</math>, the above expression can be rewritten as\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}(t) \\rangle &= \\langle n | {S}^{\\dagger}(\\infty,0) S(\\infty, t) \\mathcal{O_I}(t) \\, S(t,0) | n \\rangle\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nor with <math>\\infty</math> replaced by any time value greater than <math>t</math>.\n\n== Path ordering on the Keldysh contour ==\nWe can write the above expression more succinctly by, purely formally, replacing each operator <math>X(t)</math> with a contour-ordered operator <math>X(c)\n</math> , such that <math>c</math> parametrizes the contour path on the time axis starting at <math>t=0</math>, proceeding to <math>t=\\infty</math>, and then returning to <math>t=0</math>. This path is known as the Keldysh contour. <math>X(c)</math>  has the same operator action as <math>X(t)</math> (where <math>t</math> is the time value corresponding to <math>c</math>) but also has the additional information of <math>c</math> (that is, strictly speaking <math>X(c_1) \\neq X(c_2)   </math> if <math>c_1 \\neq c_2   </math>, even if for the corresponding times <math>X(t_1) = X(t_2)    </math>).\n\nThen we can introduce notation of [[Path-ordering|path ordering]] on this contour, by defining  <math>\\mathcal{T_c} ( X^{(1)}(c_1) X^{(2)}(c_2)\\ldots X^{(n)}(c_n) ) = (\\pm 1)^{\\sigma}X^{(\\sigma(1))}(c_{\\sigma(1)}) X^{(\\sigma(2))}(c_{\\sigma(2)})\\ldots X^{(\\sigma(n))}(c_{\\sigma(n)})   </math>, where <math>\\sigma</math> is a permutation such that <math>c_{\\sigma(1)} < c_{\\sigma(2)} < \\ldots c_{\\sigma(n)}   </math>, and the plus and minus signs are for [[Bosonic field|bosonic]] and [[Fermionic field|fermionic]] operators respectively. Note that this is a generalization of [[Time-ordering|time ordering]].\n\nWith this notation, the above time evolution is written as\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}(t) \\rangle &= \\langle n | \\mathcal{T_c}( \\mathcal{O(c)} e^{-i\\int dc' H'(c')}) | n \\rangle\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhere <math>c</math> corresponds to the time <math>t</math> on the forward branch of the Keldysh contour, and the integral over <math>c'</math> goes over the entire Keldysh contour. For the rest of this article, as is conventional, we will usually simply use the notation <math>X(t)</math> for <math>X(c)</math> where <math>t</math> is the time corresponding to <math>c</math>, and whether <math>c</math> is on the forward or reverse branch is inferred from context.\n\n\n== Keldysh diagrammatic technique for Green's functions ==\nThe non-equilibrium Green's function is defined as <math>\\begin{align}\niG(x_1, t_1, x_2, t_2)= \\langle n |  T \\psi(x_1,t_1) \\psi(x_2,t_2) | n \\rangle\n\\end{align}</math>.\n\nOr in the interaction picture  <math>\\begin{align}\niG(x_1, t_1, x_2, t_2)= \\langle n |  \\mathcal{T_c} (e^{-i\\int_c H'(t')dt'}  \\psi(x_1,t_1) \\psi(x_2,t_2)) | n \\rangle\n\\end{align}</math> . We can expand the exponential as a Taylor series to obtain the perturbation series <math>\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\langle n |  \\mathcal{T_c} ((-i\\int_t (H'(t', +)+ H'(t',-) )dt')^j  \\psi(x_1,t_1) \\psi(x_2,t_2)) | n \\rangle / j! </math>. This is the same procedure as in equilibrium diagrammatic perturbation theory, but with the important difference that both forward and reverse contour branches are included.\n\nIf, as is often the case, <math> H' </math> is a polynomial or series as a function of the elementary fields <math>\\psi</math>, we can organize this perturbation series into monomial terms and apply all possible [[Wick's Theorem|Wick pairings]] to the fields in each monomial, obtaining a summation of [[Feynman diagrams]]. However, the edges of the Feynman diagram correspond to different propagators depending on whether the paired operators come from the forward or reverse branches. Namely,\n\n:<math> \\langle n | \\mathcal{T_c} \\psi (x_1, t_1, +) \\psi (x_2, t_2, +)|n \\rangle \\equiv G_0^{++}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \\langle n|\\mathcal{T}\\psi (x_1,t_1) \\psi (x_2,t_2)|n \\rangle </math>\n\n:<math> \\langle n | \\mathcal{T_c} \\psi (x_1, t_1, +) \\psi (x_2, t_2, -)|n \\rangle \\equiv G_0^{+-}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \\langle n|\\psi (x_1,t_1) \\psi (x_2,t_2)|n \\rangle </math>\n\n:<math> \\langle n | \\mathcal{T_c} \\psi (x_1, t_1, -) \\psi (x_2, t_2, +)|n \\rangle \\equiv G_0^{-+}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \\pm \\langle n| \\psi (x_2,t_2)\\psi (x_1,t_1)|n \\rangle </math>\n\n:<math> \\langle n | \\mathcal{T_c} \\psi (x_1, t_1, -) \\psi (x_2, t_2, -)|n \\rangle \\equiv G_0^{--}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \\langle n|\\mathcal{\\overline{T}}\\psi (x_1,t_1) \\psi (x_2,t_2)|n \\rangle </math>\n\nwhere the anti-time ordering <math>\\mathcal{\\overline{T}}</math> orders operators in the opposite way as time ordering and the <math> \\pm </math> sign in <math> G_0^{-+} </math>  is for bosonic or fermionic fields. Note that <math>G_0^{--}</math> is the propagator used in ordinary ground state theory.\n\nThus, Feynman diagrams for correlation functions can be drawn and their values computed the same way as in ground state theory, except with the following modifications to the Feynman rules: Each internal vertex of the diagram is labeled with either <math> + </math> or <math> - </math>, while external vertices are labelled with <math>-</math>. Then each (unrenormalized) edge directed from a vertex <math> a </math> (with position <math>x_a</math>, time <math>t_a</math> and sign <math> s_a</math>) to a vertex <math>b</math> (with position <math>x_b</math>, time <math>t_b</math> and sign <math>s_b</math>) corresponds to the propagator <math>G_0^{s_as_b}(x_a,t_a , x_b, t_b)</math>. Then the diagram values for each choice of <math> \\pm </math> signs (there are <math>2^{v}</math> such choices, where <math>v</math> is the number of internal vertices) are all added up to find the total value of the diagram.\n\n== Landauer\u2013B\u00fcttiker\u2013Keldysh formalism ==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Spin Hall effect]]\n*[[Kondo effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Other ===\n<!-- Please include this references to the main text -->\n\n#{{Cite journal|last=\u041b\u0438\u0444\u0448\u0438\u0446|first=\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|last2=\u041f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|first2=\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|date=1979|title=\u0424\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430|url=|journal=\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430, \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0442-\u0440\u044b|volume=10|pages=|via=}}\n#{{Cite web|url=https://nanohub.org/resources/1877/about|title=Introduction to the Keldysh Nonequilibrium Green Function Technique|last=Jauho|first=A.P.|date=5 October 2006|website=[[nanoHUB]]|format=PDF|access-date=18 June 2018}}\n#{{Cite web|url=https://nanohub.org/resources/3833|title=Application of the Keldysh Formalism to Quantum Device Modeling and Analysis|last=Lake|first=Roger|date=13 January 2018|website=[[nanoHUB]]|format=PDF|access-date=18 June 2018}}\n#{{Cite journal|last=Kamenev|first=Alex|date=11 December 2004|title=Many-body theory of non-equilibrium systems|pages=cond\u2013mat/0412296|arxiv=cond-mat/0412296|bibcode=2004cond.mat.12296K}}\n#{{Cite journal|last=Kita|first=Takafumi|year=2010|title=Introduction to Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics with Quantum Field|journal=[[Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics|Progress of Theoretical Physics]]|volume=123|issue=4|pages=581\u2013658|arxiv=1005.0393|doi=10.1143/PTP.123.581|bibcode=2010PThPh.123..581K}}\n#{{cite book |last=Ryndyk|first=D.

Then the diagram values for each choice of <math> \\pm </math> signs (there are <math>2^{v}</math> such choices, where <math>v</math> is the number of internal vertices) are all added up to find the total value of the diagram.\n\n== Landauer\u2013B\u00fcttiker\u2013Keldysh formalism ==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Spin Hall effect]]\n*[[Kondo effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Other ===\n<!-- Please include this references to the main text -->\n\n#{{Cite journal|last=\u041b\u0438\u0444\u0448\u0438\u0446|first=\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|last2=\u041f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|first2=\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|date=1979|title=\u0424\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430|url=|journal=\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430, \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0442-\u0440\u044b|volume=10|pages=|via=}}\n#{{Cite web|url=https://nanohub.org/resources/1877/about|title=Introduction to the Keldysh Nonequilibrium Green Function Technique|last=Jauho|first=A.P.|date=5 October 2006|website=[[nanoHUB]]|format=PDF|access-date=18 June 2018}}\n#{{Cite web|url=https://nanohub.org/resources/3833|title=Application of the Keldysh Formalism to Quantum Device Modeling and Analysis|last=Lake|first=Roger|date=13 January 2018|website=[[nanoHUB]]|format=PDF|access-date=18 June 2018}}\n#{{Cite journal|last=Kamenev|first=Alex|date=11 December 2004|title=Many-body theory of non-equilibrium systems|pages=cond\u2013mat/0412296|arxiv=cond-mat/0412296|bibcode=2004cond.mat.12296K}}\n#{{Cite journal|last=Kita|first=Takafumi|year=2010|title=Introduction to Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics with Quantum Field|journal=[[Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics|Progress of Theoretical Physics]]|volume=123|issue=4|pages=581\u2013658|arxiv=1005.0393|doi=10.1143/PTP.123.581|bibcode=2010PThPh.123..581K}}\n#{{cite book |last=Ryndyk|first=D.

In many other countries, they persisted for a few decades longer, until the mid or late 19th century. '''Highwaywomen''', such as [[Katherine Ferrers]], were said to also exist, often dressing as men, especially in fiction.\n\nThe first [[wikt:attestation|attestation]] of the word ''highwayman'' is from 1617.<ref>Fennor, William. \"The Counter's Commonwealth,\" in ''The Elizabethan Underworld'', p. 446.</ref> [[Euphemism]]s such as \"knights of the road\" and \"gentlemen of the road\" were sometimes used by people interested in [[wikt:romanticize|romanticizing]] (with a [[Robin Hood]]\u2013esque slant) what was often an especially violent form of stealing. In the 19th-century American West, highwaymen were sometimes known as ''road agents''.<ref>Brewer, E. Cobham. ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 1898, defines road-agent as \"A highwayman in the mountain districts of North America,\" citing the generation earlier, [[W.

Some of them are known to have been disbanded soldiers and even officers of the [[English Civil War]] and French wars. What favoured them most was the lack of governance and absence of a police force: parish constables were almost wholly ineffective and commonplace detection and arrest were very difficult. Most of the highwaymen held up travellers and took their money. Some had channels by which they could dispose of bills of exchange. Others had a 'racket' on the road transport of an extensive district; carriers regularly paid them a ransom to go unmolested.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Sir George |date=1956 |title=The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714 |location=Oxford History of England |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=259 |isbn=0-19-821702-1}}</ref> \n\nThey often attacked [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]] for their lack of protection, including public [[stagecoaches]]; the [[mail carrier|postboys]] who carried the mail were also frequently held up.<ref>Beattie, J.

The historian [[Roy Porter]] described the use of direct, physical action as a hallmark of public and political life: \"From the rough-house of the crowd to the dragoons' musket volley, violence was as English as plum pudding. Force was used not just criminally, but as a matter of routine to achieve social and political goals, smudging hard-and-fast distinctions between the worlds of criminality and politics...Highwaymen were romanticized, with a hidden irony, as 'gentlemen of the road'.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |date=1982 |title=English Society in the Eighteenth Century |location=Pelican Social History of Britain |publisher=Pelican Books |page=31, 114\u2013115|isbn=0-14-022099-2}}</ref>\n\n==Robbers as heroes==\nThere is a long history of treating highway robbers as heroes. Originally they were admired by many as bold men who confronted their victims [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] and were ready to fight for what they wanted.<ref>Spraggs, Gillian: ''Outlaws and Highwaymen: the Cult of the Robber in [[England]] from the [[Middle Ages]] to the Nineteenth Century'', pp. 2\u20133, 7\u20138, 255.

From the mid-17th century, bandits who harassed the British were known as tories (from Irish ''t\u00f3rai\u1e0be'', raider; ''t\u00f3ra\u00ed'' in [[Irish orthography|modern spelling]]). Later in the century, they became known as [[rapparee]]s.

They usually chose lonely areas of [[Heath (habitat)|heathland]] or [[woodland]]. [[Hounslow Heath]] was a favourite haunt: it was crossed by the roads to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Exeter]].<ref>Maxwell, Gordon S. : ''Highwayman's Heath: Story in Fact and Fiction of Hounslow Heath in Middlesex ''. Heritage Publications, Hounslow Leisure Services, 1994.</ref> [[Bagshot Heath]] in [[Surrey]] was another dangerous place on the road to Exeter. One of the most notorious places in England was [[Shooter's Hill]] on the [[Great Dover Road]]. [[Finchley Common]], on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)]], was very nearly as bad.<ref>Beattie, J. M.: ''Crime and the Courts in England, 1660\u20131800'', pp. 155\u2013156.

Later in the 18th century the road from London to [[Reigate]] and [[Brighton]] through [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] attracted highwaymen. Commons and heaths considered to be dangerous included [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], [[Wimbledon Common|Putney Heath]], [[Streatham Common]], [[Mitcham Common]], [[Thornton Heath]] \u2013 also the site of a gallows known as \"Hangman's Acre\" or \"Gallows Green\" \u2013 [[Sutton Common]], Banstead Downs and [[Reigate Heath]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeandleisure.co.uk/articles/local/742-stand-and-deliver.html |title=Stand and Deliver! |last=Walford |first=Leslie |date=7 March 2011 |website=Time & Leisure |access-date=27 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 17th and early 18th centuries, highwaymen in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] were sufficiently common for [[William III of England|King William III]] to have the route between [[St. James's Palace]] and [[Kensington Palace]] ([[Rotten Row]]) lit at night with oil lamps as a precaution against them.

The chief place of execution for London and [[Middlesex]] was [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn Tree]]. Famous highwaymen whose lives ended there include [[Claude Duval|Claude Du Vall]], [[James MacLaine]], and [[John Rann|Sixteen-string Jack]]. Highwaymen who went to the gallows laughing and joking, or at least showing no fear, are said to have been admired by many of the people who came to watch.<ref>Spraggs, Gillian: ''Outlaws and Highwaymen: the Cult of the Robber in England from the Middle Ages to the Nineteenth Century'', pp. 212\u2013233. Pimlico, 2001</ref>\n\n==Decline==\nDuring the 18th century French rural roads were generally safer from highwaymen than those of England, an advantage credited by the historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] to the existence of a uniformed and disciplined mounted constabulary known as the [[Gendarmerie#Etymology|Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e]]. In England this force was often confused with the regular army and as such cited as an instrument of royal tyranny not to be imitated.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville ''L'Ancien R\u00e9gime et la R\u00e9volution''</ref>\n  \nIn England the causes of the decline are more controversial. After about 1815, mounted robbers are recorded only rarely, the last recorded robbery by a mounted highwayman having occurred in 1831.<ref>McLynn, Frank: ''Crime and punishment in eighteenth-century England'', p. 81. Routledge, 1989.</ref> The decline in highwayman activity also occurred during the period in which repeating handguns, notably the [[pepperbox]] and the [[percussion cap|percussion]] revolver, became increasingly available and affordable to the average citizen. The development of the [[Rail transport|railways]] is sometimes cited as a factor, but highwaymen were already obsolete before the railway network was built. The expansion of the system of [[Toll road|turnpikes]], manned and gated [[Toll road|toll-roads]], made it all but impossible for a highwayman to escape notice while making his getaway, but he could easily avoid such systems and use other roads, almost all of which outside the cities were flanked by open country.\n\nCities such as London were becoming much better policed: in 1805 a body of mounted police began to patrol the districts around the city at night. London was growing rapidly, and some of the most dangerous open spaces near the city, such as [[Finchley Common]], were being covered with buildings. However this only moved the robbers' operating area further out, to the new exterior of an expanded city, and does not therefore explain decline. A greater use of [[banknotes]], more traceable than gold coins, also made life more difficult for robbers,<ref>Spraggs, Gillian: ''Outlaws and Highwaymen: the Cult of the Robber in England from the Middle Ages to the Nineteenth Century'', p. 234. Pimlico, 2001.</ref> but the [[Inclosure_Act_1773|Inclosure Act]]<ref>'The Enclosure Acts and the Industrial Revolution', Wendy McElroy, 2012</ref> of 1773 was followed by a sharp decline in highway robberies; stone walls falling over the open range like a net, confined the escaping highwaymen to the roads themselves, which now had walls on both sides and were better patrolled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pearsonschoolsandfecolleges.co.uk/FEAndVocational/Humanities/History/EdexcelGCSESHPHistory2013/Samples/Crime(1B)andProtest(3B)/HistoryB1BHighwaymenpreview.pdf|title=SHP History B-- Crime and Punishment 1750 \u2013 1900, 3.3 Highwaymen.|publisher=}}</ref>\nThe dramatic population increase which began with the [[Industrial Revolution]] also meant, quite simply, that there were more eyes around, and the concept of remote place became a thing of the past in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.com/2011/09/18/ecological-impact-industrial-revolution/|title=Impact of the Industrial Revolution|date=18 September 2011|website=Ecology Global Network}}</ref>\n\n==Outside Anglophone countries==\n===Greece===\nThe bandits in [[Greece]] under Ottoman rule were the [[Klephts]] (\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2), Greeks who had taken refuge in the inaccessible mountains. The klephts, who acted as a guerilla force, were instrumental in the [[Greek War of Independence]].\n\n===Hungary and Slovakia===\n{{See also|Bety\u00e1rs}}\nThe highwaymen of 18th- and 19th-century [[Kingdom of Hungary]] were the bety\u00e1rs. Until the 1830s they were mainly simply regarded as criminals but an increasing public appetite for betyar songs, ballads and stories gradually gave a romantic image to these armed and usually mounted robbers. Several of the bety\u00e1rs have become legendary figures who in the public mind fought for social justice. The most famous Hungarian bety\u00e1rs were [[S\u00e1ndor R\u00f3zsa]] ({{lang-sk|\u0160a\u0148o R\u00f3\u017ea}}), [[J\u00f3ska Sobri]], M\u00e1rton Vidr\u00f3czki, J\u00f3ska Savany\u00fa.

Most famous of these were the [[Thuggees]], a quasi-religious group that robbed travellers on Indian roads until the cult was systematically eradicated in the mid-1800s by British colonial administrators.  Thugees would befriend large road caravans, gain their confidence, strangle them to death at the right moment, and then rob them of their valuables. According to some estimates the Thuggees murdered 1 million people between 1740 and 1840.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Rubinstein\n  | first = W.

In recent times this has often served as a way to fund various regional and political insurgencies that includes the Maoist [[Naxalite]] movement.\n[[Kayamkulam Kochunni]] was also a famed highwayman who was active in [[Central Travancore]] in the early 19th century. Along with his close friend Ithikkarappkki from the nearby Ithikkara village, he is said to have stolen from the rich and given to the poor. With the help of an [[Ezhava]] warrior called [[Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker]], Kochunni was arrested and sent to the infamous Poojappura Central Jail. Legends of his works are compiled in [[folklore]] and are still read and heard today.\n\n===The Balkans and eastern Europe===\nThe bandits in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia under Ottoman rule were the [[Hajduks]] (Hajduci, \u0425\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0443\u0446\u0438), rebels who opposed Ottoman rule and acted as a guerilla force, also instrumental in the many wars against the Ottomans and especially the [[Serbian revolution]]. Serbian and Croatian refugees in Austro-Hungarian (and Habsburg) lands were also part of the [[Uskoci]]. Notable freedom fighters include [[Starina Novak]], a notable outlaw was [[Jovo Stanisavljevi\u0107 \u010caruga]].\nIn medieval Vlachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, and Ukraine, the Haiduks (Romanian \u2013 Haiduci) or Gaiduks (Ukrainian \u2013 \u0413\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0438) were bandits and deserters who lived in forests and robbed local Boyars or other travelers along roads.

The earliest of these is Captain Alexander Smith's ''Complete History of the Lives and Robberies of the Most Notorious Highwaymen'' (1714). Some later collections of this type had the words [[The Newgate Calendar]] in their titles and this has become a general name for this kind of publication.<ref>[http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ngbibl.htm The Newgate Calendar \u2013 Bibliographical Note<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th century, highwaymen such as [[Dick Turpin]] were the heroes of a number of [[penny dreadful]]s, stories for boys published in serial form. In the 20th century the handsome highwayman became a [[stock character]] in historical love romances, including books by [[Emma Orczy|Baroness Orczy]] and [[Georgette Heyer]].\n\nSir [[Walter Scott]]'s romance ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' (1818) recounts the heroine waylaid by highwaymen while travelling from Scotland to London.\n\n===Comics===\nThe Belgian comics series ''Robin Dubois'' by [[Turk (comics)|Turk]] and [[De Groot]] is a [[gag-a-day]] series about [[Robin Hood]]'s attempts at robbing travellers in the forest.\n\nThe Dutch comics series ''[[Gilles de Geus]]'' by [[Hanco Kolk]] and [[Peter de Wit]] was originally a gag-a-day about a failed highwayman called Gilles, but the character later evolved into a resistance fighter with the [[Geuzen]] against the Spanish army.\n\n===Music===\nThere were many broadsheet [[ballad]]s about highwaymen; these were often written to be sold on the occasion of a famous robber's execution. A number of highwaymen ballads have remained current in [[oral tradition]] in England and Ireland.<ref>Seal, Graham: ''The Outlaw Legend: a cultural tradition in Britain, America and Australia'', pp. 47\u201378. Cambridge University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\nThe traditional Irish song \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\" tells the story of an Irish highwayman who robs an army captain, and includes the lines \"I first produced me pistol, then I drew me rapier. Said 'Stand and deliver, for you are a bold deceiver'.\"  The hit single version recorded in 1973 by Irish rock band [[Thin Lizzy]] renders this last line \"I said 'Stand-oh and deliver, or the devil he may take ya'.\"\n\nThe traditional Irish song \"[[The Newry Highwayman]]\" recounts the deeds and death of a highwayman who robbed \"the lords and ladies bright\". The traditional Irish song \"Brennan on the Moor\" describes an escapade of the \"bold, undaunted robber\". \n[[Adam and the Ants]] had a number one song for five weeks in 1981 in the UK with \"[[Stand and Deliver (Adam and the Ants song)|Stand and Deliver]]\". The video featured Adam Ant as an English highwayman.\n\nThe contemporary folk song \"On the Road to Fairfax County\" by [[David Massengill]], recorded by [[The Roches]] and by [[Joan Baez]], recounts a romantic encounter between a highwayman and his female victim.  In the end, the highwayman is hanged over the objections of his victim.\n\nMusician [[Jimmy Webb]] penned and recorded a song entitled \"[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]\" in 1977 about a soul with incarnations in four different places in time and history, a highwayman, a [[sailor]], a construction worker on the [[Hoover Dam]], and finally as a [[Astronaut|star ship captain]].  [[Glen Campbell]] recorded a version of the song in 1978, but the most popular incarnation of the song was recorded by [[Willie Nelson]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Johnny Cash]] in 1984, who as a group called themselves [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]].\n\nThe Canadian singer [[Loreena McKennitt|Loreena McKennit]] adapted the narrative poem, \"[[The Highwayman (poem)|The Highwayman]]\" written by [[Alfred Noyes]], as a song by the same title in her 1997 album [[The Book of Secrets]].\n\n===Cinema and television===\nThe [[Carry On films]] included a highwayman spoof in ''[[Carry On Dick]]'' (1974). [[Monty Python]] sent up the highwayman legends in the Dennis Moore sketch in Episode 37 of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', in which [[John Cleese]] played the titular criminal who stole only [[lupins]].<ref>[http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode37.htm#2 Monty Python's Flying Circus Script \u2013 Episode 37]</ref> In ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'', [[Mr. E. Blackadder]] turns highwayman in the episode \"[[Amy and Amiability]]\". In the British children's television series ''[[Dick Turpin (TV series)|Dick Turpin]]'', starring [[Richard O'Sullivan (actor)|Richard O'Sullivan]], the highwayman was depicted as an 18th-century Robin Hood figure.  Additionally the actor [[Mathew Baynton]] played Dick Turpin in ''[[Horrible Histories (2009 TV series)|Horrible Histories]]''. A singing highwayman appears in the fourth episode of the animated mini-series, ''[[Over the Garden Wall (miniseries)|Over the Garden Wall]]'', ''Songs of the Dark Lantern''.\n\nThe highwayman known as [[Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk]] (1688\u20131713) became a hero of many folk legends in the [[Slovak people|Slovak]], Czech, and Polish cultures by the 19th century<ref>Votruba, Martin: \"Hang Him High: The Elevation of J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk to an Ethnic Icon.\" ''Slavic Review,'' 65#1, pp. 24\u201344, 2006.

It is also possible for players to dress as Highwaymen. There is an enemy type in ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' called the \"bandit highwayman\" that acts as one of the higher-level bandit enemies. In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' one can encounter the Defias Highwaymen, the strongest members of the Defias Brotherhood. In ''[[Darkest Dungeon]]'' the Highwayman is a class of hero who wields a dirk and flintlock to fight. In ''[[Runescape]]'', highwaymen attack lower-leveled players on a route between two cities. In ''[[Bushido Blade 2]]'' there is a playable character named Highwayman who is dressed in Victorian clothing and represents the hero archetype. In ''[[Bloodborne]]'' many articles of clothing obtained by \"The Hunter\" are inspired by Highwaymen attire.\n\n===Films===\n*''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920)\n*''[[Dick Turpin (1925 film)|Dick Turpin]]'' (1925)\n*''[[Dick Turpin (1933 film)|Dick Turpin]]'' (1933)\n*''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938)\n*''[[The Night Riders (1939 film)|The Night Riders]]'' (1939)\n*''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939)\n*''[[My Little Chickadee]]'' (1940)\n*''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940)\n*''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940)\n*''[[The Wicked Lady]]'' (1945)\n*''[[The Loves of Carmen (1948 film)|The Loves of Carmen]]'' (1948)\n*''[[The Lady and the Bandit]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Bend of the River]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Son of Paleface]]'' (1952)\n*''[[The King's Thief]]'' (1955)\n*''[[The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders]]'' (1965)\n*''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969)\n*''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973)\n*''[[Carry On Dick]]'' (1974)\n*''[[The Mark of Zorro (1974 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975)\n*''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1977)\n*''[[The Wicked Lady (1983 film)|The Wicked Lady]]'' (1983)\n*''[[The Deceivers (film)|The Deceivers]]'' (1988)\n*''[[The Lady and the Highwayman]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Plunkett & Macleane]]'' (1999)\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[List of highwaymen]]\n*[[Brigandage]]\n*[[Bushranger]]\n*[[Dacoity]]\n*[[Hajduk]]\n*[[Mail robbery]]\n*[[Marauder (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Piracy]]\n*[[Road agent (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Social bandits]]\n*[[Thuggees]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* [[Russell Ash|Ash, Russell]] (1970).

In many other countries, they persisted for a few decades longer, until the mid or late 19th century. '''Highwaywomen''', such as [[Katherine Ferrers]], were said to also exist, often dressing as men, especially in fiction.\n\nThe first [[wikt:attestation|attestation]] of the word ''highwayman'' is from 1617.<ref>Fennor, William. \"The Counter's Commonwealth,\" in ''The Elizabethan Underworld'', p. 446.</ref> [[Euphemism]]s such as \"knights of the road\" and \"gentlemen of the road\" were sometimes used by people interested in [[wikt:romanticize|romanticizing]] (with a [[Robin Hood]]\u2013esque slant) what was often an especially violent form of stealing. In the 19th-century American West, highwaymen were sometimes known as ''road agents''.<ref>Brewer, E. Cobham. ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 1898, defines road-agent as \"A highwayman in the mountain districts of North America,\" citing the generation earlier, [[W. Hepworth Dixon]], ''New America'', p. 14: \"Road-agent is the name applied in the mountains to a ruffian who has given up honest work in the store, in the mine, in the ranch, for the perils and profits of the highway.\"</ref> In Australia, they were known as [[bushranger]]s.\n\n==Robbing==\nThe great age of highwaymen was the period from the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660 to the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714. Some of them are known to have been disbanded soldiers and even officers of the [[English Civil War]] and French wars. What favoured them most was the lack of governance and absence of a police force: parish constables were almost wholly ineffective and commonplace detection and arrest were very difficult. Most of the highwaymen held up travellers and took their money. Some had channels by which they could dispose of bills of exchange. Others had a 'racket' on the road transport of an extensive district; carriers regularly paid them a ransom to go unmolested.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Sir George |date=1956 |title=The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714 |location=Oxford History of England |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=259 |isbn=0-19-821702-1}}</ref> \n\nThey often attacked [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]] for their lack of protection, including public [[stagecoaches]]; the [[mail carrier|postboys]] who carried the mail were also frequently held up.<ref>Beattie, J.

The historian [[Roy Porter]] described the use of direct, physical action as a hallmark of public and political life: \"From the rough-house of the crowd to the dragoons' musket volley, violence was as English as plum pudding. Force was used not just criminally, but as a matter of routine to achieve social and political goals, smudging hard-and-fast distinctions between the worlds of criminality and politics...Highwaymen were romanticized, with a hidden irony, as 'gentlemen of the road'.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |date=1982 |title=English Society in the Eighteenth Century |location=Pelican Social History of Britain |publisher=Pelican Books |page=31, 114\u2013115|isbn=0-14-022099-2}}</ref>\n\n==Robbers as heroes==\nThere is a long history of treating highway robbers as heroes.

From the mid-17th century, bandits who harassed the British were known as tories (from Irish ''t\u00f3rai\u1e0be'', raider; ''t\u00f3ra\u00ed'' in [[Irish orthography|modern spelling]]).

Later in the 18th century the road from London to [[Reigate]] and [[Brighton]] through [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] attracted highwaymen.

Pimlico, 2001</ref>\n\n==Decline==\nDuring the 18th century French rural roads were generally safer from highwaymen than those of England, an advantage credited by the historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] to the existence of a uniformed and disciplined mounted constabulary known as the [[Gendarmerie#Etymology|Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e]]. In England this force was often confused with the regular army and as such cited as an instrument of royal tyranny not to be imitated.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville ''L'Ancien R\u00e9gime et la R\u00e9volution''</ref>\n  \nIn England the causes of the decline are more controversial. After about 1815, mounted robbers are recorded only rarely, the last recorded robbery by a mounted highwayman having occurred in 1831.<ref>McLynn, Frank: ''Crime and punishment in eighteenth-century England'', p. 81. Routledge, 1989.</ref> The decline in highwayman activity also occurred during the period in which repeating handguns, notably the [[pepperbox]] and the [[percussion cap|percussion]] revolver, became increasingly available and affordable to the average citizen. The development of the [[Rail transport|railways]] is sometimes cited as a factor, but highwaymen were already obsolete before the railway network was built. The expansion of the system of [[Toll road|turnpikes]], manned and gated [[Toll road|toll-roads]], made it all but impossible for a highwayman to escape notice while making his getaway, but he could easily avoid such systems and use other roads, almost all of which outside the cities were flanked by open country.\n\nCities such as London were becoming much better policed: in 1805 a body of mounted police began to patrol the districts around the city at night. London was growing rapidly, and some of the most dangerous open spaces near the city, such as [[Finchley Common]], were being covered with buildings. However this only moved the robbers' operating area further out, to the new exterior of an expanded city, and does not therefore explain decline. A greater use of [[banknotes]], more traceable than gold coins, also made life more difficult for robbers,<ref>Spraggs, Gillian: ''Outlaws and Highwaymen: the Cult of the Robber in England from the Middle Ages to the Nineteenth Century'', p. 234. Pimlico, 2001.</ref> but the [[Inclosure_Act_1773|Inclosure Act]]<ref>'The Enclosure Acts and the Industrial Revolution', Wendy McElroy, 2012</ref> of 1773 was followed by a sharp decline in highway robberies; stone walls falling over the open range like a net, confined the escaping highwaymen to the roads themselves, which now had walls on both sides and were better patrolled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pearsonschoolsandfecolleges.co.uk/FEAndVocational/Humanities/History/EdexcelGCSESHPHistory2013/Samples/Crime(1B)andProtest(3B)/HistoryB1BHighwaymenpreview.pdf|title=SHP History B-- Crime and Punishment 1750 \u2013 1900, 3.3 Highwaymen.|publisher=}}</ref>\nThe dramatic population increase which began with the [[Industrial Revolution]] also meant, quite simply, that there were more eyes around, and the concept of remote place became a thing of the past in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.com/2011/09/18/ecological-impact-industrial-revolution/|title=Impact of the Industrial Revolution|date=18 September 2011|website=Ecology Global Network}}</ref>\n\n==Outside Anglophone countries==\n===Greece===\nThe bandits in [[Greece]] under Ottoman rule were the [[Klephts]] (\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2), Greeks who had taken refuge in the inaccessible mountains. The klephts, who acted as a guerilla force, were instrumental in the [[Greek War of Independence]].\n\n===Hungary and Slovakia===\n{{See also|Bety\u00e1rs}}\nThe highwaymen of 18th- and 19th-century [[Kingdom of Hungary]] were the bety\u00e1rs. Until the 1830s they were mainly simply regarded as criminals but an increasing public appetite for betyar songs, ballads and stories gradually gave a romantic image to these armed and usually mounted robbers. Several of the bety\u00e1rs have become legendary figures who in the public mind fought for social justice. The most famous Hungarian bety\u00e1rs were [[S\u00e1ndor R\u00f3zsa]] ({{lang-sk|\u0160a\u0148o R\u00f3\u017ea}}), [[J\u00f3ska Sobri]], M\u00e1rton Vidr\u00f3czki, J\u00f3ska Savany\u00fa. Northern Hungary's [[Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk]] ({{lang-hu|J\u00e1nosik Gy\u00f6rgy }}) is still regarded as the Slovakian [[Robin Hood]].\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Rozsa Sandor.jpg|Hungarian outlaw [[S\u00e1ndor R\u00f3zsa]] in Theresienstadt prison.\nFile:Janosik7.jpg|The protocol from the trial with [[Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk]].

Most famous of these were the [[Thuggees]], a quasi-religious group that robbed travellers on Indian roads until the cult was systematically eradicated in the mid-1800s by British colonial administrators.  Thugees would befriend large road caravans, gain their confidence, strangle them to death at the right moment, and then rob them of their valuables. According to some estimates the Thuggees murdered 1 million people between 1740 and 1840.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Rubinstein\n  | first = W.

In recent times this has often served as a way to fund various regional and political insurgencies that includes the Maoist [[Naxalite]] movement.\n[[Kayamkulam Kochunni]] was also a famed highwayman who was active in [[Central Travancore]] in the early 19th century. Along with his close friend Ithikkarappkki from the nearby Ithikkara village, he is said to have stolen from the rich and given to the poor. With the help of an [[Ezhava]] warrior called [[Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker]], Kochunni was arrested and sent to the infamous Poojappura Central Jail. Legends of his works are compiled in [[folklore]] and are still read and heard today.\n\n===The Balkans and eastern Europe===\nThe bandits in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia under Ottoman rule were the [[Hajduks]] (Hajduci, \u0425\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0443\u0446\u0438), rebels who opposed Ottoman rule and acted as a guerilla force, also instrumental in the many wars against the Ottomans and especially the [[Serbian revolution]]. Serbian and Croatian refugees in Austro-Hungarian (and Habsburg) lands were also part of the [[Uskoci]]. Notable freedom fighters include [[Starina Novak]], a notable outlaw was [[Jovo Stanisavljevi\u0107 \u010caruga]].\nIn medieval Vlachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, and Ukraine, the Haiduks (Romanian \u2013 Haiduci) or Gaiduks (Ukrainian \u2013 \u0413\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0438) were bandits and deserters who lived in forests and robbed local Boyars or other travelers along roads. Sometimes they would help the poor peasants.\n\n==Literature and popular culture==\n[[File:Dickturpin.jpg|thumb|260px|left|[[Dick Turpin]] riding [[Black Bess]], from a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[toy theater|toy theatre]].]]\nIn [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' [[Falstaff]] is a highwayman, and part of the action of the play concerns a robbery committed by him and his companions. Apart from Falstaff, the most famous highwayman in [[English drama]] is [[Captain Macheath]], hero of [[John Gay]]'s 18th-century [[ballad opera]] ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''. The legend of Dick Turpin owes an enormous amount to ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' (1834), in which a heavily fictionalised Turpin is one of the main characters.<ref>Sharpe, James: ''Dick Turpin: the Myth of the English Highwayman'', Chapter 5: 'The Man from Manchester'. Profile Books, 2004</ref><ref>Spraggs, Gillian: ''Outlaws and Highwaymen: the Cult of the Robber in England from the Middle Ages to the Nineteenth Century'', pp. 237\u2013240. Pimlico, 2001.</ref> [[Alfred Noyes]]'s [[narrative poem]] \"[[The Highwayman (poem)|The Highwayman]]\" has been immensely popular ever since its publication in 1906.\n\nFrom the early 18th century, collections of short stories of highwaymen and other notorious criminals became very popular. The earliest of these is Captain Alexander Smith's ''Complete History of the Lives and Robberies of the Most Notorious Highwaymen'' (1714). Some later collections of this type had the words [[The Newgate Calendar]] in their titles and this has become a general name for this kind of publication.<ref>[http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ngbibl.htm The Newgate Calendar \u2013 Bibliographical Note<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th century, highwaymen such as [[Dick Turpin]] were the heroes of a number of [[penny dreadful]]s, stories for boys published in serial form. In the 20th century the handsome highwayman became a [[stock character]] in historical love romances, including books by [[Emma Orczy|Baroness Orczy]] and [[Georgette Heyer]].\n\nSir [[Walter Scott]]'s romance ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' (1818) recounts the heroine waylaid by highwaymen while travelling from Scotland to London.\n\n===Comics===\nThe Belgian comics series ''Robin Dubois'' by [[Turk (comics)|Turk]] and [[De Groot]] is a [[gag-a-day]] series about [[Robin Hood]]'s attempts at robbing travellers in the forest.\n\nThe Dutch comics series ''[[Gilles de Geus]]'' by [[Hanco Kolk]] and [[Peter de Wit]] was originally a gag-a-day about a failed highwayman called Gilles, but the character later evolved into a resistance fighter with the [[Geuzen]] against the Spanish army.\n\n===Music===\nThere were many broadsheet [[ballad]]s about highwaymen; these were often written to be sold on the occasion of a famous robber's execution. A number of highwaymen ballads have remained current in [[oral tradition]] in England and Ireland.<ref>Seal, Graham: ''The Outlaw Legend: a cultural tradition in Britain, America and Australia'', pp. 47\u201378. Cambridge University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\nThe traditional Irish song \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\" tells the story of an Irish highwayman who robs an army captain, and includes the lines \"I first produced me pistol, then I drew me rapier. Said 'Stand and deliver, for you are a bold deceiver'.\"  The hit single version recorded in 1973 by Irish rock band [[Thin Lizzy]] renders this last line \"I said 'Stand-oh and deliver, or the devil he may take ya'.\"\n\nThe traditional Irish song \"[[The Newry Highwayman]]\" recounts the deeds and death of a highwayman who robbed \"the lords and ladies bright\". The traditional Irish song \"Brennan on the Moor\" describes an escapade of the \"bold, undaunted robber\". \n[[Adam and the Ants]] had a number one song for five weeks in 1981 in the UK with \"[[Stand and Deliver (Adam and the Ants song)|Stand and Deliver]]\". The video featured Adam Ant as an English highwayman.\n\nThe contemporary folk song \"On the Road to Fairfax County\" by [[David Massengill]], recorded by [[The Roches]] and by [[Joan Baez]], recounts a romantic encounter between a highwayman and his female victim.  In the end, the highwayman is hanged over the objections of his victim.\n\nMusician [[Jimmy Webb]] penned and recorded a song entitled \"[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]\" in 1977 about a soul with incarnations in four different places in time and history, a highwayman, a [[sailor]], a construction worker on the [[Hoover Dam]], and finally as a [[Astronaut|star ship captain]].  [[Glen Campbell]] recorded a version of the song in 1978, but the most popular incarnation of the song was recorded by [[Willie Nelson]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Johnny Cash]] in 1984, who as a group called themselves [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]].\n\nThe Canadian singer [[Loreena McKennitt|Loreena McKennit]] adapted the narrative poem, \"[[The Highwayman (poem)|The Highwayman]]\" written by [[Alfred Noyes]], as a song by the same title in her 1997 album [[The Book of Secrets]].\n\n===Cinema and television===\nThe [[Carry On films]] included a highwayman spoof in ''[[Carry On Dick]]'' (1974). [[Monty Python]] sent up the highwayman legends in the Dennis Moore sketch in Episode 37 of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', in which [[John Cleese]] played the titular criminal who stole only [[lupins]].<ref>[http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode37.htm#2 Monty Python's Flying Circus Script \u2013 Episode 37]</ref> In ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'', [[Mr. E. Blackadder]] turns highwayman in the episode \"[[Amy and Amiability]]\". In the British children's television series ''[[Dick Turpin (TV series)|Dick Turpin]]'', starring [[Richard O'Sullivan (actor)|Richard O'Sullivan]], the highwayman was depicted as an 18th-century Robin Hood figure.  Additionally the actor [[Mathew Baynton]] played Dick Turpin in ''[[Horrible Histories (2009 TV series)|Horrible Histories]]''. A singing highwayman appears in the fourth episode of the animated mini-series, ''[[Over the Garden Wall (miniseries)|Over the Garden Wall]]'', ''Songs of the Dark Lantern''.\n\nThe highwayman known as [[Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk]] (1688\u20131713) became a hero of many folk legends in the [[Slovak people|Slovak]], Czech, and Polish cultures by the 19th century<ref>Votruba, Martin: \"Hang Him High: The Elevation of J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk to an Ethnic Icon.\" ''Slavic Review,'' 65#1, pp. 24\u201344, 2006.

It is also possible for players to dress as Highwaymen. There is an enemy type in ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' called the \"bandit highwayman\" that acts as one of the higher-level bandit enemies. In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' one can encounter the Defias Highwaymen, the strongest members of the Defias Brotherhood. In ''[[Darkest Dungeon]]'' the Highwayman is a class of hero who wields a dirk and flintlock to fight. In ''[[Runescape]]'', highwaymen attack lower-leveled players on a route between two cities. In ''[[Bushido Blade 2]]'' there is a playable character named Highwayman who is dressed in Victorian clothing and represents the hero archetype. In ''[[Bloodborne]]'' many articles of clothing obtained by \"The Hunter\" are inspired by Highwaymen attire.\n\n===Films===\n*''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920)\n*''[[Dick Turpin (1925 film)|Dick Turpin]]'' (1925)\n*''[[Dick Turpin (1933 film)|Dick Turpin]]'' (1933)\n*''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938)\n*''[[The Night Riders (1939 film)|The Night Riders]]'' (1939)\n*''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939)\n*''[[My Little Chickadee]]'' (1940)\n*''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940)\n*''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940)\n*''[[The Wicked Lady]]'' (1945)\n*''[[The Loves of Carmen (1948 film)|The Loves of Carmen]]'' (1948)\n*''[[The Lady and the Bandit]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Bend of the River]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Son of Paleface]]'' (1952)\n*''[[The King's Thief]]'' (1955)\n*''[[The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders]]'' (1965)\n*''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969)\n*''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973)\n*''[[Carry On Dick]]'' (1974)\n*''[[The Mark of Zorro (1974 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975)\n*''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1977)\n*''[[The Wicked Lady (1983 film)|The Wicked Lady]]'' (1983)\n*''[[The Deceivers (film)|The Deceivers]]'' (1988)\n*''[[The Lady and the Highwayman]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Plunkett & Macleane]]'' (1999)\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[List of highwaymen]]\n*[[Brigandage]]\n*[[Bushranger]]\n*[[Dacoity]]\n*[[Hajduk]]\n*[[Mail robbery]]\n*[[Marauder (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Piracy]]\n*[[Road agent (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Social bandits]]\n*[[Thuggees]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* [[Russell Ash|Ash, Russell]] (1970).

In 1974, the tribe regained federal recognition and restoration of most of its reservation. Today Menominee County is essentially [[Coterminous municipality|coterminous]] with the boundaries of the federally recognized [[Menominee Indian Reservation]].\n\nMenominee County is included in the [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]], WI [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]-Shawano, WI [[Green Bay metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nThe county was created from the northeastern portion of [[Shawano County, Wisconsin|Shawano County]] on July 3, 1959, in anticipation of the termination of the [[Menominee Indian Reservation]] in 1961. The reservation status was restored in 1973, and is now co-extensive with the county.\n\nMost of the land within the county boundary is under Federal trust for the exclusive use by enrolled members of the Menominee nation. Scattered parcels that were purchased during termination, as well as many lots around the [[Legend Lake, Wisconsin|Legend Lake]] area in the southeastern part of the county, are the only parts of the county that are privately owned by non-Native Americans.

Today Menominee County is essentially [[Coterminous municipality|coterminous]] with the boundaries of the federally recognized [[Menominee Indian Reservation]].\n\nMemoninee County is included in the [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]], WI [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]-Shawano, WI [[Green Bay metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nThe county was created from the northeastern portion of [[Shawano County, Wisconsin|Shawano County]] on July 3, 1959, in anticipation of the termination of the [[Menominee Indian Reservation]] in 1961. The reservation status was restored in 1973, and is now co-extensive with the county.\n\nMost of the land within the county boundary is under Federal trust for the exclusive use by enrolled members of the Menominee nation. Scattered parcels that were purchased during termination, as well as many lots around the [[Legend Lake, Wisconsin|Legend Lake]] area in the southeastern part of the county, are the only parts of the county that are privately owned by non-Native Americans.
