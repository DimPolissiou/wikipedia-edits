It is the seat of the [[Algoma District]] and the third largest city in [[Northern Ontario]], after [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Thunder Bay]].\n\nThe [[Ojibwe]], the indigenous [[Anishinaabe]] inhabitants of the area, call this area ''Baawitigong'', meaning \"place of the rapids.\" They used this as a regional meeting place during [[freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] season in the St. Mary's Rapids. (The [[English language|anglicized]] form of this name, Bawating, is used in institutional and geographic names in the area.)\n\nTo the south, across the river, is the United States and the [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Michigan city of the same name]]. These two communities were one city until a new treaty after the [[War of 1812]] established the border between Canada and the United States in this area at the St. Mary's River. In the 21st century, the two cities are joined by the [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge|International Bridge]], which connects [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] on the Michigan side, and Huron Street (and former Ontario Secondary Highway 550B) on the Ontario side. Shipping traffic in the [[Great Lakes]] system bypasses the Saint Mary's Rapids via the American [[Soo Locks]], the world's busiest canal in terms of tonnage that passes through it, while smaller recreational and tour boats use the Canadian [[Sault Ste. Marie Canal]].\n\nFrench colonists referred to the rapids on the river as ''Les Saults de Ste. Marie'' and the village name was derived from that. The rapids and cascades of the St. Mary's River descend more than {{Convert|20|ft|abbr=on|0}} from the level of Lake Superior to the level of the lower lakes. Hundreds of years ago, this slowed shipping traffic, requiring an overland portage of boats and cargo from one lake to the other.  The entire name translates to \"Saint Mary's Rapids\" or \"Saint Mary's Falls\". The word ''sault'' is pronounced {{IPA-fr|so|}} in French, and {{IPAc-en|s|u\u02d0}} in the English pronunciation of the city name.<ref>[http://www.sault-sainte-marie.mi.us/history.htm \"History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801135609/http://sault-sainte-marie.mi.us/history.htm |date=2013-08-01 }}, Sault Ste.

Marie is bordered to the east by the [[Rankin Location 15D, Ontario|Rankin]]<!-- It's inhabited by the Batchawana First Nation, but the name of the *reserve* is Rankin, not Batchawana. --> and [[Garden River 14, Ontario|Garden River]] [[First Nation]] reserves, and to the west by [[Prince, Ontario|Prince Township]]. To the north, the city is bordered by an [[Unorganized North Algoma District|unincorporated portion of Algoma District]], which includes the [[local services board (Ontario)|local services boards]] of [[Aweres, Ontario|Aweres]], [[Batchawana Bay, Ontario|Batchawana Bay]], [[Goulais and District, Ontario|Goulais and District]], [[Peace Tree, Ontario|Peace Tree]] and [[Searchmont, Ontario|Searchmont]]. The city's [[census agglomeration]], including the townships of [[Laird, Ontario|Laird]], [[Prince, Ontario|Prince]] and [[Macdonald, Meredith and Aberdeen Additional]] and the [[Indian reserve|First Nations reserves]] of [[Garden River, Ontario|Garden River]] and [[Rankin Location 15D, Ontario|Rankin]], had a total population of 79,800 in 2011.\n\nNative American settlements, mostly of [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]-speaking peoples, existed here for more than 500 years. In the late 17th century, French [[Jesuit Missions in North America|Jesuit missionaries]] established a mission at the First Nations village. This was followed by development of a fur trading post and larger settlement, as traders, trappers and Native Americans were attracted to the community. It was considered one community and part of Canada until after the [[War of 1812]] and settlement of the border between Canada and the US at the Ste. Mary's River. At that time, the US prohibited British traders from any longer operating in its territory, and the areas separated by the river began to develop as two communities, both named Sault Ste. Marie.<ref>[http://www.thenorthview.org/history/saultdesaintemarie.html \"Sault Ste.

Marie Museum in downtown Sault Ste. Marie]]\n\nAfter the visit of [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] in 1623, the [[France|French]] called it \"Sault de Gaston\" in honour of [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], the brother of King [[Louis XIII of France]]. In 1668, French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries renamed it as '''Sault Sainte Marie''', and established a mission settlement (present-day [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]]) on the river's south bank.\n\nLater, a [[fur trade|fur trading]] post was established and the settlement expanded to include both sides of the river.  Sault Ste. Marie is one of the [[List of North American cities by year of foundation|oldest]] French settlements in North America.  It was at the crossroads of the 3,000-mile [[Canadian canoe routes (early)#Saint Lawrence River basin|fur trade route]], which stretched from [[Montreal]] to Sault Ste. Marie and to the North country above Lake Superior. A cosmopolitan, mixed population of Europeans, First Nations peoples, and [[M\u00e9tis people|M\u00e9tis]] lived at the village spanning the river.<ref>[http://www.thenorthview.org/history/saultdesaintemarie.html  \"Sault Ste.

Etymologically, the word ''sault'' comes from an archaic spelling of ''saut'' (from ''sauter''), which translates most accurately in this usage to the English word ''cataract''.  This in turn derives from the [[French language|French]] word for \"leap\" or \"jump\" (similar to ''[[somersault]]''). Citations dating back to 1600 use the ''sault'' spelling to mean a cataract, waterfall or rapids. In modern French, however, the words ''chutes'' or ''rapides'' are more usual. ''Sault'' survives almost exclusively in geographic names dating from the 17th century. (See also [[Long Sault, Ontario]], [[Kahnawake|Sault St. Louis, Quebec]], and [[Grand Falls, New Brunswick|Grand Falls/Grand-Sault, New Brunswick]], three other place names where \"sault\" also carries this meaning.)\n\nTraders regularly interacted with tribes from around the Great Lakes, and Scots-British fur trader [[John Johnston (fur trader)|John Johnston]], his Ojibwe wife and multi-racial were prominent among all societies here in the late eighteenth century. Their daughter, [[Jane Johnston Schoolcraft]] married [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]], a US Indian agent and early ethnographer, and they had children. She has been recognized as the first Native American poet and writer in the United States.\n\nThis fluid environment changed during and after the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the United States. Trade dropped during the war and on July 20, 1814 an American force destroyed the [[North West Company]] depot on the north shore of the St. Marys River. Since the Americans were unable to capture [[Fort Mackinac]], the British forces retained control of Sault Ste. Marie.<ref>Mary Ellen Perkins (ed.)

In order to control their own water passage, the Canadians constructed the [[Sault Ste. Marie Canal]], which was completed in 1895.<ref>Mary Ellen Perkins (ed.)

The town gained brief international notoriety in 1911 in the trial of [[Angelina Napolitano]], the first person in Canada to use the [[battered woman defence]] for murder.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">{{cite DCB |title=Napolitano (Neapolitano), Angelina |first=Franca |last=Iacovetta |volume=15 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/napolitano_angelina_15E.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], and particularly after the US was attacked at [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, government concern turned to protection of the locks and shipping channel at Sault Ste. Marie. A substantial military presence was established to protect the locks from a possible attack by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] aircraft from the north. The recent development of long-range bombers increased fears of a sudden air raid.  Military strategists studied polar projection maps, which indicated that the air distance from occupied [[Norway]] to the town was about the same as the distance from Norway to New York. That direct route of about {{Convert|3000|mi|abbr=on}} is over terrain where there were few observers and long winter nights.\n\nA joint Canadian and US committee called the \"Permanent Joint Board on Defence\" drove the installation of anti-aircraft defence and associated units of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] to defend the locks.  An anti-aircraft training facility was established {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} north of Sault Ste. Marie on the shores of [[Great Lakes|Lake Superior]].  [[Barrage balloon]]s were installed, and early warning radar bases were established at five locations in northern Ontario ([[Kapuskasing]], [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]], [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]], [[CFS Armstrong|Armstrong (Thunder Bay District)]], and [[Nakina, Ontario|Nakina]])<ref>{{cite book | title = Military Relations Between the United States and Canada 1939\u20131945 | last = Dziuban | first = Stanley W. | year = 1970 | page = 196 | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-SS-Canada/USA-SS-Canada-7.html | publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] | access-date = 2010-06-30 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100410013357/http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-SS-Canada/USA-SS-Canada-7.html | archivedate = 2010-04-10 }}</ref> to watch for incoming aircraft. Military personnel were established to guard sensitive parts of the transportation infrastructure.  A little over one year later, in January 1943, most of these facilities and defences were deemed excessive and removed, save a reduced military base at Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nThe first [[Algerine-class minesweeper|''Algerine''-class minesweeper]] in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] was named [[HMCS Sault Ste. Marie (J334)|HMCS ''Sault Ste. Marie'' (J334)]] after the city. It was laid down in 1942 and acted as a convoy in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\nOn January 29, 1990, Sault Ste. Marie became a flashpoint in the [[Meech Lake Accord]] constitutional debate when council passed a resolution declaring English as the city's official language<ref>''Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs, 1990'', David Leyton-Brown (ed.), p.135. \"On the language front, a major headache for the government began when the Sault Ste Marie City Council, under pressure from the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada, declared English as its official language.\"</ref> and the sole language for provision of municipal services. French speakers had already gained the use of French as an official language for government services.<ref>''Crosswords: Language, Education and Ethnicity in French Ontario'', Monica Heller, p. 79</ref> The city had a sizable French-speaking population and these residents objected strongly to the council's action.

[[Essar Steel Algoma|Algoma]] (formerly  Algoma Steel; Essar Steel Algoma) is the largest single employer, with 3500 employees at the main plant and approximately 553 (440 unionized and 113 non-unionized) at an adjacent tube mill operated by [[Tenaris]]. During the 1940s, the steel and chromium operations were of substantial importance to the war effort in Canada and the United States. Algoma Steel and the Chromium Mining and Smelting Corporation were key producers for transportation and military machines.\n\nThe [[Huron Central Railway]] has been important into the 21t century to the operation of the steel operation, despite extensive railway restructuring elsewhere. [[Genesee and Wyoming, Inc.]], owner of the railway,  announced its intention to discontinue operations. It continued to operate under an agreement which terminated on August 15, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gwrr.com/investors/PressReleaseText.asp?compid=64426&releaseID=1455457 | title = Genesee & Wyoming Reports Results for the Second Quarter of 2010 Aug 3, 2010 (Press release) | access-date = 2010-08-04 | date = 2010-08-03 | work = GWI Press Release | publisher = Genesee & Wyoming, Inc. | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5rkAfZsRg?url=http://www.gwrr.com/investors/PressReleaseText.asp?compid=64426&releaseID=1455457 | archivedate = 2010-08-05 | quote = GWI has continued to operate HCRY under a temporary operating agreement that terminates in mid-August 2010, unless renewed by the affected parties. | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:ESSAR Steel Algoma Inc..JPG|thumb|ESSAR Steel Algoma Inc.]]\n[[File:St Marys Paper.jpg|thumb|St. Mary's Paper, now closed]]\n[[File:ISS047-E-125740.jpg|thumb|Sault Ste. Marie at night from the International Space Station in 2016]]\nSault Ste. Marie prospered during the 1960s and '70s, but as imported steel began to compete with domestic production, the local industry began to contract. Since the late 1980s, Algoma has declared bankruptcy twice and laid off large numbers of workers, adversely affecting the regional economy. Algoma was bailed out by the Ontario government with interest-free loans. The company had a swift turnaround in 2004 from its earlier financial troubles of the 1990s. China's increased demand for steel of the past decade has increased the price of steel. [[Denis Turcotte]], CEO, was named \"Canadian CEO of the year\" in 2006 for his efforts. An offer to purchase ASI by the Essar Group (India) had been recommended by the ASI Board of Directors and was approved. The company was officially sold to the Essar Group in June 2007 for $1.6 billion.\n\nForestry is also a major local industry. [[St. Mary's Paper]] has been closed and decommissioned, although it was reopened in June 2007 and operated for a time under new ownership. Also related to wood products is Flakeboard Ltd., which employs over 110 people in the community. An adjacent [[melamine]] factory manufactures products with Flakeboard's materials. Examples are furniture and cupboards where a finish is added to the product. Together both of Flakeboard's factories employ about 150 people. The [[Huron Central Railway]] is important to these local industries as well.\n\nThe business process outsourcing industry had three [[call centre]]s in the city, which together employed about 1500 people. The largest, [[Sutherland Global Services]], closed in 2019 and Agero is closing in April 2020. [[Nucomm]] previously had a call centre here as well. The call centre industry became a major source of jobs and had contributed to the economic turnaround of the city in the late 1990s.\n\nAnother large employer in the community is the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]] (OLG). The OLG has a corporate office located on the waterfront. It employs a total of about 900 people in Sault Ste. Marie between the corporate office and [[OLG Casino Sault Ste. Marie]]. The prize centre used to be administered in the city but this operation was moved back to Toronto (York Mills) in 2009. The OLG is still the fourth-largest employer, after [[Algoma Steel]], [[Sault Area Hospital]], and the call centre industry.\n\nSault Ste. Marie is one of only a few cities in Ontario where a municipal bylaw prevents stores from opening on December 26, a Commonwealth holiday known as [[Boxing Day]], and the day after Christmas. Retail stores in Sault Ste. Marie begin their post-Christmas [[Boxing Day]] sales on December 27. A municipal [[referendum]] to determine whether voters favour allowing stores to open on Boxing Day was held concurrently with the [[2010 Ontario municipal elections|2010 municipal election]].<ref>[http://www.thesudburystar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2455383 Wording of Sault Ste.

Marie is served by [[Highway 17 (Ontario)|Highway 17]], designated as a segment of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] in the region. The highway connects the city to [[Thunder Bay]] to the northwest and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] to the east. The [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge|International Bridge]] connects downtown Sault Ste. Marie to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]], becoming [[Interstate 75]] on the American side. Interstate 75 continues south to [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], and [[Detroit]] before crossing into [[Ohio]], eventually terminating in [[Hialeah, Florida]], near [[Miami]].\n\nThe International Bridge also directs traffic from the American side of the border via Sault Ste. Marie's new transport route that runs from the bridge to Second Line. This new limited-access roadway, known as \"Carmen's Way\" after the late [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|MP]] [[Carmen Provenzano]], will make it much easier for transport trucks to reach main roads. The route of Carmen's Way has a wide grassy right-of-way on both sides of the roadway, to facilitate future expansion of its lane capacity. Planning is underway to eventually connect Second Line East to the new four-lane section of Highway 17 that recently opened east of the city.\n\nThe city plays an inherited role in [[marine transportation]], with the locks in [[Michigan]] being an integral component of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]]. The city operates its own small-scale lock which is used by small boats and other pleasure craft in the summer. Also recently opened is a multi-modal terminal designed to take advantage of the Sault as a rail, road, and water transportation hub.\n\nSault Ste. Marie is also served by [[Sault Ste.

It is the seat of the [[Algoma District]] and the third largest city in [[Northern Ontario]], after [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Thunder Bay]].\n\nThe [[Ojibwe]], the indigenous [[Anishinaabe]] inhabitants of the area, call this area ''Baawitigong'', meaning \"place of the rapids.\" They used this as a regional meeting place during [[freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] season in the St. Mary's Rapids. (The [[English language|anglicized]] form of this name, Bawating, is used in institutional and geographic names in the area.)\n\nTo the south, across the river, is the United States and the [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Michigan city of the same name]]. These two communities were one city until a new treaty after the [[War of 1812]] established the border between Canada and the United States in this area at the St. Mary's River. In the 21st century, the two cities are joined by the [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge|International Bridge]], which connects [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] on the Michigan side, and Huron Street (and former Ontario Secondary Highway 550B) on the Ontario side. Shipping traffic in the [[Great Lakes]] system bypasses the Saint Mary's Rapids via the American [[Soo Locks]], the world's busiest canal in terms of tonnage that passes through it, while smaller recreational and tour boats use the Canadian [[Sault Ste. Marie Canal]].\n\nFrench colonists referred to the rapids on the river as ''Les Saults de Ste. Marie'' and the village name was derived from that. The rapids and cascades of the St. Mary's River descend more than {{Convert|20|ft|abbr=on|0}} from the level of Lake Superior to the level of the lower lakes. Hundreds of years ago, this slowed shipping traffic, requiring an overland portage of boats and cargo from one lake to the other.  The entire name translates to \"Saint Mary's Rapids\" or \"Saint Mary's Falls\". The word ''sault'' is pronounced {{IPA-fr|so|}} in French, and {{IPAc-en|s|u\u02d0}} in the English pronunciation of the city name.<ref>[http://www.sault-sainte-marie.mi.us/history.htm \"History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801135609/http://sault-sainte-marie.mi.us/history.htm |date=2013-08-01 }}, Sault Ste.

Marie is bordered to the east by the [[Rankin Location 15D, Ontario|Rankin]]<!-- It's inhabited by the Batchawana First Nation, but the name of the *reserve* is Rankin, not Batchawana. --> and [[Garden River 14, Ontario|Garden River]] [[First Nation]] reserves, and to the west by [[Prince, Ontario|Prince Township]]. To the north, the city is bordered by an [[Unorganized North Algoma District|unincorporated portion of Algoma District]], which includes the [[local services board (Ontario)|local services boards]] of [[Aweres, Ontario|Aweres]], [[Batchawana Bay, Ontario|Batchawana Bay]], [[Goulais and District, Ontario|Goulais and District]], [[Peace Tree, Ontario|Peace Tree]] and [[Searchmont, Ontario|Searchmont]]. The city's [[census agglomeration]], including the townships of [[Laird, Ontario|Laird]], [[Prince, Ontario|Prince]] and [[Macdonald, Meredith and Aberdeen Additional]] and the [[Indian reserve|First Nations reserves]] of [[Garden River, Ontario|Garden River]] and [[Rankin Location 15D, Ontario|Rankin]], had a total population of 79,800 in 2011.\n\nNative American settlements, mostly of [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]-speaking peoples, existed here for more than 500 years. In the late 17th century, French [[Jesuit Missions in North America|Jesuit missionaries]] established a mission at the First Nations village. This was followed by development of a fur trading post and larger settlement, as traders, trappers and Native Americans were attracted to the community. It was considered one community and part of Canada until after the [[War of 1812]] and settlement of the border between Canada and the US at the Ste. Mary's River. At that time, the US prohibited British traders from any longer operating in its territory, and the areas separated by the river began to develop as two communities, both named Sault Ste. Marie.<ref>[http://www.thenorthview.org/history/saultdesaintemarie.html \"Sault Ste.

In 1668, French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries renamed it as '''Sault Sainte Marie''', and established a mission settlement (present-day [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]]) on the river's south bank.\n\nLater, a [[fur trade|fur trading]] post was established and the settlement expanded to include both sides of the river.  Sault Ste. Marie is one of the [[List of North American cities by year of foundation|oldest]] French settlements in North America.  It was at the crossroads of the 3,000-mile [[Canadian canoe routes (early)#Saint Lawrence River basin|fur trade route]], which stretched from [[Montreal]] to Sault Ste. Marie and to the North country above Lake Superior. A cosmopolitan, mixed population of Europeans, First Nations peoples, and [[M\u00e9tis people|M\u00e9tis]] lived at the village spanning the river.<ref>[http://www.thenorthview.org/history/saultdesaintemarie.html  \"Sault Ste.

Etymologically, the word ''sault'' comes from an archaic spelling of ''saut'' (from ''sauter''), which translates most accurately in this usage to the English word ''cataract''.  This in turn derives from the [[French language|French]] word for \"leap\" or \"jump\" (similar to ''[[somersault]]''). Citations dating back to 1600 use the ''sault'' spelling to mean a cataract, waterfall or rapids. In modern French, however, the words ''chutes'' or ''rapides'' are more usual. ''Sault'' survives almost exclusively in geographic names dating from the 17th century. (See also [[Long Sault, Ontario]], [[Kahnawake|Sault St. Louis, Quebec]], and [[Grand Falls, New Brunswick|Grand Falls/Grand-Sault, New Brunswick]], three other place names where \"sault\" also carries this meaning.)\n\nTraders regularly interacted with tribes from around the Great Lakes, and Scots-British fur trader [[John Johnston (fur trader)|John Johnston]], his Ojibwe wife and multi-racial were prominent among all societies here in the late eighteenth century. Their daughter, [[Jane Johnston Schoolcraft]] married [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]], a US Indian agent and early ethnographer, and they had children. She has been recognized as the first Native American poet and writer in the United States.\n\nThis fluid environment changed during and after the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the United States. Trade dropped during the war and on July 20, 1814 an American force destroyed the [[North West Company]] depot on the north shore of the St. Marys River. Since the Americans were unable to capture [[Fort Mackinac]], the British forces retained control of Sault Ste. Marie.<ref>Mary Ellen Perkins (ed.)

The town gained brief international notoriety in 1911 in the trial of [[Angelina Napolitano]], the first person in Canada to use the [[battered woman defence]] for murder.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">{{cite DCB |title=Napolitano (Neapolitano), Angelina |first=Franca |last=Iacovetta |volume=15 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/napolitano_angelina_15E.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], and particularly after the US was attacked at [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, government concern turned to protection of the locks and shipping channel at Sault Ste. Marie. A substantial military presence was established to protect the locks from a possible attack by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] aircraft from the north. The recent development of long-range bombers increased fears of a sudden air raid.  Military strategists studied polar projection maps, which indicated that the air distance from occupied [[Norway]] to the town was about the same as the distance from Norway to New York. That direct route of about {{Convert|3000|mi|abbr=on}} is over terrain where there were few observers and long winter nights.\n\nA joint Canadian and US committee called the \"Permanent Joint Board on Defence\" drove the installation of anti-aircraft defence and associated units of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] to defend the locks.  An anti-aircraft training facility was established {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} north of Sault Ste. Marie on the shores of [[Great Lakes|Lake Superior]].  [[Barrage balloon]]s were installed, and early warning radar bases were established at five locations in northern Ontario ([[Kapuskasing]], [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]], [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]], [[CFS Armstrong|Armstrong (Thunder Bay District)]], and [[Nakina, Ontario|Nakina]])<ref>{{cite book | title = Military Relations Between the United States and Canada 1939\u20131945 | last = Dziuban | first = Stanley W. | year = 1970 | page = 196 | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-SS-Canada/USA-SS-Canada-7.html | publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] | access-date = 2010-06-30 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100410013357/http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-SS-Canada/USA-SS-Canada-7.html | archivedate = 2010-04-10 }}</ref> to watch for incoming aircraft. Military personnel were established to guard sensitive parts of the transportation infrastructure.  A little over one year later, in January 1943, most of these facilities and defences were deemed excessive and removed, save a reduced military base at Sault Ste.

Marie'' (J334)]] after the city. It was laid down in 1942 and acted as a convoy in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\nOn January 29, 1990, Sault Ste. Marie became a flashpoint in the [[Meech Lake Accord]] constitutional debate when council passed a resolution declaring English as the city's official language<ref>''Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs, 1990'', David Leyton-Brown (ed.), p.135. \"On the language front, a major headache for the government began when the Sault Ste Marie City Council, under pressure from the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada, declared English as its official language.\"</ref> and the sole language for provision of municipal services. French speakers had already gained the use of French as an official language for government services.<ref>''Crosswords: Language, Education and Ethnicity in French Ontario'', Monica Heller, p. 79</ref> The city had a sizable French-speaking population and these residents objected strongly to the council's action. The [[Sault Ste.

[[Essar Steel Algoma|Algoma]] (formerly  Algoma Steel; Essar Steel Algoma) is the largest single employer, with 3500 employees at the main plant and approximately 553 (440 unionized and 113 non-unionized) at an adjacent tube mill operated by [[Tenaris]]. During the 1940s, the steel and chromium operations were of substantial importance to the war effort in Canada and the United States. Algoma Steel and the Chromium Mining and Smelting Corporation were key producers for transportation and military machines.\n\nThe [[Huron Central Railway]] has been important into the 21t century to the operation of the steel operation, despite extensive railway restructuring elsewhere. [[Genesee and Wyoming, Inc.]], owner of the railway,  announced its intention to discontinue operations. It continued to operate under an agreement which terminated on August 15, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gwrr.com/investors/PressReleaseText.asp?compid=64426&releaseID=1455457 | title = Genesee & Wyoming Reports Results for the Second Quarter of 2010 Aug 3, 2010 (Press release) | access-date = 2010-08-04 | date = 2010-08-03 | work = GWI Press Release | publisher = Genesee & Wyoming, Inc. | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5rkAfZsRg?url=http://www.gwrr.com/investors/PressReleaseText.asp?compid=64426&releaseID=1455457 | archivedate = 2010-08-05 | quote = GWI has continued to operate HCRY under a temporary operating agreement that terminates in mid-August 2010, unless renewed by the affected parties. | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:ESSAR Steel Algoma Inc..JPG|thumb|ESSAR Steel Algoma Inc.]]\n[[File:St Marys Paper.jpg|thumb|St. Mary's Paper, now closed]]\n[[File:ISS047-E-125740.jpg|thumb|Sault Ste. Marie at night from the International Space Station in 2016]]\nSault Ste. Marie prospered during the 1960s and '70s, but as imported steel began to compete with domestic production, the local industry began to contract. Since the late 1980s, Algoma has declared bankruptcy twice and laid off large numbers of workers, adversely affecting the regional economy. Algoma was bailed out by the Ontario government with interest-free loans. The company had a swift turnaround in 2004 from its earlier financial troubles of the 1990s. China's increased demand for steel of the past decade has increased the price of steel. [[Denis Turcotte]], CEO, was named \"Canadian CEO of the year\" in 2006 for his efforts. An offer to purchase ASI by the Essar Group (India) had been recommended by the ASI Board of Directors and was approved. The company was officially sold to the Essar Group in June 2007 for $1.6 billion.\n\nForestry is also a major local industry. [[St. Mary's Paper]] has been closed and decommissioned, although it was reopened in June 2007 and operated for a time under new ownership. Also related to wood products is Flakeboard Ltd., which employs over 110 people in the community. An adjacent [[melamine]] factory manufactures products with Flakeboard's materials. Examples are furniture and cupboards where a finish is added to the product. Together both of Flakeboard's factories employ about 150 people. The [[Huron Central Railway]] is important to these local industries as well.\n\nThe business process outsourcing industry had three [[call centre]]s in the city, which together employed about 1500 people. The largest, [[Sutherland Global Services]], closed in 2019 and Agero is closing in April 2020. [[Nucomm]] previously had a call centre here as well. The call centre industry became a major source of jobs and had contributed to the economic turnaround of the city in the late 1990s.\n\nAnother large employer in the community is the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]] (OLG). The OLG has a corporate office located on the waterfront. It employs a total of about 900 people in Sault Ste. Marie between the corporate office and [[OLG Casino Sault Ste. Marie]]. The prize centre used to be administered in the city but this operation was moved back to Toronto (York Mills) in 2009. The OLG is still the fourth-largest employer, after [[Algoma Steel]], [[Sault Area Hospital]], and the call centre industry.\n\nSault Ste. Marie is one of only a few cities in Ontario where a municipal bylaw prevents stores from opening on December 26, a Commonwealth holiday known as [[Boxing Day]], and the day after Christmas. Retail stores in Sault Ste. Marie begin their post-Christmas [[Boxing Day]] sales on December 27. A municipal [[referendum]] to determine whether voters favour allowing stores to open on Boxing Day was held concurrently with the [[2010 Ontario municipal elections|2010 municipal election]].<ref>[http://www.thesudburystar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2455383 Wording of Sault Ste.

Marie Canal, with the International Bridge and rail bridge in background]]\nSault Ste. Marie is served by [[Highway 17 (Ontario)|Highway 17]], designated as a segment of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] in the region. The highway connects the city to [[Thunder Bay]] to the northwest and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] to the east. The [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge|International Bridge]] connects downtown Sault Ste. Marie to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]], becoming [[Interstate 75]] on the American side. Interstate 75 continues south to [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], and [[Detroit]] before crossing into [[Ohio]], eventually terminating in [[Hialeah, Florida]], near [[Miami]].\n\nThe International Bridge also directs traffic from the American side of the border via Sault Ste. Marie's new transport route that runs from the bridge to Second Line. This new limited-access roadway, known as \"Carmen's Way\" after the late [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|MP]] [[Carmen Provenzano]], will make it much easier for transport trucks to reach main roads. The route of Carmen's Way has a wide grassy right-of-way on both sides of the roadway, to facilitate future expansion of its lane capacity. Planning is underway to eventually connect Second Line East to the new four-lane section of Highway 17 that recently opened east of the city.\n\nThe city plays an inherited role in [[marine transportation]], with the locks in [[Michigan]] being an integral component of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]]. The city operates its own small-scale lock which is used by small boats and other pleasure craft in the summer. Also recently opened is a multi-modal terminal designed to take advantage of the Sault as a rail, road, and water transportation hub.\n\nSault Ste. Marie is also served by [[Sault Ste. Marie Airport]] and [[Sault Transit Services]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saulttransitservices.com/ |title=Sault Ste.

ONTC currently has three stops in the city, with the main stop being along Trunk Road on the east end, and the other stops being at Sault College and the hospital.\n\n==Tourism==\nArea [[tourist]] attractions include the [[Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre]], the Sault Ste. Marie Museum, the [[Sault Ste. Marie Canal]] National Historic Site, boat tours of the [[Sault locks]] (which connect [[Lake Superior]] with the lower [[Great Lakes]]), [[Whitefish Island, Ontario|Whitefish Island]], the Ermatinger-Clergue National Historic Site,  [[Casino Sault Ste. Marie]], the [[Art Gallery of Algoma]] and the [[Algoma Central Railway]]'s popular [[Agawa Canyon]] Tour Train.\n\nThe [[Norgoma|MS ''Norgoma'']], a Canadian passenger ship, was a [[museum ship]] in the [[Great Lakes]] at Sault Ste. Marie. This ship is no longer docked in Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nNearby parks include [[Pancake Bay Provincial Park]], [[Batchawana Bay Provincial Park]] and [[Lake Superior Provincial Park]]. Winter activities are also an asset to Sault Ste Marie's tourism industry with the annual [[Bon Soo Winter Carnival]], [[Searchmont, Ontario|Searchmont]] Resort as a great ski and snowboard destination, Stokely Creek Lodge (cross country ski resort) and Hiawatha a nearby cross country ski trails. The city also hosts a large snowmobile trail system that criss-crosses the province of Ontario.\n\nA new non-motorized HUB trail is being created around the city ({{Convert|20|km|abbr=on}}) so that walkers, rollerbladers and cyclists (snowshoeing and cross country skiing in winter) can enjoy the beautiful and convenient circle tour around town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://saultstemarie.ca/City-Hall/City-Departments/Community-Development-Enterprise-Services/Planning-Enterprise-Services/Strategic-Long-Range-Planning/Active-Transportation/John-Rowswell-Hub-Trail.aspx|title=John Rowswell Hub Trail|publisher=City of Sault Ste Marie|access-date=January 24, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202125347/http://saultstemarie.ca/City-Hall/City-Departments/Community-Development-Enterprise-Services/Planning-Enterprise-Services/Strategic-Long-Range-Planning/Active-Transportation/John-Rowswell-Hub-Trail.aspx|archivedate=February 2, 2017}}</ref> The [[Voyageur Hiking Trail]], a long-distance trail that will eventually span from [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] to [[Thunder Bay]], originated in Sault Ste.

The Greyhounds play in the [[GFL Memorial Gardens]], a state-of-the-art downtown arena that replaced the [[Sault Memorial Gardens]] in 2006. The current Hounds have retired five jerseys since joining the [[Ontario Hockey League]] in 1972:  #1 [[John Vanbiesbrouck]], #4 [[Craig Hartsburg]], #10 [[Ron Francis]], #5 [[Adam Foote]], and #99 [[Wayne Gretzky]].\n\nSault Ste.

''X. fastidiosa'' subsp. ''fastidiosa'' is the most studied subspecies, as it is the causal agent of PD; it is thought to have originated in southern [[Central America]] and also affects other kinds of plants. ''X. fastidiosa'' subsp. ''multiplex'' affects many trees, including stone-fruit ones such as [[peach]]es and [[plum]]s and is thought to originate in temperate and southern [[North America]]. ''Xylella fastidiosa'' subsp. ''pauca'' is believed to have originated in [[South America]]. It is the causal agent of CVC in [[Brazil]] and also affects South American coffee crops, causing coffee leaf scorch. ''Xylella fastidiosa'' subsp. ''sandyi'' is thought to have originated in the southern part of the [[United States|United States of America]], and is notable for causing oleander leaf scorch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/57195|title=Xylella fastidiosa (Pierce's disease of grapevines)|website=www.cabi.org|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref>\n\n''X. fastidiosa'' has a two-part life cycle which occurs inside an insect vector and inside a susceptible plant.  While the bacterium has been found across the globe, only once the bacterium reaches systemic levels do symptoms present themselves.  Within susceptible plant hosts, ''X. fastidiosa'' forms a biofilm-like layer within xylem cells and [[Xylem#Structure|tracheary elements]] that can completely block the water transport in affected vessels.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n== Symptoms ==\nThere is significant variation in symptoms between diseases, though some symptoms are expressed across species. On a [[macroscopic scale]], plants infected with a ''X. fastidiosa''-related disease exhibit symptoms of water deficiencies, manifesting as leaf scorching and stunting in leaves, fruit, and overall plant height.  As the bacterium progressively colonizes xylem tissues, affected plants often block off their xylem which can limit the spread of this pathogen; blocking can occur in the form of [[polysaccharide]] rich gels, [[Tylosis (botany)|tyloses]], or both.  These plant defenses do not seem to hinder the movement of ''X. fastidiosa''. Occlusion of vascular tissue, while a normal plant response to infection, makes symptoms significantly worse: as the bacterium itself also reduces vascular function, a 90% reduction of vascular hydraulic function was seen in susceptible ''[[Vitis vinifera]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Qiang|last2=Sun|first2=Yuliang|last3=Walker|first3=M.

Smaller colonies usually occur throughout a high proportion of xylem vessels of a symptomatic plant.\n\n=== Pierce's disease ===\nSevere PD symptoms include shriveled fruit, leaf scorching, and premature [[abscission]] of leaves, with bare [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] remaining on stems.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Citrus variegated chlorosis ===\nThis disease is named after the characteristic spotty chlorosis on upper sides of Citrus leaves. Fruits of infected plants are small and hard.\n\n=== Leaf scorches ===\nIn [[coffee]], premature abscission of leaves and fruits is of bigger concern than scorching.\n\n== Environment ==\n''Xylella fastidiosa'' occurs worldwide, though its diseases are most prominent in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] habitats including the southeastern United States, [[California]], and South America.\n\nSymptoms of ''X. fastidiosa'' diseases worsen during hot, dry periods in the summer: lack of water and maximum demand from a full canopy of leaves combined with symptoms due to disease stress infected plants to a breaking point. Cold winters can limit the spread of the disease;<ref name=\":2\" /> as occurs in California, but not in regions with milder winters such as Brazil. Additionally, dry summers seem to delay symptom development of PD in California.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAny conditions that increase vector populations can increase disease incidence, such as [[seasonal rainfall]] and forests or tree cover adjacent to crops, which serve as alternate food sources and [[overwintering]] locations for [[leafhopper]]s.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[Alexander Purcell]], an expert on ''Xylella fastidiosa'', hypothesized that plants foreign to ''X. fastidiosa''{{'}}s area of origin, the [[Neotropical realm|neotropical]] regions, are more susceptible to symptom development. Thus, plants from warmer climates are more resistant to ''X. fastidiosa'' disease development, while plants from areas with harsher winters, such as grapes, are more severely affected by this disease.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Hosts==\n''X. fastidiosa'' has a very wide host range: as of 2015, its host range was currently in excess of 560 plant species, with 312 species confirmed via two different detection methods, in 82 botanical families.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=European Food Safety Authority|date=2018|title=Scientific report on the update of the Xylella spp. host plant database|url=|journal=EFSA Journal|language=en|volume=16|issue=9|pages=87|doi=|issn=1831-4732|via=}}</ref>  Most 'X. fastidiosa'' host plants are [[dicots]], but it has also been reported in [[monocots]] and [[ginkgo]], a [[gymnosperm]].

The bacterium multiplies within its vectors, forming a \"bacterial carpet\" within the [[foregut]] of its host.  If the host sheds its foregut during molting, the vector is no longer infected, but can reacquire the pathogen.

Pierce]] (1856\u20131916; California's first professional plant pathologist) on grapes in California near [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], where it was known as \"Anaheim disease\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pinney|first1=Thomas|title=A History of Wine in America from the Beginnings to Prohibition|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520062245|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwineina0000pinn/page/27 27]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwineina0000pinn|url-access=registration}}</ref> The disease is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in northern California, being spread by the [[Graphocephala atropunctata|blue-green sharpshooter]], which attacks only [[grapevines]]  adjacent to [[Riparian zone|riparian]] habitats. It became a real threat to [[California wine|California's wine industry]] when the [[glassy-winged sharpshooter]] (GWSS), native to the southeast United States, was discovered in the [[Temecula Valley]] in California in 1996. The GWSS spreads PD much more extensively than other vectors.\n\n==== Symptoms of infection ====\nWhen a grape vine becomes infected, the bacterium causes a gel to form in the [[xylem]] tissue of the vine, preventing water from being drawn through the vine. Leaves on vines with Pierce's disease will turn yellow and brown, and eventually drop off the vine. Shoots will also die. After one to five years, the vine itself will die. The proximity of vineyards to citrus orchards compounds the threat, because citrus is not only a host of sharpshooter eggs, but it is also a popular overwintering site of this insect. Likewise, [[oleander]], a common landscaping plant in California, serves as a reservoir for ''Xylella''.\n\n==== Collaborative efforts for solutions ====\nA unique effort from growers, administrators, policy makers and researchers are working on a solution for this immense ''X. fastidiosa'' threat. No cure has been found,<ref name=\"OCW-PD\">winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= Oxford Companion to Wine| title= Pierce's disease |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=2428 }}</ref> but the understanding of ''Xylella fastidiosa'' and glassy-winged sharpshooter biology has markedly increased since 2000, when the [[California Department of Food and Agriculture]], in collaboration with different universities, such as [[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis); [[University of California, Berkeley]]; [[University of California, Riverside]], and the [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] started to focus their research on this pest. The research explores the different aspects of the disease propagation from the vector to the host plant and within the host plant, to the impact of the disease on California's economy. All researchers working on Pierce's disease meet annually in San Diego in mid-December to discuss the progress in their field.

''Xylella fastidiosa'' subsp. ''pauca'' is believed to have originated in [[South America]]. It is the causal agent of CVC in [[Brazil]] and also affects South American coffee crops, causing coffee leaf scorch. ''Xylella fastidiosa'' subsp.

While the bacterium has been found across the globe, only once the bacterium reaches systemic levels do symptoms present themselves.  Within susceptible plant hosts, ''X. fastidiosa'' forms a biofilm-like layer within xylem cells and [[Xylem#Structure|tracheary elements]] that can completely block the water transport in affected vessels.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n== Symptoms ==\nThere is significant variation in symptoms between diseases, though some symptoms are expressed across species. On a [[macroscopic scale]], plants infected with a ''X. fastidiosa''-related disease exhibit symptoms of water deficiencies, manifesting as leaf scorching and stunting in leaves, fruit, and overall plant height.  As the bacterium progressively colonizes xylem tissues, affected plants often block off their xylem which can limit the spread of this pathogen; blocking can occur in the form of [[polysaccharide]] rich gels, [[Tylosis (botany)|tyloses]], or both.  These plant defenses do not seem to hinder the movement of ''X. fastidiosa''. Occlusion of vascular tissue, while a normal plant response to infection, makes symptoms significantly worse: as the bacterium itself also reduces vascular function, a 90% reduction of vascular hydraulic function was seen in susceptible ''[[Vitis vinifera]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Qiang|last2=Sun|first2=Yuliang|last3=Walker|first3=M.

If the host sheds its foregut during molting, the vector is no longer infected, but can reacquire the pathogen.  At present, there is no evidence that the bacterium has any detrimental effect on its insect hosts.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+List of Subspecies ''fastidiosa'' Susceptible Plants (recreated from EFSA Panel)<ref name=\":5\" />\n!Subspecies\n!Plant Family\n!Plant Genus\n|-\n|''fastidiosa''\n|''[[Adoxaceae]]''\n|''[[Sambucus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Amaranthaceae]]''\n|''[[Alternanthera]], [[Chenopodium]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Anacardiaceae]]''\n|''[[Rhus]], [[Toxicodendron]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Apiaceae]]''\n|''[[Conium]], [[Datura]], [[Daucus]], [[Oenanthe (plant)|Oenanthe]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Apocynaceae]]''\n|''[[Nerium]], [[Vinca]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Araliaceae]]''\n|''[[Hedera]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Asteraceae]]''\n|''[[Ambrosia (plant)|Ambrosia]], [[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]], [[Baccharis]], [[Callistephus]], [[Conyza]], [[Ragweed|Franseria]], [[Helianthus]], [[Lactuca]], [[Goldenrod|Solidago]], [[Sonchus]], [[Xanthium]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Betulaceae]]''\n|''[[Alnus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Boraginaceae]]''\n|''[[Amsinckia]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Brassicaceae]]''\n|''[[Brassica]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Cannaceae]]''\n|''[[Canna (plant)|Canna]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Caprifoliaceae]]''\n|''[[Lonicera]], [[Symphoricarpos]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Convolvulaceae]]''\n|''[[Convolvulus]], [[Ipomoea]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Cyperaceae]]''\n|''[[Cyperus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Fabaceae]]''\n|''[[Acacia]], [[Chamaecrista]], [[Cytisus]], [[Genista]], [[Lathyrus]], [[Lupinus]], [[Medicago]], [[Melilotus]], [[Spartium]], [[Clover|Trifolium]], [[Vicia]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Fagaceae]]''\n|''[[Oak|Quercus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Geraniaceae]]''\n|''[[Erodium]], [[Pelargonium]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Juglandaceae]]''\n|''[[Juglans]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Lamiaceae]]''\n|''[[Callicarpa]], [[Origanum]], [[Melissa (plant)|Melissa]], [[Mentha]], [[Rosmarinus]], [[Salvia]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Lauraceae]]''\n|''[[Persea]], [[Umbellularia]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Magnoliaceae]]''\n|''[[Magnolia]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Malvaceae]]''\n|''[[Malva]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Myrtaceae]]''\n|''[[Eucalyptus]], [[Eugenia]], [[Metrosideros]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Oleaceae]]''\n|''[[Fraxinus]], [[Syringa]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Onagraceae]]''\n|''[[Epilobium]], [[Fuchsia]], [[Clarkia]], [[Oenothera]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Pittosporaceae]]''\n|''[[Pittosporum]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Platanaceae]]''\n|''[[Platanus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Poaceae]]''\n|''[[Avena]], [[Bromus]], [[Cynodon]], [[Digitaria]], [[Echinochloa]], [[Eragrostis]], [[Eriochloa|Eriochola]], [[Festuca]], [[Holcus]], [[Hordeum]], [[Lolium]], [[Paspalum]], [[Pennisetum]], [[Phalaris (plant)|Phalaris]], [[Phleum]], [[Poa]], [[Setaria]], [[Sorghum]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Polygonaceae]]''\n|''[[Persicaria]], [[Polygonum]], [[Rheum (plant)|Rheum]], [[Rumex]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Portulacaceae]]''\n|''[[Montia]], [[Portulaca]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Resedaceae]]''\n|''[[Reseda (plant)|Reseda]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Rhamnaceae]]''\n|''[[Rhamnus (genus)|Rhamnus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Rosaceae]]''\n|''[[Cotoneaster]], [[Fragaria]], [[Photinia]], [[Prunus]], [[Rosa (plant)|Rosa]], [[Rubus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Rubiaceae]]''\n|''[[Coffea]], [[Coprosma]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Rutaceae]]''\n|''[[Citrus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Salicaceae]]''\n|''[[Populus]], [[Salix]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Sapindaceae]]''\n|''[[Acer (plant)|Acer]], [[Aesculus]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Scrophulariaceae]]''\n|''[[Veronica (plant)|Veronica]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Simmondsiaceae]]''\n|''[[Simmondsia]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Solanaceae]]''\n|''[[Datura]], [[Lycopersicon]], [[Nicotiana]], [[Solanum]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Urticaceae]]''\n|''[[Urtica]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Verbenaceae]]''\n|''[[Duranta]]''\n|-\n|\n|''[[Vitaceae]]''\n|''[[Ampelopsis]], [[Parthenocissus]], [[Vitis]]''\n|}\n\n=== Grape ===\nPierce's disease (PD) was discovered in 1892 by [[Newton B. Pierce]] (1856\u20131916; California's first professional plant pathologist) on grapes in California near [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], where it was known as \"Anaheim disease\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pinney|first1=Thomas|title=A History of Wine in America from the Beginnings to Prohibition|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520062245|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwineina0000pinn/page/27 27]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwineina0000pinn|url-access=registration}}</ref> The disease is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in northern California, being spread by the [[Graphocephala atropunctata|blue-green sharpshooter]], which attacks only [[grapevines]]  adjacent to [[Riparian zone|riparian]] habitats. It became a real threat to [[California wine|California's wine industry]] when the [[glassy-winged sharpshooter]] (GWSS), native to the southeast United States, was discovered in the [[Temecula Valley]] in California in 1996. The GWSS spreads PD much more extensively than other vectors.\n\n==== Symptoms of infection ====\nWhen a grape vine becomes infected, the bacterium causes a gel to form in the [[xylem]] tissue of the vine, preventing water from being drawn through the vine. Leaves on vines with Pierce's disease will turn yellow and brown, and eventually drop off the vine. Shoots will also die. After one to five years, the vine itself will die. The proximity of vineyards to citrus orchards compounds the threat, because citrus is not only a host of sharpshooter eggs, but it is also a popular overwintering site of this insect. Likewise, [[oleander]], a common landscaping plant in California, serves as a reservoir for ''Xylella''.\n\n==== Collaborative efforts for solutions ====\nA unique effort from growers, administrators, policy makers and researchers are working on a solution for this immense ''X. fastidiosa'' threat. No cure has been found,<ref name=\"OCW-PD\">winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= Oxford Companion to Wine| title= Pierce's disease |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=2428 }}</ref> but the understanding of ''Xylella fastidiosa'' and glassy-winged sharpshooter biology has markedly increased since 2000, when the [[California Department of Food and Agriculture]], in collaboration with different universities, such as [[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis); [[University of California, Berkeley]]; [[University of California, Riverside]], and the [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] started to focus their research on this pest. The research explores the different aspects of the disease propagation from the vector to the host plant and within the host plant, to the impact of the disease on California's economy. All researchers working on Pierce's disease meet annually in San Diego in mid-December to discuss the progress in their field.

As a teenager, Stefano was so keen to become an actor that he dropped out of high school two weeks before graduation and traveled to [[New York City]]. In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.\n\nStefano's initial career was as a composer of [[pop music]] in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman [[Donn Arden]]. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist [[Michael Feinstein]] on names of obscure [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs.\n\n==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==\nStefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for [[Martin Ritt]] with ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1959); his father was a tailor, and his mother made silk flowers and this was an influence on the screenplay.\n\nStefano was commissioned by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to adapt [[Robert Bloch]]'s novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1960) for the screen. His work was recognized by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] when he was given a 1961 [[Edgar Award]], for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch's utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).\n\nStefano was also offered the job of scripting Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend [[Leslie Stevens]]' [[science fiction television]] anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for ''Marnie''.\n\nAfter leaving the series due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote, produced and directed ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]'' (1964; aka ''The Haunted''), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for ''The Outer Limits''. The [[thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Eye of the Cat]]'' (1969) and the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''Futz'' (1969) were Stefano's last big-screen jobs for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many [[television film]]s such as ''[[Revenge!]]'' (1971), ''[[A Death of Innocence]]'' (1971), ''[[Home for the Holidays (1972 film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1972), ''[[Live Again, Die Again]]'' (1974), ''Aloha Means Goodbye'' (1974) and ''[[Snowbeast]]'' (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1988) entitled \"[[Skin of Evil]]\". Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films.

As a teenager, Stefano was so keen to become an actor that he dropped out of high school two weeks before graduation and traveled to [[New York City]]. In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.\n\nStefano's initial career was as a composer of [[pop music]] in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman [[Donn Arden]]. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist [[Michael Feinstein]] on names of obscure [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs.\n\n==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==\nStefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for [[Martin Ritt]] with ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1959); his father was a tailor, and his mother made silk flowers and this was an influence on the screenplay.\n\nStefano was commissioned by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to adapt [[Robert Bloch]]'s novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1960) for the screen. His work was recognized by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] when he was given a 1961 [[Edgar Award]], for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch's utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).\n\nStefano was also offered the job of scripting Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend [[Leslie Stevens]]' [[science fiction television]] anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for ''Marnie''.\n\nAfter leaving the series due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote, produced and directed ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]'' (1964; aka ''The Haunted''), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for ''The Outer Limits''. The [[thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Eye of the Cat]]'' (1969) and the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''Futz'' (1969) were Stefano's last big-screen jobs for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many [[television film]]s such as ''[[Revenge!]]'' (1971), ''[[A Death of Innocence]]'' (1971), ''[[Home for the Holidays (1972 film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1972), ''[[Live Again, Die Again]]'' (1974), ''Aloha Means Goodbye'' (1974) and ''[[Snowbeast]]'' (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1988) entitled \"[[Skin of Evil]]\". Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) posits the origins of [[Norman Bates]]' destructive mother-love, featuring [[Olivia Hussey]] as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the [[Al Pacino]] [[drama]] ''[[Two Bits]]'' (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998) followed Stefano's script punctiliously, and in the biopic ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), about the making of ''Psycho,'' he is portrayed by [[Ralph Macchio]].\n\nStefano died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Los Robles Hospital]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], in 2006.\n\n==''The Outer Limits''==\nStefano was a producer for the first season of ''The Outer Limits'' and wrote a total of 12 episodes.

It was created by [[Gjon Kastrioti]] and then ruled by the national hero of Albania, [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]].\n\n==Formation==\n[[Gjon Kastrioti]] had originally only two small villages. In short time John Kastrioti managed to expand its lands so as to become the undisputed lord of Central Albania.\nHe married [[Voisava Tripalda]] who bore five daughters - Mara, later wife of [[Stefan Crnojevi\u0107]] of Montenegro; Jela, then wife of Gjin (Gino) Musacchio; Angjelina (Angelina), later wife of [[Vladan Arianit Comnenus Thopia]]; Vlajka, later wife of [[Stefan Maramonte Bal\u0161i\u0107]]; Mamica, later wife of [[Karol Musacchio Thopia]] - and four sons: Repo\u0161, Stani\u0161a (Stanislaus), Kostandin (Constantine) and [[George Kastrioti]]. [[Gjon Kastrioti]] was among those who opposed<ref name=\"Tennent1845\">[[James Emerson Tennent]], 1845, ''The History of Modern Greece, from Its Conquest by the Romans B.C.146, to the Present Time''</ref> the early incursion of Ottoman [[Bayezid I]], however his resistance was ineffectual. The Sultan, having accepted his submissions, obliged him to pay tribute and to ensure the fidelity of local rulers, George Kastrioti and his three brothers were taken by the Sultan to his court as hostages. After his conversion to [[Islam]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Rendina|first=Claudio|title=La grande enciclopedia di Roma|page=1136|publisher=Newton Compton|location=Rome|year=2000|isbn=88-8289-316-2}}</ref> the young George Kastrioti attended military school in [[Edirne]] and led many battles for the [[Ottoman Empire]] to victory. For his military victories, he received the title ''Arnavutlu \u0130skender [[Bey]]'', ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Sk\u00ebnderbe shqiptari'', English: ''Lord Alexander, the Albanian'') comparing Kastrioti's military brilliance to that of [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n==Restoration of Gjergj Kastrioti==\nHe was distinguished as one of the best officers in several Ottoman campaigns both in Asia Minor and in Europe, and the Sultan appointed him General. He even fought against [[Greeks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians]], and some sources say that he used to maintain secret links with [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Ladislaus Posthumus of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus V]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]] of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]].<ref name=\"Noli\">[[Fan S. Noli|Noli, Fan S.]]: ''George Castrioti Scanderbeg'', New York, 1947</ref> Sultan Murat II gave him the title [[W\u0101li|Vali]] which made him General Governor.\nOn November 28, 1443, Skanderbeg saw his opportunity to rebel after a [[Battle of Ni\u0161 (1443)|battle]] against the Hungarians led by [[John Hunyadi]] in [[Ni\u0161]] as part of the [[Crusade of Varna]]. He switched sides along with 300 other Albanians serving in the Ottoman army. After a long trek to Albania he eventually captured Kruj\u00eb by forging a letter<ref name=\"Tennent1845\"\n/> from the Sultan to the Governor of Kruj\u00eb, which granted him control of the territory. After capturing the castle, Skanderbeg<ref name=\"gibbon\">[[Edward Gibbon]], 1788, ''[[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=b8ETAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage#PPA462,M1Scanderbeg Volume 6, Scanderbeg section]</ref> abjured Islam and proclaimed himself the avenger of his family and country. He raised a flag showing a double-headed eagle, an ancient symbol used by various cultures of Balkans (especially the Byzantine Empire), which later became the [[Flag of Albania|Albanian flag]].

With this support, Skanderbeg built fortresses and organized a mobile defense force that forced the Ottomans to disperse their troops, leaving them vulnerable to the hit-and-run tactics of the Albanians.<ref name=\"Stavrianos\">{{cite book|first=L.S.|last=Stavrianos|year=2000|title=The Balkans Since 1453|isbn=1-85065-551-0}}</ref> He managed to create the [[League of Lezha]], a federation of all [[Albanian Principalities]].The main members of the league were the Arianiti, Bal\u0161i\u0107, Dukagjini,Muzaka, Spani, Thopia and Crnojevi\u0107i.

This city was particularly symbolic to Skanderbeg because he had been appointed suba of Kruja in 1438 by the Ottomans. The fighting lasted four months and over one thousand Albanians lost their lives while over 20,000 Ottomans died in battle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shqiptar\u00ebt: Historia e popullit shqiptar nga lasht\u00ebsia deri n\u00eb dit\u00ebt e sotme|last=Jacques|first=Edwin|publisher=Trans.

In June 1446, [[Mehmed II]], known as \"the conqueror\", led an army of 150,000 soldiers back to Kruja but failed to capture the castle. Skanderbeg's death in 1468 did not end the struggle for independence, and fighting continued until 1481, under [[Lek\u00eb Dukagjini]], when the Albanian lands were forced to succumb to the Ottoman armies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[House of Kastrioti]]\n* [[League of Lezh\u00eb]]\n* [[Albanian principalities]]\n* [[History of Albania]]\n\n==References==\n\"History of Albanian People\" Albanian Academy of Science. {{ISBN|99927-1-623-1}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{Medieval Albanian Principalities}}\n\n{{coord missing|Albania}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Principality Of Kastrioti}}\n[[Category:1444 disestablishments]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1389]]\n[[Category:Albanian principalities]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A principality of medieval Albania}}\n{{Disputed|date=June 2011}}\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = Principata e Kastriotit\n|conventional_long_name = Principality of Kastrioti\n|common_name            = Kastrioti\n|\n|era                    = Medieval\n|status                 = Principality\n|status_text            = <!--- A free text to describe status the top of the infobox.

It was created by [[Gjon Kastrioti]] and then ruled by the national hero of Albania, [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]].\n\n==Formation==\n[[Gjon Kastrioti]] had originally only two small villages. In short time John Kastrioti managed to expand its lands so as to become the undisputed lord of Central Albania.\nHe married [[Voisava Tripalda]] who bore five daughters - Mara, later wife of [[Stefan Crnojevi\u0107]] of Montenegro; Jela, then wife of Gjin (Gino) Musacchio; Angjelina (Angelina), later wife of [[Vladan Arianit Comnenus Thopia]]; Vlajka, later wife of [[Stefan Maramonte Bal\u0161i\u0107]]; Mamica, later wife of [[Karol Musacchio Thopia]] - and four sons: Repo\u0161, Stani\u0161a (Stanislaus), Kostandin (Constantine) and [[George Kastrioti]]. [[Gjon Kastrioti]] was among those who opposed<ref name=\"Tennent1845\">[[James Emerson Tennent]], 1845, ''The History of Modern Greece, from Its Conquest by the Romans B.C.146, to the Present Time''</ref> the early incursion of Ottoman [[Bayezid I]], however his resistance was ineffectual. The Sultan, having accepted his submissions, obliged him to pay tribute and to ensure the fidelity of local rulers, George Kastrioti and his three brothers were taken by the Sultan to his court as hostages. After his conversion to [[Islam]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Rendina|first=Claudio|title=La grande enciclopedia di Roma|page=1136|publisher=Newton Compton|location=Rome|year=2000|isbn=88-8289-316-2}}</ref> the young George Kastrioti attended military school in [[Edirne]] and led many battles for the [[Ottoman Empire]] to victory. For his military victories, he received the title ''Arnavutlu \u0130skender [[Bey]]'', ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Sk\u00ebnderbe shqiptari'', English: ''Lord Alexander, the Albanian'') comparing Kastrioti's military brilliance to that of [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n==Restoration of Gjergj Kastrioti==\nHe was distinguished as one of the best officers in several Ottoman campaigns both in Asia Minor and in Europe, and the Sultan appointed him General. He even fought against [[Greeks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians]], and some sources say that he used to maintain secret links with [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Ladislaus Posthumus of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus V]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]] of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]].<ref name=\"Noli\">[[Fan S. Noli|Noli, Fan S.]]: ''George Castrioti Scanderbeg'', New York, 1947</ref> Sultan Murat II gave him the title [[W\u0101li|Vali]] which made him General Governor.\nOn November 28, 1443, Skanderbeg saw his opportunity to rebel after a [[Battle of Ni\u0161 (1443)|battle]] against the Hungarians led by [[John Hunyadi]] in [[Ni\u0161]] as part of the [[Crusade of Varna]]. He switched sides along with 300 other Albanians serving in the Ottoman army. After a long trek to Albania he eventually captured Kruj\u00eb by forging a letter<ref name=\"Tennent1845\"\n/> from the Sultan to the Governor of Kruj\u00eb, which granted him control of the territory.

It reached service too late and was produced in too few numbers to have any effect on the war effort.\n\n==Earlier designs==\nSiemens-Schuckert's first production fighter aircraft was the [[Siemens-Schuckert D.I]], which was based closely on the French [[Nieuport 17]]. Apart from the use of the Siemens-Halske Sh.I, a geared rotary engine in which the crankshaft and the propeller rotated in opposite directions, the D.I was in fact a fairly close copy of the Nieuport. By the time production D.Is appeared in 1917 however, the design was no longer competitive and after 95 had been built, production was cancelled, with the type serving mainly as an advanced trainer.\n\nDevelopment work on the Siemens-Halske Sh.I culminated in the [[Siemens-Halske Sh.III]], which developed {{cvt|160|PS|kW hp}}. The new engine was fitted to a series of original prototype designs from the SSW works, the D.II, D.IIa and D.IIb. These featured a short, round section fuselage designed to fit a larger engine, leading to a rather stubby-looking aircraft which pilots later referred to as ''the flying beer barrel''. Flight tests started in June 1917, and while the aircraft did not have a very high top speed, they showed outstanding rates of climb. The only serious concern was the extremely long landing gear needed to keep the huge 2-bladed prop clear of the ground.\n[[File:Siemens-Schuckert D.II - Ray Wagner Collection Image (21439705645).jpg|thumb|D.IIe under-going stress testing]]\n\n==D.III==\nThree more prototypes were ordered, one  D.IIe, with the original sized wings, and two D.IIc's, fitted with shorter and longer span wings. After completion in October 1917, the design proved promising and in December an order for twenty long-span D.IIc's was placed with a smaller 4-bladed propeller that allowed for shorter landing gear legs. Deliveries of these aircraft, now known as D.III, began in January and were followed by an additional order for thirty in February.\n\nAll fifty were delivered to front-line units in May, where they proved popular but after only 10 hours of service the engines started showing serious problems, overheating and seizing. Siemens blamed the problem on the Voltol-based oil that was used to replace scarce [[castor oil]] for lubricating the engine but the type was withdrawn from service and replaced by [[Fokker D.VII]]s. When they were removed, [[Rudolf Berthold]], commander of JG.II, noted that he felt \"the Siemens fighter be made available again for front-line use as quickly as possible for, after elimination of the present faults, it is likely to be become one of our most useful fighter aircraft\".\n\nA version of the Sh.III passed a 40-hour endurance test in June and the aircraft were cleared to return to service in July. In the meantime they had been upgraded with the addition of a new rudder, balanced ailerons and had the cowling cut-away for improved cooling. Some sources also claim that the original engines were replaced with the improved {{cvt|200|PS|kW hp}} Sh.IIIa engines. Another thirty new aircraft with these features were built and all eighty of the improved design entered service in home defense units where their climb rate made them excellent [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]]s.\n\n==D.IV==\nThe short-span D.IIc prototype had been further refined and with a narrower {{cvt|1.00|m}} [[Chord (aeronautics)|chord]] upper and lower wing, using the G\u00f6ttingen 180 airfoil. One wing was slightly longer than the other to counter the [[P-factor]] of its huge four-blade propeller. The port panels outboard of the struts were {{cvt|1110|mm}} in length, while those on the starboard side were {{cvt|1040|mm}} long.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Siemens Type D IV Single-Seater Fighter |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%200333.html |magazine=Flight |location= |publisher= |date=March 13, 1919 |page=333 |access-date=May 5, 2019 }}</ref> The performance improved noticeably in top speed and in climb rate over the D.III. An order for this model, now known as the D.IV, was placed in March 1918 and additional orders were placed as the qualities of the design became known. Aircraft started reaching operational units in August but of the 280 ordered only 123 were completed by the end of the war, about half of those reaching operational units.\n\nAlthough the short landing gear and limited prop clearance led to tricky landing, the plane was otherwise easy to fly. It had a very short take-off run and at heights above {{cvt|4000|m}} was faster and more manoeuvrable than the Mercedes-powered [[Fokker D.VII]]. Its most notable feature was its phenomenal rate of climb and extremely high service ceiling\u2014it could reach {{cvt|6000|m}} in under 14\u00bd minutes. In 36 minutes it could reach {{cvt|8100|m}}, about {{cvt|1200|m}} higher than the ceiling of the Fokker. Production of the D.IV continued after the cease-fire, while one example escaped to [[Switzerland]] where it operated from 1918 to 1922, and another was acquired by the Lithuanians, however it never flew in their service. One examples was used by the Belgians, being marked with the race number 22. With the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] aircraft production in Germany was outlawed and the aircraft division of SSW disappeared.

It reached service too late and was produced in too few numbers to have any effect on the war effort.\n\n==Earlier designs==\nSiemens-Schuckert's first production fighter aircraft was the [[Siemens-Schuckert D.I]], which was based closely on the French [[Nieuport 17]]. Apart from the use of the Siemens-Halske Sh.I, a geared rotary engine in which the crankshaft and the propeller rotated in opposite directions, the D.I was in fact a fairly close copy of the Nieuport. By the time production D.Is appeared in 1917 however, the design was no longer competitive and after 95 had been built, production was cancelled, with the type serving mainly as an advanced trainer.\n\nDevelopment work on the Siemens-Halske Sh.I culminated in the [[Siemens-Halske Sh.III]], which developed {{cvt|160|PS|kW hp}}. The new engine was fitted to a series of original prototype designs from the SSW works, the D.II, D.IIa and D.IIb. These featured a short, round section fuselage designed to fit a larger engine, leading to a rather stubby-looking aircraft which pilots later referred to as ''the flying beer barrel''. Flight tests started in June 1917, and while the aircraft did not have a very high top speed, they showed outstanding rates of climb. The only serious concern was the extremely long landing gear needed to keep the huge 2-bladed prop clear of the ground.\n[[File:Siemens-Schuckert D.II - Ray Wagner Collection Image (21439705645).jpg|thumb|D.IIe under-going stress testing]]\n\n==D.III==\nThree more prototypes were ordered, one  D.IIe, with the original sized wings, and two D.IIc's, fitted with shorter and longer span wings. After completion in October 1917, the design proved promising and in December an order for twenty long-span D.IIc's was placed with a smaller 4-bladed propeller that allowed for shorter landing gear legs. Deliveries of these aircraft, now known as D.III, began in January and were followed by an additional order for thirty in February.\n\nAll fifty were delivered to front-line units in May, where they proved popular but after only 10 hours of service the engines started showing serious problems, overheating and seizing. Siemens blamed the problem on the Voltol-based oil that was used to replace scarce [[castor oil]] for lubricating the engine but the type was withdrawn from service and replaced by [[Fokker D.VII]]s. When they were removed, [[Rudolf Berthold]], commander of JG.II, noted that he felt \"the Siemens fighter be made available again for front-line use as quickly as possible for, after elimination of the present faults, it is likely to be become one of our most useful fighter aircraft\".\n\nA version of the Sh.III passed a 40-hour endurance test in June and the aircraft were cleared to return to service in July. In the meantime they had been upgraded with the addition of a new rudder, balanced ailerons and had the cowling cut-away for improved cooling. Some sources also claim that the original engines were replaced with the improved {{cvt|200|PS|kW hp}} Sh.IIIa engines. Another thirty new aircraft with these features were built and all eighty of the improved design entered service in home defense units where their climb rate made them excellent [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]]s.\n\n==D.IV==\nThe short-span D.IIc prototype had been further refined and with a narrower {{cvt|1.00|m}} [[Chord (aeronautics)|chord]] upper and lower wing, using the G\u00f6ttingen 180 airfoil. One wing was slightly longer than the other to counter the [[P-factor]] of its huge four-blade propeller. The port panels outboard of the struts were {{cvt|1110|mm}} in length, while those on the starboard side were {{cvt|1040|mm}} long.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Siemens Type D IV Single-Seater Fighter |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%200333.html |magazine=Flight |location= |publisher= |date=March 13, 1919 |page=333 |access-date=May 5, 2019 }}</ref> The performance improved noticeably in top speed and in climb rate over the D.III. An order for this model, now known as the D.IV, was placed in March 1918 and additional orders were placed as the qualities of the design became known. Aircraft started reaching operational units in August but of the 280 ordered only 123 were completed by the end of the war, about half of those reaching operational units.\n\nAlthough the short landing gear and limited prop clearance led to tricky landing, the plane was otherwise easy to fly. It had a very short take-off run and at heights above {{cvt|4000|m}} was faster and more manoeuvrable than the Mercedes-powered [[Fokker D.VII]]. Its most notable feature was its phenomenal rate of climb and extremely high service ceiling\u2014it could reach {{cvt|6000|m}} in under 14\u00bd minutes. In 36 minutes it could reach {{cvt|8100|m}}, about {{cvt|1200|m}} higher than the ceiling of the Fokker. Production of the D.IV continued after the cease-fire, while one example escaped to [[Switzerland]] where it operated from 1918 to 1922, and another was acquired by the Lithuanians, however it never flew in their service. One examples was used by the Belgians, being marked with the race number 22. With the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] aircraft production in Germany was outlawed and the aircraft division of SSW disappeared. Siemens-Halske later reorganized into [[Bramo]].\n\n==D.V==\nIn May/June 1918 a sesquiplane, two bay derivative, the '''D.V''' participated in the Adlershof trials.

It involves producing images that communicate relationships among the represented data to viewers of the images. This communication is achieved through the use of a systematic [[Map_(mathematics)|mapping]] between graphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization. This mapping establishes how data values will be represented visually, determining how and to what extent a property of a graphic mark, such as size or color, will change to reflect changes in the value of a data.\n\nTo communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses [[statistical graphics]], [[plot (graphics)|plots]], [[Infographic|information graphics]] and other tools.

The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users. It is one of the steps in [[data analysis]] or [[data science]]. According to Vitaly Friedman (2008) the \"main goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means. It doesn't mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its key-aspects in a more intuitive way. Yet designers often fail to achieve a balance between form and function, creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail to serve their main purpose \u2014 to communicate information\".<ref>Vitaly Friedman (2008) [http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/14/monday-inspiration-data-visualization-and-infographics/ \"Data Visualization and Infographics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722172600/http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/14/monday-inspiration-data-visualization-and-infographics/ |date=2008-07-22 }} in: ''Graphics'', Monday Inspiration, January 14th, 2008.</ref>\n\nIndeed, [[Fernanda Viegas]] and [[Martin M.

Graphical displays should:\n*show the data\n*induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production or something else\n* avoid distorting what the data has to say\n*present many numbers in a small space\n*make large data sets coherent\n*encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data\n*reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure \n*serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation or decoration \n*be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.\nGraphics ''reveal'' data.

Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. The line width illustrates a comparison (size of the army at points in time) while the temperature axis suggests a cause of the change in army size. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  Tufte wrote in 1983 that: \"It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.\"<ref name=Tufte1983/>\n\nNot applying these principles may result in [[misleading graphs]], which distort the message or support an erroneous conclusion. According to Tufte, [[chartjunk]] refers to extraneous interior decoration of the graphic that does not enhance the message, or gratuitous three dimensional or perspective effects. Needlessly separating the explanatory key from the image itself, requiring the eye to travel back and forth from the image to the key, is a form of \"administrative debris.\" The ratio of \"data to ink\" should be maximized, erasing non-data ink where feasible.<ref name=Tufte1983/>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] summarized several best practices for graphical displays in a June 2014 presentation.  These included: a) Knowing your audience; b) Designing graphics that can stand alone outside the context of the report; and c) Designing graphics that communicate the key messages in the report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45224|title=Telling Visual Stories About Data - Congressional Budget Office|website=www.cbo.gov|access-date=2014-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204135630/https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45224|archive-date=2014-12-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Quantitative messages==\n[[File:Total Revenues and Outlays as Percent GDP 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|A time series illustrated with a line chart demonstrating trends in U.S. federal spending and revenue over time.]]\n[[File:U.S. Phillips Curve 2000 to 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|A scatterplot illustrating negative correlation between two variables (inflation and unemployment) measured at points in time.]]\nAuthor Stephen Few described eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message:\n#Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate over a 10-year period. A [[line chart]] may be used to demonstrate the trend.\n#Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (the ''measure'') by sales persons (the ''category'', with each sales person a ''categorical subdivision'') during a single period.  A [[bar chart]] may be used to show the comparison across the sales persons.\n#Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%).  A [[pie chart]] or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.\n#Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period.  A bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.\n#Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0-10%, 11-20%, etc. A [[histogram]], a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis. A [[boxplot]] helps visualize key statistics about the distribution, such as median, quartiles, outliers, etc.\n#Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. A [[scatter plot]] is typically used for this message.\n#Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.\n#Geographic or geospatial: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. A [[cartogram]] is a typical graphic used.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf|title=Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Graph Selection Matrix|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080945/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnalysts reviewing a set of data may consider whether some or all of the messages and graphic types above are applicable to their task and audience. The process of trial and error to identify meaningful relationships and messages in the data is part of [[exploratory data analysis]].\n\n==Visual perception and data visualization==\nA human can distinguish differences in line length, shape, orientation, distances, and color (hue) readily without significant processing effort; these are referred to as \"[[Pre-attentive processing|pre-attentive attributes]]\".  For example, it may require significant time and effort (\"attentive processing\") to identify the number of times the digit \"5\" appears in a series of numbers; but if that digit is different in size, orientation, or color, instances of the digit can be noted quickly through pre-attentive processing.<ref name=\"perceptualedge.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf|title=Steven Few-Tapping the Power of Visual Perception-September 2004|publisher=|access-date=2014-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080935/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEffective graphics take advantage of pre-attentive processing and attributes and the relative strength of these attributes.

Earliest documented forms of data visualization were various thematic maps from different cultures and ideograms and hieroglyphs that provided and allowed interpretation of information illustrated. For example, [[Linear B]] tablets of [[Mycenae]] provided a visualization of information regarding Late Bronze Age era trades in the Mediterranean. The idea of coordinates was used by ancient Egyptian surveyors in laying out towns, earthly and heavenly positions were located by something akin to latitude and longitude at least by 200 BC, and the map projection of a spherical earth into latitude and longitude by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] [c.85\u2013c. 165] in Alexandria would serve as reference standards until the 14th century.<ref name=\"Friendly 2001\"/>\n\nInvention of paper and parchment allowed further development of visualizations throughout history.

Particularly important were the development of triangulation and other methods to determine mapping locations accurately.<ref name=\"Springer-Verlag\"/>\n\nFrench philosopher and mathematician [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] developed analytic geometry and two-dimensional coordinate system which heavily influenced the practical methods of displaying and calculating values. Fermat and [[Blaise Pascal]]'s work on statistics and probability theory laid the groundwork for what we now conceptualize as data.<ref name=\"Springer-Verlag\"/> According to the Interaction Design Foundation, these developments allowed and helped William [[William Playfair|Playfair]], who saw potential for graphical communication of quantitative data, to generate and develop graphical methods of statistics.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:Playfair TimeSeries.png|thumb|Playfair TimeSeries]] In the second half of the 20th century, [[Jacques Bertin]] used quantitative graphs to represent information \"intuitively, clearly, accurately, and efficiently\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJohn Tukey and Edward Tufte pushed the bounds of data visualization; Tukey with his new statistical approach of exploratory data analysis and Tufte with his book \"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\" paved the way for refining data visualization techniques for more than statisticians. With the progression of technology came the progression of data visualization; starting with hand drawn visualizations and evolving into more technical applications \u2013 including interactive designs leading to software visualization.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.datavis.ca/papers/hbook.pdf|title = A Brief History of Data Visualization|date = 2006|accessdate = 2015-11-22|website = York University|publisher = Springer-Verlag|last = Friendly|first = Michael|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160508232649/http://www.datavis.ca/papers/hbook.pdf|archive-date = 2016-05-08|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nPrograms like [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SOFA Statistics|SOFA]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Minitab]], Cornerstone and more allow for data visualization in the field of statistics.

The program asks: How can interactive data visualization help scientists and engineers explore their data more effectively? How can computing, design, and design thinking help maximize research results? What methodologies are most effective for leveraging knowledge from these fields?  By encoding relational information with appropriate visual and interactive characteristics to help interrogate, and ultimately gain new insight into data, the program develops new interdisciplinary approaches to complex science problems, leveraging design thinking and the latest methods from computing, User-Centered Design, interaction design and 3D graphics. \n\n==Terminology==\nData visualization involves specific terminology, some of which is derived from statistics. For example, author Stephen Few defines two types of data, which are used in combination to support a meaningful analysis or visualization:\n*Categorical: Text labels describing the nature of the data, such as \"Name\" or \"Age\".  This term also covers qualitative (non-numerical) data.\n*Quantitative: Numerical measures, such as \"25\" to represent the age in years.\n\nTwo primary types of [[Information graphics|information displays]] are tables and graphs.\n*A ''table'' contains quantitative data organized into rows and columns with categorical labels. It is primarily used to look up specific values. In the example above, the table might have categorical column labels representing the name (a ''qualitative variable'')  and age (a ''quantitative variable''), with each row of data representing one person (the sampled ''experimental unit'' or ''category subdivision'').\n*A ''graph'' is primarily used to show relationships among data and portrays values encoded as ''visual objects'' (e.g., lines, bars, or points). Numerical values are displayed within an area delineated by one or more ''axes''.  These axes provide ''scales'' (quantitative and categorical) used to label and assign values to the visual objects. Many graphs are also referred to as ''charts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf|title=Steven Few-Selecting the Right Graph for Your Message-September 2004|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080924/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEppler and Lengler have developed the \"[http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html Periodic Table of Visualization Methods],\" an interactive chart displaying various data visualization methods.

The term was further used and recorded in public usage on December 16, 2009 in a Microsoft Canada presentation on the value of merging Business Intelligence with corporate collaboration processes.}} \"Data Presentation Architecture (DPA) is a rarely applied skill set critical for the success and value of [[Business intelligence|Business Intelligence]]. Data presentation architecture weds the science of numbers, data and statistics in [[information discovery|discovering valuable information]] from data and making it usable, relevant and actionable with the arts of data visualization, communications, [[organizational psychology]] and [[change management]] in order to provide business intelligence solutions with the data scope, delivery timing, format and visualizations that will most effectively support and drive operational, tactical and strategic behaviour toward understood business (or organizational) goals. DPA is neither an IT nor a business skill set but exists as a separate field of expertise. Often confused with data visualization, data presentation architecture is a much broader skill set that includes determining what data on what schedule and in what exact format is to be presented, not just the best way to present data that has already been chosen. Data visualization skills are one element of DPA.\"\n\n=== Objectives ===\nDPA has two main objectives:\n* To use data to provide knowledge in the most efficient manner possible (minimize noise, complexity, and unnecessary data or detail given each audience's needs and roles)\n* To use data to provide knowledge in the most effective manner possible  (provide relevant, timely and complete data to each audience member in a clear and understandable manner that conveys important meaning, is actionable and can affect understanding, behavior and decisions)\n\n=== Scope ===\nWith the above objectives in mind, the actual work of data presentation architecture consists of:\n* Creating effective delivery mechanisms for each audience member depending on their role, tasks, locations and access to technology\n* Defining important meaning (relevant knowledge) that is needed by each audience member in each context\n* Determining the required periodicity of data updates (the currency of the data)\n* Determining the right timing for data presentation (when and how often the user needs to see the data)\n* Finding the right data (subject area, historical reach, breadth, level of detail, etc.)\n* Utilizing appropriate analysis, grouping, visualization, and other presentation formats\n\n=== Related fields ===\nDPA work shares commonalities with several other fields, including:\n* [[Business analysis]] in determining business goals, collecting requirements, mapping processes.\n* Business process improvement in that its goal is to improve and streamline actions and decisions in furtherance of business goals\n* Data visualization in that it uses well-established theories of visualization to add or highlight meaning or importance in data presentation.\n* [[Information architecture]], but information architecture's focus is on [[unstructured data]] and therefore excludes both analysis (in the statistical/data sense) and direct transformation of the actual content (data, for DPA) into new entities and combinations.\n* [[Human\u2013computer interaction|HCI]] and [[interaction design]], since the many of the principles in how to design interactive data visualisation have been developed cross-disciplinary with HCI.\n* [[Visual journalism]] and [[data-driven journalism]] or [[data journalism]]: Visual journalism is concerned with all types of graphic facilitation of the telling of news stories, and data-driven and data journalism are not necessarily told with data visualisation.

Graphical displays should:\n*show the data\n*induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production or something else\n* avoid distorting what the data has to say\n*present many numbers in a small space\n*make large data sets coherent\n*encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data\n*reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure \n*serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation or decoration \n*be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.\nGraphics ''reveal'' data.  Indeed graphics can be more precise and revealing than conventional statistical computations.\"<ref name=Tufte1983>{{cite book|last=Tufte|first=Edward|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|year=1983|publisher=Graphics Press|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|isbn=0-9613921-4-2|url=https://archive.org/details/visualdisplayofq00tuft|access-date=2019-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114070823/http://archive.org/details/visualdisplayofq00tuft|archive-date=2013-01-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 1812\u20131813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. The line width illustrates a comparison (size of the army at points in time) while the temperature axis suggests a cause of the change in army size. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  Tufte wrote in 1983 that: \"It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.\"<ref name=Tufte1983/>\n\nNot applying these principles may result in [[misleading graphs]], which distort the message or support an erroneous conclusion. According to Tufte, [[chartjunk]] refers to extraneous interior decoration of the graphic that does not enhance the message, or gratuitous three dimensional or perspective effects. Needlessly separating the explanatory key from the image itself, requiring the eye to travel back and forth from the image to the key, is a form of \"administrative debris.\" The ratio of \"data to ink\" should be maximized, erasing non-data ink where feasible.<ref name=Tufte1983/>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] summarized several best practices for graphical displays in a June 2014 presentation.  These included: a) Knowing your audience; b) Designing graphics that can stand alone outside the context of the report; and c) Designing graphics that communicate the key messages in the report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45224|title=Telling Visual Stories About Data - Congressional Budget Office|website=www.cbo.gov|access-date=2014-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204135630/https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45224|archive-date=2014-12-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Quantitative messages==\n[[File:Total Revenues and Outlays as Percent GDP 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|A time series illustrated with a line chart demonstrating trends in U.S. federal spending and revenue over time.]]\n[[File:U.S. Phillips Curve 2000 to 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|A scatterplot illustrating negative correlation between two variables (inflation and unemployment) measured at points in time.]]\nAuthor Stephen Few described eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message:\n#Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate over a 10-year period. A [[line chart]] may be used to demonstrate the trend.\n#Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (the ''measure'') by sales persons (the ''category'', with each sales person a ''categorical subdivision'') during a single period.  A [[bar chart]] may be used to show the comparison across the sales persons.\n#Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%).  A [[pie chart]] or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.\n#Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period.  A bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.\n#Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0-10%, 11-20%, etc. A [[histogram]], a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis. A [[boxplot]] helps visualize key statistics about the distribution, such as median, quartiles, outliers, etc.\n#Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. A [[scatter plot]] is typically used for this message.\n#Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.\n#Geographic or geospatial: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. A [[cartogram]] is a typical graphic used.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf|title=Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Graph Selection Matrix|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080945/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnalysts reviewing a set of data may consider whether some or all of the messages and graphic types above are applicable to their task and audience. The process of trial and error to identify meaningful relationships and messages in the data is part of [[exploratory data analysis]].\n\n==Visual perception and data visualization==\nA human can distinguish differences in line length, shape, orientation, distances, and color (hue) readily without significant processing effort; these are referred to as \"[[Pre-attentive processing|pre-attentive attributes]]\".  For example, it may require significant time and effort (\"attentive processing\") to identify the number of times the digit \"5\" appears in a series of numbers; but if that digit is different in size, orientation, or color, instances of the digit can be noted quickly through pre-attentive processing.<ref name=\"perceptualedge.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf|title=Steven Few-Tapping the Power of Visual Perception-September 2004|publisher=|access-date=2014-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080935/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEffective graphics take advantage of pre-attentive processing and attributes and the relative strength of these attributes. For example, since humans can more easily process differences in line length than surface area, it may be more effective to use a bar chart (which takes advantage of line length to show comparison) rather than pie charts (which use surface area to show comparison).<ref name=\"perceptualedge.com\"/>\n\n=== Human perception/cognition and data visualization ===\nAlmost all data visualizations are created for human consumption.

When properties of symbolic data are mapped to visual properties, humans can browse through large amounts of data efficiently. It is estimated that 2/3 of the brain's neurons can be involved in visual processing. Proper visualization provides a different approach to show potential connections, relationships, etc. which are not as obvious in non-visualized quantitative data. Visualization can become a means of [[data exploration]].\n\n== History of data visualization ==\n\nThere is no comprehensive 'history' of data visualization.

Contrary to general belief, data visualization is not a modern development.

Earliest documented forms of data visualization were various thematic maps from different cultures and ideograms and hieroglyphs that provided and allowed interpretation of information illustrated. For example, [[Linear B]] tablets of [[Mycenae]] provided a visualization of information regarding Late Bronze Age era trades in the Mediterranean. The idea of coordinates was used by ancient Egyptian surveyors in laying out towns, earthly and heavenly positions were located by something akin to latitude and longitude at least by 200 BC, and the map projection of a spherical earth into latitude and longitude by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] [c.85\u2013c. 165] in Alexandria would serve as reference standards until the 14th century.<ref name=\"Friendly 2001\"/>\n\nInvention of paper and parchment allowed further development of visualizations throughout history.

For this purpose the zone of the zodiac was represented on a plane with a horizontal line divided into thirty parts as the time or longitudinal axis. The vertical axis designates the width of the zodiac. The horizontal scale appears to have been chosen for each planet individually for the periods cannot be reconciled. The accompanying text refers only to the amplitudes. The curves are apparently not related in time. [[File:Planetary Movements.gif|thumb|Planetary Movements]]\n\nBy the 16th century, techniques and instruments for precise observation and measurement of physical quantities, and geographic and celestial position were well-developed (for example, a \u201cwall quadrant\u201d constructed by [[Tycho Brahe]] [1546\u20131601], covering an entire wall in his observatory). Particularly important were the development of triangulation and other methods to determine mapping locations accurately.<ref name=\"Springer-Verlag\"/>\n\nFrench philosopher and mathematician [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] developed analytic geometry and two-dimensional coordinate system which heavily influenced the practical methods of displaying and calculating values. Fermat and [[Blaise Pascal]]'s work on statistics and probability theory laid the groundwork for what we now conceptualize as data.<ref name=\"Springer-Verlag\"/> According to the Interaction Design Foundation, these developments allowed and helped William [[William Playfair|Playfair]], who saw potential for graphical communication of quantitative data, to generate and develop graphical methods of statistics.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:Playfair TimeSeries.png|thumb|Playfair TimeSeries]] In the second half of the 20th century, [[Jacques Bertin]] used quantitative graphs to represent information \"intuitively, clearly, accurately, and efficiently\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJohn Tukey and Edward Tufte pushed the bounds of data visualization; Tukey with his new statistical approach of exploratory data analysis and Tufte with his book \"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\" paved the way for refining data visualization techniques for more than statisticians. With the progression of technology came the progression of data visualization; starting with hand drawn visualizations and evolving into more technical applications \u2013 including interactive designs leading to software visualization.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.datavis.ca/papers/hbook.pdf|title = A Brief History of Data Visualization|date = 2006|accessdate = 2015-11-22|website = York University|publisher = Springer-Verlag|last = Friendly|first = Michael|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160508232649/http://www.datavis.ca/papers/hbook.pdf|archive-date = 2016-05-08|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nPrograms like [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SOFA Statistics|SOFA]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Minitab]], Cornerstone and more allow for data visualization in the field of statistics. Other data visualization applications, more focused and unique to individuals, programming languages such as [[D3.js|D3]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[JavaScript]] help to make the visualization of quantitative data a possibility.  Private schools have also developed programs to meet the demand for learning data visualization and associated programming libraries, including free programs like [[The Data Incubator]] or paid programs like [[General Assembly]].<ref>{{cite news\n|title=NY gets new boot camp for data scientists: It's free but harder to get into than Harvard\n|newspaper=Venture Beat\n|access-date=2016-02-21\n|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/15/ny-gets-new-bootcamp-for-data-scientists-its-free-but-harder-to-get-into-than-harvard/\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215235820/http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/15/ny-gets-new-bootcamp-for-data-scientists-its-free-but-harder-to-get-into-than-harvard/\n|archive-date=2016-02-15\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n\nBeginning with the Symposium \"Data to Discovery\"  in 2013, ArtCenter College of Design, Caltech and JPL in Pasadena have run an annual program on I[http://datavis.caltech.edu nteractive Data Visualization].  The program asks: How can interactive data visualization help scientists and engineers explore their data more effectively? How can computing, design, and design thinking help maximize research results? What methodologies are most effective for leveraging knowledge from these fields?  By encoding relational information with appropriate visual and interactive characteristics to help interrogate, and ultimately gain new insight into data, the program develops new interdisciplinary approaches to complex science problems, leveraging design thinking and the latest methods from computing, User-Centered Design, interaction design and 3D graphics. \n\n==Terminology==\nData visualization involves specific terminology, some of which is derived from statistics. For example, author Stephen Few defines two types of data, which are used in combination to support a meaningful analysis or visualization:\n*Categorical: Text labels describing the nature of the data, such as \"Name\" or \"Age\".  This term also covers qualitative (non-numerical) data.\n*Quantitative: Numerical measures, such as \"25\" to represent the age in years.\n\nTwo primary types of [[Information graphics|information displays]] are tables and graphs.\n*A ''table'' contains quantitative data organized into rows and columns with categorical labels. It is primarily used to look up specific values. In the example above, the table might have categorical column labels representing the name (a ''qualitative variable'')  and age (a ''quantitative variable''), with each row of data representing one person (the sampled ''experimental unit'' or ''category subdivision'').\n*A ''graph'' is primarily used to show relationships among data and portrays values encoded as ''visual objects'' (e.g., lines, bars, or points). Numerical values are displayed within an area delineated by one or more ''axes''.  These axes provide ''scales'' (quantitative and categorical) used to label and assign values to the visual objects. Many graphs are also referred to as ''charts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf|title=Steven Few-Selecting the Right Graph for Your Message-September 2004|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005080924/http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEppler and Lengler have developed the \"[http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html Periodic Table of Visualization Methods],\" an interactive chart displaying various data visualization methods.

The term was further used and recorded in public usage on December 16, 2009 in a Microsoft Canada presentation on the value of merging Business Intelligence with corporate collaboration processes.}} \"Data Presentation Architecture (DPA) is a rarely applied skill set critical for the success and value of [[Business intelligence|Business Intelligence]]. Data presentation architecture weds the science of numbers, data and statistics in [[information discovery|discovering valuable information]] from data and making it usable, relevant and actionable with the arts of data visualization, communications, [[organizational psychology]] and [[change management]] in order to provide business intelligence solutions with the data scope, delivery timing, format and visualizations that will most effectively support and drive operational, tactical and strategic behaviour toward understood business (or organizational) goals. DPA is neither an IT nor a business skill set but exists as a separate field of expertise. Often confused with data visualization, data presentation architecture is a much broader skill set that includes determining what data on what schedule and in what exact format is to be presented, not just the best way to present data that has already been chosen. Data visualization skills are one element of DPA.\"\n\n=== Objectives ===\nDPA has two main objectives:\n* To use data to provide knowledge in the most efficient manner possible (minimize noise, complexity, and unnecessary data or detail given each audience's needs and roles)\n* To use data to provide knowledge in the most effective manner possible  (provide relevant, timely and complete data to each audience member in a clear and understandable manner that conveys important meaning, is actionable and can affect understanding, behavior and decisions)\n\n=== Scope ===\nWith the above objectives in mind, the actual work of data presentation architecture consists of:\n* Creating effective delivery mechanisms for each audience member depending on their role, tasks, locations and access to technology\n* Defining important meaning (relevant knowledge) that is needed by each audience member in each context\n* Determining the required periodicity of data updates (the currency of the data)\n* Determining the right timing for data presentation (when and how often the user needs to see the data)\n* Finding the right data (subject area, historical reach, breadth, level of detail, etc.)\n* Utilizing appropriate analysis, grouping, visualization, and other presentation formats\n\n=== Related fields ===\nDPA work shares commonalities with several other fields, including:\n* [[Business analysis]] in determining business goals, collecting requirements, mapping processes.\n* Business process improvement in that its goal is to improve and streamline actions and decisions in furtherance of business goals\n* Data visualization in that it uses well-established theories of visualization to add or highlight meaning or importance in data presentation.\n* [[Information architecture]], but information architecture's focus is on [[unstructured data]] and therefore excludes both analysis (in the statistical/data sense) and direct transformation of the actual content (data, for DPA) into new entities and combinations.\n* [[Human\u2013computer interaction|HCI]] and [[interaction design]], since the many of the principles in how to design interactive data visualisation have been developed cross-disciplinary with HCI.\n* [[Visual journalism]] and [[data-driven journalism]] or [[data journalism]]: Visual journalism is concerned with all types of graphic facilitation of the telling of news stories, and data-driven and data journalism are not necessarily told with data visualisation. Nevertheless, the field of journalism are at the forefront in developing new data visualisations to communicate data.\n* [[Graphic design]], conveying information through styling, typography, position, and other aesthetic concerns.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Analytics]]\n* [[Balanced scorecard]]\n* [[Big Data]]\n* [[Business analysis]]\n* [[Business intelligence]]\n* [[Climate change art]]\n* [[Data analysis]]\n* [[Data art]]\n* [[Data profiling]]\n* [[Data science]]\n* [[Data warehouse]]\n* [[Exploratory data analysis]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[Information architecture]]\n* [[Information design]]\n* [[Information visualization]]\n* [[Interaction design]]\n* [[Interaction techniques]]\n* [[Scientific visualization]]\n* [[Software visualization]]\n* [[Statistical analysis]]\n* [[Statistical graphics]]\n* [[Visual analytics]]\n* [[Visual journalism]]\n* [[Warming stripes]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!--\nPublications listed here should relate specifically only to data visualization, and not: Computational visualistics, Information graphics, information visualization, Knowledge visualization, Information visualization, and Visual analytics.\n\nThere are some links added here to check the content of every publication.
