In that time, McCullough's team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen stars they had previously identified as promising candidates for extrasolar planets. The star [[XO-1]], in particular, was marked as a promising candidate in June 2005. The amateur astronomers observed it from June to July 2005, eventually confirming that a planet-sized object was eclipsing it. McCullough's team then turned to the [[McDonald Observatory]] in [[Texas]] for information on the object's mass and to confirm it was a planet.<ref name=\"McCullough2006\"/>\n\n===Transit===\nMcCullough's team found the planet by detecting slight reductions in the star's [[radiance|intensity]] as the planet moved into [[extrasolar planet#Transit method|transit]] of the star.  The light from the star reduces by approximately two percent when XO-1b is in transit.  Their observation revealed that XO-1b is in a tight, four-day orbit around its parent star.\n\nWhile astronomers had detected more than [[List of extrasolar planets|180 extrasolar planets]], XO-1b is only the tenth planet discovered using the transit method. It is only the second planet found using telephoto lenses. The first, [[TrES-1]], in the constellation [[Lyra]], was reported in 2004. The transit method allows astronomers to determine a planet's [[radius|size]].\n\nSecondary transits and phase curve of this planet have been observed.<ref name=\"Tinetti2010\"/>\n\n===Radial velocity===\nThe team confirmed the planet's existence by using the [[Harlan J.

The [[extrasolar planet#Radial velocity|radial velocity method]] allowed the team to calculate a precise [[mass]] of the planet, which is slightly less than [[Jupiter]]'s. This planet is much larger than its mass would suggest. McCullough has said, \"Of the planets that pass in front of their stars, XO-1b is the most similar to Jupiter yet known, and the star XO-1 is the most similar to the Sun, but XO-1b is much, much closer to its star than Jupiter is to the Sun.\"\n\nThe technique used by the team to find XO-1b is an innovative method in that it uses a relatively inexpensive telescope to hunt for extrasolar planets. It, however, is limited primarily to planets orbiting close to their parent stars, and only finds planets large enough to cause a measurable depression in starlight.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n\n[[File:Artist's Concept of Transiting Planet XO-1b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This artist's impression shows a dramatic close-up of the extrasolar planet XO-1b passing in front of a Sun-like star 600 light-years from Earth. The Jupiter-sized planet is in a tight four-day orbit around the star.]]\nAs a planet with a mass comparable to that of [[Jupiter]] in a close-orbit around its star, this planet falls into the category of [[hot Jupiter]]s.

It, however, is limited primarily to planets orbiting close to their parent stars, and only finds planets large enough to cause a measurable depression in starlight.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n\n[[File:Artist's Concept of Transiting Planet XO-1b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This artist's impression shows a dramatic close-up of the extrasolar planet XO-1b passing in front of a Sun-like star 600 light-years from Earth. The Jupiter-sized planet is in a tight four-day orbit around the star.]]\nAs a planet with a mass comparable to that of [[Jupiter]] in a close-orbit around its star, this planet falls into the category of [[hot Jupiter]]s. Like other known transiting hot Jupiters such as [[HD 209458 b]] and [[TrES-1]], the low density of XO-1b indicates that this planet is a [[gas giant]] composed mainly of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].\n\nObservations with the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer|NICMOS]] instrument on board the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] detected the presence of [[water vapor]], [[methane]], [[carbon dioxide]], and possibly [[carbon monoxide]] in the atmosphere of XO-1b.<ref name=\"Tinetti2010\"/> However, an independent reinvestigation of the same data was unable to reproduce these results.<ref name=\"Gibson2011\"/> Later studies by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] detected water in the atmosphere of the exoplanet.<ref name=\"NASA-20131203\">{{cite web |authors=Staff |title=Hubble Traces Subtle Signals of Water on Hazy Worlds |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-traces-subtle-signals-of-water-on-hazy-worlds/|publisher=[[NASA]] |date=3 December 2013|accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Deming2013\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[51 Pegasi b]]\n* [[HD 209458 b]]\n* [[Hot Jupiter]]\n* [[TrES-1]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bonomo2017\">{{cite journal | title=The GAPS Programme with HARPS-N at TNG .

Saint Augustine was a  [[Christian theologian]] and  the bishop of Hippo Regius in north Africa and is viewed as one of the most important [[Church Fathers]] in Western Christianity for his writings. Among his most important works are ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', ''[[On Christian Doctrine]]'' and ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]].'']]\n\nA number of scholars have pointed out that the terminology used in the study of religion in the west derives from [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], and that the basic assumptions of religion as an analytical category are all Western in origin. This idea was first raised by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his 1962 book, ''The Meaning and End of Religion''.{{sfn|Smith|1991}} Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], and Jason \u0100nanda Josephson. These [[social constructionist]]s argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.\n\nWhile few would dispute that the concept of religion does have a historical genealogy, there is some disagreement about what the Western origin of the term has meant historically. Some such as [[Tomoko Masuzawa]] have felt that the equation of religion with Christianity had the effect of diminishing other traditions, especially in the study of comparative religions as it developed during the high point of Western imperialism.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}} Others{{who|date=November 2017}} have felt that this sort of criticism overestimates the influence that Western academic thought had on the rest of the world.\n\nDaniel Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, argues that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on consistent use of the term, which \"tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history\".{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} \"What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history.\"{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word religion.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}}\n\nDubuisson prefers the term \"cosmographic formation\" to religion. Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]]. The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the living or universal European world view to the dead or ethnic religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007|p=792}} Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}}\n\nAccording to Timothy Fitzgerald, religion is not a universal feature of all cultures, but rather a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|p=45\u201346}} Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call religiousness, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. As the Catholic Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}} It was at this point that religion was dissociated from universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However, there was not yet the idea of dogma as a personal choice, only of [[established church]]es. With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}\n\n[[Talal Asad]] later refined this notion by showing that many assumptions about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.{{sfn|Asad|2003}}\nAsad argues that before the word religion came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a rule just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354\u2013430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.{{sfn|Asad|1993|p=34-35}}\n\nThese ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]]. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara argues that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of religion as a worldwide practice.{{sfn|Balagangadhara|1994|p=159}} This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of religious freedom was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.{{sfn|Pennington|2005}}\n\nMore recently, in ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'', Josephson has argued that while the concept of religion was Christian in its early formulation, non-Europeans (such as the Japanese) did not just acquiesce and passively accept the term's meaning. Instead they worked to interpret religion (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.{{sfn|Josephson|2012}} In nineteenth century [[Japan]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of [[natural law]] into a religion, as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence religion has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.{{sfn|Josephson|2012|p=257}}\n\n[[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]] (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in [[God]] or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to \"a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments.\"{{sfn|Lindbeck|1984|p=33}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n* [[Belief]]\n* [[Outline of religion]]\n* [[Philosophy of religion]]\n* [[Sociology of religion]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |first=Talal |last=Asad |title=Genealogies of Religion |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ.

The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion.

Saint Augustine was a  [[Christian theologian]] and  the bishop of Hippo Regius in north Africa and is viewed as one of the most important [[Church Fathers]] in Western Christianity for his writings. Among his most important works are ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', ''[[On Christian Doctrine]]'' and ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]].'']]\n\nA number of scholars have pointed out that the terminology used in the study of religion in the west derives from [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], and that the basic assumptions of religion as an analytical category are all Western in origin. This idea was first raised by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his 1962 book, ''The Meaning and End of Religion''.{{sfn|Smith|1991}} Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], and Jason \u0100nanda Josephson. These [[social constructionist]]s argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.\n\nWhile few would dispute that the concept of religion does have a historical genealogy, there is some disagreement about what the Western origin of the term has meant historically. Some such as [[Tomoko Masuzawa]] have felt that the equation of religion with Christianity had the effect of diminishing other traditions, especially in the study of comparative religions as it developed during the high point of Western imperialism.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}} Others{{who|date=November 2017}} have felt that this sort of criticism overestimates the influence that Western academic thought had on the rest of the world.\n\nDaniel Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, argues that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on consistent use of the term, which \"tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history\".{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} \"What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history.\"{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word religion.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}}\n\nDubuisson prefers the term \"cosmographic formation\" to religion. Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]]. The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the living or universal European world view to the dead or ethnic religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007|p=792}} Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}}\n\nAccording to Timothy Fitzgerald, religion is not a universal feature of all cultures, but rather a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|p=45\u201346}} Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call religiousness, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. As the Catholic Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}} It was at this point that religion was dissociated from universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However, there was not yet the idea of dogma as a personal choice, only of [[established church]]es. With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}\n\n[[Talal Asad]] later refined this notion by showing that many assumptions about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.{{sfn|Asad|2003}}\nAsad argues that before the word religion came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a rule just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354\u2013430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.{{sfn|Asad|1993|p=34-35}}\n\nThese ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]]. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara argues that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of religion as a worldwide practice.{{sfn|Balagangadhara|1994|p=159}} This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of religious freedom was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.{{sfn|Pennington|2005}}\n\nMore recently, in ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'', Josephson has argued that while the concept of religion was Christian in its early formulation, non-Europeans (such as the Japanese) did not just acquiesce and passively accept the term's meaning. Instead they worked to interpret religion (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.{{sfn|Josephson|2012}} In nineteenth century [[Japan]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of [[natural law]] into a religion, as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence religion has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.{{sfn|Josephson|2012|p=257}}\n\n[[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]] (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in [[God]] or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to \"a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments.\"{{sfn|Lindbeck|1984|p=33}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n* [[Belief]]\n* [[Outline of religion]]\n* [[Philosophy of religion]]\n* [[Sociology of religion]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |first=Talal |last=Asad |title=Genealogies of Religion |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ.

Leader of the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and [[Ulster Unionist Party]] between 1910 and 1921, he also held numerous positions in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]] and served as a [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary]]. Carson's greatest political achievement was the creation of  [[Northern Ireland]]. He is also remembered for his open ended  cross examination of [[Oscar Wilde]] in  a legal action that Wilde had brought, but led to him being gaoled and ruined. Carson unsuccessfully attempted to intercede for Wilde after the case.<ref>John Brown, \"Carson, Sir Edward, Baron Carson 1854\u20131935\" in David Loades, ed., ''Reader's Guide to British History'' (2003) 1:227</ref>\n[[File:Teach Edward Carson.JPG|thumb|Edward Carson was born in this house, 4 Harcourt Street, Dublin]]\n\n== Early life ==\nEdward Carson, the 2nd son of Edward Henry Carson, [[architect]], was born at 4 [[Harcourt Street]], in [[Dublin]], into a wealthy [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] family.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Marjoribanks, ''Volume One: The Life of Lord Carson'', London, 1932, p. 5</ref> The Carsons were of Scottish origin, Edward's grandfather having originally moved to Dublin from [[Dumfries]] in 1815. Carson's mother was Isabella Lambert, the daughter of Captain Peter Lambert, part of an old [[Anglo-Irish]] family, the Lamberts of [[Castle Ellen]], [[County Galway]]. Carson spent holidays at Castle Ellen, which was owned by his uncle.<ref>Marjoribanks, ''Volume One: The Life of Lord Carson'', London, 1932, p. 6</ref>  He was one of six children (four boys and two girls). Edward was educated at [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]] School, [[Wesley College, Dublin]]<ref>Dickson, Brice Drewry, Gavin The Judicial House of Lords 1876\u20132009 Oxford University Press page 755</ref> and [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he read law and was an active member of the [[College Historical Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|College Historical Society]]. He also played with the college [[hurling]] team. Carson graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]].\n\nHe later received an [[honorary doctorate]] ([[LL.D.]]) from the [[University of Dublin]] in June 1901.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=28 June 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36493}}</ref>\n\n== As a barrister ==\n[[File:Solicitor General Ceremonial Dress Uniform.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Carson's ceremonial dress uniform, worn on his appointment as Solicitor General for England in 1900.]]\nIn 1877 Carson was called to the Irish [[Bar association|Bar]] at [[King's Inns]]. He gained a reputation for fearsome advocacy and supreme legal ability and became regarded as a brilliant barrister, among the most prominent in Ireland at the time.<ref>[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/sir_edward_carsons.htm ::History Learning Site::<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208181845/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/sir_edward_carsons.htm |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref> He was also an acknowledged master of the appeal to the [[jury]] by his legal wit and oratory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawlibrary.ie/viewdoc.asp?m=&fn=/documents/aboutus/history/edward_carson.htm|title=Law Library}}</ref> He was appointed Queen's Counsel (Ireland) in 1889 and was Called to the English Bar at [[Middle Temple]] on 26 April 1893. He was twice admitted to the Inn, once on 1 November 1875 and then again on 21 April 1893, and was made a Bencher on 15 June 1900.<ref>Sturgess, H.A.C. (1949).

Carson (as he then was) addresses Parliament. From ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1893.]]\nIn 1895, he was engaged by the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]] to lead his defence against [[Oscar Wilde]]'s action for [[criminal libel]]. The Marquess, angry at Wilde's ongoing homosexual relationship with his son, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], had left his calling card at Wilde's club with an inscription accusing Wilde of being a \"posing [[Sodomy|somdomite]]\" {{Sic}}. Wilde retaliated with a libel action, as homosexuality was, at the time, illegal.\n\n[[Kevin Myers]] states that Carson's initial response was to refuse to take the case. Later, he discovered that Queensberry had been telling the truth about Wilde's activity and was therefore not guilty of the libel of which Wilde accused him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/edward-carson-and--oscar-wilde--mythic-rewriting-of-history-drives-me-wild-14237022.html|title=Edward Carson and Oscar Wilde \u2013 mythic rewriting of history drives me wild|work=Belfast Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nCarson and Wilde met as children playing in the summer along the seashore at [[Dungarvan, County Waterford]], and they knew each other when they were students at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].<ref name=\"Wilde_by_Ellmann\" /> When he heard that Carson was to lead the defence, Wilde is quoted as saying that \"No doubt he will pursue his case with all the added bitterness of an old friend.\"<ref name=\"Wilde_by_Ellmann\">''Oscar Wilde'' by [[Richard Ellmann]], published in 1987</ref> Carson portrayed the playwright as a morally depraved hedonist who seduced na\u00efve young men into a life of homosexuality with lavish gifts and promises of a glamorous artistic lifestyle. He impugned Wilde's works as morally repugnant and designed to corrupt the upbringing of the youth. Queensberry spent a large amount of money on [[private detective]]s who investigated Wilde's activity in the London underworld of homosexual clubs and procurers.\n\nWilde abandoned the case when Carson announced in his opening speech for the defence that he planned to call several [[male prostitute]]s who would testify that they had had sex with Wilde, which would have rendered the libel charge unsupportable as the accusation would have been proven true. Wilde was [[bankrupt]]ed when he was then ordered to pay the considerable legal and detective bills Queensberry had incurred in his defence.\n\nBased on the evidence of Queensberry's detectives and Carson's cross-examinations of Wilde at the trial, Wilde was subsequently prosecuted for [[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]] in a second trial. He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to two years' [[hard labour]], after which he moved to France, where he died penniless.\n\n=== Cadbury Bros. ===\nIn 1908 Carson appeared for the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in a libel action brought by [[George Cadbury]]. The ''Standard'' was controlled by Unionist interests which supported [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s [[Imperial Preference]] views. The Cadbury family were [[Liberalism|Liberal]] supporters of [[free trade]] and had, in 1901, purchased ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]''. The ''Standard'' articles alleged that Cadbury Bros Ltd., which claimed to be model employers having created the village of [[Bournville]] outside [[Birmingham]], knew of the slave labour conditions on [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]], the Portuguese island colony from which Cadbury purchased most of the [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] used in the production of their [[chocolate]].<ref>{{cite book | title=A civilised savagery: Britain and the new slaveries in Africa, 1884\u20131926 | author=Kevin Grant | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=0-415-94901-7 | page=[https://archive.org/details/civilisedsavager0000gran/page/110 110] | url=https://archive.org/details/civilisedsavager0000gran/page/110 }}</ref>\n\nThe articles alleged that George's son William had gone to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in 1901 and observed for himself the slave conditions, and that the Cadbury family had decided to continue purchasing the cocoa grown there because it was cheaper than that grown in the British colony of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], where labour conditions were much better, being regulated by the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]]. The ''Standard'' alleged that the Cadbury family knew that the reason cocoa from S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was cheaper was because it was grown by slave labour. This case was regarded at the time as an important political case as Carson and the Unionists maintained that it showed the fundamental immorality of free trade. George Cadbury recovered [[Damages#Contemptuous damages|contemptuous damages]] of one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] in a case described as one of Carson's triumphs.<ref>''Chocolate on Trial: Slavery, Politics, and the Ethics of Business'', by Lowell J. Satre {{ISBN|0-8214-1626-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Archer-Shee case ===\nCarson was also the victorious counsel in the 1910 [[George Archer-Shee|Archer-Shee Case]], exonerating a [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]] cadet of the charge of theft. The cadet was from a quite prominent Roman Catholic banking family, and educated at [[Stonyhurst]]. On this case, [[Terence Rattigan]] based his play ''[[The Winslow Boy]]''. The fictional barrister, Morton, is a somewhat different character from Carson. There is, however, one interesting detail. At the end of the play Morton indicates he may take a continued interest in the boy\u2019s sister, who had played a key role in the fictional case. In his account of the case, which was the last chapter of his book before his suicide, [[Edward Marjoribanks (Conservative politician)|Edward Marjoribanks]] said that Carson\u2019s first marriage was strained and his wife died around this time. He then married a much younger woman, Lucy Frewen, and Marjoribanks, who had help from the Carson family, says her interest in him was aroused by the Archer-Shee case. They had a son (also [[Edward Carson (English politician)|Edward]]) born when Carson was over 60, who in 1945 became the [[Baby of the House|youngest Member of Parliament]] but resigned after eight years for health reasons.\n\n==WHEN CARSON MET CRAIG==\nCarson's political career began on 20 June 1892, when he was appointed [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]], although he was not then a member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  He was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] in the [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892 general election]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26311 |date=29 July 1892 |page=4314 }}</ref> as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]], although as a whole the party lost the election to the Liberals.\n\nCarson maintained his career as a barrister and was admitted to the English Bar by [[Middle Temple|The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple]] in 1893 and from then on mainly practised in London.  In 1896 he was sworn of the [[Privy Council of Ireland|Irish Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/pcouncil/pcouncilI.htm|title=leighrayment.com Privy Counsellors \u2013 Ireland|work=leighrayment.com}}</ref> He was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General for England]] on 7 May 1900,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27192 |date=15 May 1900 |page=3070 }}</ref> receiving the customary [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].  He served in this position until the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government resigned in December 1905, when he was rewarded with membership of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27862 |date=8 December 1905 |page=8891 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]], Sinn F\u00e9in won 73 out of the 105 Irish seats in the House of Commons. In 25 constituencies, Sinn F\u00e9in won the seats unopposed. [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] (including [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association]]) won 26 seats, all but three of which were in the six counties that today form [[Northern Ireland]], and the IPP won only six (down from 84), all but one in [[Ulster]]. The [[History of the Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] did not stand in the election, allowing the electorate to decide between [[home rule]] or a republic by having a clear choice between the two nationalist parties. Irish Republicans regarded these elections as the mandate to establish the [[First D\u00e1il]]. As such, all persons in Ireland elected to Westminster were considered to have been elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. Had he chosen to do so, Carson could have exercised the option of attending the meeting of the First D\u00e1il in the Mansion House on 21 January 1919. Like all of those elected to Irish seats in December 1918 he received an invitation, written [[Irish language|as gaeilge]], to attend. He kept the invitation as a souvenir.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/eile/election-1918/2018/1206/1015537-edward-carson-leader-profile/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When his name was called out in the first roll call of the new D\u00e1il, it was met by silence, and then laughter, from the Sinn F\u00e9in delegates and the audience in the Mansion House.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/dail-eireann-meets-in-mansion-house|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He was listed as \u201cas l\u00e1thair\u201d, or absent.\n\n== Unionism ==\nIn September 1911 a huge crowd of over 50,000 people gathered to rally near Belfast to hear Carson speaking to urge his party take on the governance of Ulster.  With the passage of the [[Parliament Act 1911]], the Unionists faced the loss of the [[House of Lords]]' ability to thwart the passage of the new [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]]. Carson disliked many of Ulster's local characteristics and, in particular, the culture of [[Orange Institution|Orangeism]] (although he had become an Orangeman at nineteen he left the institution shortly afterwards).<ref>Marjoribanks, ''The Life of Lord Carson'', Vol. 1, Camelot Press, 1932 p. 68</ref> He stated that their speeches reminded him of \"the unrolling of a mummy.

To enforce the legislation, given the activities of the Unionists, [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government had prepared to send troops to Ulster. This sparked the [[Curragh Incident]] on 20 March. Together with the arming of the Irish Volunteers, Ireland was on the brink of [[civil war]] when the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] led to the suspension of the Home Rule Act's operation until the end of the war.<ref name=\"stewart\">[[A.

Under Carson's leadership, with Craig as his lieutenant, discipline and organization were imposed on their supporters; proposed compromises were rejected; and plans were drawn up for a provisional government in the north, if the bill was passed, with its implementation to be resisted by the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force, which had been armed by illegal gun-running.

He resigned on 19 October, however, citing his opposition to Government policy on war in the Balkans. During Asquith's coalition government of 1915\u20131916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the [[Irish Nationalist Party]] led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. After Carson, the leading figure among the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915, he then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commons.\n\nHe played a major role in forcing the resignation of Asquith as Prime Minister, returning to office on 10 December 1916 as [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29860 |date=12 December 1916 |page=12118 }}</ref> becoming a Minister without Portfolio on 17 July 1917.<ref>''The New York Times Current History: The European War'', Volume 12 (July\u2013September 1917), The New York Times Company, Times Square, New York City, 1917, p. 224</ref>\n\nCarson was hostile to the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] as he believed that this institution would be ineffectual against war. In a speech on 7 December 1917 he said:\n\n<blockquote>Talk to me of treaties! Talk to me of the League of Nations! Every Great Power in Europe was pledged by treaty to preserve Belgium. That was a League of Nations, but it failed.<ref>Henry R.

Carson disagreed in principle and again resigned on 21 January. He gave up his seat at the University of Dublin in the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] and was instead elected for [[Belfast Duncairn (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast Duncairn]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=917| title=ElectionsIreland.org: Rt Hon Sir Edward Carson| website=ElectionsIreland.org| accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe continued to lead the Unionists, but when the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] was introduced, advised his party to work for the exemption of six Ulster counties from Home Rule as the best compromise (a compromise he had previously rejected). This proposal passed and as a result the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] was established.<ref>Frank Costello, \"King George V's Speech at Stormont (1921): Prelude to the Anglo-Irish Truce\", ''Eire-Ireland'', (1987), pp. 43\u201357.</ref>\n\nIn January 1921 he met in London over three days with [[Michael O'Flanagan|Father O'Flanagan]] and [[Lord Justice]] [[James O'Connor (Irish jurist)|Sir James O'Connor]] to try to find a mutual agreement that would end the [[Anglo-Irish war]], but without result.<ref>[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume1/1921/129.htm \"Memorandum by James O'Connor of an interview with Edward Carson\"]; RIA, Dublin, 1993.

In 1921 he stated: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority.

The statue was unveiled by [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|Lord Craigavon]] in the presence of more than 40,000 people. The statue was cast in bronze and placed upon a plinth.

From a silver bowl, soil from each of the six counties of [[Northern Ireland]] was scattered on to his coffin, which had earlier been covered by the [[Union Flag]], which however was removed during the service.  At his funeral service the choir sang his own favourite hymn, \"[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]\".  A warship had brought his body to Belfast and the funeral took place on Saturday 26 October 1935.

In November 1932 the new Stormont Parliament became the greatest Carson monument, giving his admirers the symbolic endorsement of their state. His statue was unveiled as the speakers excited the audience with triumphalist images of Protestant deliverance from Catholic tyranny.  Carson's funeral in 1935 was attended with pomp and unionist symbolism, as happened again with the dedication of a plaque in his memory in 1938. Calling for unity with Britain, numerous ceremonial rituals, memorials, and anniversaries affirmed the legitimacy of the state, and the Protestant ascendancy. The media enthusiastically participated, paying much less attention to such mundane issues as massive unemployment, poor housing, and rising religious tensions.<ref>Gillian McIntosh,  \"Symbolic mirrors: commemorations of Edward Carson in the 1930s.\" ''Irish Historical Studies'' 32.125 (2000): 93\u2013112.</ref>  James Craig, celebrated as the hero of the 1912\u20131914 counterrevolution, often joined Carson in Protestant Ireland's memory.<ref>Alvin Jackson,  \"Unionist Myths 1912\u20131985.\" ''Past & Present'' 136 (1992): 164\u2013185.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Hennessey, Thomas.

Carson (as he then was) addresses Parliament. From ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1893.]]\nIn 1895, he was engaged by the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]] to lead his defence against [[Oscar Wilde]]'s action for [[criminal libel]]. The Marquess, angry at Wilde's ongoing homosexual relationship with his son, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], had left his calling card at Wilde's club with an inscription accusing Wilde of being a \"posing [[Sodomy|somdomite]]\" {{Sic}}. Wilde retaliated with a libel action, as homosexuality was, at the time, illegal.\n\n[[Kevin Myers]] states that Carson's initial response was to refuse to take the case. Later, he discovered that Queensberry had been telling the truth about Wilde's activity and was therefore not guilty of the libel of which Wilde accused him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/edward-carson-and--oscar-wilde--mythic-rewriting-of-history-drives-me-wild-14237022.html|title=Edward Carson and Oscar Wilde \u2013 mythic rewriting of history drives me wild|work=Belfast Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nCarson and Wilde met as children playing in the summer along the seashore at [[Dungarvan, County Waterford]], and they knew each other when they were students at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].<ref name=\"Wilde_by_Ellmann\" /> When he heard that Carson was to lead the defence, Wilde is quoted as saying that \"No doubt he will pursue his case with all the added bitterness of an old friend.\"<ref name=\"Wilde_by_Ellmann\">''Oscar Wilde'' by [[Richard Ellmann]], published in 1987</ref> Carson portrayed the playwright as a morally depraved hedonist who seduced na\u00efve young men into a life of homosexuality with lavish gifts and promises of a glamorous artistic lifestyle. He impugned Wilde's works as morally repugnant and designed to corrupt the upbringing of the youth. Queensberry spent a large amount of money on [[private detective]]s who investigated Wilde's activity in the London underworld of homosexual clubs and procurers.\n\nWilde abandoned the case when Carson announced in his opening speech for the defence that he planned to call several [[male prostitute]]s who would testify that they had had sex with Wilde, which would have rendered the libel charge unsupportable as the accusation would have been proven true. Wilde was [[bankrupt]]ed when he was then ordered to pay the considerable legal and detective bills Queensberry had incurred in his defence.\n\nBased on the evidence of Queensberry's detectives and Carson's cross-examinations of Wilde at the trial, Wilde was subsequently prosecuted for [[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]] in a second trial. He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to two years' [[hard labour]], after which he moved to France, where he died penniless.\n\n=== Cadbury Bros. ===\nIn 1908 Carson appeared for the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in a libel action brought by [[George Cadbury]]. The ''Standard'' was controlled by Unionist interests which supported [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s [[Imperial Preference]] views. The Cadbury family were [[Liberalism|Liberal]] supporters of [[free trade]] and had, in 1901, purchased ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]''. The ''Standard'' articles alleged that Cadbury Bros Ltd., which claimed to be model employers having created the village of [[Bournville]] outside [[Birmingham]], knew of the slave labour conditions on [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]], the Portuguese island colony from which Cadbury purchased most of the [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] used in the production of their [[chocolate]].<ref>{{cite book | title=A civilised savagery: Britain and the new slaveries in Africa, 1884\u20131926 | author=Kevin Grant | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=0-415-94901-7 | page=[https://archive.org/details/civilisedsavager0000gran/page/110 110] | url=https://archive.org/details/civilisedsavager0000gran/page/110 }}</ref>\n\nThe articles alleged that George's son William had gone to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in 1901 and observed for himself the slave conditions, and that the Cadbury family had decided to continue purchasing the cocoa grown there because it was cheaper than that grown in the British colony of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], where labour conditions were much better, being regulated by the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]]. The ''Standard'' alleged that the Cadbury family knew that the reason cocoa from S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was cheaper was because it was grown by slave labour. This case was regarded at the time as an important political case as Carson and the Unionists maintained that it showed the fundamental immorality of free trade. George Cadbury recovered [[Damages#Contemptuous damages|contemptuous damages]] of one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] in a case described as one of Carson's triumphs.<ref>''Chocolate on Trial: Slavery, Politics, and the Ethics of Business'', by Lowell J. Satre {{ISBN|0-8214-1626-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Archer-Shee case ===\nCarson was also the victorious counsel in the 1910 [[George Archer-Shee|Archer-Shee Case]], exonerating a [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]] cadet of the charge of theft. The cadet was from a quite prominent Roman Catholic banking family, and educated at [[Stonyhurst]]. On this case, [[Terence Rattigan]] based his play ''[[The Winslow Boy]]''. The fictional barrister, Morton, is a somewhat different character from Carson. There is, however, one interesting detail. At the end of the play Morton indicates he may take a continued interest in the boy\u2019s sister, who had played a key role in the fictional case. In his account of the case, which was the last chapter of his book before his suicide, [[Edward Marjoribanks (Conservative politician)|Edward Marjoribanks]] said that Carson\u2019s first marriage was strained and his wife died around this time. He then married a much younger woman, Lucy Frewen, and Marjoribanks, who had help from the Carson family, says her interest in him was aroused by the Archer-Shee case. They had a son (also [[Edward Carson (English politician)|Edward]]) born when Carson was over 60, who in 1945 became the [[Baby of the House|youngest Member of Parliament]] but resigned after eight years for health reasons.\n\n== Politics ==\nCarson's political career began on 20 June 1892, when he was appointed [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]], although he was not then a member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  He was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] in the [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892 general election]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26311 |date=29 July 1892 |page=4314 }}</ref> as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]], although as a whole the party lost the election to the Liberals.\n\nCarson maintained his career as a barrister and was admitted to the English Bar by [[Middle Temple|The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple]] in 1893 and from then on mainly practised in London.  In 1896 he was sworn of the [[Privy Council of Ireland|Irish Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/pcouncil/pcouncilI.htm|title=leighrayment.com Privy Counsellors \u2013 Ireland|work=leighrayment.com}}</ref> He was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General for England]] on 7 May 1900,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27192 |date=15 May 1900 |page=3070 }}</ref> receiving the customary [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].  He served in this position until the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government resigned in December 1905, when he was rewarded with membership of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27862 |date=8 December 1905 |page=8891 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]], Sinn F\u00e9in won 73 out of the 105 Irish seats in the House of Commons. In 25 constituencies, Sinn F\u00e9in won the seats unopposed. [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] (including [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association]]) won 26 seats, all but three of which were in the six counties that today form [[Northern Ireland]], and the IPP won only six (down from 84), all but one in [[Ulster]]. The [[History of the Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] did not stand in the election, allowing the electorate to decide between [[home rule]] or a republic by having a clear choice between the two nationalist parties. Irish Republicans regarded these elections as the mandate to establish the [[First D\u00e1il]]. As such, all persons in Ireland elected to Westminster were considered to have been elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. Had he chosen to do so, Carson could have exercised the option of attending the meeting of the First D\u00e1il in the Mansion House on 21 January 1919. Like all of those elected to Irish seats in December 1918 he received an invitation, written [[Irish language|as gaeilge]], to attend. He kept the invitation as a souvenir.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/eile/election-1918/2018/1206/1015537-edward-carson-leader-profile/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When his name was called out in the first roll call of the new D\u00e1il, it was met by silence, and then laughter, from the Sinn F\u00e9in delegates and the audience in the Mansion House.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/dail-eireann-meets-in-mansion-house|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He was listed as \u201cas l\u00e1thair\u201d, or absent.\n\n== Unionism ==\nIn September 1911 a huge crowd of over 50,000 people gathered to rally near Belfast to hear Carson speaking to urge his party take on the governance of Ulster.  With the passage of the [[Parliament Act 1911]], the Unionists faced the loss of the [[House of Lords]]' ability to thwart the passage of the new [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]]. Carson disliked many of Ulster's local characteristics and, in particular, the culture of [[Orange Institution|Orangeism]] (although he had become an Orangeman at nineteen he left the institution shortly afterwards).<ref>Marjoribanks, ''The Life of Lord Carson'', Vol. 1, Camelot Press, 1932 p. 68</ref> He stated that their speeches reminded him of \"the unrolling of a mummy.

To enforce the legislation, given the activities of the Unionists, [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government had prepared to send troops to Ulster. This sparked the [[Curragh Incident]] on 20 March. Together with the arming of the Irish Volunteers, Ireland was on the brink of [[civil war]] when the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] led to the suspension of the Home Rule Act's operation until the end of the war.<ref name=\"stewart\">[[A.

It is this apparent willingness to carry resistance to virtually any length, even to risk civil war, that makes Carson so controversial.<ref>Brown, ''Carson'', p. 227</ref>}}In 1914, suffragettes [[Flora Drummond]] and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as [[Norah Elam]]) besieged Carson's home, arguing that his form of Ulster 'incitement to militancy' passed without notice whilst suffragettes were charged and imprisoned for same action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154415/http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/|title=Home - Mosley's Old Suffragette: A Biography of Norah Dacre Fox|date=2012-01-13|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1921 speech opposing the pending [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], Carson attacked the \"Tory intrigues\" that had led him on the course that would partition Ireland, an outcome he opposed almost as strongly as Home Rule itself. In the course of the speech Carson said: {{quote|What a fool I was!

He resigned on 19 October, however, citing his opposition to Government policy on war in the Balkans. During Asquith's coalition government of 1915\u20131916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the [[Irish Nationalist Party]] led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. After Carson, the leading figure among the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915, he then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commons.\n\nHe played a major role in forcing the resignation of Asquith as Prime Minister, returning to office on 10 December 1916 as [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29860 |date=12 December 1916 |page=12118 }}</ref> becoming a Minister without Portfolio on 17 July 1917.<ref>''The New York Times Current History: The European War'', Volume 12 (July\u2013September 1917), The New York Times Company, Times Square, New York City, 1917, p. 224</ref>\n\nCarson was hostile to the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] as he believed that this institution would be ineffectual against war. In a speech on 7 December 1917 he said:\n\n<blockquote>Talk to me of treaties! Talk to me of the League of Nations! Every Great Power in Europe was pledged by treaty to preserve Belgium. That was a League of Nations, but it failed.<ref>Henry R. Winkler, \"The Development of the League of Nations Idea in Great Britain, 1914\u20131919\", ''The Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 20, No. 2. (June 1948), p. 105.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEarly in 1918, the government decided to extend [[conscription]] to Ireland, and that Ireland would have to be given home rule in order to make it acceptable. Carson disagreed in principle and again resigned on 21 January. He gave up his seat at the University of Dublin in the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] and was instead elected for [[Belfast Duncairn (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast Duncairn]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=917| title=ElectionsIreland.org: Rt Hon Sir Edward Carson| website=ElectionsIreland.org| accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe continued to lead the Unionists, but when the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] was introduced, advised his party to work for the exemption of six Ulster counties from Home Rule as the best compromise (a compromise he had previously rejected). This proposal passed and as a result the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] was established.<ref>Frank Costello, \"King George V's Speech at Stormont (1921): Prelude to the Anglo-Irish Truce\", ''Eire-Ireland'', (1987), pp. 43\u201357.</ref>\n\nIn January 1921 he met in London over three days with [[Michael O'Flanagan|Father O'Flanagan]] and [[Lord Justice]] [[James O'Connor (Irish jurist)|Sir James O'Connor]] to try to find a mutual agreement that would end the [[Anglo-Irish war]], but without result.<ref>[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume1/1921/129.htm \"Memorandum by James O'Connor of an interview with Edward Carson\"]; RIA, Dublin, 1993.

In 1921 he stated: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority.

Thousands of shipworkers stopped work and bowed their heads as [[HMS Broke (D83)|HMS ''Broke'']] steamed slowly up [[Belfast Lough]], with Carson's flag-draped coffin sat on the quarterdeck.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lord Carson's Funeral |section=News |day_of_week=Monday |date=28 October 1935 |page_number=11 |issue=47206 |column=A }}</ref>\n\n===Memories===\n[[File:Carson Poster.jpg|thumb|Carson Poster, Belfast, August 2007]]\nEven before his death, there was an organized effort to portray Carson as the heroic embodiment of the militant unionist spirit. In November 1932 the new Stormont Parliament became the greatest Carson monument, giving his admirers the symbolic endorsement of their state. His statue was unveiled as the speakers excited the audience with triumphalist images of Protestant deliverance from Catholic tyranny.  Carson's funeral in 1935 was attended with pomp and unionist symbolism, as happened again with the dedication of a plaque in his memory in 1938. Calling for unity with Britain, numerous ceremonial rituals, memorials, and anniversaries affirmed the legitimacy of the state, and the Protestant ascendancy. The media enthusiastically participated, paying much less attention to such mundane issues as massive unemployment, poor housing, and rising religious tensions.<ref>Gillian McIntosh,  \"Symbolic mirrors: commemorations of Edward Carson in the 1930s.\" ''Irish Historical Studies'' 32.125 (2000): 93\u2013112.</ref>  James Craig, celebrated as the hero of the 1912\u20131914 counterrevolution, often joined Carson in Protestant Ireland's memory.<ref>Alvin Jackson,  \"Unionist Myths 1912\u20131985.\" ''Past & Present'' 136 (1992): 164\u2013185.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Hennessey, Thomas.
