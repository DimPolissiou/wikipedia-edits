''''' ('''Outrage!''') is a 1993 [[Spanish language|Spanish]]  film directed by [[Carlos Saura]], starring [[Francesca Neri]]  and [[Antonio Banderas]]. The story is a revenge tragedy.\n\n==Plot==\nMarcos, a young reporter, goes to a circus to write a Sunday supplement piece. As he is leaving, the next act is about to start. It involves a woman riding a horse and performing tricks; the presentation ends in shooting balloons from a horse while it is moving. Marcos is taken by the beauty of Ana, the equestrian sharpshooter, and returns to interview her. She invites him to dinner with the troupe. They dance, and then spend the night together. He falls in love with the beautiful horse-riding circus girl. An affair between them ensues; he considers following her around Europe and promises he would follow her to hell. Soon, Marco has to leave to cover a concert in [[Barcelona]]. \n\nFate intervenes when three young mechanics come to repair circus equipment and the owner gives them complimentary tickets for the show. The trio makes a racket as they watch Ana perform. After the show, they follow Ana to her trailer and brutally [[rape]] her. Although she is badly hurt, she decides to take matters into her own hands. Bruised, humiliated, and bleeding, she picks up her rifle and goes to hunt them down. She finds them easily at the mechanic shop where they work. She kills them all and leaves without being clearly identified. Ana, who is bleeding badly, has to visit a doctor who reveals to the authorities that she has been raped. The police initially have no clues about the culprit of the triple homicide, but after interviewing the doctor, they begin to suspect Ana. \n\nAna is stopped in a highway by two officers; she panics and kills them too, a decision that she regrets immediately. Marco who goes to Ana's trailer, finds traces of blood all over the place and he and the authorities go in search of Ana. She finds refuge in a country home where a couple and two small children live. Marcos is responsible for breaking the impasse between Ana and the police, but he arrives too late to help her; the police open fire on her, and she dies in his arms.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Francesca Neri]] as Ana\n*[[Antonio Banderas]] as Marcos\n*Eulalia Ramon as Lali\n*Coque Malla as rapist\n\n==Reception==\n[[TV Guide]] remarked in its 3/5 star review \"A well-acted revenge drama, [the film] seems rather anomalous to the career of acclaimed director Carlos Saura...

It stars [[Brenda Vaccaro]] and [[Don Stroud]] and was one of the first films from Canadian director [[William Fruet]]. The low-budget production was shot in rural [[Canada]] and at a studio in [[Kleinburg]], [[Ontario]], Canada.\n\nIn 2019, the film got a Blu-ray release from Germany. The VHS was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] during the [[video nasty]] panic.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set over a period of 24 hours on a cold November day in rural Ontario. Diane (Brenda Vaccaro), a former fashion model, meets Harry (Chuck Shamata), a wealthy dentist [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]]. After a whirlwind romance, she decides to accompany Harry for a weekend party at his remote country house by a lake. On their way in Harry's [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]], Diane asks Harry to let her drive.\n\nThey soon encounter a red-colored 1967 [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] loaded with four drunken thugs, led by Lep (Don Stroud) and get into a fit of [[road rage]] where Diane forces the punks off the road and into a creek bed, wrecking their car. At the lake house, Diane learns that despite what Harry had told her in order to get her to come with him, there are no other guests joining them at the house, and that he is only using her for sex.\nDiane and Harry are unaware that the angry gang is seeking them, looking for some vicious revenge against the arguing, unhappy and unarmed couple. After the gang rampages through a camping park looking for the car that ran them off the road, they find the Corvette at a rural gas station where Harry had left it to be looked after while taking a less flashy station wagon to the country house. After intimidating the drunk station owners to give them the location to where Harry is staying, Lep and his friends drive off to their destination.\n\nThe four thugs break into the lake house and hold both Diane and Harry hostage. Over the rest of the day and night, Lep and his three cohorts Runt (Richard Ayres), Frankie (Kyle Edwards), and Stanley (Don Granberry), terrorize, harass, and humiliate their two captives from vandalizing the house to stealing Harry's speedboat and wrecking it, killing two townspeople in the process. When Diane attempts to escape, Lep recaptures her and, as punishment, rapes her.\n\nAt nightfall, the gang becomes more out of control with drinking and smoking dope. Harry confronts them with a [[pump-action shotgun]], but he hesitates to shoot and Lep snatches the weapon from his hands. Lep then uses it to kill Harry as he attempts to flee from the house, and Diane is taken to a bedroom to be raped again, this time by Runt. Diane fights back and eventually kills Runt by slashing his neck with a shard of mirror glass and she manages to flee from the house. She later traps Stanley in the boathouse and sets it on fire, allowing him to burn to death. She then lures the pursuing Frankie to a nearby bog where he falls into a quicksand pit and drowns.\n\nIn the morning, Diane and the shotgun-toting Lep face off in a final confrontation in an open field where she attempts to hotwire and escape in Harry's car (with Harry's dead body in the front seat) as Lep tries to shoot her with the shotgun. When Lep runs out of ammunition, he climbs on top of the moving car to stop Diane attempting to drive away. The confrontation ends when Diane manages to shake Lep off the hood, and then runs him over, killing him.\n\nDiane drives the bullet-ridden car away to a paved road where the car stalls on the side of the road. In the final shot, Diane, looking exhausted and dazed, exits the damaged car and looks down the empty road.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Diane\n*[[Don Stroud]] as Lep\n* [[Chuck Shamata]] as Harry\n*[[Richard Ayres]] as Runt\n*[[Kyle Edwards]] as Frankie\n*Don Granberry as Stanley\n*Ed McNamara as Spragg\n*Michael Kirby as Ralph\n*[[Richard Donat]] as policeman\n}}\n\n==Filming locations==\n\n* [[King, Ontario]]\n* [[Kleinburg, Ontario]]\n\n==US release==\nThe film was released in the US by [[American International Pictures]] under the title ''House by the Lake''.
