There, he finds the shop closed and coincidently meets a young girl, Neelam ([[Shalini Pandey]]) who lives right above the shop. An interesting conversation takes place between them. Soon after, they happen to meet a few more times by chance and Naate is now drawn to her. its not very different for Neelam. She appreciates Nasir's genuine gestures towards her, however she seems hesitant when things start to get real.

Ajay Rai of [[Jar Pictures]] watched the short film and told him to narrate to him whatever he writes next. \n\nRanjan completed the draft of Bamfaad and narrated it to Ajay and he immediately agreed to produce it.\n\n\n'''Casting'''\n\nRanjan gave the script to casting director Taran Bajaj to read telling him that he needs a 'Bamfaad' actor for the role of the protagonist, Nasir Jamal. On going through that Taran made him meet Aditya Rawal. Ranjan liked the energy of Aditya and thought him perfect for his character. Ranjan spent a good amount of time with Aditya working on his language, body language and attitude to get him into character. Ranjan narrated various incidents and anecdotes of the world to Aditya, did several hindi book reading sessions, travelled with him to the north indian small towns to get a better idea of the world and people. \n\nRanjan wanted a powerful female lead. He had seen [[Shalini Pandey]] in the Telugu film [[Arjun Reddy]]. It also happened that he saw a youtube video of Shalini in which she was performing and as he saw he realised he had found his heroine, Neelam. Following which he met Shalini and narrated the script to her. She liked the script and she was on. \n\n\n'''Filming'''     \n\nSince this was Ranjan\u2019s debut film, the budget was quite restrained. That is why he chose his hometown [[Kanpur]] as the base for shooting. His father Manmohan Chandel has played a very important part in the shoot. There were many times when the crew didn\u2019t have permission to shoot at a location, the crew used to shoot in Ranjan father\u2019s hometown as he used to get permission for the crew easily. \n\nThe principal photography of the film began on 2nd September 2018 in Kanpur and the film was wrapped on 22nd October 2018 in Lucknow. The shooting of the film got finished in a span of 45 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bamfaad-trailer-paresh-rawal-s-son-aditya-shalini-pandeys-love-story-marred-violence-drama-522226?amp|title=Bamfaad Trailer: Paresh Rawal\u2019s son Aditya & Shalini Pandey's love story is marred by violence & drama|date=7 April 2020|website=pinkvilla.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413081417/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bamfaad-trailer-paresh-rawal-s-son-aditya-shalini-pandeys-love-story-marred-violence-drama-522226?amp|archive-date=13 April 2020|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe Soundtrack for Bamfaad's songs is composed by [[Vishal Mishra (composer)|Vishal Mishra]] and the lyrics are written by [[Raj Shekhar]].\n\nThe film contains [[Suryakant Tripathi|Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']] - Baadal Raag, composed and sung by Harpreet Singh.

The striking introduction melds realism, humour and an earthy song. She mentioned, \"The second half of ''Bamfaad'' does not live up to the promise of the pre-interval portion. Still the director Ranjan Chandel and Writer Hanzalah Shahid are talents to watch out for. For one, in this era of stereotype-ridden, Islamophobic Bollywood rants, it is nice to see a film in which the protagonist is a Muslim, but is not given any stereotypical markers of the religion, and members of the community are treated as regular humans: some good, some not, some evil, some not\". She also mentioned, \"Besides, how can one not make note of artists who can conceptualise a scene in which a love-lorn youth gazing at the object of his affection tells her that pimples look good on her face? He does not say \u201ceven pimples\u201d, he simply says \u201cpimples\u201d. Oh the sweet innocence of those words!

Naate brings home complaints regularly. His father Shahid Jamal, a reputed contractor overlooks his son's deeds and in turn encourages his behaviour for the worse while his mom worried sick about her son and his carelessness. \n\nOne evening, Nasir goes to drop off a parcel at Sanam CD Music shop on Zahid's request, Naate's childhood friend. There, he finds the shop closed and coincidently meets a young girl, Neelam ([[Shalini Pandey]]) who lives right above the shop. An interesting conversation takes place between them. Soon after, they happen to meet a few more times by chance and Naate is now drawn to her. its not very different for Neelam. She appreciates Nasir's genuine gestures towards her, however she seems hesitant when things start to get real. Having had a tough journey, she battles to make things work with Nasir, but he is too light hearted about it all to see any red flags. \n\nWhile Nasir and Neelam get closer, Jigar Fareedi ([[Vijay Varma]]), a seemingly charming, influential person and a role model for many youngsters alike across paths with Nasir on account of his fight with Rajeeb Mehndi, a college student politician who is Jigar's candidate. Jigar demands that Nasir make a public apology and is arrogantly turned down leading to the beginning of an ego conflict between the two. \n\nNeelam struggles to understand her relationship with Nasir, but is unaware of how much she has grown to like him.

Ajay Rai of [[Jar Pictures]] watched the short film and told him to narrate to him whatever he writes next. \n\nRanjan completed the draft of Bamfaad and narrated it to Ajay and he immediately agreed to produce it.\n\n\n'''Casting'''\n\nRanjan gave the script to casting director Taran Bajaj to read telling him that he needs a 'Bamfaad' actor for the role of the protagonist, Nasir Jamal. On going through that Taran made him meet Aditya Rawal. Ranjan liked the energy of Aditya and thought him perfect for his character. Ranjan spent a good amount of time with Aditya working on his language, body language and attitude to get him into character. Ranjan narrated various incidents and anecdotes of the world to Aditya, did several hindi book reading sessions, travelled with him to the north indian small towns to get a better idea of the world and people. \n\nRanjan wanted a powerful female lead. He had seen [[Shalini Pandey]] in the Telugu film [[Arjun Reddy]]. It also happened that he saw a youtube video of Shalini in which she was performing and as he saw he realised he had found his heroine, Neelam. Following which he met Shalini and narrated the script to her. She liked the script and she was on. \n\n\n'''Filming'''     \n\nSince this was Ranjan\u2019s debut film, the budget was quite restrained. That is why he chose his hometown [[Kanpur]] as the base for shooting. His father Manmohan Chandel has played a very important part in the shoot. There were many times when the crew didn\u2019t have permission to shoot at a location, the crew used to shoot in Ranjan father\u2019s hometown as he used to get permission for the crew easily. \n\nThe principal photography of the film began on 2nd September 2018 in Kanpur and the film was wrapped on 22nd October 2018 in Lucknow. The shooting of the film got finished in a span of 45 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bamfaad-trailer-paresh-rawal-s-son-aditya-shalini-pandeys-love-story-marred-violence-drama-522226?amp|title=Bamfaad Trailer: Paresh Rawal\u2019s son Aditya & Shalini Pandey's love story is marred by violence & drama|date=7 April 2020|website=pinkvilla.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413081417/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bamfaad-trailer-paresh-rawal-s-son-aditya-shalini-pandeys-love-story-marred-violence-drama-522226?amp|archive-date=13 April 2020|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe Soundtrack for Bamfaad's songs is composed by [[Vishal Mishra (composer)|Vishal Mishra]] and the lyrics are written by [[Raj Shekhar]].\n\nThe film contains [[Suryakant Tripathi|Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']] - Baadal Raag, composed and sung by Harpreet Singh.

''Ref:'' https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/bamfaad-movie-review-rating-6356312/    \n\nFilm Critic Anna MM Vetticad wrote in [[Firstpost|First Post]] - \"True to its title, ''Bamfaad'' has a fiery start. The striking introduction melds realism, humour and an earthy song. She mentioned, \"The second half of ''Bamfaad'' does not live up to the promise of the pre-interval portion. Still the director Ranjan Chandel and Writer Hanzalah Shahid are talents to watch out for. For one, in this era of stereotype-ridden, Islamophobic Bollywood rants, it is nice to see a film in which the protagonist is a Muslim, but is not given any stereotypical markers of the religion, and members of the community are treated as regular humans: some good, some not, some evil, some not\". She also mentioned, \"Besides, how can one not make note of artists who can conceptualise a scene in which a love-lorn youth gazing at the object of his affection tells her that pimples look good on her face? He does not say \u201ceven pimples\u201d, he simply says \u201cpimples\u201d. Oh the sweet innocence of those words! Because of course on her they are an adornment, not a skin eruption \u2013 \u201cthat dress looks good on you\u201d, \u201cthe new hairstyle looks good on you\u201d, \u201cpimples look good on you\u201d.

Cleanup operations have been underway since the early 1980s. The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] is considering removing the site from the [[National Priorities List]] because of the extensive cleanup that has been done.<ref name=\"Search Superfund Site Information\" />\n\n==Origins==\nThe Chemical Control Corporation superfund site is located in a highly industrial district of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. The [[Elizabeth River (New Jersey)|Elizabeth River]], which runs from several counties in [[New Jersey]], empties itself right in front of the site. The company was operated from 1972-1979 under several owners including William Carracino, Eugene Conlon, John Albert and William Collection.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> The buildup of chemical wastes began after failure to fix the [[incinerator]]. Under the ownership of Collection, the site reached over 50,000 drums of chemicals which resulted in Chemical Control being condemned in 1979 as a [[superfund site]].<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />\n\n===Town history===\nThe city of Elizabeth is located in New Jersey. It is the largest city in [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] and also holds the largest [[county seat]]. Based on the 2010 census, Elizabeth is also the fourth largest city in [[New Jersey]]. It is composed of several [[districts]] and neighborhoods including Midtown, Bayway, Downtown or the Port of Elizabeth, West End, Elmora Hills, Frog Hollow, North End, Keighry Head, Peterstown, The Point, Quality Hill and Westminster. It is bordered by the towns of [[Roselle, New Jersey|Roselle]], [[Roselle Park, New Jersey|Roselle Park]], [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]], [[Hillside, New Jersey|Hillside]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Linden, New Jersey|Linden]], which is the site of the LCP Chemical, Inc. superfund site. The Elizabeth River, which runs through both Union and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]], empties \u201cunderneath a bridge on the S Front Street near Elizabeth Ave and S 1st St.\" South Front Street is the location of the Chemical Control Corporation superfund site which had contaminated the Elizabeth River.\n\n===Company history===\nThe Chemical Control superfund site was operated and run by the Chemical Control Corporation. It received a five-year operating permit in 1972 for its incinerator that passed the air quality tests.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> Between 1976 and 1977, the owner and operator of Chemical Control was William Carracino. During this period of time, he arranged for midnight dumpings throughout Elizabeth to \"offset the buildup of inventory at the site.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> He was indicted and convicted of this crime and was sentenced to \u201ctwo consecutive three year terms and fined a sum of $21,000.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> However, Carracino sold the company to Eugene Conlon and John Albert, who were allegedly linked to a well-known mob under the [[Genovese crime family|Genovese]] family.<ref name=\"NY Times Article\">{{cite news|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Ralph|title=MOB FUNDS TRACED IN TOXIC WASTE PLANT'S TAKEOVER|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/nyregion/mob-funds-traced-in-toxic-waste-plant-s-takeover.html|accessdate=September 24, 2017|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times Company|date=January 3, 1981}}</ref> The two appointed William Collection as the new president. During this time, 30,000 drums of chemicals were recorded on site and Collection was ordered to get rid of them in a safe manner. He had refused to do so and by 1979 over 50,000 drums of chemicals were recorded to be on site. This led to the condemnation of the Chemical Control site in 1979.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />\n\n==Superfund designation==  \nState and national intervention were enforced on the Chemical Control superfund site. The state of New Jersey initiated cleanup efforts through Peabody Coastal Services and from funding by the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund after the site was condemned in 1979.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> The 1980 fire at Chemical Control resulted in national intervention as a result of the magnitude of contamination that effected both the state of New Jersey and [[New York (state)|New York]] via the air, soil, and water.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />\n\n===State intervention=== \nPrior to the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] intervention, the state of New Jersey initiated a cleanup of the site in 1979 when the company was taken over by Conlon and Albert. The state stated that the new owners of the site had to \"eliminate the barrels that had built up on the site at a rate of 1,200 per month, to inventory and label all on-site drums, and to incinerate all burnable waste.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> However, the state administrator who mandated the requirements did not state that the site was barred from accepting more chemicals. This resulted in an increase of 30,000 drums of chemicals to 50,000 drums of chemicals on site by 1979.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> As a result, an investigation by the Bureau of Hazardous Waste's was started which, \"led to the suit filed against Chemical Control and its parent company, the Northern Pollution Control Company of New York. The owners of Chemical Control, Conlon and Albert, claimed that their company did not have sufficient funds to perform a cleanup. The Chemical Control records at the time showed only a few thousand dollars, so the state put the company in receivership.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> After being condemned in 1979, Peabody Costal Services was hired to commence the cleanup of the site. Between 1979 and the fire of 1980, 8,000 to 10,000 drums of toxic and explosive chemicals were removed, along with \"5 pounds of radioactive substances, 10 pounds of disease-bearing material, and nearly 400 pounds of explosive material.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> The whole operation costed between $11 -$13 million and was all funded by the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />\n\n===National intervention===\nAt first, national intervention was not necessary due to the intense state efforts to clean up the site. However, \"on April 21, 1980, an explosive fire at the Chemical Control Corporation's Elizabeth, New Jersey hazardous waste treatment facility sent a toxic mixture of gases and chemical particulates into the [[atmosphere]]. Fifty-five gallon drums containing a variety of chemicals rocketed two hundred feet in the air before they burst due to the intense heat. [[Temperatures]] reached 3,000\u00b0 F., melting and fusing containers. An estimated 50,000 drums of hazardous waste burned for more than ten hours before the Elizabeth fire department was able to bring the fire under control at 9:15 a.m. During the fire, a plume of noxious smoke and ash blanketed a fifteen square-mile area northeast from the site.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> The fire not only caused chemicals to become airborne, but also resulted in them entering water, [[groundwater]] and soil. Contamination of the environment and health risks of over 15 million people led the Environmental Protection Agency to intervene at the site.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />  The site was proposed for admission to be put on the National Priorities List in October 1981 and was finally added in September 1983.<ref name=\"Fact Book National\">{{cite web|title=Fact Book National Priorities List Under The Original Hazard Ranking System|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/2000H8D7.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=1991%20Thru%201994&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&UseQField=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C91THRU94%5CTXT%5C00000015%5C2000H8D7.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=35|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=September 24, 2017}}</ref>  The origin of the fire \u201chas never been determined, although unstable chemicals are the prime suspect\u201d <ref name=\"CC Fire 15 Years Article\">{{cite news|title=Chemical Control Fire Burned 15 Hours, Seared Memories for 35 Years|url=http://njtoday.net/2016/04/20/chemical-control-fire-burned-15-hours-seared-memories-35-years/|agency=Staff Report|publisher=CMD Media|date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Health and environmental hazards== \nThe damages caused by the Chemical Control Corporation superfund site effected both the surrounding environment and community of Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Numerous chemicals from the site, including [[benzene]], [[PCBs]], [[toluene]] and more, resulted in side effects of irritated eyes, vomiting, diarrhea and skin rashes.

Cleanup operations have been underway since the early 1980s. The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] is considering removing the site from the [[National Priorities List]] because of the extensive cleanup that has been done.<ref name=\"Search Superfund Site Information\" />\n\n==Origins==\nThe Chemical Control Corporation superfund site is located in a highly industrial district of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. The [[Elizabeth River (New Jersey)|Elizabeth River]], which runs from several counties in [[New Jersey]], empties itself right in front of the site. The company was operated from 1972-1979 under several owners including William Carracino, Eugene Conlon, John Albert and William Collection.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> The buildup of chemical wastes began after failure to fix the [[incinerator]]. Under the ownership of Collection, the site reached over 50,000 drums of chemicals which resulted in Chemical Control being condemned in 1979 as a [[superfund site]].<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />\n\n===Town history===\nThe city of Elizabeth is located in New Jersey. It is the largest city in [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] and also holds the largest [[county seat]]. Based on the 2010 census, Elizabeth is also the fourth largest city in [[New Jersey]]. It is composed of several [[districts]] and neighborhoods including Midtown, Bayway, Downtown or the Port of Elizabeth, West End, Elmora Hills, Frog Hollow, North End, Keighry Head, Peterstown, The Point, Quality Hill and Westminster. It is bordered by the towns of [[Roselle, New Jersey|Roselle]], [[Roselle Park, New Jersey|Roselle Park]], [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union]], [[Hillside, New Jersey|Hillside]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Linden, New Jersey|Linden]], which is the site of the LCP Chemical, Inc. superfund site. The Elizabeth River, which runs through both Union and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]], empties \u201cunderneath a bridge on the S Front Street near Elizabeth Ave and S 1st St.\" South Front Street is the location of the Chemical Control Corporation superfund site which had contaminated the Elizabeth River.\n\n===Company history===\nThe Chemical Control superfund site was operated and run by the Chemical Control Corporation. It received a five-year operating permit in 1972 for its incinerator that passed the air quality tests.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> Between 1976 and 1977, the owner and operator of Chemical Control was William Carracino. During this period of time, he arranged for midnight dumpings throughout Elizabeth to \"offset the buildup of inventory at the site.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> He was indicted and convicted of this crime and was sentenced to \u201ctwo consecutive three year terms and fined a sum of $21,000.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> However, Carracino sold the company to Eugene Conlon and John Albert, who were allegedly linked to a well-known mob under the [[Genovese crime family|Genovese]] family.<ref name=\"NY Times Article\">{{cite news|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Ralph|title=MOB FUNDS TRACED IN TOXIC WASTE PLANT'S TAKEOVER|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/nyregion/mob-funds-traced-in-toxic-waste-plant-s-takeover.html|accessdate=September 24, 2017|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times Company|date=January 3, 1981}}</ref> The two appointed William Collection as the new president. During this time, 30,000 drums of chemicals were recorded on site and Collection was ordered to get rid of them in a safe manner. He had refused to do so and by 1979 over 50,000 drums of chemicals were recorded to be on site. This led to the condemnation of the Chemical Control site in 1979.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />\n\n==Superfund designation==  \nState and national intervention were enforced on the Chemical Control superfund site. The state of New Jersey initiated cleanup efforts through Peabody Coastal Services and from funding by the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund after the site was condemned in 1979.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> The 1980 fire at Chemical Control resulted in national intervention as a result of the magnitude of contamination that effected both the state of New Jersey and [[New York (state)|New York]] via the air, soil, and water.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />\n\n===State intervention=== \nPrior to the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] intervention, the state of New Jersey initiated a cleanup of the site in 1979 when the company was taken over by Conlon and Albert. The state stated that the new owners of the site had to \"eliminate the barrels that had built up on the site at a rate of 1,200 per month, to inventory and label all on-site drums, and to incinerate all burnable waste.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> However, the state administrator who mandated the requirements did not state that the site was barred from accepting more chemicals. This resulted in an increase of 30,000 drums of chemicals to 50,000 drums of chemicals on site by 1979.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> As a result, an investigation by the Bureau of Hazardous Waste's was started which, \"led to the suit filed against Chemical Control and its parent company, the Northern Pollution Control Company of New York. The owners of Chemical Control, Conlon and Albert, claimed that their company did not have sufficient funds to perform a cleanup. The Chemical Control records at the time showed only a few thousand dollars, so the state put the company in receivership.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> After being condemned in 1979, Peabody Costal Services was hired to commence the cleanup of the site. Between 1979 and the fire of 1980, 8,000 to 10,000 drums of toxic and explosive chemicals were removed, along with \"5 pounds of radioactive substances, 10 pounds of disease-bearing material, and nearly 400 pounds of explosive material.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> The whole operation costed between $11 -$13 million and was all funded by the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />\n\n===National intervention===\nAt first, national intervention was not necessary due to the intense state efforts to clean up the site. However, \"on April 21, 1980, an explosive fire at the Chemical Control Corporation's Elizabeth, New Jersey hazardous waste treatment facility sent a toxic mixture of gases and chemical particulates into the [[atmosphere]]. Fifty-five gallon drums containing a variety of chemicals rocketed two hundred feet in the air before they burst due to the intense heat. [[Temperatures]] reached 3,000\u00b0 F., melting and fusing containers. An estimated 50,000 drums of hazardous waste burned for more than ten hours before the Elizabeth fire department was able to bring the fire under control at 9:15 a.m. During the fire, a plume of noxious smoke and ash blanketed a fifteen square-mile area northeast from the site.\"<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" /> The fire not only caused chemicals to become airborne, but also resulted in them entering water, [[groundwater]] and soil. Contamination of the environment and health risks of over 15 million people led the Environmental Protection Agency to intervene at the site.<ref name=\"Sharefkin\" />  The site was proposed for admission to be put on the National Priorities List in October 1981 and was finally added in September 1983.<ref name=\"Fact Book National\">{{cite web|title=Fact Book National Priorities List Under The Original Hazard Ranking System|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/2000H8D7.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=1991%20Thru%201994&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&UseQField=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C91THRU94%5CTXT%5C00000015%5C2000H8D7.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=35|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=September 24, 2017}}</ref>  The origin of the fire \u201chas never been determined, although unstable chemicals are the prime suspect\u201d <ref name=\"CC Fire 15 Years Article\">{{cite news|title=Chemical Control Fire Burned 15 Hours, Seared Memories for 35 Years|url=http://njtoday.net/2016/04/20/chemical-control-fire-burned-15-hours-seared-memories-35-years/|agency=Staff Report|publisher=CMD Media|date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Health and environmental hazards== \nThe damages caused by the Chemical Control Corporation superfund site effected both the surrounding environment and community of Elizabeth, New Jersey.

In late September 1939 Vera Lynn first recorded a song that continues to be associated with her: \"[[We'll Meet Again]]\" was originally recorded with Arthur Young on the [[Novachord]].<ref name=Baade8/>\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s the [[Decca Records|Decca]] label issued all of Lynn's records, including several recorded with [[Mantovani]] and His Orchestra in 1942 and with [[Robert Farnon]], from the late 1940s. These were only available as 78 rpm singles, which contained only two songs as an A and a [[B-side]]. In the mid-1950s Decca issued several [[Extended play|EP]] singles, which comprised between two and four recordings per side, such as ''Vera Lynn's Party Sing Song'' from 1954. Singles were now issued on two formats: the known 78 rpm 10\" shellac discs, and the recently introduced 45 rpm 7\" vinyl single. In the late 1950s Lynn recorded four albums at Decca, the first; ''Vera Lynn Concert'' remains her only live recording ever issued on vinyl.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn 1960, after more than 20 years at Decca Records, Lynn signed to the US based [[MGM Records]]. In the UK her recordings were distributed by the [[His Masters Voice]] label, later [[EMI Records]]. Several albums and stand-alone singles were recorded with [[Geoff Love]] & His Orchestra. [[Norman Newell]] also took over as Lynn's producer in this period and remained with her until her 1976 album ''Christmas with Vera Lynn''. Recording at EMI Records up until 1977, Lynn released thirteen albums with material as diverse as traditional [[Hymns]], pop and [[Country music|country]] songs, as well as re-recording many of her known songs from the 1940s for the albums ''Hits of the Blitz'' (1962), ''More Hits of the Blitz'' and ''Vera Lynn Remembers \u2013 The World at War'' (1974). In the 1980s, two albums of contemporary pop songs were recorded at the [[Pye Records]] label, both including covers of songs previously recorded by artists such as [[ABBA]] and [[Barry Manilow]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn 1982, Lynn released the stand-alone single \"[[I Love This Land]]\", written by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], to mark the end of the [[Falklands War]].

The songs most associated with her are \"[[We'll Meet Again]]\", \"[[(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover|The White Cliffs of Dover]]\", \"[[A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square (song)|A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square]]\" and \"[[There'll Always Be an England]]\".\n\nShe remained popular after the war, appearing on radio and television in the UK and the US and recording such hits as \"[[Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart]]\" and her UK number one single \"[[My Son, My Son]]\". Her last single, \"[[I Love This Land]]\", was released to mark the end of the [[Falklands War]]. In 2009, at the age of 92, she became the oldest living artist to top the [[UK Albums Chart]], with compilation album ''[[We'll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn]]''.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Lynn also scored a number one in 2014, when she was 97, with the collection ''Vera Lynn: National Treasure'', and remains the oldest person to top the album charts. Further, she released the [[compilation album]]  of hits ''[[Vera Lynn 100]]'' in 2017, to commemorate her centennial year, and it was a number-3 hit, making her the first centenarian performer to have an album in the charts.\n\nShe has devoted much time and energy to charity work connected with ex-servicemen, disabled children, and breast cancer. She is held in great affection by veterans of the [[Second World War]] and in 2000 was named the Briton who best exemplified the spirit of the 20th century.\n\n==Early life==\nVera Margaret Welch was born in [[East Ham]], now part of the London Borough of  [[Newham]]<!-- Do not change to London, East Ham was in Essex in 1917 -->, on 20 March 1917, the daughter of Bertram Samuel Welch (1883\u20131955) and Annie Martin (1889\u20131975), who had married in 1913.<ref>\"Welch Bertram S. & Martin Annie\" in ''Register of Marriages for West Ham Registration District'', vol. 4a (March quarter, 1913), p. 43</ref> Her elder brother Roger Welch (4 March 1914 \u2013 3 March 2017) also became a centenarian.\n\nIn 1919, when Lynn was two years old, she fell ill with diphtheritic croup and nearly died as a result.

In late September 1939 Vera Lynn first recorded a song that continues to be associated with her: \"[[We'll Meet Again]]\" was originally recorded with Arthur Young on the [[Novachord]].<ref name=Baade8/>\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s the [[Decca Records|Decca]] label issued all of Lynn's records, including several recorded with [[Mantovani]] and His Orchestra in 1942 and with [[Robert Farnon]], from the late 1940s. These were only available as 78 rpm singles, which contained only two songs as an A and a [[B-side]]. In the mid-1950s Decca issued several [[Extended play|EP]] singles, which comprised between two and four recordings per side, such as ''Vera Lynn's Party Sing Song'' from 1954. Singles were now issued on two formats: the known 78 rpm 10\" shellac discs, and the recently introduced 45 rpm 7\" vinyl single. In the late 1950s Lynn recorded four albums at Decca, the first; ''Vera Lynn Concert'' remains her only live recording ever issued on vinyl.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn 1960, after more than 20 years at Decca Records, Lynn signed to the US based [[MGM Records]]. In the UK her recordings were distributed by the [[His Masters Voice]] label, later [[EMI Records]]. Several albums and stand-alone singles were recorded with [[Geoff Love]] & His Orchestra. [[Norman Newell]] also took over as Lynn's producer in this period and remained with her until her 1976 album ''Christmas with Vera Lynn''. Recording at EMI Records up until 1977, Lynn released thirteen albums with material as diverse as traditional [[Hymns]], pop and [[Country music|country]] songs, as well as re-recording many of her known songs from the 1940s for the albums ''Hits of the Blitz'' (1962), ''More Hits of the Blitz'' and ''Vera Lynn Remembers \u2013 The World at War'' (1974). In the 1980s, two albums of contemporary pop songs were recorded at the [[Pye Records]] label, both including covers of songs previously recorded by artists such as [[ABBA]] and [[Barry Manilow]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn 1982, Lynn released the stand-alone single \"[[I Love This Land]]\", written by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], to mark the end of the [[Falklands War]].

Since 2012 onwards, the preliminary (first test) of the two examinations are combined. These officers are recruited and trained by the Central Government, and then allotted to different State cadres.\n\n==History==\nThe history of All India Services dates back to the British era when initially Civil Servants were appointed by the Court of Directors of the British East India Company. The service in those times was known as 'Covenanted Civil Service'.

This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The [[Cabinet Secretary]] stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a [[District Magistrate]]'s office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretaries]]/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]]. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the [[District collector|Collector]] or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\n===Indian Forest Service (IFS)===\n{{main|Indian Forest Service}}\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the [[Indian Forest Service#Imperial Forest Service (IFS)|Imperial Forest Department]]. In 1866 Dr. [[Dietrich Brandis]], a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \n \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in [[Germany]] and [[France]], and from 1885 to 1905 at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[London]], which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh]] undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\n \nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] (FRI) at [[Dehradun]] (established in 1906). Later The [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]] (IFC) was established in 1938 at [[Dehradun]], and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. [[Forestry]], which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\n \nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the ''All India Services Act 1951'', for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\n \nIndia has an area of 635,400&nbsp;km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the [[Concurrent List]].\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, [[Divisional Forest Officer]] (DFOs), \n[[Deputy Conservator of Forests]],\n[[Conservator of Forests]] (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (Addl.PCCFs),\n[[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\n[[Director General of Forests (India)]] - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the [[ISRO]]'s [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]], [[University of Twente]]/[[ITC Enschede|ITC]] [[Netherlands]] and in Wildlife Management from the [[Wildlife Institute of India]]. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], SAARC Forestry Centre, [[Forest Survey of India]], [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [[Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education]] (ICFRE), [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, [[Wildlife Crime Control Bureau]] (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\n===Indian Police Service (IPS)===\n{{main|Indian Police Service}}\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after [[India]] gained [[Partition of India|independence]] from [[British Raj|Britain]], the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as its Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as [[Superintendent of Police]] or [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]] and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] or [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] in 15 years, an [[Inspector General of Police]] in 18 years, [[Additional Director General of Police]] in 25 years and finally, the [[Director General of Police]] after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Research and Analysis Wing]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Central Industrial Security Force]], etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], [[Consul General]], Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, [[High Commissioner]] and [[Ambassador]].\n\nThe [[Director General of Police]] and [[Commissioner of Police]] is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]]  etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The [[Inspector General#India|Inspector General]] or [[Joint Commissioner of Police]] is at the head of certain specialised police force like [[Criminal Investigation Department]], Special Branch, etc.\n\n==Reforms and changes==\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| title= Retire non-performing bureaucrats: Centre to states| date= 1 July 2012| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120701135717/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| archivedate= 1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS lazy retire\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lazy-and-incompetent-babus-to-retire-early/1/162137.html |title=Lazy and incompetent babus to retire early|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"corruption compulsory retirement\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/graft-taint-may-lead-to-retirement-for-babus/1/179684.html |title=Corruption taint may lead to compulsory retirement for babus|author=|date=21 April 2012 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS retire 15 incompetence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/proposal-to-retire-incompetent-officers-after-15-year-service/20111130.htm |title=Proposal to retire incompetent officers after 15-year service|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Rediff News |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn recommendation by [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-ias-462676| title=Exams for state civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-IAS/articleshow/27861653.cms| title=State civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\n==Disputes in using acronym IFS==\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS  by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Services of India]]\n*[[Special Duty Allowance (SDA)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091220111744/http://www.upsc.gov.in/ais/index.htm All India Services official website]\n* [http://upsc.gov.in/ Union Public Service Commission official website]\n* [http://persmin.nic.in/ Indian Administrative Service official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619060945/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=346 Indian Police Service official website]\n* [http://ifs.nic.in/ Indian Forest Service official website]\n*[https://sarkarijobindian.com/ Government Jobs official Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174347/http://persmin.nic.in/ersheet/StartQryERS.asp List of IAS Officers]\n[[Category:All India Services| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Public services in India}}{{Use Indian English|date=January 2019}}{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}\nThe '''All India Services''' ('''AIS''') comprises [[Civil Services of India]], namely the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), the [[Indian Forest Service]] (IFS) <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO INDIAN FOREIGN SERVICE --> and the [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS).<ref name=\"All India Services\">{{cite web|title=All India Services|url=http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/profile.php?id=32|website=Know India Official website of Government}}</ref> A common unique feature of the All India Services is that the members of these services are recruited by the Centre (Union government in federal polity), but their services are placed under various State cadres, and they have the liability to serve both under the State and under the Centre.<ref name=\"All India Services\"/> Due to the federal polity of the country, this is considered one of the tools that makes union government stronger than state governments.

The service in those times was known as 'Covenanted Civil Service'.

This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The [[Cabinet Secretary]] stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a [[District Magistrate]]'s office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretaries]]/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]]. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the [[District collector|Collector]] or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\n===Indian Forest Service (IFS)===\n{{main|Indian Forest Service}}\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the [[Indian Forest Service#Imperial Forest Service (IFS)|Imperial Forest Department]]. In 1866 Dr. [[Dietrich Brandis]], a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \n \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in [[Germany]] and [[France]], and from 1885 to 1905 at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[London]], which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh]] undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\n \nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] (FRI) at [[Dehradun]] (established in 1906). Later The [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]] (IFC) was established in 1938 at [[Dehradun]], and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. [[Forestry]], which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\n \nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the ''All India Services Act 1951'', for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\n \nIndia has an area of 635,400&nbsp;km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the [[Concurrent List]].\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, [[Divisional Forest Officer]] (DFOs), \n[[Deputy Conservator of Forests]],\n[[Conservator of Forests]] (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (Addl.PCCFs),\n[[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\n[[Director General of Forests (India)]] - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the [[ISRO]]'s [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]], [[University of Twente]]/[[ITC Enschede|ITC]] [[Netherlands]] and in Wildlife Management from the [[Wildlife Institute of India]]. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], SAARC Forestry Centre, [[Forest Survey of India]], [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [[Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education]] (ICFRE), [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, [[Wildlife Crime Control Bureau]] (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\n===Indian Police Service (IPS)===\n{{main|Indian Police Service}}\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after [[India]] gained [[Partition of India|independence]] from [[British Raj|Britain]], the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as its Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as [[Superintendent of Police]] or [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]] and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] or [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] in 15 years, an [[Inspector General of Police]] in 18 years, [[Additional Director General of Police]] in 25 years and finally, the [[Director General of Police]] after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Research and Analysis Wing]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Central Industrial Security Force]], etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], [[Consul General]], Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, [[High Commissioner]] and [[Ambassador]].\n\nThe [[Director General of Police]] and [[Commissioner of Police]] is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]]  etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The [[Inspector General#India|Inspector General]] or [[Joint Commissioner of Police]] is at the head of certain specialised police force like [[Criminal Investigation Department]], Special Branch, etc.\n\n==Reforms and changes==\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| title= Retire non-performing bureaucrats: Centre to states| date= 1 July 2012| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120701135717/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| archivedate= 1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS lazy retire\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lazy-and-incompetent-babus-to-retire-early/1/162137.html |title=Lazy and incompetent babus to retire early|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"corruption compulsory retirement\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/graft-taint-may-lead-to-retirement-for-babus/1/179684.html |title=Corruption taint may lead to compulsory retirement for babus|author=|date=21 April 2012 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS retire 15 incompetence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/proposal-to-retire-incompetent-officers-after-15-year-service/20111130.htm |title=Proposal to retire incompetent officers after 15-year service|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Rediff News |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn recommendation by [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-ias-462676| title=Exams for state civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-IAS/articleshow/27861653.cms| title=State civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\n==Disputes in using acronym IFS==\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS  by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Services of India]]\n*[[Special Duty Allowance (SDA)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091220111744/http://www.upsc.gov.in/ais/index.htm All India Services official website]\n* [http://upsc.gov.in/ Union Public Service Commission official website]\n* [http://persmin.nic.in/ Indian Administrative Service official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619060945/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=346 Indian Police Service official website]\n* [http://ifs.nic.in/ Indian Forest Service official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174347/http://persmin.nic.in/ersheet/StartQryERS.asp List of IAS Officers]\n[[Category:All India Services| ]]\n", "name_user": "SARKARIJOBINDIAN", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Services"}
