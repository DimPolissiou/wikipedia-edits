A longer example, {{lang|ar|\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064f \u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064f}}, ({{lang|ar-Latn|huwa yaqra\u02bcu kit\u0101bahu}}, \"he reads his book\") more clearly indicates the possessor. H\u0101\u02be is also used as the Arabic abbreviation for dates following the Islamic era [[AH (era)|AH]].\n\nThe ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|h\u0101\u02be}}'' suffix appended to a verb represents a masculine [[object (grammar)|object]] (e.g. {{lang|ar|\u064a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064f\u0647\u064f}}, ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|yaqra\u02beuhu}}'', 'he reads it').\n\nThe feminine form of this construction is in both cases {{lang|ar|\u0640\u0647\u064e\u0627}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|-h\u0101}}''.\n\nIn [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq]] the letter has a variant, [[gol he]], with its own particular shapes. As Urdu and other languages of Pakistan are usually written in Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq, they normally employ this variant, which is given an independent code point (U+06C1) for compatibility:\n\n{{Arabic alphabet Naskh and Nastaliq shapes|\u06c1}}\n\nFor [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] and [[breathy voice]] Urdu and other languages of Pakistan use the medial (in Nastaliq script) or initial (in Naskh script) form of ''h\u0101\u02be'', called in Urdu {{lang|ur-Latn|do cashm\u012b he}} ('two-eyed he'):\n\n{{Arabic alphabet Naskh and Nastaliq shapes|\u06be}}\n\nMany Turkic languages of Central Asia like Uyghur as well as Kurdish use the modification of the letter for front vowels /{{IPA link|\u00e6}}/ or /{{IPA link|\u025b}}/. This has its own code point (U+06D5). To distinguish it from Arabic ''h\u0101\u02be'' /h/ the letter lacks its initial and medial forms: [{{script/Nastaliq|\u0640}}]\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|\u06d5}}\n\n==Hebrew Hei==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=5|<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n!colspan=3|<small>Various print fonts</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br>Hebrew]]</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Rashi script|Rashi<br>script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>Serif</small> !! <small>[[Sans-serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospaced]]</small>\n|-\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">\u05d4</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:29pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">\u05d4</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">\u05d4</span>\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter He handwriting.svg|22px]]\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter He Rashi.png|35px]]\n|}\n\nHebrew spelling: <big>{{hebrew|\u05d4\u05b5\u05d0}}</big>\n\n===Pronunciation===\nIn [[Hebrew Language|modern Hebrew]], the letter represents a [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0266/}}, and may also be dropped, although this pronunciation is seen as substandard.\n\nAlso, in many variant Hebrew pronunciations the letter may represent a glottal stop. In word-final position, ''Hei'' is used to indicate an ''a''-vowel, usually that of [[qamatz]] (&nbsp;<big>{{Hebrew|1=<span style=\"line-height:normal\">&#x5B8;</span>}}</big>&nbsp;), and in this sense functions like [[Aleph]], [[Vav (letter)|Vav]], and [[Yodh|Yud]] as a [[mater lectionis]], indicating the presence of a long vowel.\n\n''Hei'', along with [[Aleph (Hebrew)|Aleph]], [[Ayin]], [[Resh|Reish]], and [[Heth (letter)|Khet]], cannot receive a [[dagesh]]. Nonetheless, it does receive a marking identical to the dagesh, to form ''Hei-[[mappiq]]'' ({{Hebrew|\u05d4\u05bc}}). Although indistinguishable for most modern speakers or readers of Hebrew, the mapiq is placed in a word-final ''Hei'' to indicate that the letter is not merely a mater lectionis but the consonant should be aspirated in that position. It is generally used in Hebrew to indicate the third-person feminine singular genitive marker. Today, such a pronunciation only occurs in religious contexts and even then often only by careful readers of the scriptures.\n\n===Significance of Hei===\nIn [[gematria]], ''Hei'' symbolizes the number five, and when used at the beginning of [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew years]], it means 5000 (i.e. \u05d4\u05ea\u05e9\u05e0\u05f4\u05d3 in [[Arabic numerals|numbers]] would be the [[calendar date|date]] 5754). \n\nAttached to words, ''Hei'' may have three possible meanings:\n*A [[preposition]] meaning the definite article \"the\", or the relative pronouns \"that\", or \"who\" (as in \"a boy ''who'' reads\"). For example, ''yeled'', a boy; '''''ha'''yeled'', the boy.\n*A prefix indicating that the sentence is a question. (For example, ''Yadata'', You knew; '''''Ha'''yadata''?, Did you know?)\n*A suffix after place names indicating movement towards the given noun. (For example, ''Yerushalayim'', [[Jerusalem]]; ''Yerushalaym'''ah''''', towards Jerusalem.)\n\nIn modern Hebrew the frequency of the usage of he, out of all the letters, is 8.18%.\n\n''Hei'', representing five in gematria, is often found on amulets, symbolizing the five fingers of a hand, [[Hamsa|a very common talismanic symbol]].\n\n====In Judaism====\n''Hei'' is often used to represent the name of God as an abbreviation for [[Names of God in Judaism#Hashem.2FHadavar|Hashem]], which means ''The Name'' and is a way of saying ''God'' without actually saying the name of God. In print, Hashem is usually written as ''Hei'' with a [[geresh]]: {{Hebrew|\u05d4\u05f3}}.\n\n==Syriac Heh==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Heh'''\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Eastern he.svg|50px]] ''Madn\u1e2baya'' Heh\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Serta he.svg|50px]] ''Ser\u1e6do'' Heh\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Estrangela he.svg|50px]] ''Es\u1e6drangela'' Heh\n|}\n\n[[File:Syriac letter shapes Heh.PNG|600px]]\n\nIn the [[Syriac alphabet]], the fifth letter is {{lang|syr|\u0717}} \u2014 Heh ({{lang|syr|\u0717\u0739\u0710}}). It is pronounced as an <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[voiceless glottal fricative|h]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. At the end of a word with a point above it, it represents the [[grammatical person|third-person]] [[grammatical gender|feminine]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[suffix]]. Without the point, it stands for the masculine equivalent. Standing alone with a horizontal line above it, it is the [[abbreviation]] for either ''h\u0101noh'' ({{lang|syr|\u0717\u0735\u0722\u0718\u073f}}), meaning 'this is' or 'that is', or ''[[Hallelujah|halel\u00fbya]]'' ({{lang|syr|\u0717\u0735\u0720\u0739\u0720\u0718\u073c\u071d\u0735\u0710}}).

H\u0101\u02be is also used as the Arabic abbreviation for dates following the Islamic era [[AH (era)|AH]].\n\nThe ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|h\u0101\u02be}}'' suffix appended to a verb represents a masculine [[object (grammar)|object]] (e.g. {{lang|ar|\u064a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064f\u0647\u064f}}, ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|yaqra\u02beuhu}}'', 'he reads it').\n\nThe feminine form of this construction is in both cases {{lang|ar|\u0640\u0647\u064e\u0627}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|-h\u0101}}''.\n\nIn [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq]] the letter has a variant, [[gol he]], with its own particular shapes. As Urdu and other languages of Pakistan are usually written in Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq, they normally employ this variant, which is given an independent code point (U+06C1) for compatibility:\n\n{{Arabic alphabet Naskh and Nastaliq shapes|\u06c1}}\n\nFor [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] and [[breathy voice]] Urdu and other languages of Pakistan use the medial (in Nastaliq script) or initial (in Naskh script) form of ''h\u0101\u02be'', called in Urdu {{lang|ur-Latn|do cashm\u012b he}} ('two-eyed he'):\n\n{{Arabic alphabet Naskh and Nastaliq shapes|\u06be}}\n\nMany Turkic languages of Central Asia like Uyghur as well as Kurdish use the modification of the letter for front vowels /{{IPA link|\u00e6}}/ or /{{IPA link|\u025b}}/. This has its own code point (U+06D5). To distinguish it from Arabic ''h\u0101\u02be'' /h/ the letter lacks its initial and medial forms: [{{script/Nastaliq|\u0640}}]\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|\u06d5}}\n\n==Hebrew Hei==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=5|<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n!colspan=3|<small>Various print fonts</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br>Hebrew]]</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Rashi script|Rashi<br>script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>Serif</small> !! <small>[[Sans-serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospaced]]</small>\n|-\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">\u05d4</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:29pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">\u05d4</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">\u05d4</span>\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter He handwriting.svg|22px]]\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter He Rashi.png|35px]]\n|}\n\nHebrew spelling: <big>{{hebrew|\u05d4\u05b5\u05d0}}</big>\n\n===Pronunciation===\nIn [[Hebrew Language|modern Hebrew]], the letter represents a [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0266/}}, and may also be dropped, although this pronunciation is seen as substandard.\n\nAlso, in many variant Hebrew pronunciations the letter may represent a glottal stop. In word-final position, ''Hei'' is used to indicate an ''a''-vowel, usually that of [[qamatz]] (&nbsp;<big>{{Hebrew|1=<span style=\"line-height:normal\">&#x5B8;</span>}}</big>&nbsp;), and in this sense functions like [[Aleph]], [[Vav (letter)|Vav]], and [[Yodh|Yud]] as a [[mater lectionis]], indicating the presence of a long vowel.\n\n''Hei'', along with [[Aleph (Hebrew)|Aleph]], [[Ayin]], [[Resh|Reish]], and [[Heth (letter)|Khet]], cannot receive a [[dagesh]]. Nonetheless, it does receive a marking identical to the dagesh, to form ''Hei-[[mappiq]]'' ({{Hebrew|\u05d4\u05bc}}). Although indistinguishable for most modern speakers or readers of Hebrew, the mapiq is placed in a word-final ''Hei'' to indicate that the letter is not merely a mater lectionis but the consonant should be aspirated in that position. It is generally used in Hebrew to indicate the third-person feminine singular genitive marker. Today, such a pronunciation only occurs in religious contexts and even then often only by careful readers of the scriptures.\n\n===Significance of Hei===\nIn [[gematria]], ''Hei'' symbolizes the number five, and when used at the beginning of [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew years]], it means 5000 (i.e. \u05d4\u05ea\u05e9\u05e0\u05f4\u05d3 in [[Arabic numerals|numbers]] would be the [[calendar date|date]] 5754). \n\nAttached to words, ''Hei'' may have three possible meanings:\n*A [[preposition]] meaning the definite article \"the\", or the relative pronouns \"that\", or \"who\" (as in \"a boy ''who'' reads\"). For example, ''yeled'', a boy; '''''ha'''yeled'', the boy.\n*A prefix indicating that the sentence is a question. (For example, ''Yadata'', You knew; '''''Ha'''yadata''?, Did you know?)\n*A suffix after place names indicating movement towards the given noun. (For example, ''Yerushalayim'', [[Jerusalem]]; ''Yerushalaym'''ah''''', towards Jerusalem.)\n\nIn modern Hebrew the frequency of the usage of he, out of all the letters, is 8.18%.\n\n''Hei'', representing five in gematria, is often found on amulets, symbolizing the five fingers of a hand, [[Hamsa|a very common talismanic symbol]].\n\n====In Judaism====\n''Hei'' is often used to represent the name of God as an abbreviation for [[Names of God in Judaism#Hashem.2FHadavar|Hashem]], which means ''The Name'' and is a way of saying ''God'' without actually saying the name of God. In print, Hashem is usually written as ''Hei'' with a [[geresh]]: {{Hebrew|\u05d4\u05f3}}.\n\n==Syriac Heh==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Heh'''\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Eastern he.svg|50px]] ''Madn\u1e2baya'' Heh\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Serta he.svg|50px]] ''Ser\u1e6do'' Heh\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Estrangela he.svg|50px]] ''Es\u1e6drangela'' Heh\n|}\n\n[[File:Syriac letter shapes Heh.PNG|600px]]\n\nIn the [[Syriac alphabet]], the fifth letter is {{lang|syr|\u0717}} \u2014 Heh ({{lang|syr|\u0717\u0739\u0710}}). It is pronounced as an <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[voiceless glottal fricative|h]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. At the end of a word with a point above it, it represents the [[grammatical person|third-person]] [[grammatical gender|feminine]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[suffix]]. Without the point, it stands for the masculine equivalent. Standing alone with a horizontal line above it, it is the [[abbreviation]] for either ''h\u0101noh'' ({{lang|syr|\u0717\u0735\u0722\u0718\u073f}}), meaning 'this is' or 'that is', or ''[[Hallelujah|halel\u00fbya]]'' ({{lang|syr|\u0717\u0735\u0720\u0739\u0720\u0718\u073c\u071d\u0735\u0710}}). As a numeral, He represents the number five.\n\n==Character encodings==\n{{charmap\n|05D4|name1=Hebrew Letter He\n|0647|name2=Arabic Letter Heh\n|0717|name3=Syriac Letter He\n|0804|name4=Samaritan Letter Iy\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10385|name1=Ugaritic Letter Ho\n|10844|name2=Imperial Aramaic Letter He\n|10904|name3=Phoenician Letter He\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|He (letter)}}\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n{{Northwest Semitic abjad}}\n[[Category:Phoenician alphabet]]\n[[Category:Arabic letters]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]\n\n[[kk:\u0647]]\n[[tr:He (harf)]]\n", "name_user": "164.215.175.39", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(h at Persian)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_(letter)"}

The feed is employed mostly for [[cattle]] feeding, but is also used for [[pig]]s and [[poultry]].{{Sfn |Heuz\u00e9 |Tran |Sauvant |Lessire |2020}} However, natural rapeseed oil contains 50% [[erucic acid]] and high levels of [[glucosinolates]] that significantly lowers the nutritional value of rapeseed press cakes for animal feed.{{Sfn|Potts|Rakow|Males|1999}}\n\n=== Vegetable oil ===\nRapeseed oil is one of the oldest known vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to [[cardiac muscle]] of animals, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed.{{Sfn|O'Brien|2008|pp=37-40}} Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid.{{Sfn|Sahasrabudhe|1977|p=323}} Food-grade canola oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, also known as rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil, has been [[generally recognized as safe]] by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} and 5% in the EU,{{Sfn|EC|1980}} with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human [[infants]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}}{{Sfn|EC|1980}}\n\n=== Biodiesel ===\nRapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as [[biodiesel]], straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower [[Gel point (petroleum)|gel point]] than most other vegetable oils.\n\n=== Other ===\nRapeseed is also used as a [[cover crop]] in the US during the winter as it prevents [[soil erosion]], produces large amounts of [[biomass]], suppresses weeds and can improve soil [[tilth]] with its root system. Some cultivars of rapeseed are also used as annual forage and are ready for grazing livestock 80 to 90 days after planting.{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}}\n\nRapeseed has a high [[Melliferous flower|melliferous]] potential and is a main forage crop for [[honeybees]].{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} Monofloral rapeseed honey has a whitish or milky yellow color, peppery taste and, due to its fast crystallization time, a soft-solid texture. It crystallizes within 3 to 4 weeks and can ferment over time if stored improperly.{{Sfn|Lixandru|2017}} The low fructose-to-glucose ratio in [[Monofloral honey|monofloral rapeseed honey]] causes it to quickly granulate in the [[honeycomb]], forcing beekeepers to extract the honey within 24 hours of it being capped.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\nAs a [[Lubricant#Biolubricant|biolubricant]], rapeseed has possible uses for bio-medical applications (e.g., lubricants for artificial joints) and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes.{{Sfn|Salimon|Salih|Yousif|2010}} Biolubricant containing 70% or more canola/rapeseed oil has replaced petroleum-based chainsaw oil in Austria although they are typically more expensive.{{Sfn|Garrett|1998}}\n\nRapeseed has been researched as a means of containing [[radionuclide]]s that contaminated the soil after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}{{Sfn|RIA Novosti|2010}}{{Sfn|Walker|2010}} as it has a rate of uptake up to three times more than other grains, and only about 3 to 6% of the radionuclides go into the oilseeds.{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}\n\nRapeseed meal is mostly used as a soil fertilizer rather than for animal feed in [[China]].{{Sfn|Bonjean|Dequidt|Sang|Limagrain|2016}}\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Champ de colza C\u00f4te-d'Or Bourgogne avril 2014.jpg|thumb|Field of rapeseed]]\n\nCrops from the genus ''Brassica'', including rapeseed, were among the earliest plants to be widely cultivated by mankind as early as 10,000 years ago. Rapeseed was being cultivated in India as early as 4000 B.C. and it spread to China and Japan 2000 years ago.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|pp=54-56}}\n\nOilseed rape is predominantly cultivated in its winter form in most of Europe and Asia due to the requirement of [[vernalization]] to start the process of flowering. It is sown in autumn and remains in a [[Rosette (botany)|leaf rosette]] on the soil surface during the winter. The plant grows a long vertical stem in the next spring followed by lateral branch development. It generally flowers in late spring with the process of pod development and ripening occurring over a period of 6\u20138 weeks until [[midsummer]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|pp=54-56}}\n\nIn Europe, winter rape is grown as an annual break crop in three to four year rotations with cereals such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]], and break crops such as [[peas]] and [[beans]]. This is done to reduce the possibility of pests and diseases being carried over from one crop to another. Winter rape is less susceptible to [[crop failure]] as it is more vigorous than the summer variety and can compensate for damage done by pests.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|pp=1-4}}\n\nSpring rapeseed is cultivated in Canada, northern Europe and Australia as it is not winter-hardy and does not require vernalization. The crop is sown in spring with stem development happening immediately after [[germination]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|pp=54-56}}\n\nRapeseed can be cultivated on a wide variety of well-drained soils, prefers a [[pH]] between 5.5 and 8.3 and has a moderate tolerance of [[soil salinity]].{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}} It is predominantly a [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] plant but shows significantly increased grain yields when [[Honey bee#Pollination|bee-pollinated]],{{Sfn|Chamb\u00f3|De Oliveira|Garcia|Duarte-J\u00fanior|2014}} almost double the final yield{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} but the effect is cultivar-dependent.{{Sfn|Lindstr\u00f6m|Herbertsson|Rundl\u00f6f|Smith|2015}} It is currently grown with high levels of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and the manufacture of these generates [[Nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]]. An estimated 3-5% of nitrogen provided as fertilizer for rapeseed is converted to N<sub>2</sub>O.{{Sfn|Lewis Jr.|2007}}\n\n== Diseases and pests==\nThe main diseases of the winter rapeseed crop are ''[[canker]]'', ''[[Pyrenopeziza brassicae|light leaf spot]]'', ''[[alternaria]]'' and ''[[sclerotinia]] stem rot''. Canker causes [[leaf spot]]ting, and premature ripening and weakening of the stem during the autumn-winter period. A conazole or [[triazole]] [[fungicide]] treatment is required in late autumn and in spring against ''canker'' while broad-spectrum fungicides are used during the spring-summer period for alternaria and sclerotinia control. Oilseed rape cannot be planted in close rotation with itself due to soil-borne diseases such as ''sclerotinia'', ''[[verticillium wilt]]'' and [[clubroot]].{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n=== Pests ===\nOilseed rape is attacked by a wide variety of insects, [[nematodes]], [[slugs]] as well as [[Wood-Pigeon|wood pigeons]]. The ''[[brassica pod midge]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus assimilis|cabbage seed weevil]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus|cabbage stem weevil]]'', ''[[Psylliodes chrysocephala|cabbage stem flea beetle]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus napi|rape stem weevil]]'' and ''[[pollen beetles]]'' are the primary insect pests that prey on the oilseed rape crop in Europe. The insect pests can feed on developing pods to lay eggs inside and eat the developing seeds, bore into the plant's stem and feed on pollen, leaves and flowers. Synthetic [[pyrethroid]] [[insecticides]] are the main attack vector against insect pests though there is a large-scale use of [[prophylactic]] insecticides in many countries. [[Molluscicide]] pellets are used either before or after sowing of the rapeseed crop to protect against slugs.{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n== History of the cultivars ==\nIn 1973, Canadian [[Agricultural science|agricultural scientists]]  launched a marketing campaign to promote [[canola]] consumption.{{Sfn|Thiyam-Holl\u00e4nder|Eskin|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=4}} Seed, oil and protein meal derived from rapeseed cultivars which is low in erucic acid and low in glucosinolates was originally registered as a trademark, in 1978, of the Canola Council of Canada, as \"canola\".{{Sfn|Mag|1983|p=380}}{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}} This is now a generic term for edible varieties of rapeseed but is still officially defined in Canada as rapeseed oil that \"must contain less than 2% erucic acid and less than 30 \u00b5mol of glucosinolates per gram of air-dried oil-free meal.\"{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}}{{Sfn|CFIA|2017}}\n\nFollowing the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] [[Transport Biofuels Directive 2003|Transport Biofuels Directive]] in 2003 promoting the use of biofuels, the cultivation of winter rapeseed increased dramatically in Europe.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\n[[Bayer Cropscience]], in collaboration with [[BGI-Shenzhen]], China, Keygene N.V., the Netherlands, and the University of Queensland, Australia, announced it had sequenced the entire genome of ''B. napus'' and its constituent genomes present in ''B. rapa'' and ''B. oleracea'' in 2009. The \"A\" genome component of the amphidiploid rapeseed species ''B. napus'' is currently being sequenced by the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=The www.brassica.info website for the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project\n | url=http://www.brassica.info\n}}</ref>{{Update after|2010|11|16}}\n\nA [[genetically modified]]-for-[[glyphosate]]-tolerance variety of rapeseed which was developed in 1998 is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola. By 2009, 90% of the rapeseed crops planted in Canada were of this sort,{{Sfn|Beckie |Harker |L\u00e9g\u00e8re |Morrison |2011|p=43}} adoption of which, however, has not been free of controversy. \n\n=== GMO controversy ===\n{{Main|Roundup Ready Canola}}\n\nThe [[Monsanto]] company [[genetically engineered]] new cultivars of rapeseed to be resistant to the effects of its [[herbicide]], [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]. In 1998, they brought this to the Canadian market. Monsanto sought compensation from farmers found to have crops of this cultivar in their fields without paying a license fee. However, these farmers claimed that the pollen containing the ''Roundup Ready'' gene was blown into their fields and crossed with unaltered canola. Other farmers claimed that after spraying Roundup in non-canola fields to kill weeds before planting, ''Roundup Ready'' [[Volunteer (botany)|volunteers]] were left behind, causing extra expense to rid their fields of the weeds.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\nIn a closely followed legal battle, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found in favor of Monsanto's [[patent infringement]] claim for unlicensed growing of ''Roundup Ready'' in its 2004 ruling on ''[[Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser]]'', but also ruled that Schmeiser was not required to pay any damages. The case garnered international controversy, as a court-sanctioned legitimization for the global patent protection of [[genetically modified crops]]. In March 2008, an [[out-of-court settlement]] between Monsanto and Schmeiser agreed that Monsanto would clean up the entire GMO-canola crop on Schmeiser's farm, at a cost of about CAD $660.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\n==Production==\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] reports global production of 36 million tons of rapeseed in the 2003\u20132004 season, and an estimated 58.4 million tons in the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |title=Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade |accessdate=17 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208134100/http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWorldwide production of rapeseed (including canola) has increased sixfold between 1975 and 2007. The production of canola and rapeseed since 1975 has opened up the edible oil market for rapeseed oil. Since 2002, production of biodiesel has been steadily increasing in EU and USA to 6 million metric tons in 2006. Rapeseed oil is positioned to supply a good portion of the vegetable oils needed to produce that fuel. World production was thus expected to trend further upward between 2005 and 2015 as biodiesel content requirements in Europe go into effect.<ref>Canola, Growing Great 2016, The Canola Council of Canada, 2007, page 3, 10</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Top rapeseed producers in millions of [[tonnes]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/form?collection=Production.Crops.Primary&Domain=Production&servlet=1&hasbulk=0&version=ext&language=EN FAOSTAT].

'''[[Canola]]''' are a group of ''rapeseed'' [[cultivar]]s which were bred to have very low levels of [[erucic acid]] and are especially prized for use for human and animal food. ''Rapeseed'' is the third-largest source of [[vegetable oil]] and second-largest source of protein meal in the world.\n\n== Etymology and taxonomy ==\nThe term \"rape\" derives from the Latin word for [[turnip]], ''rapa'' or ''rapum'', cognate with the Greek word ''rhapys''.{{Sfn|OED|2016}}\n\nThe [[species]] ''Brassica napus'' belongs to the flowering plant family [[Brassicaceae]]. Rapeseed is a [[subspecies]] with the [[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]  ''B. napus ''subsp.'' napus''.{{Sfn|GRIN|2012a}} It encompasses winter and spring oilseed, vegetable and fodder rape.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}} Siberian kale is a distinct leaf rape form [[Variety (botany)|variety]] (''B. napus ''var.'' pabularia'') which used to be common as a winter-annual vegetable.{{Sfn|GRIN|2010b}}{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|p=54}} The second subspecies of ''B. napus'' is [[rutabaga|''B. napus ''subsp.'' rapifera'']] (also subsp. ''napobrassica''; the rutabaga, swede, or yellow turnip).{{Sfn|GRIN|2012b}}{{Sfn|NCBI|2013}}\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Brassica napus 2.jpg|thumb|Rapeseed blossoms]]\n\n''Brassica napus'' grows to {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}} height with [[pinnatifid]] and [[glaucous]] lower leaves{{Sfn|Martin|1965}}{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}}{{Sfn|Webb|Parnell|Doogue|1996}} and with the upper leaves clasping the stem. ''Brassica napus'' can be distinguished from ''[[Brassica nigra]]'' by the upper leaves which do not clasp the stem, and from ''[[Brassica rapa]]'' by its smaller petals which are less than {{convert|13|mm|abbr=on}} across.{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}}\n\nRapeseed flowers are yellow and about {{convert|17|mm|abbr=on}} across.{{Sfn|Parnell|Curtis|Webb|2012}} They are radial and consist of four [[petals]] in a typical cross-form, alternating with four [[sepals]]. They have indeterminate [[racemose]] flowering starting at the lowest bud and growing upward in the following days. The flowers have two lateral [[stamens]] with short filaments, and four median stamens with longer filaments whose anthers split away from the flower's center upon flowering.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|pp=54-56}}\n\nThe rapeseed pods are green and elongated [[Silique|siliquae]] during development that eventually ripen to brown. Each pod has two [[Locule|compartments]] separated by a inner central wall within which a row of oilseeds develop. The oilseeds are black and hard at maturity.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|pp=1-4}}\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Northern Ireland, U K ''B. napus'' and ''B. rapa'' are recorded as escapes in roadside verges and waste ground.{{Sfn|Beesley|Wilde|1997|p=104}}\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Rapeseed, roasted.jpg|thumb|Roasted canola seeds]]\n\nRapeseed is grown for the production of [[compound feed|animal feed]], edible [[vegetable oils]], and [[biodiesel]]. Rapeseed was the third-leading source of vegetable oil in the world in 2000, after [[soybean]] and [[palm oil]].{{Sfn|USDA|2002|p=26}} It is the world's second-leading source of [[protein]] meal after soybean.{{Sfn|Heuz\u00e9|Tran|Sauvant|Lessire|2020}}\n\n=== Animal feed ===\nProcessing of rapeseed for oil production produces rapeseed meal as a byproduct. The byproduct is a high-protein animal feed, competitive with soybean. The feed is employed mostly for [[cattle]] feeding, but is also used for [[pig]]s and [[poultry]].{{Sfn |Heuz\u00e9 |Tran |Sauvant |Lessire |2020}} However, natural rapeseed oil contains 50% [[erucic acid]] and high levels of [[glucosinolates]] that significantly lowers the nutritional value of rapeseed press cakes for animal feed.{{Sfn|Potts|Rakow|Males|1999}}\n\n=== Vegetable oil ===\nRapeseed oil is one of the oldest known vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to [[cardiac muscle]] of animals, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed.{{Sfn|O'Brien|2008|pp=37-40}} Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid.{{Sfn|Sahasrabudhe|1977|p=323}} Food-grade canola oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, also known as rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil, has been [[generally recognized as safe]] by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}} and 5% in the EU,{{Sfn|EC|1980}} with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human [[infants]].{{Sfn|USFDA|2010}}{{Sfn|EC|1980}}\n\n=== Biodiesel ===\nRapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as [[biodiesel]], straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower [[Gel point (petroleum)|gel point]] than most other vegetable oils.\n\n=== Other ===\nRapeseed is also used as a [[cover crop]] in the US during the winter as it prevents [[soil erosion]], produces large amounts of [[biomass]], suppresses weeds and can improve soil [[tilth]] with its root system. Some cultivars of rapeseed are also used as annual forage and are ready for grazing livestock 80 to 90 days after planting.{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}}\n\nRapeseed has a high [[Melliferous flower|melliferous]] potential and is a main forage crop for [[honeybees]].{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} Monofloral rapeseed honey has a whitish or milky yellow color, peppery taste and, due to its fast crystallization time, a soft-solid texture. It crystallizes within 3 to 4 weeks and can ferment over time if stored improperly.{{Sfn|Lixandru|2017}} The low fructose-to-glucose ratio in [[Monofloral honey|monofloral rapeseed honey]] causes it to quickly granulate in the [[honeycomb]], forcing beekeepers to extract the honey within 24 hours of it being capped.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\nAs a [[Lubricant#Biolubricant|biolubricant]], rapeseed has possible uses for bio-medical applications (e.g., lubricants for artificial joints) and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes.{{Sfn|Salimon|Salih|Yousif|2010}} Biolubricant containing 70% or more canola/rapeseed oil has replaced petroleum-based chainsaw oil in Austria although they are typically more expensive.{{Sfn|Garrett|1998}}\n\nRapeseed has been researched as a means of containing [[radionuclide]]s that contaminated the soil after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}{{Sfn|RIA Novosti|2010}}{{Sfn|Walker|2010}} as it has a rate of uptake up to three times more than other grains, and only about 3 to 6% of the radionuclides go into the oilseeds.{{Sfn|Smith|2004}}\n\nRapeseed meal is mostly used as a soil fertilizer rather than for animal feed in [[China]].{{Sfn|Bonjean|Dequidt|Sang|Limagrain|2016}}\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Champ de colza C\u00f4te-d'Or Bourgogne avril 2014.jpg|thumb|Field of rapeseed]]\n\nCrops from the genus ''Brassica'', including rapeseed, were among the earliest plants to be widely cultivated by mankind as early as 10,000 years ago. Rapeseed was being cultivated in India as early as 4000 B.C. and it spread to China and Japan 2000 years ago.{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|pp=54-56}}\n\nOilseed rape is predominantly cultivated in its winter form in most of Europe and Asia due to the requirement of [[vernalization]] to start the process of flowering. It is sown in autumn and remains in a [[Rosette (botany)|leaf rosette]] on the soil surface during the winter. The plant grows a long vertical stem in the next spring followed by lateral branch development. It generally flowers in late spring with the process of pod development and ripening occurring over a period of 6\u20138 weeks until [[midsummer]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|pp=54-56}}\n\nIn Europe, winter rape is grown as an annual break crop in three to four year rotations with cereals such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]], and break crops such as [[peas]] and [[beans]]. This is done to reduce the possibility of pests and diseases being carried over from one crop to another. Winter rape is less susceptible to [[crop failure]] as it is more vigorous than the summer variety and can compensate for damage done by pests.{{Sfn|Alford|2008|pp=1-4}}\n\nSpring rapeseed is cultivated in Canada, northern Europe and Australia as it is not winter-hardy and does not require vernalization. The crop is sown in spring with stem development happening immediately after [[germination]].{{Sfn|Snowdon|L\u00fchs|Friedt|2006|pp=54-56}}\n\nRapeseed can be cultivated on a wide variety of well-drained soils, prefers a [[pH]] between 5.5 and 8.3 and has a moderate tolerance of [[soil salinity]].{{Sfn|AgMRC|2018}} It is predominantly a [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] plant but shows significantly increased grain yields when [[Honey bee#Pollination|bee-pollinated]],{{Sfn|Chamb\u00f3|De Oliveira|Garcia|Duarte-J\u00fanior|2014}} almost double the final yield{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}} but the effect is cultivar-dependent.{{Sfn|Lindstr\u00f6m|Herbertsson|Rundl\u00f6f|Smith|2015}} It is currently grown with high levels of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and the manufacture of these generates [[Nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]]. An estimated 3-5% of nitrogen provided as fertilizer for rapeseed is converted to N<sub>2</sub>O.{{Sfn|Lewis Jr.|2007}}\n\n== Diseases and pests==\nThe main diseases of the winter rapeseed crop are ''[[canker]]'', ''[[Pyrenopeziza brassicae|light leaf spot]]'', ''[[alternaria]]'' and ''[[sclerotinia]] stem rot''. Canker causes [[leaf spot]]ting, and premature ripening and weakening of the stem during the autumn-winter period. A conazole or [[triazole]] [[fungicide]] treatment is required in late autumn and in spring against ''canker'' while broad-spectrum fungicides are used during the spring-summer period for alternaria and sclerotinia control. Oilseed rape cannot be planted in close rotation with itself due to soil-borne diseases such as ''sclerotinia'', ''[[verticillium wilt]]'' and [[clubroot]].{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n=== Pests ===\nOilseed rape is attacked by a wide variety of insects, [[nematodes]], [[slugs]] as well as [[Wood-Pigeon|wood pigeons]]. The ''[[brassica pod midge]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus assimilis|cabbage seed weevil]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus|cabbage stem weevil]]'', ''[[Psylliodes chrysocephala|cabbage stem flea beetle]]'', ''[[Ceutorhynchus napi|rape stem weevil]]'' and ''[[pollen beetles]]'' are the primary insect pests that prey on the oilseed rape crop in Europe. The insect pests can feed on developing pods to lay eggs inside and eat the developing seeds, bore into the plant's stem and feed on pollen, leaves and flowers. Synthetic [[pyrethroid]] [[insecticides]] are the main attack vector against insect pests though there is a large-scale use of [[prophylactic]] insecticides in many countries. [[Molluscicide]] pellets are used either before or after sowing of the rapeseed crop to protect against slugs.{{Sfn|Alford|2008}}\n\n== History of the cultivars ==\nIn 1973, Canadian [[Agricultural science|agricultural scientists]]  launched a marketing campaign to promote [[canola]] consumption.{{Sfn|Thiyam-Holl\u00e4nder|Eskin|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=4}} Seed, oil and protein meal derived from rapeseed cultivars which is low in erucic acid and low in glucosinolates was originally registered as a trademark, in 1978, of the Canola Council of Canada, as \"canola\".{{Sfn|Mag|1983|p=380}}{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}} This is now a generic term for edible varieties of rapeseed but is still officially defined in Canada as rapeseed oil that \"must contain less than 2% erucic acid and less than 30 \u00b5mol of glucosinolates per gram of air-dried oil-free meal.\"{{Sfn|Roch\u00e9|2015|p=5}}{{Sfn|CFIA|2017}}\n\nFollowing the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] [[Transport Biofuels Directive 2003|Transport Biofuels Directive]] in 2003 promoting the use of biofuels, the cultivation of winter rapeseed increased dramatically in Europe.{{Sfn|Bertazzini|Forlani|2016}}\n\n[[Bayer Cropscience]], in collaboration with [[BGI-Shenzhen]], China, Keygene N.V., the Netherlands, and the University of Queensland, Australia, announced it had sequenced the entire genome of ''B. napus'' and its constituent genomes present in ''B. rapa'' and ''B. oleracea'' in 2009. The \"A\" genome component of the amphidiploid rapeseed species ''B. napus'' is currently being sequenced by the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=The www.brassica.info website for the Multinational ''Brassica'' Genome Project\n | url=http://www.brassica.info\n}}</ref>{{Update after|2010|11|16}}\n\nA [[genetically modified]]-for-[[glyphosate]]-tolerance variety of rapeseed which was developed in 1998 is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola. By 2009, 90% of the rapeseed crops planted in Canada were of this sort,{{Sfn|Beckie |Harker |L\u00e9g\u00e8re |Morrison |2011|p=43}} adoption of which, however, has not been free of controversy. \n\n=== GMO controversy ===\n{{Main|Roundup Ready Canola}}\n\nThe [[Monsanto]] company [[genetically engineered]] new cultivars of rapeseed to be resistant to the effects of its [[herbicide]], [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]. In 1998, they brought this to the Canadian market. Monsanto sought compensation from farmers found to have crops of this cultivar in their fields without paying a license fee. However, these farmers claimed that the pollen containing the ''Roundup Ready'' gene was blown into their fields and crossed with unaltered canola. Other farmers claimed that after spraying Roundup in non-canola fields to kill weeds before planting, ''Roundup Ready'' [[Volunteer (botany)|volunteers]] were left behind, causing extra expense to rid their fields of the weeds.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\nIn a closely followed legal battle, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found in favor of Monsanto's [[patent infringement]] claim for unlicensed growing of ''Roundup Ready'' in its 2004 ruling on ''[[Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser]]'', but also ruled that Schmeiser was not required to pay any damages. The case garnered international controversy, as a court-sanctioned legitimization for the global patent protection of [[genetically modified crops]]. In March 2008, an [[out-of-court settlement]] between Monsanto and Schmeiser agreed that Monsanto would clean up the entire GMO-canola crop on Schmeiser's farm, at a cost of about CAD $660.{{Sfn|Hartley|2008}}\n\n==Production==\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] reports global production of 36 million tons of rapeseed in the 2003\u20132004 season, and an estimated 58.4 million tons in the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |title=Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade |accessdate=17 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208134100/http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWorldwide production of rapeseed (including canola) has increased sixfold between 1975 and 2007. The production of canola and rapeseed since 1975 has opened up the edible oil market for rapeseed oil. Since 2002, production of biodiesel has been steadily increasing in EU and USA to 6 million metric tons in 2006. Rapeseed oil is positioned to supply a good portion of the vegetable oils needed to produce that fuel. World production was thus expected to trend further upward between 2005 and 2015 as biodiesel content requirements in Europe go into effect.<ref>Canola, Growing Great 2016, The Canola Council of Canada, 2007, page 3, 10</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Top rapeseed producers in millions of [[tonnes]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/form?collection=Production.Crops.Primary&Domain=Production&servlet=1&hasbulk=0&version=ext&language=EN FAOSTAT].

Both of these fields are closely connected, since both are concerned with the interactions of [[neurotransmitters]], [[neuropeptides]], [[neurohormones]], [[neuromodulators]], [[enzymes]], [[second messengers]], [[co-transporters]], [[ion channels]], and [[receptor proteins]] in the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s. Studying these interactions, researchers are developing drugs to treat many different neurological disorders, including [[pain]], neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], psychological disorders, addiction, and many others.\n\n==History==\nNeuropharmacology did not appear in the scientific field until, in the early part of the 20th century, scientists were able to figure\nout a basic understanding of the nervous system and how nerves communicate between one another. Before this discovery, there were drugs that had been found that demonstrated some type of influence on the nervous system. In the 1930s, French scientists began working with a compound called phenothiazine in the hope of synthesizing a drug that would be able to combat malaria. Though this drug showed very little hope in the use against malaria-infected individuals, it was found to have sedative effects along with what appeared to be beneficial effects toward patients with Parkinson's disease. This black box method, wherein an investigator would administer a drug and examine the response without knowing how to relate drug action to patient response, was the main approach to this field, until, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, scientists were able to identify specific neurotransmitters, such as [[norepinephrine]] (involved in the constriction of blood vessels and the increase in heart rate and blood pressure), [[dopamine]] (the chemical whose shortage is involved in Parkinson's disease), and [[serotonin]] (soon to be recognized as deeply connected to depression{{Citation needed}}).

These two major historical events in neuropharmacology allowed scientists not only to study how information is transferred from one neuron to another but also to study how a neuron processes this information within itself.\n\n==Overview==\nNeuropharmacology is a very broad region of science that encompasses many aspects of the nervous system from single neuron manipulation to entire areas of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. To better understand the basis behind drug development, one must first understand how neurons communicate with one another.\n\n==Neurochemical interactions==\n[[Image:Neuron.svg|frame|Labeling of different parts of a neuron]]\nTo understand the potential advances in medicine that neuropharmacology can bring, it is important to understand how human behavior and thought processes are transferred from neuron to neuron and how medications can alter the chemical foundations of these processes.\n\nNeurons are known as excitable cells because on its surface membrane there are an abundance of proteins known as ion-channels that allow small charged particles to pass in and out of the cell. The structure of the neuron allows chemical information to be received by its [[dendrites]], propagated through the [[perikaryon]] (cell body) and down its [[axon]], and eventually passing on to other neurons through its [[axon terminal]]. These [[voltage-gated ion channels]] allow for rapid [[depolarization]] throughout the cell. This depolarization, if it reaches a certain threshold, will cause an [[action potential]]. Once the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it will cause an influx of calcium ions into the cell. The calcium ions will then cause vesicles, small packets filled with [[neurotransmitters]], to bind to the cell membrane and release its contents into the synapse. This cell is known as the pre-synaptic neuron, and the cell that interacts with the neurotransmitters released is known as the post-synaptic neuron. Once the neurotransmitter is released into the synapse, it can either bind to receptors on the post-synaptic cell, the pre-synaptic cell can re-uptake it and save it for later transmission, or it can be broken down by enzymes in the synapse specific to that certain neurotransmitter. These three different actions are major areas where drug action can affect communication between neurons.<ref name=\"Science\" />\n\nThere are two types of receptors that neurotransmitters interact with on a post-synaptic neuron. The first types of receptors are ligand-gated ion channels or LGICs. LGIC receptors are the fastest types of transduction from chemical signal to electrical signal. Once the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, it will cause a conformational change that will allow ions to directly flow into the cell. The second types are known as G-protein-coupled receptors or GPCRs. These are much slower than LGICs due to an increase in the amount of biochemical reactions that must take place intracellularly. Once the neurotransmitter binds to the GPCR protein, it causes a cascade of intracellular interactions that can lead to many different types of changes in cellular biochemistry, physiology, and gene expression. Neurotransmitter/receptor interactions in the field of neuropharmacology are extremely important because many drugs that are developed today have to do with disrupting this binding process.<ref name=\"Alcohol\">{{cite journal | author = Lovinger, D.

There are a few technical words that must be defined when relating neurotransmission to receptor action:\n# Agonist \u2013 a molecule that binds to a receptor protein and activates that receptor\n# Competitive antagonist \u2013 a molecule that binds to the same site on the receptor protein as the agonist, preventing activation of the receptor\n# Non-competitive antagonist \u2013 a molecule that binds to a receptor protein on a different site than that of the agonist, but causes a conformational change in the protein that does not allow activation.\nThe following neurotransmitter/receptor interactions can be affected by synthetic compounds that act as one of the three above. Sodium/potassium ion channels can also be manipulated throughout a neuron to induce inhibitory effects of action potentials.\n\n===GABA===\nThe GABA neurotransmitter mediates the fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system. When GABA is released from its pre-synaptic cell, it will bind to a receptor (most likely the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor) that causes the post-synaptic cell to hyperpolarize (stay below its action potential threshold). This will counteract the effect of any excitatory manipulation from other neurotransmitter/receptor interactions.\n\nThis GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor contains many binding sites that allow conformational changes and are the primary target for drug development. The most common of these binding sites, benzodiazepine, allows for both agonist and antagonist effects on the receptor. A common drug, [[diazepam]], acts as an allosteric enhancer at this binding site.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2174/1568026023393444 | last1 = Sigel | first1 = E | title = Mapping of the benzodiazepine recognition site on GABA(A) receptors | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = 833\u20139 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12171574}}</ref> Another receptor for GABA, known as GABA<sub>B</sub>, can be enhanced by a molecule called baclofen. This molecule acts as an agonist, therefore activating the receptor, and is known to help control and decrease spastic movement.\n\n===Dopamine===\nThe [[dopamine]] neurotransmitter mediates synaptic transmission by binding to five specific GPCRs. These five receptor proteins are separated into two classes due to whether the response elicits an excitatory or inhibitory response on the post-synaptic cell. There are many types of drugs, legal and illegal, that effect dopamine and its interactions in the brain. With Parkinson's disease, a disease that decreases the amount of dopamine in the brain, the dopamine precursor Levodopa is given to the patient due to the fact that dopamine cannot cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] and L-dopa can. Some dopamine agonists are also given to Parkinson's patients that have a disorder known as restless leg syndrome or RLS. Some examples of these are [[ropinirole]] and [[pramipexole]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Winkelman | first1 = JW | last2 = Allen | first2 = RP | last3 = Tenzer | first3 = P | last4 = Hening | first4 = W | title = Restless legs syndrome: nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments | journal = Geriatrics | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 13\u20136 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922563}}</ref>\n\nPsychological disorders like that of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) can be treated with drugs like [[methylphenidate]] (also known as [[Ritalin]]), which block the re-uptake of dopamine by the pre-synaptic cell, thereby providing an increase of dopamine left in the synaptic gap. This increase in synaptic dopamine will increase binding to receptors of the post-synaptic cell. This same mechanism is also used by other illegal and more potent stimulant drugs such as [[cocaine]].\n\n===Serotonin===\nThe neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] has the ability to mediate synaptic transmission through either GPCR's or LGIC receptors. The excitatory or inhibitory post-synaptic effects of serotonin are determined by the type of receptor expressed in a given brain region. The most popular and widely used drugs for the regulation of serotonin during depression are known as SSRIs or [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]]. These drugs inhibit the transport of serotonin back into the pre-synaptic neuron, leaving more serotonin in the synaptic gap.\n\nBefore the discovery of SSRIs, there were also drugs that inhibited the enzyme that breaks down serotonin. MAOIs or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] increased the amount of serotonin in the synapse, but had many side-effects including intense migraines and high blood pressure. This was eventually linked to the drugs interacting with a common chemical known as [[tyramine]] found in many types of food.<ref>{{Cite journal| pmid = 19442174| year = 2009| last1 = L\u00f3pez-Mu\u00f1oz | first1 = F.| last2 = Alamo | first2 = C.| title = Monoaminergic neurotransmission: the history of the discovery of antidepressants from 1950s until today| volume = 15| issue = 14| pages = 1563\u20131586| journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design| doi = 10.2174/138161209788168001}}</ref>\n\n===Ion channels===\nIon channels located on the surface membrane of the neuron allows for an influx of sodium ions and outward movement of potassium ions during an action potential. Selectively blocking these ion channels will decrease the likelihood of an action potential to occur. The drug [[riluzole]] is a neuroprotective drug that blocks sodium ion channels. Since these channels cannot activate, there is no action potential, and the neuron does not perform any transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals and the signal does not move on.

Most research has shown that the major part of the brain that reinforces addiction through neurochemical reward is the [[nucleus accumbens]]. The image to the right shows how dopamine is projected into this area. Chronic alcohol abuse can cause [[drug dependence|dependence]] and [[addiction]]. How this addiction occurs is described below.\n\n===Ethanol===\n\nAlcohol's rewarding and reinforcing (i.e., [[addictive]]) properties are mediated through its effects on [[dopamine]] neurons in the [[mesolimbic reward pathway]], which connects the [[ventral tegmental area]] to the [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAcc).<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\">{{cite web|title=Alcoholism \u2013 Homo sapiens (human) Database entry|url=http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?hsa05034|website=KEGG Pathway|accessdate=9 February 2015|date=29 October 2014|quote =  As one of the primary mediators of the rewarding effects of alcohol, dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been identified. Acute exposure to alcohol stimulates dopamine release into the NAc, which activates D1 receptors, stimulating PKA signaling and subsequent CREB-mediated gene expression,  whereas chronic alcohol exposure leads to an adaptive downregulation of this pathway, in particular of CREB function. The decreased CREB function in the NAc may promote the intake of drugs of abuse to achieve an increase in reward and thus may be involved in the regulation of positive affective states of addiction. PKA signaling also affects NMDA receptor activity and may  play an important role in neuroadaptation in response to chronic alcohol exposure.}}</ref><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\">{{cite web | title=Alcoholism \u2013 Homo sapiens (human) | url=http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05034+2354 | work=KEGG Pathway | accessdate=31 October 2014 | author=Kanehisa Laboratories | date=29 October 2014}}</ref> One of alcohol's primary effects is the allosteric inhibition of [[NMDA receptor]]s and facilitation of [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]]s (e.g., enhanced GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated [[chloride]] flux through [[allosteric regulation]] of the receptor).<ref name=\"NHM-Ethanol\">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = 372 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote= Despite the high concentrations required for its psychoactive effects, ethanol exerts specific actions on the brain. The initial effects of ethanol result primarily from facilitation of GABAA receptors and inhibition of NMDA glutamate receptors. At higher doses, ethanol also inhibits the functioning of most ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. It is not known whether ethanol selectively affects these channels via direct low affinity binding or via nonspecific disruption of plasma membranes which then selectively influences these highly complex, multimeric, transmembrane proteins. Ethanol allosterically regulates the GABAA receptor to enhance GABA-activated Cl\u2212 flux. The anxiolytic and sedative effects of ethanol, as well as those of barbiturates and benzodiazepines, result from enhancement of GABAergic function. Facilitation of GABAA receptor function is also believed to contribute to the reinforcing effects of these drugs. Not all GABAA receptors are ethanol sensitive.&nbsp;... Ethanol also acts as an NMDA antagonist by allosterically inhibiting the passage of glutamate-activated Na+ and Ca2+ currents through the NMDA receptor.&nbsp;... The reinforcing effects of ethanol are partly explained by its ability to activate mesolimbic dopamine circuitry, although it is not known whether this effect is mediated at the level of the VTA or NAc. It also is not known whether this activation of dopamine systems is caused primarily by facilitation of GABAA receptors or inhibition of NMDA receptors, or both. Ethanol reinforcement also is mediated in part by ethanol-induced release of endogenous opioid peptides within the mesolimbic dopamine system, although whether the VTA or NAc is the predominant site of such action is not yet known. Accordingly, the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone reduces ethanol self-administration in animals and is used with modest effect to treat alcoholism in humans. }}</ref> At high doses, ethanol inhibits most [[ligand gated ion channel]]s and [[voltage gated ion channel]]s in neurons as well.<ref name=\"NHM-Ethanol\" /> Alcohol inhibits [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pumps]] in the [[cerebellum]] and this is likely how it impairs cerebellar computation and body co-ordination.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Simulation of alcohol action upon a detailed Purkinje neuron model and a simpler surrogate model that runs >400 times faster |journal= BMC Neuroscience | volume=16 |issue=27 |pages=27 | date=April 2015 |doi=10.1186/s12868-015-0162-6 |pmid=25928094 |pmc=4417229 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/michael_forrest/the_neuroscience_reason_we_fall_over_when_drunk-155301|title=The neuroscience reason we fall over when drunk|last1=Forrest|first1=Michael|date=April 2015|website=Science 2.0|access-date=January 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith acute alcohol consumption, [[dopamine]] is released in the [[chemical synapse|synapses]] of the mesolimbic pathway, in turn heightening activation of postsynaptic [[dopamine receptor D1|D1 receptors]].<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\" /><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" /> The activation of these receptors triggers postsynaptic internal signaling events through [[protein kinase A]] which ultimately [[phosphorylate]] [[cAMP response element binding protein]] (CREB), inducing CREB-mediated changes in [[gene expression]].<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\" /><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" />\n\nWith chronic alcohol intake, consumption of ethanol similarly induces CREB phosphorylation through the D1 receptor pathway, but it also alters [[NMDA receptor]] function through phosphorylation mechanisms;<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\" /><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" /> an adaptive [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] of the D1 receptor pathway and CREB function occurs as well.<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\" /><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" />  Chronic consumption is also associated with an effect on CREB phosphorylation and function via postsynaptic NMDA receptor signaling cascades through a [[MAPK/ERK pathway]] and [[CAMK]]-mediated pathway.<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" />  These modifications to CREB function in the mesolimbic pathway [[inducible gene|induce expression]] (i.e., increase gene expression) of [[\u0394FosB]] in the {{abbr|NAcc|nucleus accumbens}},<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" /> where \u0394FosB is the \"master control protein\" that, when overexpressed in the NAcc, is [[necessary and sufficient]] for the development and maintenance of an addictive state (i.e., its overexpression in the nucleus accumbens produces and then directly modulates compulsive alcohol consumption).<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" /><ref name=\"What the \u0394FosB?\">{{cite journal | author = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (\u0394)FosB about? | journal = Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 428\u2013437 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25083822 | doi = 10.3109/00952990.2014.933840 | quote = <br />\u0394FosB as a therapeutic biomarker<br />The strong correlation between chronic drug exposure and \u0394FosB provides novel opportunities for targeted therapies in addiction (118), and suggests methods to analyze their efficacy (119).

It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker.

Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&nbsp;...<br /><br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a \u2018\u2018molecular switch\u2019\u2019 (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"Cellular basis\">{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ | title = Cellular basis of memory for addiction | journal = Dialogues Clin Neurosci | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 431\u2013443 |date=December 2013  | pmid = 24459410 | pmc = 3898681 | doi = | quote = DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF NUMEROUS PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS, AT ITS CORE, DRUG ADDICTION INVOLVES A BIOLOGICAL PROCESS: the ability of repeated exposure to a drug of abuse to induce changes in a vulnerable brain that drive the compulsive seeking and taking of drugs, and loss of control over drug use, that define a state of addiction.&nbsp;...

Before this discovery, there were drugs that had been found that demonstrated some type of influence on the nervous system. In the 1930s, French scientists began working with a compound called phenothiazine in the hope of synthesizing a drug that would be able to combat malaria. Though this drug showed very little hope in the use against malaria-infected individuals, it was found to have sedative effects along with what appeared to be beneficial effects toward patients with Parkinson's disease. This black box method, wherein an investigator would administer a drug and examine the response without knowing how to relate drug action to patient response, was the main approach to this field, until, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, scientists were able to identify specific neurotransmitters, such as [[norepinephrine]] (involved in the constriction of blood vessels and the increase in heart rate and blood pressure), [[dopamine]] (the chemical whose shortage is involved in Parkinson's disease), and [[serotonin]] (soon to be recognized as deeply connected to depression{{Citation needed}}).

Once the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it will cause an influx of calcium ions into the cell. The calcium ions will then cause vesicles, small packets filled with [[neurotransmitters]], to bind to the cell membrane and release its contents into the synapse. This cell is known as the pre-synaptic neuron, and the cell that interacts with the neurotransmitters released is known as the post-synaptic neuron. Once the neurotransmitter is released into the synapse, it can either bind to receptors on the post-synaptic cell, the pre-synaptic cell can re-uptake it and save it for later transmission, or it can be broken down by enzymes in the synapse specific to that certain neurotransmitter. These three different actions are major areas where drug action can affect communication between neurons.<ref name=\"Science\" />\n\nThere are two types of receptors that neurotransmitters interact with on a post-synaptic neuron. The first types of receptors are ligand-gated ion channels or LGICs. LGIC receptors are the fastest types of transduction from chemical signal to electrical signal. Once the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, it will cause a conformational change that will allow ions to directly flow into the cell. The second types are known as G-protein-coupled receptors or GPCRs. These are much slower than LGICs due to an increase in the amount of biochemical reactions that must take place intracellularly. Once the neurotransmitter binds to the GPCR protein, it causes a cascade of intracellular interactions that can lead to many different types of changes in cellular biochemistry, physiology, and gene expression. Neurotransmitter/receptor interactions in the field of neuropharmacology are extremely important because many drugs that are developed today have to do with disrupting this binding process.<ref name=\"Alcohol\">{{cite journal | author = Lovinger, D.

There are a few technical words that must be defined when relating neurotransmission to receptor action:\n# Agonist \u2013 a molecule that binds to a receptor protein and activates that receptor\n# Competitive antagonist \u2013 a molecule that binds to the same site on the receptor protein as the agonist, preventing activation of the receptor\n# Non-competitive antagonist \u2013 a molecule that binds to a receptor protein on a different site than that of the agonist, but causes a conformational change in the protein that does not allow activation.\nThe following neurotransmitter/receptor interactions can be affected by synthetic compounds that act as one of the three above. Sodium/potassium ion channels can also be manipulated throughout a neuron to induce inhibitory effects of action potentials.\n\n===GABA===\nThe GABA neurotransmitter mediates the fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system. When GABA is released from its pre-synaptic cell, it will bind to a receptor (most likely the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor) that causes the post-synaptic cell to hyperpolarize (stay below its action potential threshold). This will counteract the effect of any excitatory manipulation from other neurotransmitter/receptor interactions.\n\nThis GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor contains many binding sites that allow conformational changes and are the primary target for drug development. The most common of these binding sites, benzodiazepine, allows for both agonist and antagonist effects on the receptor. A common drug, [[diazepam]], acts as an allosteric enhancer at this binding site.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2174/1568026023393444 | last1 = Sigel | first1 = E | title = Mapping of the benzodiazepine recognition site on GABA(A) receptors | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = 833\u20139 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12171574}}</ref> Another receptor for GABA, known as GABA<sub>B</sub>, can be enhanced by a molecule called baclofen. This molecule acts as an agonist, therefore activating the receptor, and is known to help control and decrease spastic movement.\n\n===Dopamine===\nThe [[dopamine]] neurotransmitter mediates synaptic transmission by binding to five specific GPCRs. These five receptor proteins are separated into two classes due to whether the response elicits an excitatory or inhibitory response on the post-synaptic cell. There are many types of drugs, legal and illegal, that effect dopamine and its interactions in the brain. With Parkinson's disease, a disease that decreases the amount of dopamine in the brain, the dopamine precursor Levodopa is given to the patient due to the fact that dopamine cannot cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] and L-dopa can. Some dopamine agonists are also given to Parkinson's patients that have a disorder known as restless leg syndrome or RLS. Some examples of these are [[ropinirole]] and [[pramipexole]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Winkelman | first1 = JW | last2 = Allen | first2 = RP | last3 = Tenzer | first3 = P | last4 = Hening | first4 = W | title = Restless legs syndrome: nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments | journal = Geriatrics | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 13\u20136 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922563}}</ref>\n\nPsychological disorders like that of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) can be treated with drugs like [[methylphenidate]] (also known as [[Ritalin]]), which block the re-uptake of dopamine by the pre-synaptic cell, thereby providing an increase of dopamine left in the synaptic gap. This increase in synaptic dopamine will increase binding to receptors of the post-synaptic cell. This same mechanism is also used by other illegal and more potent stimulant drugs such as [[cocaine]].\n\n===Serotonin===\nThe neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] has the ability to mediate synaptic transmission through either GPCR's or LGIC receptors. The excitatory or inhibitory post-synaptic effects of serotonin are determined by the type of receptor expressed in a given brain region. The most popular and widely used drugs for the regulation of serotonin during depression are known as SSRIs or [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]]. These drugs inhibit the transport of serotonin back into the pre-synaptic neuron, leaving more serotonin in the synaptic gap.\n\nBefore the discovery of SSRIs, there were also drugs that inhibited the enzyme that breaks down serotonin. MAOIs or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] increased the amount of serotonin in the synapse, but had many side-effects including intense migraines and high blood pressure. This was eventually linked to the drugs interacting with a common chemical known as [[tyramine]] found in many types of food.<ref>{{Cite journal| pmid = 19442174| year = 2009| last1 = L\u00f3pez-Mu\u00f1oz | first1 = F.| last2 = Alamo | first2 = C.| title = Monoaminergic neurotransmission: the history of the discovery of antidepressants from 1950s until today| volume = 15| issue = 14| pages = 1563\u20131586| journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design| doi = 10.2174/138161209788168001}}</ref>\n\n===Ion channels===\nIon channels located on the surface membrane of the neuron allows for an influx of sodium ions and outward movement of potassium ions during an action potential. Selectively blocking these ion channels will decrease the likelihood of an action potential to occur. The drug [[riluzole]] is a neuroprotective drug that blocks sodium ion channels. Since these channels cannot activate, there is no action potential, and the neuron does not perform any transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals and the signal does not move on. This drug is used as an anesthetic as well as a sedative.<ref name=\"past\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Narahashi | first1 = T | title = Neuroreceptors and ion channels as the basis for drug action: past, present, and future | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 294 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201326 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10871290}}</ref>\n\n==Behavioral neuropharmacology==\n[[Image:Dopamine_and_serotonin_pathways.png|thumb|right|300px|Dopamine and serotonin pathway]]\nOne form of behavioral neuropharmacology focuses on the study of drug dependence and how drug addiction affects the human mind. Most research has shown that the major part of the brain that reinforces addiction through neurochemical reward is the [[nucleus accumbens]]. The image to the right shows how dopamine is projected into this area. Chronic alcohol abuse can cause [[drug dependence|dependence]] and [[addiction]]. How this addiction occurs is described below.\n\n===Ethanol===\n\nAlcohol's rewarding and reinforcing (i.e., [[addictive]]) properties are mediated through its effects on [[dopamine]] neurons in the [[mesolimbic reward pathway]], which connects the [[ventral tegmental area]] to the [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAcc).<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\">{{cite web|title=Alcoholism \u2013 Homo sapiens (human) Database entry|url=http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?hsa05034|website=KEGG Pathway|accessdate=9 February 2015|date=29 October 2014|quote =  As one of the primary mediators of the rewarding effects of alcohol, dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been identified. Acute exposure to alcohol stimulates dopamine release into the NAc, which activates D1 receptors, stimulating PKA signaling and subsequent CREB-mediated gene expression,  whereas chronic alcohol exposure leads to an adaptive downregulation of this pathway, in particular of CREB function. The decreased CREB function in the NAc may promote the intake of drugs of abuse to achieve an increase in reward and thus may be involved in the regulation of positive affective states of addiction. PKA signaling also affects NMDA receptor activity and may  play an important role in neuroadaptation in response to chronic alcohol exposure.}}</ref><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\">{{cite web | title=Alcoholism \u2013 Homo sapiens (human) | url=http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05034+2354 | work=KEGG Pathway | accessdate=31 October 2014 | author=Kanehisa Laboratories | date=29 October 2014}}</ref> One of alcohol's primary effects is the allosteric inhibition of [[NMDA receptor]]s and facilitation of [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]]s (e.g., enhanced GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated [[chloride]] flux through [[allosteric regulation]] of the receptor).<ref name=\"NHM-Ethanol\">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = 372 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote= Despite the high concentrations required for its psychoactive effects, ethanol exerts specific actions on the brain. The initial effects of ethanol result primarily from facilitation of GABAA receptors and inhibition of NMDA glutamate receptors. At higher doses, ethanol also inhibits the functioning of most ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. It is not known whether ethanol selectively affects these channels via direct low affinity binding or via nonspecific disruption of plasma membranes which then selectively influences these highly complex, multimeric, transmembrane proteins. Ethanol allosterically regulates the GABAA receptor to enhance GABA-activated Cl\u2212 flux. The anxiolytic and sedative effects of ethanol, as well as those of barbiturates and benzodiazepines, result from enhancement of GABAergic function. Facilitation of GABAA receptor function is also believed to contribute to the reinforcing effects of these drugs. Not all GABAA receptors are ethanol sensitive.&nbsp;... Ethanol also acts as an NMDA antagonist by allosterically inhibiting the passage of glutamate-activated Na+ and Ca2+ currents through the NMDA receptor.&nbsp;... The reinforcing effects of ethanol are partly explained by its ability to activate mesolimbic dopamine circuitry, although it is not known whether this effect is mediated at the level of the VTA or NAc. It also is not known whether this activation of dopamine systems is caused primarily by facilitation of GABAA receptors or inhibition of NMDA receptors, or both. Ethanol reinforcement also is mediated in part by ethanol-induced release of endogenous opioid peptides within the mesolimbic dopamine system, although whether the VTA or NAc is the predominant site of such action is not yet known. Accordingly, the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone reduces ethanol self-administration in animals and is used with modest effect to treat alcoholism in humans. }}</ref> At high doses, ethanol inhibits most [[ligand gated ion channel]]s and [[voltage gated ion channel]]s in neurons as well.<ref name=\"NHM-Ethanol\" /> Alcohol inhibits [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pumps]] in the [[cerebellum]] and this is likely how it impairs cerebellar computation and body co-ordination.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Simulation of alcohol action upon a detailed Purkinje neuron model and a simpler surrogate model that runs >400 times faster |journal= BMC Neuroscience | volume=16 |issue=27 |pages=27 | date=April 2015 |doi=10.1186/s12868-015-0162-6 |pmid=25928094 |pmc=4417229 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/michael_forrest/the_neuroscience_reason_we_fall_over_when_drunk-155301|title=The neuroscience reason we fall over when drunk|last1=Forrest|first1=Michael|date=April 2015|website=Science 2.0|access-date=January 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith acute alcohol consumption, [[dopamine]] is released in the [[chemical synapse|synapses]] of the mesolimbic pathway, in turn heightening activation of postsynaptic [[dopamine receptor D1|D1 receptors]].<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\" /><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" /> The activation of these receptors triggers postsynaptic internal signaling events through [[protein kinase A]] which ultimately [[phosphorylate]] [[cAMP response element binding protein]] (CREB), inducing CREB-mediated changes in [[gene expression]].<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\" /><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" />\n\nWith chronic alcohol intake, consumption of ethanol similarly induces CREB phosphorylation through the D1 receptor pathway, but it also alters [[NMDA receptor]] function through phosphorylation mechanisms;<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\" /><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" /> an adaptive [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] of the D1 receptor pathway and CREB function occurs as well.<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB DB entry\" /><ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" />  Chronic consumption is also associated with an effect on CREB phosphorylation and function via postsynaptic NMDA receptor signaling cascades through a [[MAPK/ERK pathway]] and [[CAMK]]-mediated pathway.<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" />  These modifications to CREB function in the mesolimbic pathway [[inducible gene|induce expression]] (i.e., increase gene expression) of [[\u0394FosB]] in the {{abbr|NAcc|nucleus accumbens}},<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" /> where \u0394FosB is the \"master control protein\" that, when overexpressed in the NAcc, is [[necessary and sufficient]] for the development and maintenance of an addictive state (i.e., its overexpression in the nucleus accumbens produces and then directly modulates compulsive alcohol consumption).<ref name=\"Alcoholism \u0394FosB\" /><ref name=\"What the \u0394FosB?\">{{cite journal | author = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (\u0394)FosB about? | journal = Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 428\u2013437 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25083822 | doi = 10.3109/00952990.2014.933840 | quote = <br />\u0394FosB as a therapeutic biomarker<br />The strong correlation between chronic drug exposure and \u0394FosB provides novel opportunities for targeted therapies in addiction (118), and suggests methods to analyze their efficacy (119).

It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker. If \u0394FosB detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure (and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance), then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker (Figure 2). Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&nbsp;...<br /><br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a \u2018\u2018molecular switch\u2019\u2019 (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"Cellular basis\">{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ | title = Cellular basis of memory for addiction | journal = Dialogues Clin Neurosci | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 431\u2013443 |date=December 2013  | pmid = 24459410 | pmc = 3898681 | doi = | quote = DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF NUMEROUS PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS, AT ITS CORE, DRUG ADDICTION INVOLVES A BIOLOGICAL PROCESS: the ability of repeated exposure to a drug of abuse to induce changes in a vulnerable brain that drive the compulsive seeking and taking of drugs, and loss of control over drug use, that define a state of addiction.&nbsp;...

Today, the most commonly used drug to combat this disease is levodopa or [[L-DOPA]]. This precursor to dopamine can penetrate through the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]], whereas the neurotransmitter dopamine cannot. There has been extensive research to determine whether L-dopa is a better treatment for Parkinson's disease rather than other dopamine agonists. Some believe that the long-term use of L-dopa will compromise neuroprotection and, thus, eventually lead to dopaminergic cell death. Though there has been no proof, [[in-vivo]] or [[in-vitro]], some still believe that the long-term use of dopamine agonists is better for the patient.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = J.

A personal RF safety monitor is typically worn either on the torso region of the body or handheld and is required by the [[occupational safety and health]] acts of many telecommunication companies.\n\nMost of the scientifically proven RF safety monitors are designed to measure the RF exposure as a percentage of the two most common international RF safety guidelines: International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection ([[ICNIRP]]) guidelines<ref>https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_ii/otm_ii_3.html</ref> and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).<ref>http://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/eameasurements.html</ref> The ICNIRP guidelines are also endorsed by the [[WHO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/peh-emf/meetings/en/Cape_Town_meet_report_12-01.pdf |title=WHO/ICNIRP Conference on EMF Biological Effects |publisher= World Health Organization |date=2001-12-10}}</ref> RF personal safety monitors were originally designed for [[RF Engineer]]s working in environments where they could be exposed to high levels of RF energy or be working close to a RF source, for example working at the top of a [[telecommunication tower]], or working on the rooftop of a building where transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s are present.

[[Wideband]] RF monitors can be used at a broader variety of [[base station]] sites than for example a [[narrowband]], cellular RF monitor which is designed only to be used in the [[mobile telephone]]- and [[data network]]s. IEEE Std C95.3 states that \"In the region between 1-100 GHz, resistive thermoelectric dipoles are used as sensors with a background of lossy material to reduce the effect of scattering from the body. Electrically short dipoles with diode detectors as sensors may cover a portion of this range\". The results of monitors which do not incorporate \"lossy material\" to reduce the effects of scattering, are questionable on the body. \n\nThe type of response is a basic feature of any RF personal monitor and can be expressed in two basic parameters:\n\n* Directivity: Some of them have an isotropic response, which means that they are able to measure RF fields from any space direction. Others, like radial field monitors, have a partial space coverage, and have to be worn in a specific way in order to provide a correct reading.\n* Frequency response:\n** Flat response: units that have a flat response for all the frequency range covered, i.e. the response does not change with frequency.\n** Shaped response: contain frequency dependent sensors that automatically weight the detected RF fields in accordance with frequency-dependent RF exposure limits.\n\nIt is common that RF personal monitors provide results as a percentage (%) of frequency-dependent limit values of a specific standard (sometimes called reference levels or MPE, maximum permissible exposure). It is important to be careful interpreting exposure during an alarm condition based on a % result; shaped response RF personal monitors will provide a result as a % of the standard, independently of the frequency, while flat response monitors will provide a result as a % of a particular value (not frequency-dependent), so it is important to know which is the particular value this % is referring to.\n\nSome RF personal monitors have different versions, shaped to each standard, so they will be more accurate, but can be used only for that standard. Others have a single version, so will be less accurate, but can be used for different standards.\n\nUsually, the alarm of most RF personal monitors is triggered by instant values, however, standard limits are specified as time-averaged values. Some RF monitors have the possibility to trigger alarms based on average values, which is a better indication of the real exposure situation (as an example, an instant value can be at 200% while the average being below 100%).\n\nAs they are typically small, portable units, they are usually equipped with only a few LEDs for a rough field level indication (50%, 100%, etc). Nevertheless, some of them have a datalogger that allows to download the measurements, check for the exact values, and keep a history record of the exposures.

And most of the monitors have different operating modes. For instance, the Narda Radman has a mode in which it can be body worn by the operator, but it also has a probe mode where the operator can scan certain areas to find accurate [[exclusion zone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.narda-sts.de/faq.html?qid=021|title=Radman - Measure and probe mode}}</ref>  The FieldSENSE on the other hand has a monitor and measure mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldsense.com/occupational.php|title=FieldSENSE - Measure and monitor mode}}</ref>  The measure mode is similar to the Radman\u2019s probe mode, but the monitor mode is used by mounting the FieldSENSE onto an inactive antenna and then it is safe to work on the antenna until the FieldSENSE raise an alarm to warn RF technicians that the antenna is live and that any work on the antennas should be ceased until deactivation is confirmed. The Wavecontrol\u2019s WaveMon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wavecontrol.com/rfsafety/en/products/personal-safety|title=WaveMon RF personal monitors|website=Wavecontrol}}</ref> and Narda's RadMan 2[29] can be body-worn, and used off the body as a probe or as a monitor. Most of the RF monitors such as the FieldSENSE, EME Guard, WaveMon and the RadMan 2 also have a data logging functionality that can log the RF exposure of a worker over time.<ref name=\"narda-sts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.narda-sts.us/pdf_files/DataSheets/Radman_DataSheet.pdf |title=Narda Safety Test Solutions |publisher=Narda-sts.us |date= |accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref><ref name=\"EME Guard\"/> The RadMan 2XT's RF detection mode with its tone search feature can locate leaks in waveguides and verify that an antenna is turned off.

This article concentrates on densitometers used in the [[telecommunication]] industry, which measure exposure to [[radio spectrum]] radiation. Other densitometers, like [[extremely low frequency]] densitometers which measure exposure to radiation from [[electric power]] lines, also exist. The major difference between a \"Densitometer\" and a \"Dosimeter\" is that a Dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose, which does not exist for RF Monitors. Monitors are also separated by \"RF Monitors\" that simply measure fields and \"RF Personal Monitors\" that are designed to function while mounted on the human body. \n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Unbiased Comparison of Available RF Personal Monitors.jpg|thumb|RF monitor comparison]] \nElectromagnetic field [[densitometers]], as used in the [[cellular phone]] industry, are referred as \"personal [[radio frequency|RF]] safety monitors\", personal protection monitors (PPM) or RF exposimeters.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8Lk2ghPl7IC&pg=PA1904&lpg=PA1904&dq=fcc+rf+monitors+ppm#v=onepage&q=fcc%20rf%20monitors%20ppm&f=false | title=National Association of Broadcasters Engineering Handbook| isbn=9780240807515| last1=Williams| first1=Edmund A.| last2=Jones| first2=Graham A.| last3=Layer| first3=David H.| last4=Osenkowsky| first4=Thomas G.| year=2007}}</ref> They form part of the [[personal protective equipment]] worn by a person working in areas exposed to [[radio spectrum]] radiation. A personal RF safety monitor is typically worn either on the torso region of the body or handheld and is required by the [[occupational safety and health]] acts of many telecommunication companies.\n\nMost of the scientifically proven RF safety monitors are designed to measure the RF exposure as a percentage of the two most common international RF safety guidelines: International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection ([[ICNIRP]]) guidelines<ref>https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_ii/otm_ii_3.html</ref> and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).<ref>http://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/eameasurements.html</ref> The ICNIRP guidelines are also endorsed by the [[WHO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/peh-emf/meetings/en/Cape_Town_meet_report_12-01.pdf |title=WHO/ICNIRP Conference on EMF Biological Effects |publisher= World Health Organization |date=2001-12-10}}</ref> RF personal safety monitors were originally designed for [[RF Engineer]]s working in environments where they could be exposed to high levels of RF energy or be working close to a RF source, for example working at the top of a [[telecommunication tower]], or working on the rooftop of a building where transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s are present.  Most international RF safety programs include the training and use of RF personal safety monitors and the IEEE C95.7 specifies what is a RF Personal Monitor.<ref name=\"RecommendedPractice\">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1611107&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1611107|title\"IEEE Recommended Practice for Radio Frequency Safety Programs, 3 kHz to 300 GHz,\" IEEE, International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety, New York, IEEE Std C95.7, 2014</ref>\n\nIn some cases the RF safety monitor comes in a version or mode for the general public.<ref name=\"fieldsense_a\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldsense.com/public.php |title=Public product info |publisher=FieldSENSE |date= |accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref> These meters can then be used to determine areas where the public might be exposed to high levels of RF energy or used to indicate the RF level in areas where the general public has access.\n\n==Specification==\nThe specifications of a RF monitor determines the work environment where could be applicable. [[Wideband]] RF monitors can be used at a broader variety of [[base station]] sites than for example a [[narrowband]], cellular RF monitor which is designed only to be used in the [[mobile telephone]]- and [[data network]]s. IEEE Std C95.3 states that \"In the region between 1-100 GHz, resistive thermoelectric dipoles are used as sensors with a background of lossy material to reduce the effect of scattering from the body. Electrically short dipoles with diode detectors as sensors may cover a portion of this range\". The results of monitors which do not incorporate \"lossy material\" to reduce the effects of scattering, are questionable on the body. \n\nThe type of response is a basic feature of any RF personal monitor and can be expressed in two basic parameters:\n\n* Directivity: Some of them have an isotropic response, which means that they are able to measure RF fields from any space direction. Others, like radial field monitors, have a partial space coverage, and have to be worn in a specific way in order to provide a correct reading.\n* Frequency response:\n** Flat response: units that have a flat response for all the frequency range covered, i.e. the response does not change with frequency.\n** Shaped response: contain frequency dependent sensors that automatically weight the detected RF fields in accordance with frequency-dependent RF exposure limits.\n\nIt is common that RF personal monitors provide results as a percentage (%) of frequency-dependent limit values of a specific standard (sometimes called reference levels or MPE, maximum permissible exposure). It is important to be careful interpreting exposure during an alarm condition based on a % result; shaped response RF personal monitors will provide a result as a % of the standard, independently of the frequency, while flat response monitors will provide a result as a % of a particular value (not frequency-dependent), so it is important to know which is the particular value this % is referring to.\n\nSome RF personal monitors have different versions, shaped to each standard, so they will be more accurate, but can be used only for that standard. Others have a single version, so will be less accurate, but can be used for different standards.\n\nUsually, the alarm of most RF personal monitors is triggered by instant values, however, standard limits are specified as time-averaged values. Some RF monitors have the possibility to trigger alarms based on average values, which is a better indication of the real exposure situation (as an example, an instant value can be at 200% while the average being below 100%).\n\nAs they are typically small, portable units, they are usually equipped with only a few LEDs for a rough field level indication (50%, 100%, etc). Nevertheless, some of them have a datalogger that allows to download the measurements, check for the exact values, and keep a history record of the exposures. Wavecontrol\u2019s WaveMon has available a GPS and altimeter to include position information to the data records.\n\nOther specifications that may be relevant, depending on the application are battery characteristics (lifetime, ways to change or recharge), dimensions, weight, and operating temperature.\n\nThe following table shows different basic specifications of some RF monitors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

And most of the monitors have different operating modes. For instance, the Narda Radman has a mode in which it can be body worn by the operator, but it also has a probe mode where the operator can scan certain areas to find accurate [[exclusion zone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.narda-sts.de/faq.html?qid=021|title=Radman - Measure and probe mode}}</ref>  The FieldSENSE on the other hand has a monitor and measure mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldsense.com/occupational.php|title=FieldSENSE - Measure and monitor mode}}</ref>  The measure mode is similar to the Radman\u2019s probe mode, but the monitor mode is used by mounting the FieldSENSE onto an inactive antenna and then it is safe to work on the antenna until the FieldSENSE raise an alarm to warn RF technicians that the antenna is live and that any work on the antennas should be ceased until deactivation is confirmed. The Wavecontrol\u2019s WaveMon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wavecontrol.com/rfsafety/en/products/personal-safety|title=WaveMon RF personal monitors|website=Wavecontrol}}</ref> and Narda's RadMan 2[29] can be body-worn, and used off the body as a probe or as a monitor. Most of the RF monitors such as the FieldSENSE, EME Guard, WaveMon and the RadMan 2 also have a data logging functionality that can log the RF exposure of a worker over time.<ref name=\"narda-sts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.narda-sts.us/pdf_files/DataSheets/Radman_DataSheet.pdf |title=Narda Safety Test Solutions |publisher=Narda-sts.us |date= |accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref><ref name=\"EME Guard\"/> The RadMan 2XT's RF detection mode with its tone search feature can locate leaks in waveguides and verify that an antenna is turned off.

In the image, Oswald holds a Carcano rifle in one hand, with markings which have been matched to the Carcano rifle that was found in the book depository and used in the assassination. Furthermore he holds two Marxist newspapers in the other hand: [[The Daily Worker|The Worker]], which followed closely a [[Soviet Union|Moscow]] party line (and up to being pro-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] until the death of Stalin), and [[The Militant]], a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] newspaper which followed an anti-Stalinist and anti-Moscow line.]]\n\nOn April 1, 1977, Jeanne de Mohrenschildt gave the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0078b.htm a print] of a photograph showing [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] standing in his Dallas backyard holding two newspapers and a rifle, and with a pistol on his hip \u2013 a photograph taken by Oswald's wife [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina]]. While similar to other prints which had been found among Oswald's effects on November 23, 1963, the existence of this particular print was previously unknown. On the back was written ''To my friend George from Lee Oswald'', and the date \"5/IV/63\" (5 April 1963).<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0079a.htm back of that print] at aarclibrary.org.

According to Mohrenschildt, the photograph was not found among his stored papers until he and his wife found it in February 1967. When analyzed by the HSCA in 1977, this photo turned out to be a first generation print of the backyard photo already known to the Warren Commission as \"CE-133A\" and which had probably been taken on March 31, 1963.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0077b.htm CE-133A]</ref>\n\n==Memoir==\n\nJeanne de Mohrenschildt also gave the [[HSCA]] committee a copy of a draft manuscript called ''I Am a Patsy! I Am a Patsy!'' which George de Mohrenschildt had completed in the summer of 1976 about his relationship with his \"dear, dead friend\" Oswald, wherein he said that the Oswald he knew was rarely ever violent and would not have been the sort of person to have killed John F. Kennedy. In part this judgment was based on Mohrenschildt's estimation of Oswald's political views and Kennedy's liberal ideas. Until 2014 the memoir had never been published as a stand-alone book, but the entire typescript was published as an appendix in the HSCA report.<ref name=\"aarclibrary.org\"/>\n\nThe primary focus of Mohrenschildt's text is a series of recollections about the brief time period between September 1962 and April 1963 that he and Jeanne were acquainted with the Oswalds. A secondary focus consists of a number of meditations on the corrosive effects knowing the Oswalds had on the professional and personal lives of the Mohrenschildts.  \"It must be acknowledged that our brief friendship with the Oswalds had strange and adverse effects on our lives.\"  Only in a tertiary sense is the manuscript concerned with Oswald's guilt or innocence and who the \"real criminals\" might be. Stating Oswald was a \"patsy not involved in any revenge\", and referencing articles describing \"organized murder for profit\", readers are challenged to make up their own minds. This memoir by Mohrenschildt was edited and annotated as ''Lee Harvey Oswald As I Knew Him'', by Michael A. Rinella.

Walton Moore and one of Moore's associates had handed him the address of Lee Harvey Oswald in nearby Fort Worth and then suggested that Mohrenschildt might like to meet him.

In the image, Oswald holds a Carcano rifle in one hand, with markings which have been matched to the Carcano rifle that was found in the book depository and used in the assassination. Furthermore he holds two Marxist newspapers in the other hand: [[The Daily Worker|The Worker]], which followed closely a [[Soviet Union|Moscow]] party line (and up to being pro-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] until the death of Stalin), and [[The Militant]], a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] newspaper which followed an anti-Stalinist and anti-Moscow line.]]\n\nOn April 1, 1977, Jeanne de Mohrenschildt gave the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0078b.htm a print] of a photograph showing [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] standing in his Dallas backyard holding two newspapers and a rifle, and with a pistol on his hip \u2013 a photograph taken by Oswald's wife [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina]]. While similar to other prints which had been found among Oswald's effects on November 23, 1963, the existence of this particular print was previously unknown. On the back was written ''To my friend George from Lee Oswald'', and the date \"5/IV/63\" (5 April 1963).<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0079a.htm back of that print] at aarclibrary.org. This date was confirmed by Mohrenschildt in his memoir, see [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol12/pdf/HSCA_Vol12_deMohren.pdf pp. 254-262].</ref> along with the words \"Copyright Geo de M\"' and a Russian phrase translated as \"'Hunter of fascists, ha-ha-ha!\" Handwriting specialists later concluded that the words \"To my friend George ...\" and Oswald's signature were written by Lee Harvey Oswald, but could not determine whether the rest was the writing of Lee Oswald, Mohrenschildt, or Marina Oswald.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=795}}  Mohrenschildt assumed that Marina had written it sarcastically.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=795}}\n\nMohrenschildt wrote in his manuscript (reference and pages cited above) that he had missed Oswald's photograph in packing for the move to Haiti in May, 1963, and this was why he had not mentioned it to the Warren Commission (though he had noted in his manuscript that Oswald had a rifle in April 1963, and scoffed to Oswald that he had missed [[General Walker]], remembering that Oswald had blanched at the joke). According to Mohrenschildt, the photograph was not found among his stored papers until he and his wife found it in February 1967. When analyzed by the HSCA in 1977, this photo turned out to be a first generation print of the backyard photo already known to the Warren Commission as \"CE-133A\" and which had probably been taken on March 31, 1963.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0077b.htm CE-133A]</ref>\n\n==Memoir==\n\nJeanne de Mohrenschildt also gave the [[HSCA]] committee a copy of a draft manuscript called ''I Am a Patsy! I Am a Patsy!'' which George de Mohrenschildt had completed in the summer of 1976 about his relationship with his \"dear, dead friend\" Oswald, wherein he said that the Oswald he knew was rarely ever violent and would not have been the sort of person to have killed John F. Kennedy. In part this judgment was based on Mohrenschildt's estimation of Oswald's political views and Kennedy's liberal ideas. Until 2014 the memoir had never been published as a stand-alone book, but the entire typescript was published as an appendix in the HSCA report.<ref name=\"aarclibrary.org\"/>\n\nThe primary focus of Mohrenschildt's text is a series of recollections about the brief time period between September 1962 and April 1963 that he and Jeanne were acquainted with the Oswalds. A secondary focus consists of a number of meditations on the corrosive effects knowing the Oswalds had on the professional and personal lives of the Mohrenschildts.  \"It must be acknowledged that our brief friendship with the Oswalds had strange and adverse effects on our lives.\"  Only in a tertiary sense is the manuscript concerned with Oswald's guilt or innocence and who the \"real criminals\" might be. Stating Oswald was a \"patsy not involved in any revenge\", and referencing articles describing \"organized murder for profit\", readers are challenged to make up their own minds. This memoir by Mohrenschildt was edited and annotated as ''Lee Harvey Oswald As I Knew Him'', by Michael A. Rinella. It was released in November 2014 by the University Press of Kansas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/demlee.html|title=Lee Harvey Oswald as I Knew Him|publisher=kansaspress.ku.edu|accessdate=October 28, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101548/http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/demlee.html|archivedate=October 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Depictions in the popular media ==\n\nMohrenschildt was played by [[Willem Oltmans]] in the 1991 film, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', and by [[Bill Bolender]] in the 1993 TV movie, ''[[Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald]]''.

Supposedly modeled on the similar work of [[Suetonius]], ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors (collectively known as the ''Scriptores Historiae Augustae''), written during the reigns of [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]] and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain the life of a single emperor, while some include a group of two or more, grouped together merely because these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xii}}\n\nThe true authorship of the work, its actual date, its reliability, and its purpose, have long been matters for controversy amongst historians and scholars, ever since [[Hermann Dessau]] in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include the nature of the sources it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xx\u2013xxi}}\n\nBy the second decade of the 21st century, the overall consensus supported the position that there was only a single author who was writing either at the end of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. There is further consensus that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to [[Cicero]] and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.{{sfn|Breisach|2007|p=75}}\n\n==Title and scope==\nThe name ''Historia Augusta'' originated with [[Isaac Casaubon]], who produced a critical edition in 1603, working from a complex [[manuscript]] tradition with a number of variant versions.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xi}} The title as recorded on the ''Codex Palatinus'' manuscript (written in the 9th century) is ''Vitae Diversorum Principum et Tyrannorum a Divo Hadriano usque ad Numerianum Diversis compositae'' (\"The Lives of various Emperors and Tyrants from the Divine Hadrian to Numerian by Various Authors\"), and it is assumed that the work may have been originally called ''de Vita Caesarum'' or ''Vitae Caesarum''.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xi}}\n\nHow widely the work was circulated in late antiquity is unknown, but its earliest use was in a ''Roman History'' composed by [[Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus]] in 485.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=20}} Lengthy citations from it are found in authors of the 6th and 9th centuries, including [[Sedulius Scottus]] who quoted parts of the ''Marcus Aurelius'', the ''Maximini'' and the ''Aurelian'' within his ''Liber de Rectoribus Christianis'', and the chief manuscripts also date from the 9th or 10th centuries.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xxiv\u2013xxv}} The six ''Scriptores'' \u2013 \"Aelius Spartianus\", \"Julius Capitolinus\", \"Vulcacius Gallicanus\", \"[[Aelius Lampridius]]\", \"Trebellius Pollio\", and \"Flavius Vopiscus (of Syracuse)\" \u2013 dedicate their biographies to [[Diocletian]], [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and various private persons, and so ostensibly were all writing around the late 3rd and early 4th century. The first four ''scriptores'' are attached to the lives from [[Hadrian]] to [[Gordian III]], while the final two are attached to the lives from [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] to [[Numerian]].\n\nThe biographies cover the emperors from Hadrian to [[Carinus]] and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of [[Philip the Arab]], [[Decius]], [[Trebonianus Gallus]], [[Aemilian]] and all but the end of the reign of Valerian is missing in all the manuscripts,{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=9}} and it has been argued that biographies of [[Nerva]] and [[Trajan]] have also been lost{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=9}} at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation might have been a direct continuation of [[Suetonius]]' ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]''. It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century lacuna might actually be a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.{{sfn|Birley|1967|pp=125\u2013130}}\n\nDespite devoting whole books to ephemeral or in some cases non-existent usurpers,{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=118\u2013119}}{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=277}} there are no independent biographies of the Emperors [[Quintillus]] and [[Marcus Annius Florianus|Florian]], whose reigns are merely briefly noted towards the end of the biographies of their respective predecessors, [[Claudius Gothicus]] and [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus|Tacitus]]. For nearly 300 years after Casaubon's edition, though much of the ''Historia Augusta'' was treated with some scepticism, it was used by historians as an authentic source \u2013 [[Edward Gibbon]] used it extensively in the first volume of the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=12}} However, \"in modern times most scholars read the work as a piece of deliberate mystification written much later than its purported date, however the fundamentalist view still has distinguished support. (...)  The ''Historia Augusta'' is also, unfortunately, the principal Latin source for a century of Roman history.  The historian must make use of it, but only with extreme circumspection and caution.\"{{sfn|Browning|1983|pp=43,45}}\n\n== Textual transmission ==\nExisting manuscripts and witnesses of the ''Historia Augusta'' fall into three groups:\n\n# A manuscript of the first quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (''Codex Palatinus''), known as '''P''', and its direct and indirect copies. P was written at [[Lorsch]] in [[Caroline minuscule]]. The text in this manuscript has several ''[[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]]'' marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between ''Verus'' and ''Alexander'', and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in ''Carus''.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xxxiii}} P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as [[Petrarch]] and [[Poggio Bracciolini]]; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=354f}}\n# A group of 15th-century manuscripts, designated as '''\u03a3'''. Not only are the lives rearranged in chronological order, but the corruptions present in P have been subjected to drastic emendations or omitted altogether. Beginning with Dr. Ernst Hohl, some have asserted that the improvements in the text come from a source independent of P. Although admitting that \"this question still remains to be answered definitively\", author Peter Marshall noted that research undertaken through to the 1980s had improved scholarly knowledge concerning the methods and abilities of early Italian humanists, and concludes by saying that \"the \u03a3 manuscripts nowhere provide readings which are beyond the powers of the humanists active at the time.{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=355}}\n# Three different sets of excerpts, one of which [[Theodor Mommsen]] suggested was possibly the work of Sedulius Scottus. How any are related to P is unclear.{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=356}}\n\nIn Marshall's opinion, the best scholarly editions are those by H. Peter (Teubner, 2nd ed. 1884), & E. Hohl (Teubner, 1971, reissue of 1965 revised by Ch. Samberger & W. Seyfarth).{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=354f}}\n\nA later version of the Codex Palatinus (possibly a version that was made for Petrarch in 1356) was the basis of the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''History'', published in [[Milan]] in 1475. A subsequent printed version (the Aldine edition) was published at [[Venice]] in 1516, and this was followed closely by an edition edited by [[Desiderius Erasmus]], and published by [[Johann Froben]] in [[Basel]] in 1518.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xxviii}}\n\n==The dating problem==\n[[File:Hermann Dessau.jpg|thumb|[[Hermann Dessau]], whose groundbreaking work on the ''Historia Augusta'' led to its critical re-evaluation in the 20th century]]\nIn 1776, Gibbon had observed that there was something wrong with the numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject.<ref group=\"note\">[[Gerardus Vossius]], who published ''de Historicis Latinis'' in 1627, discussed the problem of the distribution of the various vitae among the ''scriptores'', but also the problems about the authors cited by them. [[Louis-S\u00e9bastien Le Nain de Tillemont]], who published ''Histoire des Empereurs et des autres Princes qui ont r\u00e9gn\u00e9 durant les six premiers Si\u00e8cles de l'Eglise'' in 1690, provided a wholesale denunciation of the biographies as being worthless, full of contradictions and chronological errors.</ref>{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=7}}{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xxx\u2013xxxi}} A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who was meant to be writing his biographies in 305-6.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=11}} Then in 1889, [[Hermann Dessau]], who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, [[Vulgar Latin]] vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious [[persona]]e, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of [[Theodosius I]].{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xxxii}}{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=1}} Among his supporting evidence was that the life of [[Septimius Severus]] appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian [[Aurelius Victor]],<ref group=\"note\">Sev. 17.5\u201319.4 was copied from Victor, Caes. 20.1 and 10\u201330; in both passages there is a major error, which mixes up the emperor [[Didius Julianus]] with the legal scholar Salvius Julianus</ref> and that the life of [[Marcus Aurelius]] likewise uses material from [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]].<ref group=\"note\">MA 16.3\u201318.2 was lifted from Eutropius 8.11</ref>{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=20}} In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve at least some of the six ''Scriptores'' as distinct persons and in favour of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, [[Theodor Mommsen]] postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the ''Scriptores''' work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=2}} Hermann Peter (editor of the ''Historia Augusta'' and of the ''[[Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae]]'') proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language.{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|p=113}} Others, such as [[Norman H. Baynes]], abandoned the early 4th-century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of [[Julian the Apostate]] (useful for arguing the work was intended as [[Paganism|pagan]] propaganda).{{sfn|Baynes|1926|pp=169-169}}\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's original arguments received powerful restatement and expansion from Sir [[Ronald Syme]], who devoted three books to the subject and was prepared to date the writing of the work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style,{{sfn|Hornblower|Spawforth|Eidinow|2012|p=691}} and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=19}} Although it was believed that the ''Historia Augusta'' did not reference any material from [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period,{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=13\u201314}} this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the ''Historia Augusta'' does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=20}}\n\nNot all scholars have accepted the theory of a forger working around the last decades of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]]{{sfn|Momigliano|1954|pp=22\u201346}}{{sfn|Momigliano|1969|pp=566\u2013569}}{{sfn|Momigliano|1973|pp=114\u2013115}} and [[A. H. M. Jones]]{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=1071, Note 1}} were the most prominent 20th century critics of the Dessau-Syme theory amongst English-speaking scholars. Momigliano, summarizing the literature from Dessau down to 1954, defined the question as \"res iudicanda\" (i.e. \"a matter to be decided\") and not as \"res iudicata\" (\"a matter that has been decided\"). Momigliano reviewed every book published on the topic by Sir Ronald Syme, and provided counter arguments to most if not all of Syme's arguments.{{sfn|Momigliano|1969|pp=566\u2013569}}{{sfn|Momigliano|1973|pp=114\u2013115}} For instance, the reference in the ''Life of Probus'' about the emperor's descendants which has been taken to refer to [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] (consul in 371) and his family may, in the opinion of Momigliano, equally refer to the earlier members of the family, which was prominent throughout the 4th century, such as [[Petronius Probinus (consul 341)|Petronius Probinus]] (consul in 341) and [[Petronius Probianus]] (consul in 322).{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|p=121}} Momigliano's opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to dismiss a composition date of the early 4th century, and that any post-Constantinian anachronisms could be explained by an editor working on the material at a later date, perhaps during the reigns of [[Constantius II]] or [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]].{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|pp=125, 133}}\n\nOther opinions included Dr H Stern's, who postulated that the ''History'' was composed by a team of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of [[Magnentius]] on behalf of the [[Senate of the Roman Empire|Senatorial aristocracy]] who had supported the usurper.{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|p=140}} In the 21st century, [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] rebutted a number of Syme's and Barnes' arguments for a composition date c.395\u2013400, suggesting a composition date between 361 and the 380s.{{sfn|Cameron|2010|pp=743\u2013746}}\n\n==Six ''scriptores'' or a single author?==\nLinked to the problem of dating the composition of the ''History'' is the question about the authorship of the work. Taking the ''History'' at face value, there is clearly a division between the authors named prior and after the presence of the interrupting lacuna. For the first half of the ''History'', four ''scriptores'' are present, and the biographies are divided in a remarkably erratic fashion:{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=12}}\n* '''Aelius Spartianus''' (7 lives): ''Hadrian'', ''Aelius'', ''Didius Julianus'', ''Severus'', ''Niger'', ''Caracalla'' and ''Geta''.\n* '''Julius Capitolinus''' (9 lives): ''Antoninus'', ''Marcus'', ''Lucius Verus'', ''Pertinax'', ''Albinus'', ''Macrinus'', ''The Maximini'', ''The Gordiani'', and ''Maximus and Balbinus''.\n* '''Vulcacius Gallicanus''' (1 life): ''Avidius Cassius''.\n* '''Aelius Lampridius''' (4 lives): ''Commodus'', ''Diadumenus'', ''Heliogabalus'' and ''Severus Alexander''.\n\nOf these four, Spartianus and Gallicanus claim to be undertaking  a complete set of imperial biographies from [[Julius Caesar]] onwards, while Lampridius' stated intention was to write a collection of biographies that would deal with the Gordians, Claudius II, Aurelian, Diocletian, Maximian and the four rivals of Constantine. Capitolinus also implied that he was writing more biographies than are present in the ''History''.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nThe second half of the ''History'' is divided between two ''scriptores''. Unlike the first half, the emperors tackled in this section are grouped logically, and are divided roughly in half between the two ''scriptores'' in chronological sequence:\n* '''Trebellius Pollio''' (4 lives): ''Valerian'', ''Gallienus'', ''Tyranni Triginta'' and ''Claudius''.\n* '''Flavius Vopiscus Syracusanus''' (5 lives): ''Aurelian'', ''Tacitus'', ''Probus'', ''Quadrigae Tyrannorum'' and ''Carus, Carinus and Numerian''.\n\nIn terms of any acknowledgement of the mutual existence between the ''scriptores'', only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306)<ref group=\"note\">In the ''Aurelian'', Vopiscus refers to Constantinus Chlorus as emperor and Diocletian as a private citizen, dating this composition between Diocletian's abdication on 1 May 305 and Constantius' death on 25 July 306</ref>{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=10}} refers to any of the other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=10}} However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the ''Albinus'', ''Maximini'' and ''Gordiani'' he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=11}}\n\nThe theory that there was a single author, as initially postulated by [[Hermann Dessau]], is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an editor who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the ''scriptores''.<ref group=\"note\">For example, Spartianus declares that he is going to write a life of Verus, but that life is attributed to Capitolinus.</ref>{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must have been involved in the project in order to select one ''scriptor'''s life over another's.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}}\n\nHowever, the presence of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by [[Theodore Mommsen]], still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of the second half of the ''History'', operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=182}} He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the ''History'' means they cannot have been written by the same author.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=182}}\n\nNevertheless, if the validity of six independent authors is accepted, there are still issues, as the way they approached their work does show similar themes and details.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} All six not only provide biographies for the emperors, but also for the ''Caesars'' and usurpers. They describe their work and approach in very similar language, and quote otherwise unknown historians and biographers, such as Junius Cordus. They collectively share many errors, such as calling [[Diadumenian]]us \"Diadumenus\".{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} They also share much idiosyncratic content and similar language, with particular focus on women, wine and military discipline, and were fixated on poor plays on words ascribing personality traits to certain emperors, for instance Verus was truthful, while Severus was a severe individual.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} Additionally, the authors shared certain stylistic characteristics that has been suggested would not naturally occur between individuals writing separately. For instance, the authors all happen to use the word ''occido'' with respect to killing (a total of 42 occurrences), but only once do any of them use the alternative word of ''interficio''. This ratio is not found with any other writers in this time period and for this genre.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} Finally, each of the six ''scriptores'' authored fictional lives for some of their biographies, all of them using fake sources, documents and acclamations.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=6}}\n\nIt has been postulated that the names of the ''scriptores'' themselves are also a form of literary playfulness, not only mocking both legitimate authors and historians, but also the narrative itself.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=20\u201321}} The names Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus are sourced in various ways from [[Cicero]]'s writings,{{sfn|Birley|2006|pp=25\u201327}} as is the name Capitolinus.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=23}} Further, the word ''vopiscus'' is a rare Latin term, referring to a twin who survives, while its sibling died ''in utero''; this has been interpreted to refer to \"Flavius Vopiscus\" as being the final one to survive from the six authors of the ''History''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=23}} Vulcacius is believed to be a mockery of [[Volcatius Sedigitus]], who was a historical literary critic with some association with humor. The meanings behind the other two ''scriptores'' (Spartianus and Lampridius) have eluded interpretation.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nFinally, it should also be noted that the results of recent computer-assisted stylistic analysis concerning the single vs multiple authorship have proven to be inconclusive:\n<blockquote>\"[[Computer]]-aided stylistic analysis of the work has, however, returned ambiguous results; some elements of style are quite uniform throughout the work, while others vary in a way that suggests multiple authorship. To what extent this is due to the fact that portions of the work are obviously compiled from multiple sources is unclear. Several computer analyses of the text have been done to determine whether there were multiple authors. Many of them conclude that there was but a single author, but disagree on methodology. However, several studies done by the same team concluded there were several authors, though they were not sure how many.\"{{sfn|Prickman|2013|loc=University of Iowa's website}}</blockquote>\n\n==Primary and secondary Vitae==\nA unique feature of the ''Historia Augusta'' is that it purports to supply the biographies not only of reigning Emperors (called \"primary lives\" by modern scholars), but also \"secondary lives\" of their designated heirs, junior colleagues, and usurpers who unsuccessfully claimed the supreme power.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=54\u201357}} Thus among the biographies of 2nd-century and early 3rd-century figures are included [[Hadrian]]'s heir [[Lucius Aelius|Aelius Caesar]], and the usurpers [[Avidius Cassius]], [[Pescennius Niger]] and [[Clodius Albinus]], [[Caracalla]]'s brother [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Macrinus]]' son [[Diadumenianus]]. None of these pieces contain much in the way of solid information: all are marked by rhetorical padding and obvious fiction. The biography of Marcus Aurelius' colleague [[Lucius Verus]], which Mommsen thought 'secondary', is however rich in apparently reliable information and has been vindicated by Syme as belonging to the 'primary' series.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nThe 'secondary' lives allowed the author to exercise freedom in the invention of events, places and people without the need to conform to authentic historical facts.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=13\u201314}} As the work proceeds the author's inventiveness undergoes an increasing degree of elaboration as legitimate historical sources begin to run out, eventually composing largely fictional accounts such as the \"biographies\" of the [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|\"Thirty Tyrants\"]], whom the author claimed had risen as usurpers under [[Gallienus]]. Moreover, after the biography of [[Caracalla]] the 'primary' biographies, of the emperors themselves, begin to assume the rhetorical and fictive qualities previously confined to the 'secondary' ones, probably because the secondary lives were written after the ''Life of Caracalla''.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=44, 211, 214}}\n\nThe biography of [[Macrinus]] is notoriously unreliable,{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=57\u201359}} and after a partial reversion to reliability in the ''[[Elagabalus|Life of Elagabalus]]'', the ''[[Alexander Severus]]'', one of the longest biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise [[philosopher king]].{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=146\u2013150}} Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources \u2013 [[Herodian]] up to 238, and probably [[Dexippus]] in the later books, for the entire imperial period the ''[[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte]]'' as well as [[Aurelius Victor]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and [[Jerome]] \u2013 but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=14}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=20}}\n\nHowever, even where recognisable facts are present, their use in the ''History'' cannot be taken at face value. In the ''Life of Alexander Severus'', the ''History'' makes the claim at 24.4 that [[Severus Alexander|Alexander]] had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] did later ban the practice.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=151}} Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true \u2013 the source of this is Aurelius Victor (28.6\u20137, and who in turn sourced it from the ''Kaisergeschichte''), and the ''History'' even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the ''Kaisergeschichte''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|pp=150\u2013151}} Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the ''Kaisergeschichte''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=151}}\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Estimated amount of reliable historical details in some of the ''Historia Augusta's'' secondary and later primary vitae{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=23}}\n !

Under this anti-Christianity theory, the lacuna covering the period from Philip the Arab through to the end of Valerian's reign is seen as deliberate, as it freed the author from addressing Philip's reign, as by the late 4th century, Philip was being claimed as a Christian emperor, as well as not discussing Decius and Valerian's reigns, as they were well known persecutors of the Church. It also avoided dealing with their fates, as Christians saw their ends as divine retribution for their persecutions. In fact, where mentioned, both Decius and Valerian are viewed very positively by the author of the ''History''.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=22}} Further, it is noted that the ''History'' also parodies Christian scripture. For instance, in the ''Life of Alexander Severus'' there is: \"It is said that on the day after his birth a star of the first magnitude was visible for the entire day at Arca Caesarea\",{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Alexander Severus'', 13.5}} while \"where, save at Rome, is there an imperial power that rules an empire?\"{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Alexander Severus'', 14.4}} is considered to be a response to 2 Thessalonians 2:6\u20137.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}}\n\nSyme{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=12\u201313}} argued that it was a mistake to regard it as a historical work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the ''History'' is primarily a literary product \u2013 an exercise in [[satire]] produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and [[Marius Maximus]] were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of [[Tacitus]]. (The ''History'' implausibly{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=214}} makes the Emperor Tacitus (275\u2013276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the ''Quadriga tyrannorum''{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 1.2}} \u2014 the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] \u2014 the ''History'' itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': ''homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit'' ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term ''mythistoricis'' occurs nowhere else in Latin.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=76}} Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of [[Aurelian]], in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the [[Praefectus urbi|City Prefect]] of Rome during the festival of [[Hilaria]] in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=192}}\n\n[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|[[Cicero]], one of the authors whose works the ''Historia Augusta'' references obliquely.]]\nOther examples of the work as a parody can be taken from the names of the ''Scriptores'' themselves. It has been suggested that \"Trebellius Pollio\" and \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\" were invented, with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in Cicero's letters and speeches in the 1st century BC.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} With respect to \"Trebellius Pollio\", this is a reference to Lucius Trebellius, a supporter of [[Mark Antony]] who was mentioned in the [[Philippicae|Philippics]] (''Phil'', 11.14), and another reference to him in ''[[Epistulae ad Familiares]]'' along with the term \"Pollentiam\" reminded the ''History's'' author of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], who was a fellow [[Tribune of the Plebs|Plebeian Tribune]] alongside Lucius Trebellius and a historian as well.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} This is reinforced by noted similarities between the fictitious criticism of \"Trebellius Pollio\" by \"Flavius Vopiscus\" at the start of the ''Life of Aurelian'', with similar comments made by Asinius Pollio about Julius Caesar's [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|published ''Commentaries'']].{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} Significantly, Lucius Trebellius adopted the [[Cognomen]] ''Fides'' for his actions as Plebeian Tribune in 47 BC to resist laws that would abolish debts; later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment, Cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule. According to this theory it is no coincidence that, in selecting the name \"Trebellius Pollio\", the author is playing with the concepts of ''fides'' and ''fidelitas historica'' at the precise point in the lives that are assigned to \"Trebellius Pollio\" and \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\".{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=26}}\n\nIn the case of \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\", it was argued that it too was inspired by the Philippics' reference to \"Caesar Vopiscus\" (''Phil'', 11.11), with Cicero's reference to Vopiscus immediately preceding his reference to Lucius Trebellius.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} The cognomen \"Syracusius\" was selected because Cicero's ''[[In Verrem]]'' is filled with references to \"Syracusae\" and \"Syracusani\".{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} Further, in Cicero's ''[[De Oratore]]'', Cicero refers to Strabo Vopiscus as an authority on humour, during which he refers to the reputation of Sicilians when it came to humour, and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was one of the principal cities of [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} Such references were intended as a \"knowing wink\" to the readers of the ''History'', who would recognise the mockery of the historical material by the author.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} This corresponds with David Rohrbacher's view of the ''History'', who maintains that the author has no political or theological agenda; rather that the ''History'' is the equivalent of a literary puzzle or game, with the reader's understanding and enjoyment of the numerous elaborate and complicated allusions contained within it being the only purpose behind its existence.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=148}}\n\nIn support of this theory, Rohrbacher provides an example with respect to Ammianus Marcellinus' work. In one passage (Amm. 19.12.14), Ammianus describes the Christian emperor Constantius II's attempts to prosecute cases of magic under treason laws, in particular the death penalty applied to those men who were condemned simply for wearing an amulet to ward off diseases: \"''si qui remedia quartanae vel doloris alterius collo gestaret''\" (\"For if anyone wore on his neck an amulet against the quartan ague or any other complaint\").{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=143}} There is a very similar imperial ruling described in the ''Life of Caracalla'' (5.7), which makes no sense in Caracalla's time, and is worded in almost exactly the same way: \"''qui remedia quartanis tertianisque collo adnexas gestarent''\" (\"wearing them around their necks as preventives of quartan or tertian fever\").{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=143}}\n\nOther theories include [[Andr\u00e9 Chastagnol]]'s minimalist opinion that the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races,{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=147}} while Fran\u00e7ois Paschoud proposed that the last books of the ''History'' are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven into the fabric of a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with [[Carus]] substituting for [[Valentinian I]] and Carinus for [[Gratian]].{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=147}}\n\n==Historical value==\nFrom the sixth century to the end of the 19th century, historians had recognized that the ''Historia Augusta'' was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source, and since the 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution.{{sfn|Browning|1983|pp=43,45}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=4}} Older historians, such as Edward Gibbon, not fully aware of its problems with respect to the fictitious elements contained within it, generally treated the information preserved within it as authentic. For instance, in Gibbon's account of the reign of Gallienus, he uncritically reproduces the ''Historia Augusta's'' biased and largely fictional account of that reign.{{sfn|Bray|1997|pp=3\u20134}} So when Gibbon states \"The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul\",{{sfn|Gibbon|1776|loc=Ch. 10}} he is reworking the passage in ''The Two Gallieni'':\n\n<blockquote>I am ashamed to relate what Gallienus used often to say at this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid the ills of mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, he is said to have exclaimed \"What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!\" and when informed that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, \"What! We cannot do without saltpetre!\" and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, \"Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?\" Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Two Gallieni'', 6.1\u20136.8}}</blockquote>\n\nGibbon then noted after this passage: \"This singular character has, I believe, been fairly transmitted to us. The reign of his immediate successor was short and busy; and the historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Constantine could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienus.\"{{sfn|Gibbon|1776|loc=Ch. 10, Note 156}} Modern scholars now believe that Gallienus' reputation was posthumously maligned, that he was one of the main architects of the later Roman imperial structure, and that his reforms were built upon by succeeding emperors.{{sfn|Bray|1997|p=4}}\n\nNevertheless, it is unwise to dismiss it altogether as it is also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus, mentioned in the Life of [[Didius Julianus]], was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as [[Praetorian Prefect]] in 193.{{sfn|Mellor|2002|p=163}} Likewise, the information that [[Hadrian's Wall]] was constructed during Hadrian's reign{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Hadrian'', 11.2}} and that the [[Antonine Wall]] was built during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]]{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Antoninus Pius'', 5.4}} are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the ''Historia Augusta'',<ref group=\"note\">Where other ancient writers (such as Eutropius) speak of a defensive wall in Britain, they have associated it with the activities of Septimius Severus \u2013 see David Shorter's ''Roman Britain: A Sourcebook'' (2008), pp. 113\u2013114.</ref> the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=13}}\n\n===False documents and authorities===\nA peculiarity of the work is its inclusion of a large number of purportedly authentic documents such as extracts from Senate proceedings and letters written by imperial personages.{{sfn|Potter|2005|p=150}}{{sfn|Campbell|1994|p=248}} In all it contains around 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xx\u2013xxi}} Records like these are quite distinct from the rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians \u2013 it was accepted practice for the writer to invent these himself{{sfn|Mehl|2011|p=21}} \u2013 and on the few occasions when historians (such as [[Sallust]] in his work on [[Catiline]] or Suetonius in his ''Twelve Caesars'') include such documents, they have generally been regarded as genuine;{{sfn|Potter|2005|p=149}}  but almost all those found in the Historia Augusta have been rejected as fabrications, partly on stylistic grounds, partly because they refer to military titles or points of administrative organisation which are otherwise unrecorded until long after the purported date, or for other suspicious content.{{sfn|Hadas|2013|pp=356\u2013357}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=6\u20138}}{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nThe ''History'' moreover cites dozens of otherwise unrecorded historians, biographers, letter-writers, knowledgeable friends of the writers, and so on, most of whom must be regarded as expressions of the author's creative imagination.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=98\u201399}} For example, the biographer \"Cordus\" is cited twenty-seven times in the ''History''. Long considered to be a real, but lost, biographer until midway into the 20th century,{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xviii\u2013xix}}{{sfn|Syme|1968|pp=96\u201398}} with a couple of minor exceptions where material claimed to be sourced from Cordus is in reality from Suetonius or Cicero, every other citation is fake, providing details which have been invented and ascribed to Cordus. Cordus is mentioned almost exclusively in those Vitae where the ''History'' used Herodian as the primary source, and his appearances vanish once Herodian's history comes to an end.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=161}}\n\nThe author would also misattribute material taken from a legitimate historian and ascribe it to a fictitious author. For instance, Herodian is used more often than he is explicitly referenced in the ''History''; in addition to the ten times he is correctly cited, three times his material is cited as \"Arrianus\", probably to multiply the author's sources.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=20}} Further, not only does the author copy from Herodian without citation (either direct lifts, abbreviations or supplementations), he often distorts Herodian, to suit his literary objective.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=13}}\n\nThen there is the deliberate citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the ''History's'' sixteen citations of Dexippus are considered to be fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, but rather as a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the ''Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte''. In addition [[Quintus Gargilius Martialis]], who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=160}}\n\n===Examples of false historical events and personages===\nThe untrustworthiness of the ''History'' stems from the multifarious kinds of fraudulent (as opposed to simply inaccurate) information that run through the work, becoming ever more dominant as it proceeds.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=13\u201314}} The various biographies are ascribed to different invented 'authors', and continue with the dedicatory epistles to Diocletian and Constantine, the quotation of fabricated documents, the citation of non-historical authorities, the invention of persons (extending even to the subjects of some of the minor biographies), presentation of contradictory information to confuse an issue while making a show of objectivity, deliberately false statements, and the inclusion of material which can be shown to relate to events or personages of the late 4th century rather than the period supposedly being written about.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=12\u201316}} For example:\n* The biography of Geta states he was born in Mediolanum on 27 May; the year is not specified but it was 'in the suffect consulships of Severus and Vitellius'.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Geta'', 3.1}} He was actually born in Rome on 7 March 189; there was no such pair of suffect [[Roman consul|consuls]] in this or any other year;{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=123}} however, it has been suggested that the names for these persons be amended to be Severus and Vettulenus, and that these men were suffect consuls sometime before 192.{{sfn|Birley|1966|pp=249\u2013253}}\n* In the ''Vita Commodi'', the biography on emperor [[Commodus]], there is much doubt about the authenticity of the sources used and cited. Lampridius (the pseudonym the author works with here) claims to have used Marius Maximus on multiple occasions for his work.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=31}} One instance forms a case in point: Lampridius (supposedly) quotes the senatorial speeches in Maximus\u2019 work which were held after Commodus\u2019 death.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Commodus'', 15.3-5 + 18-21}} However, it is unclear whether the references to Maximus are genuine or made up by the author to give himself a sense of authority and expertise.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=41}} Baldwin thinks that the senatorial speeches are probably a figment of Lampridius\u2019 imagination.{{sfn|Baldwin|1981|pp=138-149}} Molinier-Arbo, however, believes in their authenticity. She suggests that the full report of the ''acta senatus'' (lit. acts of the senate) was handed down in the ''acta urbis'' (a kind of city gazette). Marius Maximus could have used this report for his work and Lampridius could have used it later on.{{sfn|Molinier-Arbo|2010|pp=87-112}}\n* A letter of Hadrian written from Egypt to his brother-in-law [[Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus|Servianus]] is quoted at length (and was accepted as genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century).{{sfn|Raschke|1976|pp=761\u2013762}} Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son [[Lucius Aelius Caesar]]: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136.{{sfn|Habelt|1968|p=121}}{{sfn|Birley|2013|p=3}} The letter is said to have been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the ''History'', in another suspect passage.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=60}} A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Patriarch]], head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, [[Raban Gamliel VI|Gamaliel]].{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=21\u201324}}\n* Decius revives the office of [[Roman censor|Censor]]; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy to hold it in a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on campaign against the [[Goths]]) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Two Valerians'', 5.4\u20136.1}} The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=215}}\n* Valerian holds an imperial council in [[Byzantium]], attended by several named dignitaries, none of them otherwise attested and some holding offices not known to exist until the following century, at which the general 'Ulpius Crinitus' (a name apparently chosen to evoke the military glories of the Emperor Trajan) takes the young Aurelian (destined to be another military Emperor) as his adopted son. There are no grounds to believe this is anything other than invention.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=97}}\n[[File:Trebellianus.jpg|200px|thumb|Trebellianus, one of the fictitious tyrants included in the ''Historia Augusta'', drawn by [[Guillaume Rouill\u00e9]] in  ''[[Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]''- 1553]]\n* In the ''Tyranni Triginta'', the author 'Trebellius Pollio' sets out to chronicle 'the 30 usurpers who arose in the years when the Empire was ruled by Gallienus and Valerian'.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 1.1}} The number 30 is evidently modelled on the notorious '[[Thirty Tyrants]]' who ruled Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War.{{sfn|Bunson|1991|p=414}} The chapter contains 32 mini-biographies. They include two women, six youths, and seven men who never claimed the imperial power; one usurper of the reign of [[Maximinus Thrax]], one of the time of Decius, and two of the time of Aurelian; and a number who are not historical personages: [[Postumus the Younger]], [[Saturninus (253\u2013268)|Saturninus]], [[Trebellianus]], [[Celsus (usurper)|Celsus]], [[Titus (usurper)|Titus]], [[Censorinus (usurper)|Censorinus]], and [[Victorinus Junior]].{{sfn|Cancik|Schneider|Salazar|2009|p=91}}\n* In the ''Life of Tacitus'', the emperor is acclaimed by the Senate, meeting in the ''Curia Pompiliana'', which never existed.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=159}} The ''History'' then lists a number of individuals, all of whom are invented by the author: the consul 'Velius Cornificius Gordianus',{{sfn|Kreucher|2003|p=105}} 'Maecius Faltonius Nicomachus',{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=4, 12}} the [[City Prefect|Prefect of the City]] 'Aelius Cesettianus',{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=117}} and the Praetorian Prefect 'Moesius Gallicanus'.{{sfn|Baldwin|1984|p=4}} Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom are assumed to be non-historical personages.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=238\u2013239}} Most of the 'Maecii' and 'Gallicani' in the ''History'' are believed to be inventions of the author.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=4, 12}}{{sfn|Baldwin|1984|p=4}}\n* In the ''Quadrigae Tyrannorum'' (''Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus''<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Firmus_et_al*.html The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus] at LacusCurtius</ref>), the author includes [[Firmus]], said to have been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 3.1}}{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Aurelian'', 32.2}} There is no certainty that this person ever existed; however, there was a ''[[Corrector]]'' named Claudius Firmus stationed in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] in 274, about the time [[Zosimus]] states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=71}} Nevertheless, the ''History's'' wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented.{{sfn|Den Boeft|Drijvers|Den Hengst|Teitler|2013|pp=150}} For example, he would eat an ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 3.2\u20136.5}}\n* In the ''Life of Probus'',{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Probus'', 24.1\u201324.3}} the author 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' states that the Emperor's descendants (''posteri'') fled from Rome and settled near [[Verona]]. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This is one of the strongest indications of the ''History's'' late 4th-century date, as it seems to be a fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=164}}{{sfn|Platnauer|Claudian|1922|loc=''Panegyric on the Consuls Probinus and Olybrius'', Note 1}} Petronius Probus was born in Verona.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1971|pp=739}}\n\n==Marius Maximus or 'Ignotus'?==\nCertain scholars have always defended the value of specific parts of the work. [[Anthony Birley]], for instance, has argued that the lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=14\u201315}} As a result, his translation of the ''History'' for [[Penguin Books]] covers only the first half, and was published as ''Lives of the Later Caesars'', Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these are not part of the original texts, which begin with Hadrian).\n\nHis view (part of a tradition that goes back to J. J. M\u00fcller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as Andr\u00e9 Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus (\"the unknown one\"), the good biographer'.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=33}}{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=15}} His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the ''Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that ''Princeps'' in the History is mainly of good quality.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=31\u201333}} Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=32}} Finally, that the composer of the ''Historia Augusta'' wrote the lives of the emperors through to the ''Life of Caracalla'' (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=32\u201333}} It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus),{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=31\u201332}} as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the ''Life of Geta''.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=44}}\n\nA similar theory to Syme's has been put forward by Fran\u00e7ois Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was probably a satirical poet, in the same vein as [[Juvenal]] and not an imperial biographer at all.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=21}} His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the ''History'', the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the ''History's'' description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=160}} This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=21}} and David Rohrbacher.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n==Literary value==\nThe ''Historia Augusta'' has been described by Ronald Syme as \"the most enigmatic work that Antiquity has transmitted\".{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=4}} Although much of the focus of study throughout the centuries has been on the historical content, since the 20th century there has also been an assessment of the literary value of the work. For much of that time the assessment has been critical, as demonstrated by the analysis put forward by David Magie:\n\n<blockquote>The literary, as well as the historical, value of the Historia Augusta has suffered greatly as a result of the method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xxiii\u2013xxiv}}</blockquote>\n\nM. L. W. Laistner was of the opinion that \"even if the ''Historia Augusta'' was propaganda disguised as biography, it is still a wretched piece of literature\",{{sfn|Laistner|1966|p=180}} while Ronald Syme noted that with respect to the author's Latin prose:\n\n<blockquote>He was not an elegant exponent. His normal language is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions&nbsp;... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=251}}</blockquote>\n\nFurther, the work shows evidence of its having been put together in a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=18\u201319}} Birley sees an example of the carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the ''Life of Marcus Aurelius'' the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}} The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}} However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}}\n\nAlthough these criticisms still form the prevailing view on the ''History's'' literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work,{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=171}}{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=18}} its use of allusion as a vehicle for parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, making it one of the most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=170\u2013172}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=148}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)]] \u2013 about the ''Tyranni Triginta'', one of the books of the ''Historia Augusta''\n* [[Titus Aurelius Fulvus]]\n* [[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|group=note|60em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref            = {{sfnRef|Historia Augusta}}\n|author         = Anonymous\n|title          = Historia Augusta\n|trans-title    = Augustan History\n|url            = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/home.html\n|year           = c. 395\n|language       = Latin\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref        = harv\n|last       = Baldwin\n|first      = Barry\n|title      = Studies on Late Roman and Byzantine History, Literature, and Language\n|url        = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Buo7AAAAMAAJ\n|publisher  = Brill Academic Publishing\n|year       = 1984\n|series     = Volume 12 of London studies in classical philology\n|isbn       = 978-90-70265-56-4\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n|ref        = harv\n|last       = Baldwin\n|first      = Barry\n|title      = Acclamations in the ''Historia Augusta''\n|journal    = Athenaeum\n|publisher  = Pavia\n|location   = Italy\n|volume     = 59\n|pages      = 138-149\n|year       = 1981\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref        = harv\n|last       = Barnes\n|first      = Timothy\n|authorlink = Timothy Barnes\n|title      = The Sources of the Historia Augusta\n|url        = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=KaSgAAAAMAAJ\n|publisher  = Latomus\n|year       = 1978\n|isbn       = 978-2-87031-005-2\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref        = harv\n|last       = Baynes\n|first      = Norman Hepburn\n|authorlink = Norman H.

Supposedly modeled on the similar work of [[Suetonius]], ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors (collectively known as the ''Scriptores Historiae Augustae''), written during the reigns of [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]] and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain the life of a single emperor, while some include a group of two or more, grouped together merely because these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xii}}\n\nThe true authorship of the work, its actual date, its reliability, and its purpose, have long been matters for controversy amongst historians and scholars, ever since [[Hermann Dessau]] in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include the nature of the sources it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xx\u2013xxi}}\n\nBy the second decade of the 21st century, the overall consensus supported the position that there was only a single author who was writing either at the end of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. There is further consensus that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to [[Cicero]] and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.{{sfn|Breisach|2007|p=75}}\n\n==Title and scope==\nThe name ''Historia Augusta'' originated with [[Isaac Casaubon]], who produced a critical edition in 1603, working from a complex [[manuscript]] tradition with a number of variant versions.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xi}} The title as recorded on the ''Codex Palatinus'' manuscript (written in the 9th century) is ''Vitae Diversorum Principum et Tyrannorum a Divo Hadriano usque ad Numerianum Diversis compositae'' (\"The Lives of various Emperors and Tyrants from the Divine Hadrian to Numerian by Various Authors\"), and it is assumed that the work may have been originally called ''de Vita Caesarum'' or ''Vitae Caesarum''.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xi}}\n\nHow widely the work was circulated in late antiquity is unknown, but its earliest use was in a ''Roman History'' composed by [[Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus]] in 485.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=20}} Lengthy citations from it are found in authors of the 6th and 9th centuries, including [[Sedulius Scottus]] who quoted parts of the ''Marcus Aurelius'', the ''Maximini'' and the ''Aurelian'' within his ''Liber de Rectoribus Christianis'', and the chief manuscripts also date from the 9th or 10th centuries.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xxiv\u2013xxv}} The six ''Scriptores'' \u2013 \"Aelius Spartianus\", \"Julius Capitolinus\", \"Vulcacius Gallicanus\", \"[[Aelius Lampridius]]\", \"Trebellius Pollio\", and \"Flavius Vopiscus (of Syracuse)\" \u2013 dedicate their biographies to [[Diocletian]], [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and various private persons, and so ostensibly were all writing around the late 3rd and early 4th century. The first four ''scriptores'' are attached to the lives from [[Hadrian]] to [[Gordian III]], while the final two are attached to the lives from [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] to [[Numerian]].\n\nThe biographies cover the emperors from Hadrian to [[Carinus]] and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of [[Philip the Arab]], [[Decius]], [[Trebonianus Gallus]], [[Aemilian]] and all but the end of the reign of Valerian is missing in all the manuscripts,{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=9}} and it has been argued that biographies of [[Nerva]] and [[Trajan]] have also been lost{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=9}} at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation might have been a direct continuation of [[Suetonius]]' ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]''. It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century lacuna might actually be a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.{{sfn|Birley|1967|pp=125\u2013130}}\n\nDespite devoting whole books to ephemeral or in some cases non-existent usurpers,{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=118\u2013119}}{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=277}} there are no independent biographies of the Emperors [[Quintillus]] and [[Marcus Annius Florianus|Florian]], whose reigns are merely briefly noted towards the end of the biographies of their respective predecessors, [[Claudius Gothicus]] and [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus|Tacitus]]. For nearly 300 years after Casaubon's edition, though much of the ''Historia Augusta'' was treated with some scepticism, it was used by historians as an authentic source \u2013 [[Edward Gibbon]] used it extensively in the first volume of the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=12}} However, \"in modern times most scholars read the work as a piece of deliberate mystification written much later than its purported date, however the fundamentalist view still has distinguished support. (...)  The ''Historia Augusta'' is also, unfortunately, the principal Latin source for a century of Roman history.  The historian must make use of it, but only with extreme circumspection and caution.\"{{sfn|Browning|1983|pp=43,45}}\n\n== Textual transmission ==\nExisting manuscripts and witnesses of the ''Historia Augusta'' fall into three groups:\n\n# A manuscript of the first quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (''Codex Palatinus''), known as '''P''', and its direct and indirect copies. P was written at [[Lorsch]] in [[Caroline minuscule]]. The text in this manuscript has several ''[[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]]'' marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between ''Verus'' and ''Alexander'', and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in ''Carus''.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xxxiii}} P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as [[Petrarch]] and [[Poggio Bracciolini]]; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=354f}}\n# A group of 15th-century manuscripts, designated as '''\u03a3'''. Not only are the lives rearranged in chronological order, but the corruptions present in P have been subjected to drastic emendations or omitted altogether. Beginning with Dr. Ernst Hohl, some have asserted that the improvements in the text come from a source independent of P. Although admitting that \"this question still remains to be answered definitively\", author Peter Marshall noted that research undertaken through to the 1980s had improved scholarly knowledge concerning the methods and abilities of early Italian humanists, and concludes by saying that \"the \u03a3 manuscripts nowhere provide readings which are beyond the powers of the humanists active at the time.{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=355}}\n# Three different sets of excerpts, one of which [[Theodor Mommsen]] suggested was possibly the work of Sedulius Scottus.

Other recent studies also show much consistency of style,{{sfn|Hornblower|Spawforth|Eidinow|2012|p=691}} and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=19}} Although it was believed that the ''Historia Augusta'' did not reference any material from [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period,{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=13\u201314}} this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the ''Historia Augusta'' does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=20}}\n\nNot all scholars have accepted the theory of a forger working around the last decades of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th.

Jones]]{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=1071, Note 1}} were the most prominent 20th century critics of the Dessau-Syme theory amongst English-speaking scholars. Momigliano, summarizing the literature from Dessau down to 1954, defined the question as \"res iudicanda\" (i.e. \"a matter to be decided\") and not as \"res iudicata\" (\"a matter that has been decided\"). Momigliano reviewed every book published on the topic by Sir Ronald Syme, and provided counter arguments to most if not all of Syme's arguments.{{sfn|Momigliano|1969|pp=566\u2013569}}{{sfn|Momigliano|1973|pp=114\u2013115}} For instance, the reference in the ''Life of Probus'' about the emperor's descendants which has been taken to refer to [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] (consul in 371) and his family may, in the opinion of Momigliano, equally refer to the earlier members of the family, which was prominent throughout the 4th century, such as [[Petronius Probinus (consul 341)|Petronius Probinus]] (consul in 341) and [[Petronius Probianus]] (consul in 322).{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|p=121}} Momigliano's opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to dismiss a composition date of the early 4th century, and that any post-Constantinian anachronisms could be explained by an editor working on the material at a later date, perhaps during the reigns of [[Constantius II]] or [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]].{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|pp=125, 133}}\n\nOther opinions included Dr H Stern's, who postulated that the ''History'' was composed by a team of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of [[Magnentius]] on behalf of the [[Senate of the Roman Empire|Senatorial aristocracy]] who had supported the usurper.{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|p=140}} In the 21st century, [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] rebutted a number of Syme's and Barnes' arguments for a composition date c.395\u2013400, suggesting a composition date between 361 and the 380s.{{sfn|Cameron|2010|pp=743\u2013746}}\n\n==Six ''scriptores'' or a single author?==\nLinked to the problem of dating the composition of the ''History'' is the question about the authorship of the work. Taking the ''History'' at face value, there is clearly a division between the authors named prior and after the presence of the interrupting lacuna. For the first half of the ''History'', four ''scriptores'' are present, and the biographies are divided in a remarkably erratic fashion:{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=12}}\n* '''Aelius Spartianus''' (7 lives): ''Hadrian'', ''Aelius'', ''Didius Julianus'', ''Severus'', ''Niger'', ''Caracalla'' and ''Geta''.\n* '''Julius Capitolinus''' (9 lives): ''Antoninus'', ''Marcus'', ''Lucius Verus'', ''Pertinax'', ''Albinus'', ''Macrinus'', ''The Maximini'', ''The Gordiani'', and ''Maximus and Balbinus''.\n* '''Vulcacius Gallicanus''' (1 life): ''Avidius Cassius''.\n* '''Aelius Lampridius''' (4 lives): ''Commodus'', ''Diadumenus'', ''Heliogabalus'' and ''Severus Alexander''.\n\nOf these four, Spartianus and Gallicanus claim to be undertaking  a complete set of imperial biographies from [[Julius Caesar]] onwards, while Lampridius' stated intention was to write a collection of biographies that would deal with the Gordians, Claudius II, Aurelian, Diocletian, Maximian and the four rivals of Constantine. Capitolinus also implied that he was writing more biographies than are present in the ''History''.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nThe second half of the ''History'' is divided between two ''scriptores''. Unlike the first half, the emperors tackled in this section are grouped logically, and are divided roughly in half between the two ''scriptores'' in chronological sequence:\n* '''Trebellius Pollio''' (4 lives): ''Valerian'', ''Gallienus'', ''Tyranni Triginta'' and ''Claudius''.\n* '''Flavius Vopiscus Syracusanus''' (5 lives): ''Aurelian'', ''Tacitus'', ''Probus'', ''Quadrigae Tyrannorum'' and ''Carus, Carinus and Numerian''.\n\nIn terms of any acknowledgement of the mutual existence between the ''scriptores'', only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306)<ref group=\"note\">In the ''Aurelian'', Vopiscus refers to Constantinus Chlorus as emperor and Diocletian as a private citizen, dating this composition between Diocletian's abdication on 1 May 305 and Constantius' death on 25 July 306</ref>{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=10}} refers to any of the other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=10}} However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the ''Albinus'', ''Maximini'' and ''Gordiani'' he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=11}}\n\nThe theory that there was a single author, as initially postulated by [[Hermann Dessau]], is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an editor who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the ''scriptores''.<ref group=\"note\">For example, Spartianus declares that he is going to write a life of Verus, but that life is attributed to Capitolinus.</ref>{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must have been involved in the project in order to select one ''scriptor'''s life over another's.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}}\n\nHowever, the presence of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by [[Theodore Mommsen]], still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of the second half of the ''History'', operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=182}} He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the ''History'' means they cannot have been written by the same author.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=182}}\n\nNevertheless, if the validity of six independent authors is accepted, there are still issues, as the way they approached their work does show similar themes and details.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} All six not only provide biographies for the emperors, but also for the ''Caesars'' and usurpers. They describe their work and approach in very similar language, and quote otherwise unknown historians and biographers, such as Junius Cordus. They collectively share many errors, such as calling [[Diadumenian]]us \"Diadumenus\".{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} They also share much idiosyncratic content and similar language, with particular focus on women, wine and military discipline, and were fixated on poor plays on words ascribing personality traits to certain emperors, for instance Verus was truthful, while Severus was a severe individual.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} Additionally, the authors shared certain stylistic characteristics that has been suggested would not naturally occur between individuals writing separately. For instance, the authors all happen to use the word ''occido'' with respect to killing (a total of 42 occurrences), but only once do any of them use the alternative word of ''interficio''. This ratio is not found with any other writers in this time period and for this genre.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} Finally, each of the six ''scriptores'' authored fictional lives for some of their biographies, all of them using fake sources, documents and acclamations.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=6}}\n\nIt has been postulated that the names of the ''scriptores'' themselves are also a form of literary playfulness, not only mocking both legitimate authors and historians, but also the narrative itself.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=20\u201321}} The names Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus are sourced in various ways from [[Cicero]]'s writings,{{sfn|Birley|2006|pp=25\u201327}} as is the name Capitolinus.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=23}} Further, the word ''vopiscus'' is a rare Latin term, referring to a twin who survives, while its sibling died ''in utero''; this has been interpreted to refer to \"Flavius Vopiscus\" as being the final one to survive from the six authors of the ''History''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=23}} Vulcacius is believed to be a mockery of [[Volcatius Sedigitus]], who was a historical literary critic with some association with humor. The meanings behind the other two ''scriptores'' (Spartianus and Lampridius) have eluded interpretation.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nFinally, it should also be noted that the results of recent computer-assisted stylistic analysis concerning the single vs multiple authorship have proven to be inconclusive:\n<blockquote>\"[[Computer]]-aided stylistic analysis of the work has, however, returned ambiguous results; some elements of style are quite uniform throughout the work, while others vary in a way that suggests multiple authorship. To what extent this is due to the fact that portions of the work are obviously compiled from multiple sources is unclear. Several computer analyses of the text have been done to determine whether there were multiple authors. Many of them conclude that there was but a single author, but disagree on methodology. However, several studies done by the same team concluded there were several authors, though they were not sure how many.\"{{sfn|Prickman|2013|loc=University of Iowa's website}}</blockquote>\n\n==Primary and secondary Vitae==\nA unique feature of the ''Historia Augusta'' is that it purports to supply the biographies not only of reigning Emperors (called \"primary lives\" by modern scholars), but also \"secondary lives\" of their designated heirs, junior colleagues, and usurpers who unsuccessfully claimed the supreme power.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=54\u201357}} Thus among the biographies of 2nd-century and early 3rd-century figures are included [[Hadrian]]'s heir [[Lucius Aelius|Aelius Caesar]], and the usurpers [[Avidius Cassius]], [[Pescennius Niger]] and [[Clodius Albinus]], [[Caracalla]]'s brother [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Macrinus]]' son [[Diadumenianus]]. None of these pieces contain much in the way of solid information: all are marked by rhetorical padding and obvious fiction. The biography of Marcus Aurelius' colleague [[Lucius Verus]], which Mommsen thought 'secondary', is however rich in apparently reliable information and has been vindicated by Syme as belonging to the 'primary' series.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nThe 'secondary' lives allowed the author to exercise freedom in the invention of events, places and people without the need to conform to authentic historical facts.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=13\u201314}} As the work proceeds the author's inventiveness undergoes an increasing degree of elaboration as legitimate historical sources begin to run out, eventually composing largely fictional accounts such as the \"biographies\" of the [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|\"Thirty Tyrants\"]], whom the author claimed had risen as usurpers under [[Gallienus]]. Moreover, after the biography of [[Caracalla]] the 'primary' biographies, of the emperors themselves, begin to assume the rhetorical and fictive qualities previously confined to the 'secondary' ones, probably because the secondary lives were written after the ''Life of Caracalla''.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=44, 211, 214}}\n\nThe biography of [[Macrinus]] is notoriously unreliable,{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=57\u201359}} and after a partial reversion to reliability in the ''[[Elagabalus|Life of Elagabalus]]'', the ''[[Alexander Severus]]'', one of the longest biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise [[philosopher king]].{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=146\u2013150}} Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources \u2013 [[Herodian]] up to 238, and probably [[Dexippus]] in the later books, for the entire imperial period the ''[[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte]]'' as well as [[Aurelius Victor]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and [[Jerome]] \u2013 but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=14}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=20}}\n\nHowever, even where recognisable facts are present, their use in the ''History'' cannot be taken at face value. In the ''Life of Alexander Severus'', the ''History'' makes the claim at 24.4 that [[Severus Alexander|Alexander]] had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] did later ban the practice.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=151}} Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true \u2013 the source of this is Aurelius Victor (28.6\u20137, and who in turn sourced it from the ''Kaisergeschichte''), and the ''History'' even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the ''Kaisergeschichte''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|pp=150\u2013151}} Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the ''Kaisergeschichte''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=151}}\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Estimated amount of reliable historical details in some of the ''Historia Augusta's'' secondary and later primary vitae{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=23}}\n !

Under this anti-Christianity theory, the lacuna covering the period from Philip the Arab through to the end of Valerian's reign is seen as deliberate, as it freed the author from addressing Philip's reign, as by the late 4th century, Philip was being claimed as a Christian emperor, as well as not discussing Decius and Valerian's reigns, as they were well known persecutors of the Church. It also avoided dealing with their fates, as Christians saw their ends as divine retribution for their persecutions. In fact, where mentioned, both Decius and Valerian are viewed very positively by the author of the ''History''.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=22}} Further, it is noted that the ''History'' also parodies Christian scripture. For instance, in the ''Life of Alexander Severus'' there is: \"It is said that on the day after his birth a star of the first magnitude was visible for the entire day at Arca Caesarea\",{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Alexander Severus'', 13.5}} while \"where, save at Rome, is there an imperial power that rules an empire?\"{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Alexander Severus'', 14.4}} is considered to be a response to 2 Thessalonians 2:6\u20137.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}}\n\nSyme{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=12\u201313}} argued that it was a mistake to regard it as a historical work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the ''History'' is primarily a literary product \u2013 an exercise in [[satire]] produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and [[Marius Maximus]] were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of [[Tacitus]]. (The ''History'' implausibly{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=214}} makes the Emperor Tacitus (275\u2013276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the ''Quadriga tyrannorum''{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 1.2}} \u2014 the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] \u2014 the ''History'' itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': ''homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit'' ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term ''mythistoricis'' occurs nowhere else in Latin.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=76}} Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of [[Aurelian]], in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the [[Praefectus urbi|City Prefect]] of Rome during the festival of [[Hilaria]] in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=192}}\n\n[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|[[Cicero]], one of the authors whose works the ''Historia Augusta'' references obliquely.]]\nOther examples of the work as a parody can be taken from the names of the ''Scriptores'' themselves. It has been suggested that \"Trebellius Pollio\" and \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\" were invented, with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in Cicero's letters and speeches in the 1st century BC.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} With respect to \"Trebellius Pollio\", this is a reference to Lucius Trebellius, a supporter of [[Mark Antony]] who was mentioned in the [[Philippicae|Philippics]] (''Phil'', 11.14), and another reference to him in ''[[Epistulae ad Familiares]]'' along with the term \"Pollentiam\" reminded the ''History's'' author of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], who was a fellow [[Tribune of the Plebs|Plebeian Tribune]] alongside Lucius Trebellius and a historian as well.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} This is reinforced by noted similarities between the fictitious criticism of \"Trebellius Pollio\" by \"Flavius Vopiscus\" at the start of the ''Life of Aurelian'', with similar comments made by Asinius Pollio about Julius Caesar's [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|published ''Commentaries'']].{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} Significantly, Lucius Trebellius adopted the [[Cognomen]] ''Fides'' for his actions as Plebeian Tribune in 47 BC to resist laws that would abolish debts; later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment, Cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule. According to this theory it is no coincidence that, in selecting the name \"Trebellius Pollio\", the author is playing with the concepts of ''fides'' and ''fidelitas historica'' at the precise point in the lives that are assigned to \"Trebellius Pollio\" and \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\".{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=26}}\n\nIn the case of \"Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius\", it was argued that it too was inspired by the Philippics' reference to \"Caesar Vopiscus\" (''Phil'', 11.11), with Cicero's reference to Vopiscus immediately preceding his reference to Lucius Trebellius.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} The cognomen \"Syracusius\" was selected because Cicero's ''[[In Verrem]]'' is filled with references to \"Syracusae\" and \"Syracusani\".{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} Further, in Cicero's ''[[De Oratore]]'', Cicero refers to Strabo Vopiscus as an authority on humour, during which he refers to the reputation of Sicilians when it came to humour, and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was one of the principal cities of [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} Such references were intended as a \"knowing wink\" to the readers of the ''History'', who would recognise the mockery of the historical material by the author.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} This corresponds with David Rohrbacher's view of the ''History'', who maintains that the author has no political or theological agenda; rather that the ''History'' is the equivalent of a literary puzzle or game, with the reader's understanding and enjoyment of the numerous elaborate and complicated allusions contained within it being the only purpose behind its existence.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=148}}\n\nIn support of this theory, Rohrbacher provides an example with respect to Ammianus Marcellinus' work. In one passage (Amm. 19.12.14), Ammianus describes the Christian emperor Constantius II's attempts to prosecute cases of magic under treason laws, in particular the death penalty applied to those men who were condemned simply for wearing an amulet to ward off diseases: \"''si qui remedia quartanae vel doloris alterius collo gestaret''\" (\"For if anyone wore on his neck an amulet against the quartan ague or any other complaint\").{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=143}} There is a very similar imperial ruling described in the ''Life of Caracalla'' (5.7), which makes no sense in Caracalla's time, and is worded in almost exactly the same way: \"''qui remedia quartanis tertianisque collo adnexas gestarent''\" (\"wearing them around their necks as preventives of quartan or tertian fever\").{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=143}}\n\nOther theories include [[Andr\u00e9 Chastagnol]]'s minimalist opinion that the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races,{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=147}} while Fran\u00e7ois Paschoud proposed that the last books of the ''History'' are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven into the fabric of a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with [[Carus]] substituting for [[Valentinian I]] and Carinus for [[Gratian]].{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=147}}\n\n==Historical value==\nFrom the sixth century to the end of the 19th century, historians had recognized that the ''Historia Augusta'' was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source, and since the 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution.{{sfn|Browning|1983|pp=43,45}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=4}} Older historians, such as Edward Gibbon, not fully aware of its problems with respect to the fictitious elements contained within it, generally treated the information preserved within it as authentic. For instance, in Gibbon's account of the reign of Gallienus, he uncritically reproduces the ''Historia Augusta's'' biased and largely fictional account of that reign.{{sfn|Bray|1997|pp=3\u20134}} So when Gibbon states \"The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul\",{{sfn|Gibbon|1776|loc=Ch. 10}} he is reworking the passage in ''The Two Gallieni'':\n\n<blockquote>I am ashamed to relate what Gallienus used often to say at this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid the ills of mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, he is said to have exclaimed \"What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!\" and when informed that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, \"What! We cannot do without saltpetre!\" and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, \"Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?\" Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Two Gallieni'', 6.1\u20136.8}}</blockquote>\n\nGibbon then noted after this passage: \"This singular character has, I believe, been fairly transmitted to us. The reign of his immediate successor was short and busy; and the historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Constantine could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienus.\"{{sfn|Gibbon|1776|loc=Ch. 10, Note 156}} Modern scholars now believe that Gallienus' reputation was posthumously maligned, that he was one of the main architects of the later Roman imperial structure, and that his reforms were built upon by succeeding emperors.{{sfn|Bray|1997|p=4}}\n\nNevertheless, it is unwise to dismiss it altogether as it is also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus, mentioned in the Life of [[Didius Julianus]], was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as [[Praetorian Prefect]] in 193.{{sfn|Mellor|2002|p=163}} Likewise, the information that [[Hadrian's Wall]] was constructed during Hadrian's reign{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Hadrian'', 11.2}} and that the [[Antonine Wall]] was built during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]]{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Antoninus Pius'', 5.4}} are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the ''Historia Augusta'',<ref group=\"note\">Where other ancient writers (such as Eutropius) speak of a defensive wall in Britain, they have associated it with the activities of Septimius Severus \u2013 see David Shorter's ''Roman Britain: A Sourcebook'' (2008), pp. 113\u2013114.</ref> the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=13}}\n\n===False documents and authorities===\nA peculiarity of the work is its inclusion of a large number of purportedly authentic documents such as extracts from Senate proceedings and letters written by imperial personages.{{sfn|Potter|2005|p=150}}{{sfn|Campbell|1994|p=248}} In all it contains around 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xx\u2013xxi}} Records like these are quite distinct from the rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians \u2013 it was accepted practice for the writer to invent these himself{{sfn|Mehl|2011|p=21}} \u2013 and on the few occasions when historians (such as [[Sallust]] in his work on [[Catiline]] or Suetonius in his ''Twelve Caesars'') include such documents, they have generally been regarded as genuine;{{sfn|Potter|2005|p=149}}  but almost all those found in the Historia Augusta have been rejected as fabrications, partly on stylistic grounds, partly because they refer to military titles or points of administrative organisation which are otherwise unrecorded until long after the purported date, or for other suspicious content.{{sfn|Hadas|2013|pp=356\u2013357}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=6\u20138}}{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nThe ''History'' moreover cites dozens of otherwise unrecorded historians, biographers, letter-writers, knowledgeable friends of the writers, and so on, most of whom must be regarded as expressions of the author's creative imagination.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=98\u201399}} For example, the biographer \"Cordus\" is cited twenty-seven times in the ''History''. Long considered to be a real, but lost, biographer until midway into the 20th century,{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xviii\u2013xix}}{{sfn|Syme|1968|pp=96\u201398}} with a couple of minor exceptions where material claimed to be sourced from Cordus is in reality from Suetonius or Cicero, every other citation is fake, providing details which have been invented and ascribed to Cordus. Cordus is mentioned almost exclusively in those Vitae where the ''History'' used Herodian as the primary source, and his appearances vanish once Herodian's history comes to an end.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=161}}\n\nThe author would also misattribute material taken from a legitimate historian and ascribe it to a fictitious author. For instance, Herodian is used more often than he is explicitly referenced in the ''History''; in addition to the ten times he is correctly cited, three times his material is cited as \"Arrianus\", probably to multiply the author's sources.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=20}} Further, not only does the author copy from Herodian without citation (either direct lifts, abbreviations or supplementations), he often distorts Herodian, to suit his literary objective.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=13}}\n\nThen there is the deliberate citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the ''History's'' sixteen citations of Dexippus are considered to be fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, but rather as a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the ''Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte''. In addition [[Quintus Gargilius Martialis]], who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=160}}\n\n===Examples of false historical events and personages===\nThe untrustworthiness of the ''History'' stems from the multifarious kinds of fraudulent (as opposed to simply inaccurate) information that run through the work, becoming ever more dominant as it proceeds.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=13\u201314}} The various biographies are ascribed to different invented 'authors', and continue with the dedicatory epistles to Diocletian and Constantine, the quotation of fabricated documents, the citation of non-historical authorities, the invention of persons (extending even to the subjects of some of the minor biographies), presentation of contradictory information to confuse an issue while making a show of objectivity, deliberately false statements, and the inclusion of material which can be shown to relate to events or personages of the late 4th century rather than the period supposedly being written about.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=12\u201316}} For example:\n* The biography of Geta states he was born in Mediolanum on 27 May; the year is not specified but it was 'in the suffect consulships of Severus and Vitellius'.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Geta'', 3.1}} He was actually born in Rome on 7 March 189; there was no such pair of suffect [[Roman consul|consuls]] in this or any other year;{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=123}} however, it has been suggested that the names for these persons be amended to be Severus and Vettulenus, and that these men were suffect consuls sometime before 192.{{sfn|Birley|1966|pp=249\u2013253}}\n* In the ''Vita Commodi'', the biography on emperor [[Commodus]], there is much doubt about the authenticity of the sources used and cited. Lampridius (the pseudonym the author works with here) claims to have used Marius Maximus on multiple occasions for his work.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=31}} One instance forms a case in point: Lampridius (supposedly) quotes the senatorial speeches in Maximus\u2019 work which were held after Commodus\u2019 death.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Commodus'', 15.3-5 + 18-21}} However, it is unclear whether the references to Maximus are genuine or made up by the author to give himself a sense of authority and expertise.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=41}} Baldwin thinks that the senatorial speeches are probably a figment of Lampridius\u2019 imagination.{{sfn|Baldwin|1981|pp=138-149}} Molinier-Arbo, however, believes in their authenticity. She suggests that the full report of the ''acta senatus'' (lit. acts of the senate) was handed down in the ''acta urbis'' (a kind of city gazette). Marius Maximus could have used this report for his work and Lampridius could have used it later on.{{sfn|Molinier-Arbo|2010|pp=87-112}}\n* A letter of Hadrian written from Egypt to his brother-in-law [[Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus|Servianus]] is quoted at length (and was accepted as genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century).{{sfn|Raschke|1976|pp=761\u2013762}} Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son [[Lucius Aelius Caesar]]: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136.{{sfn|Habelt|1968|p=121}}{{sfn|Birley|2013|p=3}} The letter is said to have been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the ''History'', in another suspect passage.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=60}} A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Patriarch]], head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, [[Raban Gamliel VI|Gamaliel]].{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=21\u201324}}\n* Decius revives the office of [[Roman censor|Censor]]; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy to hold it in a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on campaign against the [[Goths]]) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Two Valerians'', 5.4\u20136.1}} The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=215}}\n* Valerian holds an imperial council in [[Byzantium]], attended by several named dignitaries, none of them otherwise attested and some holding offices not known to exist until the following century, at which the general 'Ulpius Crinitus' (a name apparently chosen to evoke the military glories of the Emperor Trajan) takes the young Aurelian (destined to be another military Emperor) as his adopted son. There are no grounds to believe this is anything other than invention.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=97}}\n[[File:Trebellianus.jpg|200px|thumb|Trebellianus, one of the fictitious tyrants included in the ''Historia Augusta'', drawn by [[Guillaume Rouill\u00e9]] in  ''[[Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]''- 1553]]\n* In the ''Tyranni Triginta'', the author 'Trebellius Pollio' sets out to chronicle 'the 30 usurpers who arose in the years when the Empire was ruled by Gallienus and Valerian'.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 1.1}} The number 30 is evidently modelled on the notorious '[[Thirty Tyrants]]' who ruled Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War.{{sfn|Bunson|1991|p=414}} The chapter contains 32 mini-biographies.

There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This is one of the strongest indications of the ''History's'' late 4th-century date, as it seems to be a fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=164}}{{sfn|Platnauer|Claudian|1922|loc=''Panegyric on the Consuls Probinus and Olybrius'', Note 1}} Petronius Probus was born in Verona.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1971|pp=739}}\n\n==Marius Maximus or 'Ignotus'?==\nCertain scholars have always defended the value of specific parts of the work. [[Anthony Birley]], for instance, has argued that the lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=14\u201315}} As a result, his translation of the ''History'' for [[Penguin Books]] covers only the first half, and was published as ''Lives of the Later Caesars'', Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these are not part of the original texts, which begin with Hadrian).\n\nHis view (part of a tradition that goes back to J. J. M\u00fcller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as Andr\u00e9 Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus (\"the unknown one\"), the good biographer'.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=33}}{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=15}} His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the ''Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that ''Princeps'' in the History is mainly of good quality.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=31\u201333}} Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=32}} Finally, that the composer of the ''Historia Augusta'' wrote the lives of the emperors through to the ''Life of Caracalla'' (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=32\u201333}} It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus),{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=31\u201332}} as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the ''Life of Geta''.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=44}}\n\nA similar theory to Syme's has been put forward by Fran\u00e7ois Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was probably a satirical poet, in the same vein as [[Juvenal]] and not an imperial biographer at all.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=21}} His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the ''History'', the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the ''History's'' description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=160}} This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=21}} and David Rohrbacher.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n==Literary value==\nThe ''Historia Augusta'' has been described by Ronald Syme as \"the most enigmatic work that Antiquity has transmitted\".{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=4}} Although much of the focus of study throughout the centuries has been on the historical content, since the 20th century there has also been an assessment of the literary value of the work. For much of that time the assessment has been critical, as demonstrated by the analysis put forward by David Magie:\n\n<blockquote>The literary, as well as the historical, value of the Historia Augusta has suffered greatly as a result of the method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xxiii\u2013xxiv}}</blockquote>\n\nM. L. W. Laistner was of the opinion that \"even if the ''Historia Augusta'' was propaganda disguised as biography, it is still a wretched piece of literature\",{{sfn|Laistner|1966|p=180}} while Ronald Syme noted that with respect to the author's Latin prose:\n\n<blockquote>He was not an elegant exponent. His normal language is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions&nbsp;... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=251}}</blockquote>\n\nFurther, the work shows evidence of its having been put together in a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=18\u201319}} Birley sees an example of the carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the ''Life of Marcus Aurelius'' the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}} The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}} However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}}\n\nAlthough these criticisms still form the prevailing view on the ''History's'' literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work,{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=171}}{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=18}} its use of allusion as a vehicle for parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, making it one of the most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=170\u2013172}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=148}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)]] \u2013 about the ''Tyranni Triginta'', one of the books of the ''Historia Augusta''\n* [[Titus Aurelius Fulvus]]\n* [[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|group=note|60em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref            = {{sfnRef|Historia Augusta}}\n|author         = Anonymous\n|title          = Historia Augusta\n|trans-title    = Augustan History\n|url            = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/home.html\n|year           = c. 395\n|language       = Latin\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref        = harv\n|last       = Baldwin\n|first      = Barry\n|title      = Studies on Late Roman and Byzantine History, Literature, and Language\n|url        = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Buo7AAAAMAAJ\n|publisher  = Brill Academic Publishing\n|year       = 1984\n|series     = Volume 12 of London studies in classical philology\n|isbn       = 978-90-70265-56-4\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n|ref        = harv\n|last       = Baldwin\n|first      = Barry\n|title      = Acclamations in the ''Historia Augusta''\n|journal    = Athenaeum\n|publisher  = Pavia\n|location   = Italy\n|volume     = 59\n|pages      = 138-149\n|year       = 1981\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref        = harv\n|last       = Barnes\n|first      = Timothy\n|authorlink = Timothy Barnes\n|title      = The Sources of the Historia Augusta\n|url        = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=KaSgAAAAMAAJ\n|publisher  = Latomus\n|year       = 1978\n|isbn       = 978-2-87031-005-2\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|ref        = harv\n|last       = Baynes\n|first      = Norman Hepburn\n|authorlink = Norman H.
