Until the 3rd century, these sword were very rare and presumably reserved for royalty. They became more attainable in the later 4th and during the 5th century, and are found in many higher class tombs of this period. Their production declined in the 6th century.\n\nBy the last third of the Three Kingdoms period (i.e. 450 AD and beyond), steel making techniques had come from China (possibly during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period in China) and were also employed in Korean swordmaking by all three Korean kingdoms ([[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 2013, a Chinese Character inscription was discovered on a 5th-century sword  from the  [[Geumgwanchong]] tomb in [[Gyeongju]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]].\nThe  scabbard of the sword has the inscription  \u5c12\u65af\u667a\u738b ''Yisaji-wang'' (\"King Isaji\").<ref>[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2014/03/317_138624.html Sword sparks debate], The Korean Times, 4 July 2013.

At this time land warfare consisted mostly of spearmen and bowmen on foot, mounted archers on horseback using two-handed bows, and mounted swordsmen with twin blades. Swords were not a primary weapon for all combat but were instead used mostly for shock attacks, defensive strokes, and for close-in fighting. Blades were heavy as they were made mostly of bronze and later iron, and pommels were often knobbed and used as balances or for very close-in work. Short swords may have been used in follow-up attacks, as short sword carriers were armoured completely.\n\nRecords indicate that the art of sword manufacturing, still in a rudimentary state, may have been transmitted to the Japanese Archipelago from the Korean Peninsula some time in the Three Kingdoms period, along with iron smelting and manufacture and later that of steel work; these methods and techniques, as well as their updates, continued to be transmitted during the [[North South States Period]] to the Japanese Archipelago until connections with the Asian mainland were largely closed off by Japan in the early part of the [[Heian period]] (794 AD to 1195 AD; the early part is considered to have ended in 967 AD).\n\nDuring the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, a limited number of Korean swords were exported for trade missions in Asia. It is likely that Korean swordmaking was influenced by the various influences present in Mongol and Chinese weapon manufacture after Goryeo's submission as a Mongol vassal after [[Mongol invasions of Korea|6 Mongol invasions]] ending in 1259.\n\n===Joseon period ===\n[[File:Hyewon-Ssanggeum.daemu-detail-01.jpg|thumb|Painting of a [[kisaeng]] performing a sword dance ([[Hyewon]], 1805)]]\nThe [[Joseon period]] (15th to 19th centuries) is the \"classical\" era of Korean culture, including the creation of a [[Hangul|national script]] and the suppression of [[Korean Buddhism]] in favour of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. Accompanying the neo-Confucian philosophies was an increased emphasis on the artistic, literary, and academic pursuits, while martial pursuits and training (while still understood to be necessary) declined in cultural stature.\n\nKorean swords were in production mostly for military and ceremonial use; private ownership outside of these purposes was largely restricted to members of the wealthy and/or politically influential classes, and possession by commoners often drew the suspicion of the authorities. Several types of ceremonial swords were made; among these sword types are the jingeom (dragon sword) and ingeom (tiger sword), which by tradition could be forged only at certain times. The highest grade of these, sa-ingeom (four tigers sword) and possibly the sa-jingeom (four dragons sword - none are extant) were reserved for the monarch and could only be made during a window of 2 hours every 12 years. The lower-grade swords - i-jingeom, sam-jingeom, i-ingeom, sam-ingeom (two dragons, three dragons, two tigers, three tigers) - could be made more frequently.\n\nAs only high-quality steel was considered for use in forging military swords, the quantity produced by Korean blacksmiths, even for Korea's own military, was limited (most Korean infantry used spears, tridents, and ranged weaponry such as the crossbow and composite bow, while swords were usually wielded by officers, local magistrates/deputies, and mounted soldiers). In addition, because Korean weapons manufacture was typically dedicated to the production of weapons for military/government use and under close scrutiny by government authorities, it was not uncommon for Koreans (both military personnel and civilians) to import swords, usually from Japan's renowned swordsmiths, in the event that Korean sources could not be secured.\n\nAmong the swords that were produced in Korea for use by its military and law enforcement officials include the [[jedok geom]] and [[bonguk geom]] (both of these refer to both a style of sword as well as a style of bladed combat). Blades were single edged and usually between 3\u20134 feet long; however, certain swords of the jedok geom style could reach a length of 6 feet (while it is unclear as to the style of the swords of Admiral [[Yi Sun-shin]], he is believed to have wielded swords that were almost that size).\n\nThe ''saingeom'' is a type of Joseon-era [[sword]] from Western Korea. It has a 90 centimeter (35-inch) blade, produced primarily by molding rather than hammering.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Modern history===\nKorean swords are very scarce today, since most surviving examples were confiscated and destroyed during the colonial period.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} A systematic attempt was made to collect and destroy all Korean swords, coats of armour, and all Korean martial arts equipment.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The entire history of Korean swords and armour was almost lost forever, along with much of Korea's culture and traditions, because of Japanese colonial policies.<ref>Hong Wontack 1994 Paekchae of Korea and the origin of Yamato Japan, Seoul Kadura International</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2013}}<ref name=\"Coval 1984\">Coval, Dr John Carter and Alan, 1984, \"Korean impact on Japanese culture: Japan's hidden History\" Hollym International Corp., Elizabeth, New Jersey</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2013}}\n\nAfter the liberation of Korea in 1945, ceremonial swords were once again manufactured both in southern and northern Korea, and by the 1960s, sword-making was a vibrant and increasingly secure industry; however, due to the depredations and systematic destruction by the Japanese during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], many traditions and techniques lost and were either completely unrecoverable or had yet to be recovered.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n== Types ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nMany different types of Do and Geom exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swordsofkorea.com/swords.htm|title=Swords Of Korea|website=www.swordsofkorea.com|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>\n\n''Geom'' (\uac80; \u528d) is the Korean word for \"sword\"; it is typically used of double edged swords, but is also applied to single edged swords. ''Yedo'' (\uc608\ub3c4; \u92b3\u5200) is the specific term for a single-edged sword.\nThe [[Muyesinbo]] describes as [[bonguk geom]] or \"national sword\" a double-edged sword closely resembling the [[Eastern Han]] period ''[[jian]]''. This contrasted with the ''[[jedok geom]]'' or \"admiral sword\", the term for the type introduced in the 16th century by [[Li Rusong]], usually about 5\u20136 feet tall and single edged. The sword was also straight and wielded with one or two hands.\n\nElements of the Korean sword include: ''geomjip'' or scabbard, most often of lacquer; ''hyuljo'' or fuller (most genuine Korean swords didn't have a fuller); ''hwando magi'' or collar; ''ho in'' or collar; ''kodeungi'' or hand guard; a ring-design pommel; tassels; a round and wide designed sword guard, or a straight lotus design.<ref name=\"\ubb34\uae30\uc640 \ubc29\uc5b4\uad6c \ud3b8\">\ud55c\uad6d\ud658\uc0c1\uc0ac\uc804.

It is known for having a ring pommel and being single or double edged. Most swords during this time was semi-uniform in nature and many martial arts practitioners tend to recognize this weapon as a \"Genuine Korean Sword\". The Hwandudaedo may have some connection to the Japanese straight swords (tsurugi) and the Chinese Jian.\n \nIn deference to the [[Neo-Confucianism in Korea|Neo-Confucian]] state philosophy during the [[Joseon period]], Korean swords tended to be somewhat shorter than their Japanese or Chinese templates, with a blunted tip and infrequently having a groove the length of the blade. In this way the sword was made to be represented as being as singularly \"unaggressive\" as possible.\n\n*''Geom'' is the generic term for \"sword\", but more specifically also refers to a  shorter straight-blade, double-edged sword with a somewhat blunted tip distinguishes this weapon from its Chinese counterpart, the [[jian]]. As a badge of status rather than a weapon, the Geom was often heavily decorated both on its sheath and grip as well as with engravings and inscriptions on its blade.<ref name=\"autogenerated141\"/>\n*The ''Do'', commonly referred to as a ''Hwando'' or \"military sword\", was a single-edged sword, in use as the stated sidearm of the Korean soldier well into the 19th century. Sometimes referred to as a \"short sword\", relative to the out sized two-handed Sangsoodo, its length of 24 to 34 inches  was comparable to that of the two-handed Japanese Katana which may have been the inspiration for the Ssangsoodo. Reports found in the \"Book of Corrections\", a Korean record of the [[Imjin]] Warum (1592\u20131598) state that Japanese swords taken in combat were readily pressed into service by simply trimming the length of the hilt. Forged of carbon steel the ''Do'' has a single edged, curved blade, a sword guard and a grip, typically of wood. Earlier practice saw the ''Do'' suspended from a cord (Jul) and with a simple metal hanger which allowed the soldier to speedily discard his sheath. In later practice, the sword was suspended from a girdle or belt but retained a simple metal quick-release clip.<ref name=\"autogenerated141\">Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 & PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 2, Chap 2 pg 141</ref>\n*The  ''Ssangsudo'' (\uc30d\uc218\ub3c4; \u96d9\u624b\u5200)  is a double-handed single-edged sword in use only during a limited time, n the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Chinese literature and history both ascribe its adoption as a weapon on the Asian mainland to General Qi Ji-guang (1628\u20131687) who is said to have taken pirate prisoners -[[Wokou]]- during his campaigns in Southern China, wrote about the sword in his manual - Lian Bing Shi Ji - and recommended its use as part of the defense along China's northern border. Since General Qi's training manual Jin Xiao Shin Shu was used in the revamping the Korean Military it followed that this weapon came highly recommended. Nor did the Koreans overlook that oversized swords had been used by Japanese soldiers during the recent conflict as well as during their own experiences with the Wakou. Intended by General Qi to be carried into combat on wagons or by individuals who drew each other's weapon, the Ssangsoodo measured an overall length of 6 feet, two feet of which were to be the grip and another 2 feet forward of the handle to be sheathed in brass or copper. Undoubtedly the length and weight of the sword, and the high level of training necessary to wield it, made the sword impractical as a common part of the Korean arsenal. It is also useful to note that the Ming Dynasty, which saw this weapon added to its own military, fell to the Manchu invaders some 50 years later.<ref>Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 & PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 2, Chap 1, pg 129</ref>\n*The '' Hyup Do'' or  \"spear sword\") is found in Book Three, Chapter seven.

Until the 3rd century, these sword were very rare and presumably reserved for royalty. They became more attainable in the later 4th and during the 5th century, and are found in many higher class tombs of this period. Their production declined in the 6th century.\n\nBy the last third of the Three Kingdoms period (i.e. 450 AD and beyond), steel making techniques had come from China (possibly during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period in China) and were also employed in Korean swordmaking by all three Korean kingdoms ([[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 2013, a Chinese Character inscription was discovered on a 5th-century sword  from the  [[Geumgwanchong]] tomb in [[Gyeongju]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]].\nThe  scabbard of the sword has the inscription  \u5c12\u65af\u667a\u738b ''Yisaji-wang'' (\"King Isaji\").<ref>[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2014/03/317_138624.html Sword sparks debate], The Korean Times, 4 July 2013.

At this time land warfare consisted mostly of spearmen and bowmen on foot, mounted archers on horseback using two-handed bows, and mounted swordsmen with twin blades. Swords were not a primary weapon for all combat but were instead used mostly for shock attacks, defensive strokes, and for close-in fighting. Blades were heavy as they were made mostly of bronze and later iron, and pommels were often knobbed and used as balances or for very close-in work. Short swords may have been used in follow-up attacks, as short sword carriers were armoured completely.\n\nRecords indicate that the art of sword manufacturing, still in a rudimentary state, may have been transmitted to the Japanese Archipelago from the Korean Peninsula some time in the Three Kingdoms period, along with iron smelting and manufacture and later that of steel work; these methods and techniques, as well as their updates, continued to be transmitted during the [[North South States Period]] to the Japanese Archipelago until connections with the Asian mainland were largely closed off by Japan in the early part of the [[Heian period]] (794 AD to 1195 AD; the early part is considered to have ended in 967 AD).\n\nDuring the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, a limited number of Korean swords were exported for trade missions in Asia. It is likely that Korean swordmaking was influenced by the various influences present in Mongol and Chinese weapon manufacture after Goryeo's submission as a Mongol vassal after [[Mongol invasions of Korea|6 Mongol invasions]] ending in 1259.\n\n===Joseon period ===\n[[File:Hyewon-Ssanggeum.daemu-detail-01.jpg|thumb|Painting of a [[kisaeng]] performing a sword dance ([[Hyewon]], 1805)]]\nThe [[Joseon period]] (15th to 19th centuries) is the \"classical\" era of Korean culture, including the creation of a [[Hangul|national script]] and the suppression of [[Korean Buddhism]] in favour of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. Accompanying the neo-Confucian philosophies was an increased emphasis on the artistic, literary, and academic pursuits, while martial pursuits and training (while still understood to be necessary) declined in cultural stature.\n\nKorean swords were in production mostly for military and ceremonial use; private ownership outside of these purposes was largely restricted to members of the wealthy and/or politically influential classes, and possession by commoners often drew the suspicion of the authorities. Several types of ceremonial swords were made; among these sword types are the jingeom (dragon sword) and ingeom (tiger sword), which by tradition could be forged only at certain times. The highest grade of these, sa-ingeom (four tigers sword) and possibly the sa-jingeom (four dragons sword - none are extant) were reserved for the monarch and could only be made during a window of 2 hours every 12 years. The lower-grade swords - i-jingeom, sam-jingeom, i-ingeom, sam-ingeom (two dragons, three dragons, two tigers, three tigers) - could be made more frequently.\n\nAs only high-quality steel was considered for use in forging military swords, the quantity produced by Korean blacksmiths, even for Korea's own military, was limited (most Korean infantry used spears, tridents, and ranged weaponry such as the crossbow and composite bow, while swords were usually wielded by officers, local magistrates/deputies, and mounted soldiers). In addition, because Korean weapons manufacture was typically dedicated to the production of weapons for military/government use and under close scrutiny by government authorities, it was not uncommon for Koreans (both military personnel and civilians) to import swords, usually from Japan's renowned swordsmiths, in the event that Korean sources could not be secured.\n\nAmong the swords that were produced in Korea for use by its military and law enforcement officials include the [[jedok geom]] and [[bonguk geom]] (both of these refer to both a style of sword as well as a style of bladed combat). Blades were single edged and usually between 3\u20134 feet long; however, certain swords of the jedok geom style could reach a length of 6 feet (while it is unclear as to the style of the swords of Admiral [[Yi Sun-shin]], he is believed to have wielded swords that were almost that size).\n\nThe ''saingeom'' is a type of Joseon-era [[sword]] from Western Korea. It has a 90 centimeter (35-inch) blade, produced primarily by molding rather than hammering.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Modern history===\nKorean swords are very scarce today, since most surviving examples were confiscated and destroyed during the colonial period.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} A systematic attempt was made to collect and destroy all Korean swords, coats of armour, and all Korean martial arts equipment.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The entire history of Korean swords and armour was almost lost forever, along with much of Korea's culture and traditions, because of Japanese colonial policies.<ref>Hong Wontack 1994 Paekchae of Korea and the origin of Yamato Japan, Seoul Kadura International</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2013}}<ref name=\"Coval 1984\">Coval, Dr John Carter and Alan, 1984, \"Korean impact on Japanese culture: Japan's hidden History\" Hollym International Corp., Elizabeth, New Jersey</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2013}}\n\nAfter the liberation of Korea in 1945, ceremonial swords were once again manufactured both in southern and northern Korea, and by the 1960s, sword-making was a vibrant and increasingly secure industry; however, due to the depredations and systematic destruction by the Japanese during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], many traditions and techniques lost and were either completely unrecoverable or had yet to be recovered.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n== Types ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nMany different types of Do and Geom exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swordsofkorea.com/swords.htm|title=Swords Of Korea|website=www.swordsofkorea.com|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>\n\n''Geom'' (\uac80; \u528d) is the Korean word for \"sword\"; it is typically used of double edged swords, but is also applied to single edged swords. ''Yedo'' (\uc608\ub3c4; \u92b3\u5200) is the specific term for a single-edged sword.\nThe [[Muyesinbo]] describes as [[bonguk geom]] or \"national sword\" a double-edged sword closely resembling the [[Eastern Han]] period ''[[jian]]''. This contrasted with the ''[[jedok geom]]'' or \"admiral sword\", the term for the type introduced in the 16th century by [[Li Rusong]], usually about 5\u20136 feet tall and single edged. The sword was also straight and wielded with one or two hands.\n\nElements of the Korean sword include: ''geomjip'' or scabbard, most often of lacquer; ''hyuljo'' or fuller (most genuine Korean swords didn't have a fuller); ''hwando magi'' or collar; ''ho in'' or collar; ''kodeungi'' or hand guard; a ring-design pommel; tassels; a round and wide designed sword guard, or a straight lotus design.<ref name=\"\ubb34\uae30\uc640 \ubc29\uc5b4\uad6c \ud3b8\">\ud55c\uad6d\ud658\uc0c1\uc0ac\uc804.

It is known for having a ring pommel and being single or double edged. Most swords during this time was semi-uniform in nature and many martial arts practitioners tend to recognize this weapon as a \"Genuine Korean Sword\". The Hwandudaedo may have some connection to the Japanese straight swords (tsurugi) and the Chinese Jian.\n \nIn deference to the [[Neo-Confucianism in Korea|Neo-Confucian]] state philosophy during the [[Joseon period]], Korean swords tended to be somewhat shorter than their Japanese or Chinese templates, with a blunted tip and infrequently having a groove the length of the blade. In this way the sword was made to be represented as being as singularly \"unaggressive\" as possible.\n\n*''Geom'' is the generic term for \"sword\", but more specifically also refers to a  shorter straight-blade, double-edged sword with a somewhat blunted tip distinguishes this weapon from its Chinese counterpart, the [[jian]]. As a badge of status rather than a weapon, the Geom was often heavily decorated both on its sheath and grip as well as with engravings and inscriptions on its blade.<ref name=\"autogenerated141\"/>\n*The ''Do'', commonly referred to as a ''Hwando'' or \"military sword\", was a single-edged sword, in use as the stated sidearm of the Korean soldier well into the 19th century. Sometimes referred to as a \"short sword\", relative to the out sized two-handed Sangsoodo, its length of 24 to 34 inches  was comparable to that of the two-handed Japanese Katana which may have been the inspiration for the Ssangsoodo. Reports found in the \"Book of Corrections\", a Korean record of the [[Imjin]] Warum (1592\u20131598) state that Japanese swords taken in combat were readily pressed into service by simply trimming the length of the hilt. Forged of carbon steel the ''Do'' has a single edged, curved blade, a sword guard and a grip, typically of wood. Earlier practice saw the ''Do'' suspended from a cord (Jul) and with a simple metal hanger which allowed the soldier to speedily discard his sheath. In later practice, the sword was suspended from a girdle or belt but retained a simple metal quick-release clip.<ref name=\"autogenerated141\">Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 & PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 2, Chap 2 pg 141</ref>\n*The  ''Ssangsudo'' (\uc30d\uc218\ub3c4; \u96d9\u624b\u5200)  is a double-handed single-edged sword in use only during a limited time, n the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Chinese literature and history both ascribe its adoption as a weapon on the Asian mainland to General Qi Ji-guang (1628\u20131687) who is said to have taken pirate prisoners -[[Wokou]]- during his campaigns in Southern China, wrote about the sword in his manual - Lian Bing Shi Ji - and recommended its use as part of the defense along China's northern border. Since General Qi's training manual Jin Xiao Shin Shu was used in the revamping the Korean Military it followed that this weapon came highly recommended. Nor did the Koreans overlook that oversized swords had been used by Japanese soldiers during the recent conflict as well as during their own experiences with the Wakou. Intended by General Qi to be carried into combat on wagons or by individuals who drew each other's weapon, the Ssangsoodo measured an overall length of 6 feet, two feet of which were to be the grip and another 2 feet forward of the handle to be sheathed in brass or copper. Undoubtedly the length and weight of the sword, and the high level of training necessary to wield it, made the sword impractical as a common part of the Korean arsenal. It is also useful to note that the Ming Dynasty, which saw this weapon added to its own military, fell to the Manchu invaders some 50 years later.<ref>Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 & PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 2, Chap 1, pg 129</ref>\n*The '' Hyup Do'' or  \"spear sword\") is found in Book Three, Chapter seven.

They are the same.\" It is reasonable to conclude that the Hyup Do was much closer to the Japanese Nagamaki.<ref>Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 & PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Book 3, Chap 7, pg 283</ref>\n\n[[File:Korean Wol-do.jpg|thumb|Korean Wol-Do (L) displayed with its Chinese equivalent (R).]] \n*The *[[Woldo]] (\uc6d4\ub3c4; \u6708\u5200)   was a bladed polearm, like its Chinese counterpart the Yaoyindao commonly decorated with a tassel or feather affixed to a prominence on the spine of the bladewhich assisted the person wielding the weapon with identifying the blades' center of mass. \"the length of the handle is six feet, four inches; the length of the blade is two feet eight inches.

ReaScripts can be written in EEL2 (JSFX script), [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascript.php|title=REAPER {{!}} ReaScript|website=reaper.fm|access-date=2017-01-29}}</ref> SWS / S&M is a popular, open-source extension to REAPER, providing workflow enhancements and advanced tempo/groove manipulation functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sws-extension.org/index.php#features|title=SWS / S&M Extension|website=www.sws-extension.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-29}}</ref>\n\nREAPER's interface can be customized with user-built themes. Each previous version's default theme is included with REAPER and theming allows for complete overhauls of the [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]. REAPER has been translated into multiple languages and downloadable language packs are available. Users as well as developers can create language packs for REAPER.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reaper.fm/langpack/|title=REAPER {{!}} Language Packs|website=www.reaper.fm|access-date=2017-01-29}}</ref>\n\n== Included software and plug-ins ==\nReaper comes with a variety of commonly used [[Audio signal processing|audio production effects]]. They include tools such as ReaEQ, ReaVerb, ReaGate, ReaDelay, ReaPitch and ReaComp. The included Rea-plug-ins are also available as a separate download for users of [[List of audio editing software|other DAWS]], as the ReaPlugs VST FX Suite.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/|title=REAPER {{!}} ReaPlugs|website=www.reaper.fm|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nAlso included are hundreds of [[JSFX]] plug-ins<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.reaper.fm/about.php|title=REAPER {{!}} About|website=www.reaper.fm|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref> ranging from standard effects to specific applications for MIDI and audio. JSFX scripts are text files, which when loaded into REAPER (exactly like a VST or other plug-in) become full-featured plug-ins ranging from simple audio effects (e.g delay, distortion, compression) to instruments (synths, samplers) and other special purpose tools (drum triggering, surround panning). All JSFX plug-ins are editable in any text editor and thus are fully user customizable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/js/js.php|title=REAPER {{!}} JSFX Programming|website=reaper.fm|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nREAPER includes no [[Third-party software component|third-party software]], but is fully compatible with all versions of the [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST standard]] (currently VST3) and thus works with the vast majority of both free and commercial plug-ins available. REAPER x64 can also run 32-bit plug-ins alongside 64-bit processes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Video editing ==\nWhile not a dedicated video editor, REAPER can be used to cut and trim video files and to edit or replace the audio within. Common video effects such as fades, wipes and cross-fades are available. REAPER aligns video files in a project, as it would an audio track, and the video part of a file can be viewed in separate video window while working on the project.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.extremraym.com/en/reaper-5-review/#Video_Editing|title=REAPER 5: An Exhaustive Review|date=2015-11-04|newspaper=ExtremRaym|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Control surface support==\nREAPER has built-in support for:\n* BCF2000 \u2013 Behringer's motorized faders control surface, USB/MIDI<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/BCF2000.aspx|title=Behringer - BCF2000|publisher=Behringer.com|accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref>\n* TranzPort \u2013 Frontier Design Group's wireless transport control<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontierdesign.com/Products/TranzPort|title=Frontier Design Group|publisher=Frontierdesign.com|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n* AlphaTrack \u2013 Frontier Design Group's AlphaTrack control surface<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontierdesign.com/Products/AlphaTrack|title=Frontier Design Group|publisher=Frontierdesign.com|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n* FaderPort \u2013 Presonus' FaderPort control surface<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presonus.com/products/FaderPort|title=PreSonus - FaderPort|publisher=Presonus.com|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n* Baby HUI \u2013 Mackie's Baby HUI control surface<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mackie.com/products/babyhui/|title=Mackie - Baby HUI|publisher=Mackie.com|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n* MCU \u2013 Mackie's \"Mackie Control Universal\" control surface<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mackie.com/products/mcupro/index.html|title=Mackie - Mackie Control Universal Pro|author=Marketing Dept|publisher=Mackie.com|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Version history==\n* First public release \u2013 December 23, 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaper.fm/download-old.php?ver=0x&skip=100|title=REAPER - Old Versions|publisher=Reaper.fm|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> as [[freeware]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaper.fm/ |title=REAPER : Latest news |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=7 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615113931/http://www.reaper.fm/ |archivedate=June 15, 2006 }}</ref>\n* 1.0 \u2013 released on August 23, 2006<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaper.fm/download-old.php?ver=1x&skip=100|title=REAPER - Old Versions|publisher=Reaper.fm|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> as [[shareware]]\n* 2.0 \u2013 October 10, 2007\n** 2.43 \u2013  July 30, 2008: [[Beta version|Beta]] [[Mac OS X]] and Windows [[x64]] support.<ref name=\"reaper.fm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.reaper.fm/download-old.php?ver=2x|title=REAPER - Old Versions|publisher=}}</ref>\n** 2.56 \u2013 March 2, 2009: Finalized Mac OS X and Windows x64 ports.<ref name=\"reaper.fm\"/>\n* 3.0 \u2013 May 22, 2009\n* 4.0 \u2013 August 3, 2011\n** Work on [[Linux]] support began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=83324|title=Linux port of reaper/swell - Cockos Confederated Forums|publisher=}}</ref>\n* 5.0 \u2013 August 12, 2015\n** Beta-quality Linux support<ref name=\"extremraym.com\"/><ref name=\"phoronix.com\"/>\n* 5.981 - July 22, 2019\n** Cumulative improvements and enhancements, notably Notation mode MIDI Editor (new in 5.20), VST3 support, Reascript, Video support, Control Grouping, FX Parameter Automation, Envelope modes, new API functions, new Actions, and much more\n* 6.0 \u2013 December 3, 2019\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Music}}\n{{Portal|Record production}}\n* [[Comparison of digital audio editors]]\n* [[Digital audio workstation#List_of_notable_commercial_DAWs|List of digital audio workstation software]]\n* [[List of music software]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.reaper.fm/ REAPER home page]\n{{Audio editors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reaper}}\n[[Category:Audio software|Linux]]\n[[Category:Audio editing software for Linux]]\n[[Category:Digital audio editors for Linux]]\n[[Category:Digital audio workstation software]]\n[[Category:Linux software]]\n[[Category:MacOS audio editors]]\n", "name_user": "Toxide", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIncluded software and plug-ins:capitalization (plural **s** in **DAWs**)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REAPER"}

It was first developed in [[West Germany]] in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone (\"Clear Lemon [[Fanta]]\") and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to [[7 Up]].\n\n==Marketing==\nSprite advertising often makes use of the [[portmanteau]] word ''lymon'', a combination of the words \"lemon\" and \"lime\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2006/scene/columns/subliminal-ads-with-a-twist-of-lymon-1200337893/|title=Subliminal ads with a twist of lymon|last=Bing|first=Jonathan|last2=Bing|first2=Jonathan|date=2006-06-12|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1980s, Sprite had developed a large following among teenagers. In response, Sprite began to cater to this demographic in their advertisements in 1987. \"I Like the Sprite In You\" was the brand's first long-running slogan, and many jingles were produced around it before its discontinuation in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, Sprite revamped their marketing logo, and slogan, as well. The new, more vibrant logo stood out more on packaging, and featured a blue-to-green gradient with silver \"splashes\" and subtle white \"bubbles\" in the background. The product name, \"Sprite\" had a blue backdrop shadow on the logo. The words; \"Great Lymon Taste!\" which had been present on the previous logo, were removed. This logo was used in the United States until 2006, and similar variants were used in other countries until this year as well.\n\nThe brand's slogan was changed to; \"Obey Your Thirst\", and jingles containing it became urban-oriented, featuring a hip-hop theme. One of the first lyrics for the new slogan were: \"never forget yourself 'cause first things first, grab a cold, cold can, and obey your thirst.\u201d Under the new slogan, Sprite tapped into hip-hop culture by leveraging up and coming, as well as underground rap artists including; [[LL Cool J]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[KRS-One]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Grand Puba]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Nas]] and others in television commercials. Sprite expanded its urban connections in the late 1990s by featuring both amateur and accomplished basketball players in their advertisements. To this day, NBA players and hip-hop artists such as [[LeBron James]], [[Vince Staples]], and [[Lil Yachty]] frequently appear in Sprite adverts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/10/lil-yachty-sprite-ad-lebron-james/|title=Lil Yachty Stars in New Sprite Ad With LeBron James - XXL|publisher=|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, one commercial poked fun at products which featured cartoon [[mascots]] in the style of a horror film. In it, the mascot for a fictitious [[orange juice]] drink called \"Sun Fizz\" comes to life, terrifying the kids and mother, and starts to chase them. This commercial is also notorious for ending on a [[cliffhanger]] which still remains unresolved to this day.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1990s, one of Sprite's longest-running ad campaigns was \"[[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant\nHill]] Drinks Sprite\" (overlapping its \"Obey Your Thirst\" campaign), in which the well-liked basketball player's abilities, and Sprite's importance in giving him his abilities, were humorously exaggerated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacafe.com/watch/47179/sprite_and_its_meaning/|title=Video is temporarily not available|first=|last=metacafe.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.advertisementave.com/tv/ad.asp?adid=116 AdvertisementAve.com - A Better Basketball Player?<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013132126/http://advertisementave.com/tv/ad.asp?adid=116 |date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Sprite commissioned graffiti artist Temper to design limited edition art, which appeared on 100 million cans across Europe.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 2004, Coke created Miles Thirst, a vinyl doll voiced by [[Reno Wilson]], used in advertising to exploit the hip-hop market for soft drinks.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2004-04-25-sprite_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Theresa | last1=Howard | title=Coke creates hip-hop figure to inject Sprite with attitude | date=April 26, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a new Sprite logo, consisting of two yellow and green \"halves\" forming an \"S\" lemon/lime design, made its debut on Sprite bottles and cans. The slogan was changed from its long running \"Obey Your Thirst\" to just \"Obey\" in the United States and was outright replaced with \"Freedom From Thirst\" in many countries.

It was first developed in [[West Germany]] in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone (\"Clear Lemon [[Fanta]]\") and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to [[7 Up]].\n\n==Marketing==\nSprite advertising often makes use of the [[portmanteau]] word ''lymon'', a combination of the words \"lemon\" and \"lime\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2006/scene/columns/subliminal-ads-with-a-twist-of-lymon-1200337893/|title=Subliminal ads with a twist of lymon|last=Bing|first=Jonathan|last2=Bing|first2=Jonathan|date=2006-06-12|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1980s, Sprite had developed a large following among teenagers. In response, Sprite began to cater to this demographic in their advertisements in 1987. \"I Like the Sprite In You\" was the brand's first long-running slogan, and many jingles were produced around it before its discontinuation in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, Sprite revamped their marketing logo, and slogan, as well. The new, more vibrant logo stood out more on packaging, and featured a blue-to-green gradient with silver \"splashes\" and subtle white \"bubbles\" in the background. The product name, \"Sprite\" had a blue backdrop shadow on the logo. The words; \"Great Lymon Taste!\" which had been present on the previous logo, were removed. This logo was used in the United States until 2006, and similar variants were used in other countries until this year as well.\n\nThe brand's slogan was changed to; \"Obey Your Thirst\", and jingles containing it became urban-oriented, featuring a hip-hop theme. One of the first lyrics for the new slogan were: \"never forget yourself 'cause first things first, grab a cold, cold can, and obey your thirst.\u201d Under the new slogan, Sprite tapped into hip-hop culture by leveraging up and coming, as well as underground rap artists including; [[LL Cool J]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[KRS-One]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Grand Puba]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Nas]] and others in television commercials. Sprite expanded its urban connections in the late 1990s by featuring both amateur and accomplished basketball players in their advertisements. To this day, NBA players and hip-hop artists such as [[LeBron James]], [[Vince Staples]], and [[Lil Yachty]] frequently appear in Sprite adverts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/10/lil-yachty-sprite-ad-lebron-james/|title=Lil Yachty Stars in New Sprite Ad With LeBron James - XXL|publisher=|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, one commercial poked fun at products which featured cartoon [[mascots]] in the style of a horror film. In it, the mascot for a fictitious [[orange juice]] drink called \"Sun Fizz\" comes to life, terrifying the kids and mother, and starts to chase them. This commercial is also notorious for ending on a [[cliffhanger]] which still remains unresolved to this day.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1990s, one of Sprite's longest-running ad campaigns was \"[[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant\nHill]] Drinks Sprite\" (overlapping its \"Obey Your Thirst\" campaign), in which the well-liked basketball player's abilities, and Sprite's importance in giving him his abilities, were humorously exaggerated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacafe.com/watch/47179/sprite_and_its_meaning/|title=Video is temporarily not available|first=|last=metacafe.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.advertisementave.com/tv/ad.asp?adid=116 AdvertisementAve.com - A Better Basketball Player?<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013132126/http://advertisementave.com/tv/ad.asp?adid=116 |date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Sprite commissioned graffiti artist Temper to design limited edition art, which appeared on 100 million cans across Europe.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 2004, Coke created Miles Thirst, a vinyl doll voiced by [[Reno Wilson]], used in advertising to exploit the hip-hop market for soft drinks.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2004-04-25-sprite_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Theresa | last1=Howard | title=Coke creates hip-hop figure to inject Sprite with attitude | date=April 26, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a new Sprite logo, consisting of two yellow and green \"halves\" forming an \"S\" lemon/lime design, made its debut on Sprite bottles and cans.
