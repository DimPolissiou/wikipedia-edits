There are 11 men's teams, 11 women's teams, and one co-ed team.  The club teams also compete as the Leopards.  Though not a varsity sport, crew and ice hockey are very competitive at Lafayette and play in intercollegiate club leagues.\n\nLafayette's primary rival in every sport is the [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks]] of nearby [[Lehigh University]]. [[Bucknell University]] is also a major rival and other league and school rivalries exist on an individual sport level.\n\nLafayette's student-athletes generally lead the NCAA in academic performance.  In 2011, 16 of Lafayette's 23 teams academic performance scored within the top ten percent of their respective sport. Lafayette led the Patriot League, which placed second behind the [[Ivy League]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lafayette Sets Bar in Patriot League Academic Performance|url=http://www.goleopards.com/genrel/051711aaa.html|work=Lafayette Athletics|publisher=Lafayette College|accessdate=August 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLafayette's first recorded athletic event outside of the student body was a baseball game against Easton amateurs, a 44\u201311 win on November 8, 1865. The first recorded intercollegiate match was a 45\u201345 tie in a baseball game against Lehigh in October 1869.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\">{{cite book|last=March|first=Francis A.|title=Athletics at Lafayette College|year=1926|publisher=Lafayette College|location=Easton, PA|pages=272}}</ref>\n\n==Nickname==\nThe first athletic teams at Lafayette were nicknamed the 'Maroon' as a result of the maroon sweaters worn by the players. Though the team continued to wear maroon, a new nickname was bestowed on Lafayette.  The Lafayette Student Council voted on the nickname \"Leopards\" since many other rival schools, such as Princeton, Pittsburgh, and Bucknell, had animal nicknames. It is not clear why the nickname \"Leopards\" was selected, although it is reasonable to speculate that an 'L' nickname was ideal since other schools had animal nicknames that started with the school's first letter (Pittsburgh Panthers, Bucknell Bison). The leopard was also selected because its 'cunning and physical strength, combined with the fact that it is irresistible when aroused, seemed to be typical of a Lafayette team.' The Leopard mascot made its debut against Washington & Jefferson University at Yankee Stadium on October 25, 1924, a 20\u20136 Leopard victory.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lafayette Chooses Leopard as Symbol of its Teams|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 October 1924}}</ref>\n\nIt was previously believed that the nickname Leopards first appeared on November 24, 1924, when a writer at the Easton Express-Times referred to the team as the 'Leopards.' The name was first used on campus when Lafayette sports editor George Parkman referred to the team as the 'Leopards' on October 7, 1927.  Parkman noticed that other competitors were selecting animal nicknames and decided Lafayette should have one.<ref name=\"Davidson and Donchez 1997 268\">{{cite book|last=Davidson and Donchez|first=Todd and Bob|title=Legends of Lehigh - Lafayette|year=1997|publisher=D&D Publishing Company|location=Bethlehem, PA|isbn=0-9640341-1-5|pages=268}}</ref> Given the two different accounts of the nickname 'Leopard', it seems the nickname was slow to resonate with students and alumni.\n\n==History==\nBaseball was the first organized sport on campus, with a club formally organized in March 1860.  Games would be played amongst the students until Lafayette teams began playing amateur clubs from the region.  Lafayette met Lehigh in its first intercollegiate game in October 1869, a 45\u201345 tie in Easton, and earned its first win against Lehigh, a 31\u201324 decision in Bethlehem. Lafayette's first non-Lehigh college game was a 26\u201311 loss to [[Princeton Tigers|Princeton University]] in May 1874.\n\nFootball appeared on campus in 1878, and did not become fully organized until 1880. The first games took place in 1882, when Lafayette lost to [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]].  The team earned its first win ever against Rutgers the following year.\n\nInterest in football became so great that by 1889, a field was needed to handle the crowds and earn revenue for the team to compete against a schedule. The Alumni Advisory Committee was formed to handle all aspects of facilities, management, and equipment fundraising, although players were still largely responsible for their own equipment and health. By 1894, March Field was complete and featured a track meet at the dedication.\n\n[[Lafayette Leopards football|Football]] quickly became the marquis sport at Lafayette as students, alumni, and citizens of Easton packed March Field through 1925. Lafayette became the first non-[[Ivy League]] school to win a national football championship in 1896.  The team continued to enjoy success through the 1920s by winning two national championships and becoming one of the top football teams in the East and the United States. In 1926, [[Fisher Field]] was built to capitalize upon the excitement of football, as well as Alumni Gymnasium in order to house other athletic programs and provide general training for the student body.\n\nLafayette was independent in football until 1929, when it joined the [[Middle Three Conference]] with [[Lehigh University]] and [[Rutgers University]].\n\nWith the decline of football as a national power in the 1950s, basketball became a popular sport.  The Leopards made appearances in the NCAA Tournament and the more noted NIT Tournament.  Also, Lafayette baseball made several trips to the [[College World Series]] in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1958, Lafayette helped form the Middle America Conference (MAC), which soon became known as the more recognized [[East Coast Conference (Division I)|East Coast Conference]]. All Leopard teams aside from football competed in the conference.\n\nThe Leopards continued to play \"major\" college football through the 1970s, until the NCAA reclassified the divisions. Lafayette soon found itself as a member in [[Division I-AA]], where Lafayette remains a member today (now known as the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|FCS Subdivision]]. At this time, Lafayette's major rivalry with Rutgers ended, also due to Rutgers' increasing size and competitiveness in football. In search of an athletic league with more like-minded institutions focused on academic scholarship and non-athletic scholarship financing for student-athletes, Lafayette co-founded the [[Patriot League]] in 1986. A major objective of the league was to serve as non-conference football opponents for the [[Ivy League]].\n\nAs women matriculated at Lafayette in 1970, teams were quickly established in basketball and field hockey.  Lafayette quickly became a mid-major power in women's lacrosse and field hockey, which continued into the 21st century.  The field hockey team currently ranks in the top 20 for all-time victories.\n\nLafayette continued offering non-scholarship athletic financial aid through the 1990s, when [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] started offering athletic scholarships for their basketball teams. Other schools followed suit except Lafayette, which held out until 2006, three years longer than the last holdout (Bucknell).  At the time, Lafayette was the lone school in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] aside from the Ivy League not offer athletic scholarships in any sports. Along with basketball athletic scholarships, Lafayette offers scholarships in field hockey and men's soccer.  In 2012, Lafayette, along with the rest of the Patriot League, elected to award football scholarships starting with the class of 2017.  Scholarships in other sports will follow suit.\n\n==Varsity sports==\nLafayette sponsors 23 [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] sports, the highest level of competition in college athletics. All sports compete in the [[Patriot League]].\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''Men's sports'''\n* Baseball\n* Basketball\n* Cross Country\n* Football\n* Golf\n* Lacrosse\n* Soccer\n* Swimming & Diving\n* Tennis\n* Track & Field, Indoor\n* Track & Field, Outdoor\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n'''Women's sports'''\n* Basketball\n* Cross Country\n* Field Hockey\n* Lacrosse\n* Soccer\n* Softball\n* Swimming & Diving\n* Tennis\n* Track & Field, Indoor\n* Track & Field, Outdoor\n* Volleyball\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n'''Co-ed sports'''\n* Fencing\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Baseball===\nBaseball is the oldest sport at the College, with a club team competing on a College Hill since March 1860.  The team's first official game was a 44-11 win on November 8, 1865 against amateurs from Easton. The first recorded intercollegiate match was a 45-45 tie in a baseball game against Lehigh in October 1869 and its first win against Lehigh 31\u201324 shortly thereafter.\n\nAside from its traditional Ivy League and local rivals, Lafayette developed a rivalry with the [[University of North Carolina]] and the [[University of South Carolina]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. Games were played on March Field, and were later played at Fisher Stadium. Once the Metzgar Athletic Complex was built in the late 1960s, the team moved its field to what is now known as Kamine Stadium.\n\nLafayette has made four appearances in the [[College World Series]] in the 1950s and 1960s, the final round of the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]]. Coached by former major leaguer [[Charlie Gelbert]], the Leopards made it the semi-finals in [[1953 College World Series|1953]] before bowing to the [[Texas Longhorns baseball|University of Texas]], finishing third. Lafayette eliminated [[Stanford Cardinal baseball|Stanford]] and [[Boston College]], with their only losses coming against Texas. Lafayette did not win a game in its other trips in [[1954 College World Series|1954]], [[1958 College World Series|1958]], and [[1965 College World Series|1965]].\n\nLafayette won the [[East Coast Conference (Division I)|East Coast Conference]] in 1990 and Patriot League title 2007 to earn a trip to the NCAA Regionals.\n\nThe most noted Lafayette baseball player is current [[Chicago Cubs]] manager [[Joe Maddon]], who played on the team in the early 1970s.\n\nLafayette is 1755-1563-32 all-time.\n* College World Series appearances (4): 1953, 1954, 1958, 1965\n* NCAA Regionals appearances (2): 1990, 2007\n* Conference Championships (2): 1990 (ECC), 2007\n\n===Men's basketball===\n{{main|Lafayette Leopards men's basketball}}\n\nLafayette has a storied basketball tradition that entails multiple NCAA and NIT bids, conference championships, and legendary college basketball players and coaches.  Lafayette was independent until 1958, when it joined the [[East Coast Conference (Division I)|East Coast Conference]].  The Leopards were members until 1990, when they left as a founding member of the [[Patriot League]], their current affiliation.\n\nBasketball gained popularity at Lafayette following World War II.  Up until that point, Lafayette's teams were competitive but did not achieve much national or regional distinction. [[Pete Carril]], the legendary hall of fame coach of the [[Princeton Tigers]], played for the Leopards in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Lafayette was coached during the era by [[Butch Van Breda Kolff]], the first coaching job of the future Princeton Final Four and Los Angeles Lakers coach. Van Breda Kolff led the Leopards to their first postseason appearance, the [[1955 National Invitation Tournament]]. The NIT was considered the more prestigious postseason tournament at the time, possibly because all games were played at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The Leopards fell to [[Niagara University]] in the first round. Under new head coach George Davidson, the Leopards returned to the NIT in [[1956 National Invitation Tournament|1956]], where they fell to [[St. Francis College|St. Francis (NY)]].<ref name=\"Traditions\">{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lafa/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/traditions-11.pdf|work=Lafayette Men's Basketball Media Guide 2011-12|publisher=Lafayette College|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Leopards qualified for their third straight postseason tournament the following year, but were invited to the [[1957 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1957 NCAA Tournament]] instead.  Lafayette received the first seed in the seven team Eastern Regional, but fell to [[Syracuse University]] 75\u201371 in the semifinals at the [[Palestra]].\n\nLafayette basketball re-emerged as a power in the late 1960s under [[Hal Wissel]], a future NBA and Division II national championship coach. Wissel was responsible for recruiting the best player in Lafayette history, Tracy Tripucka. Tracy went on to score 1,973 points, the most in Lafayette history, while leading the Leopards to its first postseason victory.  In the [[1972 National Invitation Tournament|1972 NIT]], Jay Mottola sunk a free throw with three seconds left to upset the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|University of Virginia]]. Lafayette was eliminated in the next round by [[Jacksonville University]]. Aside from being the all-time leading scorer, Tracy was profiled in a Sports Illustrated article.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085663/2/index.htm |work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Sports Illustrated |title=?? |accessdate=12 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110225752/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085663/2/index.htm |archivedate=November 10, 2013 }}</ref>  Following the season, he was selected in the [[1972 NBA Draft]] by the [[New York Knicks]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1972 NBA Draft |url=http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1972&lg=N |accessdate=12 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210010654/http://databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1972&lg=N |archivedate=10 February 2012 }}</ref> The 1972 squad was coached by [[Tom Davis (basketball, born 1938)|Tom Davis]], a future longtime coach of the University of Iowa.  Future national champion head coach [[Gary Williams]] of the [[University of Maryland]] was an assistant on Davis' Lafayette staff.<ref name=\"Traditions\"/>\n\nAnother Tripucka, Tracy's younger brother Todd, led the Leopards to the [[1975 National Invitation Tournament|1975 NIT]], where Lafayette lost to [[St. John's University (New York)]]. Todd Tripucka was second in all-time leading scoring behind his brother before being surpassed by Phil Ness in 1978. Todd Tripucka ranks sixth all-time in scoring as of 2012. The Leopards returned to the NIT in 1980, but were defeated by the University of Virginia.<ref name=\"Traditions\"/>\n\nLegendary coach van Breda Kolff returned to coach the Leopards in 1984 and orchestrated one of the most dynamic upsets in Lafayette basketball history. In an unusual decision, the [[University of Notre Dame]], coached by [[Digger Phelps]] and coming off of a sweet sixteen appearance in 1987, traveled to the [[Kirby Sports Center]] for a nationally televised game. The Leopards dominated 83-68 as Otis Ellis, Lafayette's second all-time leading scorer behind Tracy Tripucka, scored a career high 35 points. Notre Dame qualified for 1988 NCAA Tournament.<ref name=\"Traditions\"/>\n\nThe Leopards returned to the NCAA Tournament under current coach [[Fran O'Hanlon]] in 1999 and 2000. The Leopards were the first basketball team to ever return two conference players of the year from two different seasons (Stefan Ciocisi and [[Brian Ehlers]]). The Leopards were seeded 15 both seasons and fell to Miami and Temple. The 2000 season was the subject of [[The Last Amateurs]], a book by nationally acclaimed author [[John Feinstein]].<ref name=\"Traditions\"/>\n\nUp until 2006, Lafayette was the only team outside of the [[Ivy League]] that did not award athletic scholarships in men's basketball. Other Patriot League teams did not award scholarships, but the policy was gradually dropped by fellow Patriot League schools, leaving Lafayette the lone hold out. With a full scholarship team, the Leopards returned the Patriot League Championship in 2010 for the first time since 2000 and fell to Lehigh. Lafayette lost the 2011 championship game to Bucknell, but the Leopards' double overtime buzzer-beater by Jim Mower against [[American University]] in the semifinals was highlighted as a top ten play on [[ESPN]]. The Leopards finally won the [[2015 Patriot League Men's Basketball Tournament]], and reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2000.\n\nLafayette is 1249-1134 all-time in 102 seasons.\n* NCAA Tournament appearances (3): 1957, 1999, 2000, 2015\n* NIT Tournament appearances (5): 1955, 1956, 1972, 1975, 1980\n* Conference Championships - Regular Season (12): 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1988 (ECC); 1998, 1999, 2000 (Patriot League)\n* Conference Tournament Championships (2): 1999, 2000, 2015\n\n===Women's basketball===\n{{main|Lafayette Leopards women's basketball}}\nThe Lafayette women's basketball team has a strong tradition and has played intercollegiate competition since 1973, two seasons after women were first admitted on campus. For the first half of its history until the Patriot League era in the early 1990s, women's basketball had a winning tradition that entailed five 20-win seasons and five appearances in the ECC Championship game in seven seasons of league play. Additionally, the women had 17 winning seasons in 22 years of play. Since 1993\u201394, the Leopards have had only one winning season. During that span, they have had two double-digit wins seasons: 2007\u201308 and 2010\u201311.\n\nLafayette quickly established a winning tradition. In their fourth season, the Leopards went 10\u20131, followed by a 15\u20133 season in 1976-77. Led by head coach Barbara Young, the Leopards received their first postseason bid to the Eastern Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (EAIAW) playoffs (NCAA predecessor). The Leopards defeated [[Kutztown University of Pennsylvania|Kutztown University]] before bowing out to [[Princeton University]] in their second loss to the Tigers that season. Lafayette qualified again in 1978 and defeated [[Loyola University Maryland|Loyola University (MD)]] before losing to [[Monmouth University]] by one point.\n\nPat Fisher took over the squad in 1980\u201381 and would coach the Leopards for the next 20 seasons. She quickly established strong squads. Her first season entailed another AIAW bid, but the Leopards lost at home to [[Saint Peter's University]], then Saint Peter's College. In 1982\u201383, the Leopards started ECC play and quickly established their dominance in the league. Lafayette won 20 or more games for five straight seasons, including their best record ever of 24\u20136 in 1984\u201385 and 1986\u201387.  Lafayette won the 1985 ECC Tournament Championship by crushing Lehigh by 20 and defeated the Mountain Hawks for the second title in 1987.  Lafayette made the championship game in 1984, 1986, and 1988, but lost to [[Drexel University]] and the [[University of Delaware]] twice by a combined 11 points.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Leopards were led by their best players in history. Maureen McManus and Stacey Cagnello, who played together from 1983\u20131987, finished first and second on the all-time career scoring list with 1,813 and 1,520 points, respectively. McManus also led the team in rebounding for two seasons. The squad was also led by [[Beth Mowins]], who finished her career as the all-time leader in assists with 703, more than 400 ahead of the current second place leader, and is also ranked 11th in all-time scoring. Mowins later went on to serve as a sportscaster at [[ESPN]] and serves a color commentator for many major college basketball and football games.\n\nThe Leopards entered Patriot League play in 1990-91 and posted two 19-win seasons in 1992 and 1993. In December 1992, Heidi Caruso tied the all-time women's NCAA individual record for steals in a game against [[Kansas State University]] with 14.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official 2007 NCAA Women's Basketball Record Book |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/BKW07.pdf |work=NCAA Records|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref> She still holds the record and led the nation in steals in 1992, 1993, and 1994, with her 1993 and 1994 mark being the third and fourth best individual marks to date. She is the NCAA women's third all-time steals leader. After going 7\u20135 in Patriot League play and 15\u201313 overall in 1997\u201398, the Leopards have not had a winning record in Patriot League play or in a season. Pat Fisher stepped down following 2001 with a 295\u2013284 career mark in 21 years. Tammy Smith promptly took over the program, but the Leopards won only 55 games in nine seasons, including 27 wins in the Patriot League. However, the Leopards made a miracle run to the 2009 Patriot League Championship game. After a 6\u201321 season and only two league wins, the Leopards knocked off American University and Navy to reach the championship game, where the fell by eight to Lehigh.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011-12 Lafayette Women's Basketball Media Guide|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lafa/sports/w-baskbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/mediaguide.pdf|work=Lafayette Athletics|publisher=Lafayette Athletic Department |accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nDiane Nolan took over the program in 2010 and led the Leopards to their second double-digit win total in 13 years. The Leopards are currently led by phenom shot-blocker Danielle Fiacco, who despite missing a portion of the 2010\u201311 season to injury, managed to finish with 71 blocks as a freshman.  Halfway through her sophomore campaign, she set a new Lafayette record with 161 blocks and counting. She finished the season ranked second in the NCAA with 3.73 blocks per game behind Baylor's Brittney Griner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blocked Shots per Game |url=https://www.ncaa.com/stats/basketball-women/d1/current/individual/104|work=Women's Basketball Statistics|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nLafayette is 440\u2013556 all-time in 40 seasons.\n* NCAA Tournament/AIAW appearances (3): 1977, 1978, 1981 (ECC)\n* Conference Championships - Regular Season (3): 1985, 1987, 1988 (ECC)\n* Conference Tournament Championships (2): 1985, 1987 (ECC)\n\n===Cross country (men's and women's)===\nCross Country has been run at Lafayette since there has been a track and field program in the 19th century. The current course is at the Metzger Athletics Complex on Sullivan Trail in Forks Township.\n\nIn the Patriot League era, the men's team had their best team finish in 1997 and 1998, both third-place finishes. The team has finished higher seventh in the championship only once since 2000, when the league had six teams.\n\nDavid Robinson is the most prolific runner in Lafayette's recent history, earning three all-Patriot League selections in 1995, 1996, and 1997.  Lafayette has had ten all-league selections, seventh most in the league.\n\nThe women had their best season in history in 1993, when they won the Patriot League Championship by one point over Lehigh. Three runners placed on the all-league team and coach Julio Piazza won coach of the year accolades. Megan Smith placed in the meet, and would do so again in 1995 and 1996.  She currently holds the 17th best time at the Patriot League meet. Lafayette has had 86 women place on the all-league team, fourth most all-time and 24 ahead of Lehigh. Since 2000, Lafayette has placed higher than sixth only once.\n\nNeither the men's or women's team has ever appeared at the NCAA Championship meet, which dates to the 1930s. A men's and women's individual runner has never qualified for the meet.\n* Men's NCAA Championship appearances (0)\n* Men's Conference Championships (0)\n* Women's NCAA Championship appearances (0)\n* Women's Conference Championships (1): 1993\n\n===Field Hockey===\nLafayette field hockey has been one of the most successful teams in Lafayette athletics history. The squad has won numerous Patriot League Championships, ECAC Championships, two NCAA play-in games, and one NCAA Tournament appearance. The team has also had numerous All-Americans and US national team selections. Overall, Lafayette is currently ranked 12th in all-time NCAA winning percentage with .607 and is tied with [[Ohio State University]] at 15th with 416 all-time victories. Former head coach Ann Gold is ranked 12th in career victories with 294 and 22nd in winning percentage with .607.

In their second season of play, Lafayette went 8-0-1 for their only undefeated season. The Leopards finished 11-1-2 in 1976 before making 14 straight postseason appearances in the EAWIW and ECC. The Patriot League did not host a tournament until 1994.  Ann Gold guided the Leopards to each appearance since her first season in 1982, breaking through for her first ECC Championship in 1987 with a 15-2-5 team. The [[University of Delaware]] entered their meeting with the Leopards on a 17-game ECC unbeaten streak, which ended with tie. In the league tournament, Delaware had won the six previous league championships and never lost to Lafayette until the Leopards prevailed 2\u20131 after three overtimes and two sets of flickoffs. Lafayette won the championship again in 1989 with an 18-4-0 mark. Lafayette won the inaugural Patriot League Championship with a 19-3-0 record and qualified for the ECAC Division I Championships, a regional post-season tournament. Lafayette defeated Princeton and Harvard to capture the title. Lafayette made return trips in 1992, where they fell to [[Rider University]], and defeated Rider and [[West Chester University]] in 1993 to claim the title.  Early Patriot League Champions did not receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament until 1996. During the era, Suzi Farrell finished her career with 79 goals, which currently rank 24th most in NCAA history.

The team finished 19\u20132 and qualified for the NCAA Tournament as the Patriot League champion. Lafayette fell to eventual national champion Maryland 6-0 and finished the season ranked 19 in the top 20. Lafayette repeated their dominant performance in 2002, going 19\u20133 and winning the Patriot League championship. The Leopards lost in an NCAA play-in game to the [[University of California, Berkley]] 1\u20130 in overtime, but finished the season ranked 18. Goaltender Casey Devlin had one of the most prolific single seasons in NCAA history, posting a 19\u20133 mark. Her 19 wins are tied for 11th most in NCAA history and her .864 winning percentage is tied for 18th for a single season, while her career winning percentage ranks 16th all-time. Megan Monahan, Jen Stone, and Meredith Hahn led the Leopard attack and established program marks for goals and assists in a season.<ref name=\"2011 Field Hockey Records\"/><ref name=\"Patriot League\"/>\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the Leopards faced the most challenging era in their history. From 2004 to 2007, the team had four straight losing seasons. In their previous 31 years, Lafayette never had back-to-back losing seasons. As the rest of the Patriot League instituted athletic scholarships, the Leopards were at a competitive disadvantage recruiting top players. The Board of Trustees finally decided to award scholarships in early 2006. But after 24 years, Ann Gold retired following the 2006 season. American University also established a dominant position in the league as carried in a full scholarship team upon joining the league.\n\nThe program plotted a new trajectory under current head coach Andrew Griffiths. With scholarships, the Leopards returned to a winning season in 2008 and 2009. Megan Cicchi established a dominant presence on defense to become one of only seven players to be named to the All-Patriot League team four times. Goaltender Kelsey Anderson was named third-team All-American, the first Lafayette selection since Jen Stone in 2003. In 2010, Lafayette established several NCAA records in a dominant win over Holy Cross. The Leopards' 11 assists rank tied for fifth all-time for most in one game, while their 27 points in one game is tied for 27th all-time. Deanna DiCroce is tied for second all-time in NCAA history with six assists in one game, while Emily Valeo is in a multi-way tie at 24 with four assists.<ref name=\"2011 Field Hockey Records\"/><ref name=\"Patriot League\"/>\n\nIn 2011, the Leopards won their first Patriot League championship since 2002 over Bucknell, ending American University's string of eight consecutive titles. Since the Leopards title run in 2002, Bucknell was the only Patriot League team to defeat American in the tournament. The championship avenged defeats to American in the final in 2009 and 2010.

Founded in 1882, the football team has won three national championships, six [[Patriot League]] championships, six undefeated seasons, and four undefeated, untied seasons.\n\nFor most of its history, Lafayette played an independent schedule until joining the Patriot League in 1986.  Between 1929 and 1975, the Leopards were a part of an unofficial conference, the \u201cMiddle Three Conference,\u201d which consisted of [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]] and [[Lehigh University]]. Today, Lafayette football is most noted for its fierce arch-rivalry with Lehigh, which is the most played rivalry in college football (150 games) and the most consecutive years played (since 1897). [[ESPN]] considers [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"The Rivalry\"]] to be among the top ten in college football,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patriotleague.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100506aad.html |title=ESPN2 and ESPNU to Feature Lafayette-Lehigh Football Rivalry - PATRIOT LEAGUE OFFICIAL SITE |publisher=Patriotleague.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> and was the subject of a PBS documentary narrated by NFL Films voice and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]]. Aside from Lehigh and Rutgers, Lafayette\u2019s primary rivals are Bucknell University and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].\n\nLafayette has produced four consensus All-Americans (FBS),<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/DI/2010/Awards.pdf</ref> 11 FCS All-Americans, four [[College Football Hall of Fame]] players,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> and three College Football Hall of Fame coaches. Lafayette football has produced and nurtured several legendary football personalities, such as [[George Barclay (sportsperson)|George Barclay]], inventor of the football helmet, and [[Jock Sutherland]], legendary coach of the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

Cheerleading at Lafayette is an athletic activity and is supported by the athletic department, which provides a host of services, including sports medicine, strength and conditioning, uniforms, warm-ups and travel. Being a member of the squad requires dedication and time management to balance academics, conditioning, practices, cheerleading at football and basketball games, and performances at various events. The season is nearly year-round, beginning with tryouts in the spring before the squad attends camp and begins practice in August. They cheer for the football team through November before turning to basketball season for both the men's and women's teams, which continues until March. The squad usually practices three to four days a week, depending on the upcoming schedule. The team is led by seniors Allie DeMoncada, Mikee Swick, and Danielle Moran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goleopards.com/cheer/lafa-cheer.html |title=Cheerleading |publisher=goleopards.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>\n\n==Lafayette Sports Network==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe Lafayette Sports Network is the standard in the Patriot League for television coverage and is unrivaled in the nation for a school of Lafayette's size with more than 35 live television broadcasts and more than 80 additional live streaming broadcast productions on GoLeopards.com.

There are 11 men's teams, 11 women's teams, and one co-ed team.  The club teams also compete as the Leopards.  Though not a varsity sport, crew and ice hockey are very competitive at Lafayette and play in intercollegiate club leagues.\n\nLafayette's primary rival in every sport is the [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks]] of nearby [[Lehigh University]]. [[Bucknell University]] is also a major rival and other league and school rivalries exist on an individual sport level.\n\nLafayette's student-athletes generally lead the NCAA in academic performance.  In 2011, 16 of Lafayette's 23 teams academic performance scored within the top ten percent of their respective sport. Lafayette led the Patriot League, which placed second behind the [[Ivy League]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lafayette Sets Bar in Patriot League Academic Performance|url=http://www.goleopards.com/genrel/051711aaa.html|work=Lafayette Athletics|publisher=Lafayette College|accessdate=August 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLafayette's first recorded athletic event outside of the student body was a baseball game against Easton amateurs, a 44\u201311 win on November 8, 1865. The first recorded intercollegiate match was a 45\u201345 tie in a baseball game against Lehigh in October 1869.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\">{{cite book|last=March|first=Francis A.|title=Athletics at Lafayette College|year=1926|publisher=Lafayette College|location=Easton, PA|pages=272}}</ref>\n\n==Nickname==\nThe first athletic teams at Lafayette were nicknamed the 'Maroon' as a result of the maroon sweaters worn by the players. Though the team continued to wear maroon, a new nickname was bestowed on Lafayette.  The Lafayette Student Council voted on the nickname \"Leopards\" since many other rival schools, such as Princeton, Pittsburgh, and Bucknell, had animal nicknames. It is not clear why the nickname \"Leopards\" was selected, although it is reasonable to speculate that an 'L' nickname was ideal since other schools had animal nicknames that started with the school's first letter (Pittsburgh Panthers, Bucknell Bison). The leopard was also selected because its 'cunning and physical strength, combined with the fact that it is irresistible when aroused, seemed to be typical of a Lafayette team.' The Leopard mascot made its debut against Washington & Jefferson University at Yankee Stadium on October 25, 1924, a 20\u20136 Leopard victory.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lafayette Chooses Leopard as Symbol of its Teams|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 October 1924}}</ref>\n\nIt was previously believed that the nickname Leopards first appeared on November 24, 1924, when a writer at the Easton Express-Times referred to the team as the 'Leopards.' The name was first used on campus when Lafayette sports editor George Parkman referred to the team as the 'Leopards' on October 7, 1927.  Parkman noticed that other competitors were selecting animal nicknames and decided Lafayette should have one.<ref name=\"Davidson and Donchez 1997 268\">{{cite book|last=Davidson and Donchez|first=Todd and Bob|title=Legends of Lehigh - Lafayette|year=1997|publisher=D&D Publishing Company|location=Bethlehem, PA|isbn=0-9640341-1-5|pages=268}}</ref> Given the two different accounts of the nickname 'Leopard', it seems the nickname was slow to resonate with students and alumni.\n\n==History==\nBaseball was the first organized sport on campus, with a club formally organized in March 1860.  Games would be played amongst the students until Lafayette teams began playing amateur clubs from the region.  Lafayette met Lehigh in its first intercollegiate game in October 1869, a 45\u201345 tie in Easton, and earned its first win against Lehigh, a 31\u201324 decision in Bethlehem. Lafayette's first non-Lehigh college game was a 26\u201311 loss to [[Princeton Tigers|Princeton University]] in May 1874.\n\nFootball appeared on campus in 1878, and did not become fully organized until 1880. The first games took place in 1882, when Lafayette lost to [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]].  The team earned its first win ever against Rutgers the following year.\n\nInterest in football became so great that by 1889, a field was needed to handle the crowds and earn revenue for the team to compete against a schedule. The Alumni Advisory Committee was formed to handle all aspects of facilities, management, and equipment fundraising, although players were still largely responsible for their own equipment and health. By 1894, March Field was complete and featured a track meet at the dedication.\n\n[[Lafayette Leopards football|Football]] quickly became the marquis sport at Lafayette as students, alumni, and citizens of Easton packed March Field through 1925. Lafayette became the first non-[[Ivy League]] school to win a national football championship in 1896.  The team continued to enjoy success through the 1920s by winning two national championships and becoming one of the top football teams in the East and the United States. In 1926, [[Fisher Field]] was built to capitalize upon the excitement of football, as well as Alumni Gymnasium in order to house other athletic programs and provide general training for the student body.\n\nLafayette was independent in football until 1929, when it joined the [[Middle Three Conference]] with [[Lehigh University]] and [[Rutgers University]].\n\nWith the decline of football as a national power in the 1950s, basketball became a popular sport.  The Leopards made appearances in the NCAA Tournament and the more noted NIT Tournament.  Also, Lafayette baseball made several trips to the [[College World Series]] in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1958, Lafayette helped form the Middle America Conference (MAC), which soon became known as the more recognized [[East Coast Conference (Division I)|East Coast Conference]]. All Leopard teams aside from football competed in the conference.\n\nThe Leopards continued to play \"major\" college football through the 1970s, until the NCAA reclassified the divisions. Lafayette soon found itself as a member in [[Division I-AA]], where Lafayette remains a member today (now known as the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|FCS Subdivision]]. At this time, Lafayette's major rivalry with Rutgers ended, also due to Rutgers' increasing size and competitiveness in football. In search of an athletic league with more like-minded institutions focused on academic scholarship and non-athletic scholarship financing for student-athletes, Lafayette co-founded the [[Patriot League]] in 1986. A major objective of the league was to serve as non-conference football opponents for the [[Ivy League]].\n\nAs women matriculated at Lafayette in 1970, teams were quickly established in basketball and field hockey.  Lafayette quickly became a mid-major power in women's lacrosse and field hockey, which continued into the 21st century.  The field hockey team currently ranks in the top 20 for all-time victories.\n\nLafayette continued offering non-scholarship athletic financial aid through the 1990s, when [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] started offering athletic scholarships for their basketball teams. Other schools followed suit except Lafayette, which held out until 2006, three years longer than the last holdout (Bucknell).  At the time, Lafayette was the lone school in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] aside from the Ivy League not offer athletic scholarships in any sports. Along with basketball athletic scholarships, Lafayette offers scholarships in field hockey and men's soccer.  In 2012, Lafayette, along with the rest of the Patriot League, elected to award football scholarships starting with the class of 2017.  Scholarships in other sports will follow suit.\n\n==Varsity sports==\nLafayette sponsors 23 [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] sports, the highest level of competition in college athletics.

The team's first official game was a 44-11 win on November 8, 1865 against amateurs from Easton. The first recorded intercollegiate match was a 45-45 tie in a baseball game against Lehigh in October 1869 and its first win against Lehigh 31\u201324 shortly thereafter.\n\nAside from its traditional Ivy League and local rivals, Lafayette developed a rivalry with the [[University of North Carolina]] and the [[University of South Carolina]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. Games were played on March Field, and were later played at Fisher Stadium. Once the Metzgar Athletic Complex was built in the late 1960s, the team moved its field to what is now known as Kamine Stadium.\n\nLafayette has made four appearances in the [[College World Series]] in the 1950s and 1960s, the final round of the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]]. Coached by former major leaguer [[Charlie Gelbert]], the Leopards made it the semi-finals in [[1953 College World Series|1953]] before bowing to the [[Texas Longhorns baseball|University of Texas]], finishing third. Lafayette eliminated [[Stanford Cardinal baseball|Stanford]] and [[Boston College]], with their only losses coming against Texas. Lafayette did not win a game in its other trips in [[1954 College World Series|1954]], [[1958 College World Series|1958]], and [[1965 College World Series|1965]].\n\nLafayette won the [[East Coast Conference (Division I)|East Coast Conference]] in 1990 and Patriot League title 2007 to earn a trip to the NCAA Regionals.\n\nThe most noted Lafayette baseball player is current [[Chicago Cubs]] manager [[Joe Maddon]], who played on the team in the early 1970s.\n\nLafayette is 1755-1563-32 all-time.\n* College World Series appearances (4): 1953, 1954, 1958, 1965\n* NCAA Regionals appearances (2): 1990, 2007\n* Conference Championships (2): 1990 (ECC), 2007\n\n===Men's basketball===\n{{main|Lafayette Leopards men's basketball}}\n\nLafayette has a storied basketball tradition that entails multiple NCAA and NIT bids, conference championships, and legendary college basketball players and coaches.  Lafayette was independent until 1958, when it joined the [[East Coast Conference (Division I)|East Coast Conference]].  The Leopards were members until 1990, when they left as a founding member of the [[Patriot League]], their current affiliation.\n\nBasketball gained popularity at Lafayette following World War II.  Up until that point, Lafayette's teams were competitive but did not achieve much national or regional distinction. [[Pete Carril]], the legendary hall of fame coach of the [[Princeton Tigers]], played for the Leopards in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Lafayette was coached during the era by [[Butch Van Breda Kolff]], the first coaching job of the future Princeton Final Four and Los Angeles Lakers coach. Van Breda Kolff led the Leopards to their first postseason appearance, the [[1955 National Invitation Tournament]]. The NIT was considered the more prestigious postseason tournament at the time, possibly because all games were played at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The Leopards fell to [[Niagara University]] in the first round. Under new head coach George Davidson, the Leopards returned to the NIT in [[1956 National Invitation Tournament|1956]], where they fell to [[St. Francis College|St. Francis (NY)]].<ref name=\"Traditions\">{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lafa/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/traditions-11.pdf|work=Lafayette Men's Basketball Media Guide 2011-12|publisher=Lafayette College|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Leopards qualified for their third straight postseason tournament the following year, but were invited to the [[1957 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1957 NCAA Tournament]] instead.  Lafayette received the first seed in the seven team Eastern Regional, but fell to [[Syracuse University]] 75\u201371 in the semifinals at the [[Palestra]].\n\nLafayette basketball re-emerged as a power in the late 1960s under [[Hal Wissel]], a future NBA and Division II national championship coach. Wissel was responsible for recruiting the best player in Lafayette history, Tracy Tripucka. Tracy went on to score 1,973 points, the most in Lafayette history, while leading the Leopards to its first postseason victory.  In the [[1972 National Invitation Tournament|1972 NIT]], Jay Mottola sunk a free throw with three seconds left to upset the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|University of Virginia]]. Lafayette was eliminated in the next round by [[Jacksonville University]]. Aside from being the all-time leading scorer, Tracy was profiled in a Sports Illustrated article.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085663/2/index.htm |work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Sports Illustrated |title=?? |accessdate=12 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110225752/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085663/2/index.htm |archivedate=November 10, 2013 }}</ref>  Following the season, he was selected in the [[1972 NBA Draft]] by the [[New York Knicks]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1972 NBA Draft |url=http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1972&lg=N |accessdate=12 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210010654/http://databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1972&lg=N |archivedate=10 February 2012 }}</ref> The 1972 squad was coached by [[Tom Davis (basketball, born 1938)|Tom Davis]], a future longtime coach of the University of Iowa.

Todd Tripucka was second in all-time leading scoring behind his brother before being surpassed by Phil Ness in 1978. Todd Tripucka ranks sixth all-time in scoring as of 2012. The Leopards returned to the NIT in 1980, but were defeated by the University of Virginia.<ref name=\"Traditions\"/>\n\nLegendary coach van Breda Kolff returned to coach the Leopards in 1984 and orchestrated one of the most dynamic upsets in Lafayette basketball history. In an unusual decision, the [[University of Notre Dame]], coached by [[Digger Phelps]] and coming off of a sweet sixteen appearance in 1987, traveled to the [[Kirby Sports Center]] for a nationally televised game. The Leopards dominated 83-68 as Otis Ellis, Lafayette's second all-time leading scorer behind Tracy Tripucka, scored a career high 35 points. Notre Dame qualified for 1988 NCAA Tournament.<ref name=\"Traditions\"/>\n\nThe Leopards returned to the NCAA Tournament under current coach [[Fran O'Hanlon]] in 1999 and 2000. The Leopards were the first basketball team to ever return two conference players of the year from two different seasons (Stefan Ciocisi and [[Brian Ehlers]]). The Leopards were seeded 15 both seasons and fell to Miami and Temple. The 2000 season was the subject of [[The Last Amateurs]], a book by nationally acclaimed author [[John Feinstein]].<ref name=\"Traditions\"/>\n\nUp until 2006, Lafayette was the only team outside of the [[Ivy League]] that did not award athletic scholarships in men's basketball. Other Patriot League teams did not award scholarships, but the policy was gradually dropped by fellow Patriot League schools, leaving Lafayette the lone hold out. With a full scholarship team, the Leopards returned the Patriot League Championship in 2010 for the first time since 2000 and fell to Lehigh. Lafayette lost the 2011 championship game to Bucknell, but the Leopards' double overtime buzzer-beater by Jim Mower against [[American University]] in the semifinals was highlighted as a top ten play on [[ESPN]]. The Leopards finally won the [[2015 Patriot League Men's Basketball Tournament]], and reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2000.\n\nLafayette is 1249-1134 all-time in 102 seasons.\n* NCAA Tournament appearances (3): 1957, 1999, 2000, 2015\n* NIT Tournament appearances (5): 1955, 1956, 1972, 1975, 1980\n* Conference Championships - Regular Season (12): 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1988 (ECC); 1998, 1999, 2000 (Patriot League)\n* Conference Tournament Championships (2): 1999, 2000, 2015\n\n===Women's basketball===\n{{main|Lafayette Leopards women's basketball}}\nThe Lafayette women's basketball team has a strong tradition and has played intercollegiate competition since 1973, two seasons after women were first admitted on campus. For the first half of its history until the Patriot League era in the early 1990s, women's basketball had a winning tradition that entailed five 20-win seasons and five appearances in the ECC Championship game in seven seasons of league play. Additionally, the women had 17 winning seasons in 22 years of play. Since 1993\u201394, the Leopards have had only one winning season. During that span, they have had two double-digit wins seasons: 2007\u201308 and 2010\u201311.\n\nLafayette quickly established a winning tradition. In their fourth season, the Leopards went 10\u20131, followed by a 15\u20133 season in 1976-77. Led by head coach Barbara Young, the Leopards received their first postseason bid to the Eastern Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (EAIAW) playoffs (NCAA predecessor). The Leopards defeated [[Kutztown University of Pennsylvania|Kutztown University]] before bowing out to [[Princeton University]] in their second loss to the Tigers that season. Lafayette qualified again in 1978 and defeated [[Loyola University Maryland|Loyola University (MD)]] before losing to [[Monmouth University]] by one point.\n\nPat Fisher took over the squad in 1980\u201381 and would coach the Leopards for the next 20 seasons. She quickly established strong squads. Her first season entailed another AIAW bid, but the Leopards lost at home to [[Saint Peter's University]], then Saint Peter's College. In 1982\u201383, the Leopards started ECC play and quickly established their dominance in the league. Lafayette won 20 or more games for five straight seasons, including their best record ever of 24\u20136 in 1984\u201385 and 1986\u201387.  Lafayette won the 1985 ECC Tournament Championship by crushing Lehigh by 20 and defeated the Mountain Hawks for the second title in 1987.  Lafayette made the championship game in 1984, 1986, and 1988, but lost to [[Drexel University]] and the [[University of Delaware]] twice by a combined 11 points.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Leopards were led by their best players in history. Maureen McManus and Stacey Cagnello, who played together from 1983\u20131987, finished first and second on the all-time career scoring list with 1,813 and 1,520 points, respectively. McManus also led the team in rebounding for two seasons. The squad was also led by [[Beth Mowins]], who finished her career as the all-time leader in assists with 703, more than 400 ahead of the current second place leader, and is also ranked 11th in all-time scoring. Mowins later went on to serve as a sportscaster at [[ESPN]] and serves a color commentator for many major college basketball and football games.\n\nThe Leopards entered Patriot League play in 1990-91 and posted two 19-win seasons in 1992 and 1993. In December 1992, Heidi Caruso tied the all-time women's NCAA individual record for steals in a game against [[Kansas State University]] with 14.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official 2007 NCAA Women's Basketball Record Book |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/BKW07.pdf |work=NCAA Records|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref> She still holds the record and led the nation in steals in 1992, 1993, and 1994, with her 1993 and 1994 mark being the third and fourth best individual marks to date. She is the NCAA women's third all-time steals leader. After going 7\u20135 in Patriot League play and 15\u201313 overall in 1997\u201398, the Leopards have not had a winning record in Patriot League play or in a season. Pat Fisher stepped down following 2001 with a 295\u2013284 career mark in 21 years. Tammy Smith promptly took over the program, but the Leopards won only 55 games in nine seasons, including 27 wins in the Patriot League. However, the Leopards made a miracle run to the 2009 Patriot League Championship game. After a 6\u201321 season and only two league wins, the Leopards knocked off American University and Navy to reach the championship game, where the fell by eight to Lehigh.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011-12 Lafayette Women's Basketball Media Guide|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lafa/sports/w-baskbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/mediaguide.pdf|work=Lafayette Athletics|publisher=Lafayette Athletic Department |accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nDiane Nolan took over the program in 2010 and led the Leopards to their second double-digit win total in 13 years. The Leopards are currently led by phenom shot-blocker Danielle Fiacco, who despite missing a portion of the 2010\u201311 season to injury, managed to finish with 71 blocks as a freshman.  Halfway through her sophomore campaign, she set a new Lafayette record with 161 blocks and counting. She finished the season ranked second in the NCAA with 3.73 blocks per game behind Baylor's Brittney Griner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blocked Shots per Game |url=https://www.ncaa.com/stats/basketball-women/d1/current/individual/104|work=Women's Basketball Statistics|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nLafayette is 440\u2013556 all-time in 40 seasons.\n* NCAA Tournament/AIAW appearances (3): 1977, 1978, 1981 (ECC)\n* Conference Championships - Regular Season (3): 1985, 1987, 1988 (ECC)\n* Conference Tournament Championships (2): 1985, 1987 (ECC)\n\n===Cross country (men's and women's)===\nCross Country has been run at Lafayette since there has been a track and field program in the 19th century. The current course is at the Metzger Athletics Complex on Sullivan Trail in Forks Township.\n\nIn the Patriot League era, the men's team had their best team finish in 1997 and 1998, both third-place finishes. The team has finished higher seventh in the championship only once since 2000, when the league had six teams.\n\nDavid Robinson is the most prolific runner in Lafayette's recent history, earning three all-Patriot League selections in 1995, 1996, and 1997.  Lafayette has had ten all-league selections, seventh most in the league.\n\nThe women had their best season in history in 1993, when they won the Patriot League Championship by one point over Lehigh. Three runners placed on the all-league team and coach Julio Piazza won coach of the year accolades. Megan Smith placed in the meet, and would do so again in 1995 and 1996.  She currently holds the 17th best time at the Patriot League meet. Lafayette has had 86 women place on the all-league team, fourth most all-time and 24 ahead of Lehigh. Since 2000, Lafayette has placed higher than sixth only once.\n\nNeither the men's or women's team has ever appeared at the NCAA Championship meet, which dates to the 1930s. A men's and women's individual runner has never qualified for the meet.\n* Men's NCAA Championship appearances (0)\n* Men's Conference Championships (0)\n* Women's NCAA Championship appearances (0)\n* Women's Conference Championships (1): 1993\n\n===Field Hockey===\nLafayette field hockey has been one of the most successful teams in Lafayette athletics history. The squad has won numerous Patriot League Championships, ECAC Championships, two NCAA play-in games, and one NCAA Tournament appearance. The team has also had numerous All-Americans and US national team selections. Overall, Lafayette is currently ranked 12th in all-time NCAA winning percentage with .607 and is tied with [[Ohio State University]] at 15th with 416 all-time victories. Former head coach Ann Gold is ranked 12th in career victories with 294 and 22nd in winning percentage with .607. The Leopards have had 28 winning seasons in 40 years and play their home games at Rappolt Field.<ref name=\"2011 Field Hockey Records\">{{cite web|title=2011 Field Hockey Records|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Stats/Fieldhockey/2011RB.html|work=Field Hockey Statistics|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nLafayette quickly established regional dominance upon the start of women's athletics in 1972. In their second season of play, Lafayette went 8-0-1 for their only undefeated season. The Leopards finished 11-1-2 in 1976 before making 14 straight postseason appearances in the EAWIW and ECC. The Patriot League did not host a tournament until 1994.  Ann Gold guided the Leopards to each appearance since her first season in 1982, breaking through for her first ECC Championship in 1987 with a 15-2-5 team. The [[University of Delaware]] entered their meeting with the Leopards on a 17-game ECC unbeaten streak, which ended with tie. In the league tournament, Delaware had won the six previous league championships and never lost to Lafayette until the Leopards prevailed 2\u20131 after three overtimes and two sets of flickoffs. Lafayette won the championship again in 1989 with an 18-4-0 mark. Lafayette won the inaugural Patriot League Championship with a 19-3-0 record and qualified for the ECAC Division I Championships, a regional post-season tournament. Lafayette defeated Princeton and Harvard to capture the title. Lafayette made return trips in 1992, where they fell to [[Rider University]], and defeated Rider and [[West Chester University]] in 1993 to claim the title.  Early Patriot League Champions did not receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament until 1996. During the era, Suzi Farrell finished her career with 79 goals, which currently rank 24th most in NCAA history. Anne Russell ranks sixth all-time in save percentage with .900, with teammate Eileen Quigley ranked sixth at .899.<ref name=\"2011 Field Hockey Records\"/><ref name=\"Patriot League\">{{cite web|title=2011 Patriot League Field Hockey Record Books |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/patr/sports/w-fieldh/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/2011PLFHRecordBook.pdf|work=Sport-by-Sport Record Books|publisher=Patriot League|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Lafayette had its best season to date. The team finished 19\u20132 and qualified for the NCAA Tournament as the Patriot League champion. Lafayette fell to eventual national champion Maryland 6-0 and finished the season ranked 19 in the top 20. Lafayette repeated their dominant performance in 2002, going 19\u20133 and winning the Patriot League championship. The Leopards lost in an NCAA play-in game to the [[University of California, Berkley]] 1\u20130 in overtime, but finished the season ranked 18. Goaltender Casey Devlin had one of the most prolific single seasons in NCAA history, posting a 19\u20133 mark. Her 19 wins are tied for 11th most in NCAA history and her .864 winning percentage is tied for 18th for a single season, while her career winning percentage ranks 16th all-time. Megan Monahan, Jen Stone, and Meredith Hahn led the Leopard attack and established program marks for goals and assists in a season.<ref name=\"2011 Field Hockey Records\"/><ref name=\"Patriot League\"/>\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the Leopards faced the most challenging era in their history. From 2004 to 2007, the team had four straight losing seasons. In their previous 31 years, Lafayette never had back-to-back losing seasons. As the rest of the Patriot League instituted athletic scholarships, the Leopards were at a competitive disadvantage recruiting top players. The Board of Trustees finally decided to award scholarships in early 2006. But after 24 years, Ann Gold retired following the 2006 season. American University also established a dominant position in the league as carried in a full scholarship team upon joining the league.\n\nThe program plotted a new trajectory under current head coach Andrew Griffiths. With scholarships, the Leopards returned to a winning season in 2008 and 2009. Megan Cicchi established a dominant presence on defense to become one of only seven players to be named to the All-Patriot League team four times. Goaltender Kelsey Anderson was named third-team All-American, the first Lafayette selection since Jen Stone in 2003. In 2010, Lafayette established several NCAA records in a dominant win over Holy Cross. The Leopards' 11 assists rank tied for fifth all-time for most in one game, while their 27 points in one game is tied for 27th all-time. Deanna DiCroce is tied for second all-time in NCAA history with six assists in one game, while Emily Valeo is in a multi-way tie at 24 with four assists.<ref name=\"2011 Field Hockey Records\"/><ref name=\"Patriot League\"/>\n\nIn 2011, the Leopards won their first Patriot League championship since 2002 over Bucknell, ending American University's string of eight consecutive titles. Since the Leopards title run in 2002, Bucknell was the only Patriot League team to defeat American in the tournament. The championship avenged defeats to American in the final in 2009 and 2010. Lafayette fell to [[Ohio University]] 2\u20131 in overtime.<ref name=\"Patriot League\"/>\n\nLafayette has the most Patriot League team selections and tournament appearances.\n\nLafayette is 416-260-45 all-time in 39 years.\n\n*NCAA Tournament/AIAW appearances (6): 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1999\n*NCAA Tournament Play-in Game (2): 2002, 2011\n*ECAC Tournament Championships (2): 1990, 1993\n*ECAC Tournament appearances (3): 1990, 1992, 1993\n*Conference Championships - Regular Season (11): 1987, 1989 (ECC); 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2002\n*Conference Tournament Championships (6): 1987, 1989 (ECC); 1995, 1999, 2002, 2011\n*All-American selections (6): Suzi Farrell 1990, Andrea Dagostino 1993, Kim Stone 1999, Megan Monahan 2002, Jen Stone 2003, Kelsey Andersen 2009\n\n===Football===\n{{main|Lafayette Leopards football}}\n\nLafayette football is one of the oldest collegiate football programs in the nation. Founded in 1882, the football team has won three national championships, six [[Patriot League]] championships, six undefeated seasons, and four undefeated, untied seasons.\n\nFor most of its history, Lafayette played an independent schedule until joining the Patriot League in 1986.  Between 1929 and 1975, the Leopards were a part of an unofficial conference, the \u201cMiddle Three Conference,\u201d which consisted of [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]] and [[Lehigh University]]. Today, Lafayette football is most noted for its fierce arch-rivalry with Lehigh, which is the most played rivalry in college football (150 games) and the most consecutive years played (since 1897). [[ESPN]] considers [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"The Rivalry\"]] to be among the top ten in college football,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patriotleague.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100506aad.html |title=ESPN2 and ESPNU to Feature Lafayette-Lehigh Football Rivalry - PATRIOT LEAGUE OFFICIAL SITE |publisher=Patriotleague.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> and was the subject of a PBS documentary narrated by NFL Films voice and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]]. Aside from Lehigh and Rutgers, Lafayette\u2019s primary rivals are Bucknell University and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].\n\nLafayette has produced four consensus All-Americans (FBS),<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/DI/2010/Awards.pdf</ref> 11 FCS All-Americans, four [[College Football Hall of Fame]] players,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> and three College Football Hall of Fame coaches.

He is a founding partner at strategic communications firm [[Charlotte Street Partners]] and chairs the Sustainable Growth Commission reporting to the [[First Minister of Scotland]].\n\n==Early life==\nWhilst attending the [[University of Strathclyde]], [[Glasgow]], (from where he graduated in 1992 with a degree in economics and politics) Wilson was elected Vice President of the Students Association and became National [[Convener]] of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) student organisation, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. He joined the [[Government Economic Service]] after graduation, serving with the [[Forestry Commission]] and [[Scottish Office]], and in 1996 he started work at SNP Headquarters, [[Edinburgh]], as a researcher to the Director of [[Business for Scotland]], before entering employment with the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] as a business economist in 1997.\n\n==Member of Scottish Parliament==\nWilson was [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|elected to the first session]] of the newly re-established [[Scottish Parliament]],  as one of five SNP MSPs to represent [[Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Central Scotland]] through the [[Additional Members System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/msps/32261.aspx |title=Previous MSPs: Session 1 (1999-2003): Andrew Wilson |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhilst an MSP he served variously in the Shadow Cabinet as the SNP Finance, Economy, Lifelong Learning and Transport Spokesperson. He was widely viewed by commentators as a rising star of the SNP, an iconoclast and pro-market economist he made much headway selling the idea of [[fiscal autonomy]] now called 'Devo-Max' to the mainstream business, media and society. It was adopted by ''[[The Scotsman]]'', a [[Unionists (Scotland)|unionist]] newspaper and later went on to win support across the political spectrum. He gave a controversial lecture at the party conference in 1999 promoting the idea Britishness could, should, and would survive independence.

He is a founding partner at strategic communications firm [[Charlotte Street Partners]] and chairs the Sustainable Growth Commission reporting to the [[First Minister of Scotland]].\n\n==Early life==\nWhilst attending the [[University of Strathclyde]], [[Glasgow]], (from where he graduated in 1992 with a degree in economics and politics) Wilson was elected Vice President of the Students Association and became National [[Convener]] of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) student organisation, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. He joined the [[Government Economic Service]] after graduation, serving with the [[Forestry Commission]] and [[Scottish Office]], and in 1996 he started work at SNP Headquarters, [[Edinburgh]], as a researcher to the Director of [[Business for Scotland]], before entering employment with the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] as a business economist in 1997.\n\n==Member of Scottish Parliament==\nWilson was [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|elected to the first session]] of the newly re-established [[Scottish Parliament]],  as one of five SNP MSPs to represent [[Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Central Scotland]] through the [[Additional Members System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/msps/32261.aspx |title=Previous MSPs: Session 1 (1999-2003): Andrew Wilson |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhilst an MSP he served variously in the Shadow Cabinet as the SNP Finance, Economy, Lifelong Learning and Transport Spokesperson. He was widely viewed by commentators as a rising star of the SNP, an iconoclast and pro-market economist he made much headway selling the idea of [[fiscal autonomy]] now called 'Devo-Max' to the mainstream business, media and society. It was adopted by ''[[The Scotsman]]'', a [[Unionists (Scotland)|unionist]] newspaper and later went on to win support across the political spectrum. He gave a controversial lecture at the party conference in 1999 promoting the idea Britishness could, should, and would survive independence. He later wrote a column for the Sunday Mail calling on Scots to support the English football team in the 2002 world cup finals. In policy he is credited with much of the work on the SNP's alternative to the [[private finance initiative]], now The Scottish Futures Trust.

When he was two years old, the family immigrated to the East New York section of [[Brooklyn]], and then to the [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]] section of [[Brooklyn]], where he grew up. In 1966, at age 17, he immigrated to Israel, and continued his Torah studies.\n\nLitzman is married, has five children, and lives in Jerusalem. He is quoted as saying that, \"in some respects, I envy the low profile the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community in the United States has been able to retain by staying out of politics\". He also said that, in Israel, the media attention makes for misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the Haredi community.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Brooklyn-bred Hasid Takes Position of Power in Israel| url=http://www.forward.com/articles/brooklyn-bred-hasid-takes-position-of-power-in-isr/| publisher=Forward, the Jewish Daily| last=Popper| first=Nathaniel| date=28 January 2005| accessdate=17 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225906/http://www.forward.com/articles/brooklyn-bred-hasid-takes-position-of-power-in-isr/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHis first job was as principal of the Hasidic [[Beis Yaakov]] girls' school in [[Jerusalem]]. He became active in politics under the guidance of the then-Gerrer [[Rebbe]], [[Rabbi]] [[Simcha Binem Alter]]. Over time, he became known as the rebbe's right-hand man, a role he continues under the present Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi [[Yaakov Arye Alter]]. In 1999, the present rebbe asked Litzman to join the Agudat Yisrael faction of the United Torah Judaism list for the [[1999 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]] that year. He was subsequently elected, and became Chairman of the Finance Committee. He headed the UTJ list for the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]],<ref>[http://en.idi.org.il/media/394109/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94%2016.pdf UTJ list] Israel Democracy Institute</ref> and was re-elected, again becoming the Chair of the Finance Committee.

After Litzman was re-elected in [[2013 Israeli legislative election|2013]], UTJ were excluded from the coalition government. However, following the [[2015 Israeli legislative election|2015 elections]], he was re-appointed Deputy Minister of Health.

When he was two years old, the family immigrated to the East New York section of [[Brooklyn]], and then to the [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]] section of [[Brooklyn]], where he grew up. In 1966, at age 17, he immigrated to Israel, and continued his Torah studies.\n\nLitzman is married, has five children, and lives in Jerusalem. He is quoted as saying that, \"in some respects, I envy the low profile the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community in the United States has been able to retain by staying out of politics\". He also said that, in Israel, the media attention makes for misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the Haredi community.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Brooklyn-bred Hasid Takes Position of Power in Israel| url=http://www.forward.com/articles/brooklyn-bred-hasid-takes-position-of-power-in-isr/| publisher=Forward, the Jewish Daily| last=Popper| first=Nathaniel| date=28 January 2005| accessdate=17 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225906/http://www.forward.com/articles/brooklyn-bred-hasid-takes-position-of-power-in-isr/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHis first job was as principal of the Hasidic [[Beis Yaakov]] girls' school in [[Jerusalem]]. He became active in politics under the guidance of the then-Gerrer [[Rebbe]], [[Rabbi]] [[Simcha Binem Alter]]. Over time, he became known as the rebbe's right-hand man, a role he continues under the present Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi [[Yaakov Arye Alter]]. In 1999, the present rebbe asked Litzman to join the Agudat Yisrael faction of the United Torah Judaism list for the [[1999 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]] that year. He was subsequently elected, and became Chairman of the Finance Committee. He headed the UTJ list for the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]],<ref>[http://en.idi.org.il/media/394109/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94%2016.pdf UTJ list] Israel Democracy Institute</ref> and was re-elected, again becoming the Chair of the Finance Committee.

After Litzman was re-elected in [[2013 Israeli legislative election|2013]], UTJ were excluded from the coalition government. However, following the [[2015 Israeli legislative election|2015 elections]], he was re-appointed Deputy Minister of Health.

This is well illustrated in his book ''La stecca nel coro'' (which translates as \"The false note in the chorus\" with the meaning of \"Going against the current\") which is a list of leading articles he composed between 1974 and 1994 in the newspaper ''[[Il Giornale]]'' which he founded and directed after being sacked from the prestigious ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', in October 1973. It was during this experience, in 1977 that the [[Red Brigades|Red Brigade]] terrorists shot him four times in the legs in the streets of Milan.\n\n===Early journalist career===\nMontanelli's career began with a Law degree from the University of Florence in the early 1920s, where he wrote a thesis on the electoral reform of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[fascism]]. Allegedly, in this thesis, he maintained that rather than a reform it amounted to the abolition of elections, which goes some way to illustrate the ambiguous nature of the Italian fascist censorship. According to him, it was a short experience of the French cultural atmosphere in [[Grenoble]], while he was taking language lessons, that he realised that his true vocation was that of the journalist.\n\nMontanelli began his journalistic career by writing for the fascist newspaper ''Il Selvaggio'' (\"The Savage\"), then directed by [[Mino Maccari]], and in 1932 for the ''Universale'', a magazine published only once fortnightly and which offered no pay. Montanelli admitted that in those days he saw in fascism the hope of a movement that could potentially create an Italian national conscience that would have resolved the economic and socioeconomic differences between the north and the south. This enthusiasm for the fascist movement began to wane when in 1935 Mussolini forced the abolition of the ''Universale'' along with other magazines and newspapers that expressed opinions on the nature of fascism.\n\nBut it was in 1934, in Paris that Montanelli began to write for the crime pages of the daily newspaper ''[[Paris Soir]]'', then as foreign correspondent in Norway (where he fished for cod for a bit), and later in Canada (where he ended up working in a farm in Alberta).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.openschoolofjournalism.com/resources/notable-journalists/montanelli-indro |title=Montanelli, Indro |year=2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom there he began a collaboration with [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]] of the [[United Press]] in New York. While working for the United Press he learned to write for the lay public in an uncomplicated style that would distinguish him within the realm of Italian journalism. One lesson he took to heart from Miller was to \"always write as if writing to a milkman from Ohio\". This open and approachable style was something he never forgot and he'd often recall that very quote during his long life. Another indelible American moment occurred while teaching a course.  Someone had asked him to explain the composition that Montanelli had just read. Montanelli told him he'd repeat it since he clearly didn't understand...  Hitting the table, the red-faced student cut him off and angrily told him, as a matter of fact, that if he hadn't understood Montanelli's composition, then it was Montanelli who was the imbecil! [and needed to change it]. It was then that he realized that he, who had come from the authoritarian regime of fascist Italy, had just had a confrontation with democracy.  During this time Montanelli conducted his first interview with a celebrity: [[Henry Ford]] \u2013 who surprised him by admitting he did not have a driver's license. During the interview, surrounded by American art depicting pastoral and frontier subjects, Ford began to reverentially talk about the [[Founding Fathers]]. Looking at the decor, Montanelli astutely asked him how he felt about having destroyed their world. Puzzled, Ford asked what he meant. Undaunted, Montanelli pressed on that the automobile and Ford's revolutionary [[assembly line]] system had forever transformed the country. Ford looked shocked, and Montanelli realized that, like all geniuses, Ford hadn't had the slightest idea of what he'd really done.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/subjects/person:indro_montanelli_(1909-)#page=2 |title=Indro Montanelli (1909\u2013) |year=2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Reporter in Abyssinia===\n[[File:Indro Montanelli 1936.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Montanelli, aged 27, during the Abyssinian War of 1936]]\n\nWhen Mussolini declared war on [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] with the intent of making Italy an empire ([[Second Italo\u2013Abyssinian War]]), Montanelli immediately abandoned his collaboration with the [[United Press]] and became a voluntary conscript for this war. He believed then, along with many Italians of the time, that this was the chance for Italy to bring civilization to the 'savage' world of Africa, an enthusiasm that Montanelli blamed also on his passion for the works of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. In spite of these initial passions, it was this very experience that led to Montanelli's biggest change of mind with regard to Italian fascism.\n\nThis amounted to the realisation that the Abyssinia experience was none other than a pretext to elevate Mussolini on an ever-higher pedestal, a show more than the substance of a revolutionary change of the colonization and civilization of Africa. With few exceptions, such as the defense of [[Gondar]], the conquest had been uneven and uneventful. One of the fascist leaders of the time, [[Farinacci]], not finding enemies, began throwing hand grenades in the lake of Ascianghi: one exploded in his hand resulting in a silver medal award.\n\nMontanelli began writing about the war to his father who \u2013 in Montanelli's total ignorance \u2013 sent the letters to one of the most famous journalists of those times, [[Ugo Ojetti]], who published them regularly on the most prestigious Italian newspaper: ''Il Corriere della Sera''.\n\nIn Ethiopia, Montanelli, who was 26 at the time, had a relationship with a 12-year-old Eritrean girl.<ref>''L'ora della verit\u00e0'', TV show by Gianni Bisiach, 1969.</ref> The girl remained at his side as a [[sexual slave]] for the entire stay in Africa.<ref>Interview from Enzo Biagi to Indro Montanelli in 1982 in \"''RT-Era ieri''\", Rai 3 at 23:45 on 13 October 2008.</ref> The [[madamato]], first tolerated and sometimes carried out by high-ranking officer, was forbidden in April 1937 to limit venereal infections and to avoid contacts between Italians and Africans: the provision was then followed the year after the enactment of the racial laws. Before returning to Italy, he ceded her to General [[Alessandro Pirzio Biroli]], who introduced her into his small harem.<ref>''Questo secolo'', TV show by Enzo Biagi, 1982.</ref>\n\n===Reporter during Spanish Civil War===\nOn his return from Abyssinia, Montanelli became foreign correspondent in Spain for the daily newspaper ''Il Messaggero'', where he experienced the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s troops. In this period he shared a room with [[Kim Philby]], who, decades later, would reveal himself to the world as one of the greatest Soviet mole spies that ever existed. One day he disappeared. Years later Montanelli received a mysterious note saying: \"Thanks for everything. Including your socks\". It was Philby. After the capture of the city of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], Montanelli wrote that '(...) it had been a long military walk with only one enemy: the heat'. This judgement contrasted with the propaganda of the times that painted that 'battle' as a glorious bloodshed on the side of the Italian contingent. In fact the only casualty he noted, but never reported, by Montanelli was a single death in the [[Alpini]] regiment caused by a mule kick that threw the unfortunate trooper down into a dry river bed. For this article he was reimpatriated, tried and expelled from the Fascist party and from the 'journalist book'. When, in the trial, he was asked why he had written such an unpatriotic article, he replied: \"Show me a single casualty of that battle: because a battle without casualties is not a real battle!\" The trial ended with a full absolution.\n\n===Reportages from Eastern and Northern Europe===\nThe position taken against fascism led him to first serious disagreements. He was taken off the ticket of the Party and he did nothing to get it back. So to avoid the worst, in 1938, the then minister of culture, Giuseppe Bottai, offered Montanelli the job of director of the Institute of Culture in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], and lecturer in Italian at the [[University of Tartu]]. In this period the then director of the ''Corriere della Sera'', [[Aldo Borelli]], asked Montanelli to engage in a 'collaboration' as foreign correspondent (he could not be employed as journalist, because this had been forbidden by the fascist regime). Montanelli began to correspond for this newspaper from Estonia and Albania (during the Italian annexation of this country).\n\nOn 1 September 1939 Germany [[invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]]. Montanelli was sent to report from the front in a Mercedes accompanied by German state functionaries. In the vicinity to the city of [[Grudzi\u0105dz]] the car was stopped by a convoy of German tanks. On one of these stood Hitler himself, but a few feet from Montanelli. When Hitler was told that the only person in casual clothes was Italian, he jumped out of the tank and eyeing Montanelli like a madman, began a ten-minute hysterical speech followed by military salute and exit. [[Albert Speer]], who had also been in the convoy with fellow artist [[Arno Breker]], corroborated the story in 1979.  Apart from this episode \u2013 which Montanelli was forbidden to report \u2013 there had been little to report because the invasion of Poland was completed so rapidly that it was over within weeks. It was allegedly him who reported about the [[Skirmish of Krojanty]] and created a myth from it.\n\nMontanelli was not welcome in Italy, and decided to move to [[Lithuania]]. The joint German-Russian invasion of Poland instinctively told him that more was brewing on the Soviet Union border. His instinct was correct because shortly after his arrival in [[Kaunas]] \u2013 the seat of Lithuanian government \u2013 the Soviet Union declared an Ultimatum to the Baltic Republics. At this point Montanelli continued to travel towards [[Tallinn]] as it was his wish to see the last of a free and democratic Estonia, which was soon invaded by Soviet Union. At this point, Montanelli was not popular in Italy, nor Germany because of his pro-Estonian and pro-Polish articles and had been expelled by the Soviet Union for being a foreigner. So he was forced by the events to cross the Baltic sea and reach [[Helsinki]].\n\nIn [[Finland]] Montanelli began writing articles about the Lapps and the reindeer, although this was not for long as Molotov had made requests on the Finnish government for the annexation of part of the Finnish land to the Soviet Union.  The Finnish delegation, headed by [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|Paasikivi]], had refused to give in to these requests and on their return it was clear that war was in the air.  Montanelli was not able to write about the details of the talks between the Soviet and Finnish delegations, as they were shrouded in strict secrecy, although he was able to interview Paasikivi, who was happy to fill him in on everything except for the content of the talks.\n\nThroughout the so-called [[Winter War]] which ensued, Montanelli wrote hotly pro-Finnish articles both from the front and from bomb-stricken Helsinki writing about the almost mythical enterprises of the [[battle of Tolvaj\u00e4rvi]], and of men like captain Pajakka who with 200 Lapps successfully confronted 40,000 Russians in the region of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]. Back in Italy Montanelli's stories had been followed with great enthusiasm by the public, but not so enthusiastic was the response of the fascist leaders who were committed to an alliance with the Soviet Union. When Borelli, director of the ''Corriere della Sera'', had been ordered to censor Montanelli's articles, he had had the courage to reply that \"thanks to his articles the ''Corriere'' increased its sales from 500,000 to 900,000 copies: are you going to reimburse me?\". When the Winter War was over, and the non-aggression pact was signed between the Soviet Union and Finland, Montanelli was personally thanked by the elusive [[Gustaf Mannerheim|Mannerheim]] himself, for writing in favour of the Finnish cause.\n\n===Invasion of Norway===\nBefore his return to Italy Montanelli witnessed the [[invasion of Norway]], and was arrested by the German army for his hostility towards the German-Italian alliance. He escaped with the help of his friend [[Vidkun Quisling]], and made a run for the north of the country where the English and the French were disembarking their troops at Narvik. He was met by the one-eyed, one-armed Major [[Adrian Carton de Wiart|Carton de Wiart]] who explained that there were no more than 10,000 Allied troops in Norway \u2013 many of them not even trained for battle. Nobody seemed to know where their garrison was. The British wanted to go inland and attack the Germans, but the French wanted to stay put and consolidate their positions. After having seen the clockwork invasion of Poland by the German troops, this disarray was a worrying sight.  When the Germans began bombing these positions the Allies were forced to embark once again and beat a hasty withdrawal to England.\n\n=== The Balkans and Greece ===\nWith Italy's entrance in the war (June 1940), Montanelli was sent to France and the Balkans; then he was assigned the responsibility of following the Italian military campaign from Greece and Albania as correspondent. Here he recounted to have written little:\n{{Quote | I remained at that front various months, writing almost nothing, a small reason was because I fell ill with typhus and a huge one because I refused to push as a glorious military campaign the quaking pummeling that we caught down there.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Tiziana | last1 = Abate | first2 = Indro | last2 = Montanelli | title = Soltanto un giornalista |trans-title=Only a Journalist}}.</ref>}}\n\nAn article published on 12 September 1940 issue of Panorama was considered \"defeatist\" by the censors of Minculpop ([[Ministero della Cultura Popolare]]), who in turn ordered the closure of the periodical.\n\n===Condemned to death===\nAfter witnessing war and destruction in the Balkans, and the disastrous [[Italian invasion of Greece]], Montanelli decided to join the partisan movement against the fascist regime, by joining the [[Partito d'Azione]]. Here he met with socialist [[Sandro Pertini]] (who would be president of Italy from 1978 to 1985).\n\nHe was eventually once again captured by the Germans, tried and condemned to death. In the Milan prison of San Vittore he met with [[Mike Bongiorno]], who would later become one of the most famous quizmasters of Italian TV. In the prison he also made the acquaintance of [[General della Rovere]], who was said to have been arrested while on a secret mission on behalf of the Allies. The reality was that this man was a thief called Giovanni Bertoni, a spy for the Germans. But Bertoni was so taken in by the military character he was playing that he refused to relay any information to his German masters and was executed like a real general. After the war Montanelli was to devote a book to this incident (''Il generale Della Rovere'', 1959, later turned into an [[Leone d'oro|award-winning]] movie directed by [[Roberto Rossellini]] and starring [[Vittorio De Sica]]).\n\nSalvation came at the end of 1944 with the help of unknown conspirators who arranged for his transfer to a prison in Verona. The transfer was then transformed into a dash for the Swiss border. The identity of these conspirators remained a mystery until decades later, when it appeared that it had been the result of collusion by several agencies. Among them, Marshall Mannerheim allegedly put pressure on his German allies (\"You are executing a gentleman\" he said to von Falkenhorst, the commander of the German troops stationed in Finland) resulting in Berlin's opening of an inquiry.\n\nIn 1945 while hiding in Switzerland, he published the novel ''Drei Kreuze'' (''Three Crosses''), later appeared in Italian with the title ''Qui non-riposano'' (''Here they do not rest''). Inspired by [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''The Bridge of San Luis Rey'', the story begins on 17 September 1944 when a Val d'Ossola priest buries three unknown corpses and commemorates them with three anonymous crosses.\n\n===Later career and writings===\nMontanelli continued his career at the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' newspaper in [[Milan]], famously authoring deeply sympathetic articles from [[Hungary]], during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. His first hand reportages inspired him to write the play, ''[[I sogni muoiono all'alba]]'' (Dreams Die at Dawn), later adapted to film. From the mid-1960s, after the death of the paper's proprietors, Mario and Vittorio Crespi, and the serious illness of the third brother, Aldo, ownership of the paper was vested upon Aldo's daughter, Giulia Maria. Under her tight control (earning her Montanelli's moniker the [[czarina]]), the daily took a sudden turn to the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. This new launch took place in 1972 with the abrupt dismissal of the director [[Giovanni Spadolini]].  Montanelli expressed a cutting indictment of the procedure in an interview on [[L'espresso]], declaring: \"A director is not sent away like a thieving domestic\" and, turning to the Crespi family, he branded their \"authoritarian, bullying junta ways that they have chosen in order to impose their decision\".\n\nAfter subsequently breaking definitely with Corriere della Sera he founded and directed the Milan daily ''[[Il Giornale]]'' in 1973, together with [[Enzo Bettiza]].\n\nOn 2 September 1977, Montanelli was shot four times in the legs by a two-man commando of the [[Red Brigades]], outside the Milanese head-office of the [[Corriere della Sera]]. His friend and surgeon was amazed on how \"four shots could hit those [long, thin] chicken legs of his and still completely miss a major artery or nerve bundle\". He credited his indoctrination as a child in the [[Balilla]] fascist youth and its mantra, \"to die on your feet\", for saving his life. He maintained that had he not held on to the railing during the incident the fourth shot would have surely hit him in the stomach. In his typical ironical and satirical vein he also thanked [[Il Duce]]. In a petty instance of insult to injury the \"Corriere della Sera\" dedicated an article to the incident omitting his name from the title (\"Milan [...] journalist [[kneecapped]]\").\n\n===Quarrel with Berlusconi and final years===\nWhen [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the then proprietor of ''Il Giornale'', entered politics and founded a new personalistic party [[Forza Italia]], Montanelli came under heavy pressure to switch his editorial line to a position favourable to Berlusconi. Montanelli never hid his bad opinion of Berlusconi: \"He lies as he breathes\", the journalist declared. In the end, protesting his independence, he founded a new daily, for which he resurrected the name ''[[La Voce (newspaper)|La Voce]]'' (\"The Voice\"), which had belonged to an historical newspaper run by [[Giuseppe Prezzolini]]. ''La Voce'', always an elitist paper, folded after about a year, and Montanelli returned to ''Corriere della Sera''. In 1994, Montanelli was awarded the [[International Editor of the Year Award]] from the [[World Press Review]].\n\nFrom 1995 to 2001 he was the chief letters editor of ''Corriere della Sera'', answering a letter a day on a page of the newspaper known as \"La Stanza di Montanelli\" (\"Montanelli's Room\"). Montanelli spent his last years vigorously opposing Silvio Berlusconi's politics. He was mentor to a significant group of colleagues, followers and students including Mario Cervi, [[Marco Travaglio]], [[Paolo Mieli]], Roberto Ridolfi, Andrea Claudio Galluzzo, [[Beppe Severgnini]] and Roberto Gervaso.\n\nHe died on 22 July 2001 at the ''La Madonnina'' clinic in Milan.

This is well illustrated in his book ''La stecca nel coro'' (which translates as \"The false note in the chorus\" with the meaning of \"Going against the current\") which is a list of leading articles he composed between 1974 and 1994 in the newspaper ''[[Il Giornale]]'' which he founded and directed after being sacked from the prestigious ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', in October 1973. It was during this experience, in 1977 that the [[Red Brigades|Red Brigade]] terrorists shot him four times in the legs in the streets of Milan.\n\n===Early journalist career===\nMontanelli's career began with a Law degree from the University of Florence in the early 1920s, where he wrote a thesis on the electoral reform of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[fascism]]. Allegedly, in this thesis, he maintained that rather than a reform it amounted to the abolition of elections, which goes some way to illustrate the ambiguous nature of the Italian fascist censorship. According to him, it was a short experience of the French cultural atmosphere in [[Grenoble]], while he was taking language lessons, that he realised that his true vocation was that of the journalist.\n\nMontanelli began his journalistic career by writing for the fascist newspaper ''Il Selvaggio'' (\"The Savage\"), then directed by [[Mino Maccari]], and in 1932 for the ''Universale'', a magazine published only once fortnightly and which offered no pay. Montanelli admitted that in those days he saw in fascism the hope of a movement that could potentially create an Italian national conscience that would have resolved the economic and socioeconomic differences between the north and the south. This enthusiasm for the fascist movement began to wane when in 1935 Mussolini forced the abolition of the ''Universale'' along with other magazines and newspapers that expressed opinions on the nature of fascism.\n\nBut it was in 1934, in Paris that Montanelli began to write for the crime pages of the daily newspaper ''[[Paris Soir]]'', then as foreign correspondent in Norway (where he fished for cod for a bit), and later in Canada (where he ended up working in a farm in Alberta).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.openschoolofjournalism.com/resources/notable-journalists/montanelli-indro |title=Montanelli, Indro |year=2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom there he began a collaboration with [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]] of the [[United Press]] in New York. While working for the United Press he learned to write for the lay public in an uncomplicated style that would distinguish him within the realm of Italian journalism. One lesson he took to heart from Miller was to \"always write as if writing to a milkman from Ohio\". This open and approachable style was something he never forgot and he'd often recall that very quote during his long life. Another indelible American moment occurred while teaching a course.  Someone had asked him to explain the composition that Montanelli had just read. Montanelli told him he'd repeat it since he clearly didn't understand...  Hitting the table, the red-faced student cut him off and angrily told him, as a matter of fact, that if he hadn't understood Montanelli's composition, then it was Montanelli who was the imbecil! [and needed to change it]. It was then that he realized that he, who had come from the authoritarian regime of fascist Italy, had just had a confrontation with democracy.  During this time Montanelli conducted his first interview with a celebrity: [[Henry Ford]] \u2013 who surprised him by admitting he did not have a driver's license. During the interview, surrounded by American art depicting pastoral and frontier subjects, Ford began to reverentially talk about the [[Founding Fathers]]. Looking at the decor, Montanelli astutely asked him how he felt about having destroyed their world. Puzzled, Ford asked what he meant. Undaunted, Montanelli pressed on that the automobile and Ford's revolutionary [[assembly line]] system had forever transformed the country. Ford looked shocked, and Montanelli realized that, like all geniuses, Ford hadn't had the slightest idea of what he'd really done.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/subjects/person:indro_montanelli_(1909-)#page=2 |title=Indro Montanelli (1909\u2013) |year=2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Reporter in Abyssinia===\n[[File:Indro Montanelli 1936.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Montanelli, aged 27, during the Abyssinian War of 1936]]\n\nWhen Mussolini declared war on [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] with the intent of making Italy an empire ([[Second Italo\u2013Abyssinian War]]), Montanelli immediately abandoned his collaboration with the [[United Press]] and became a voluntary conscript for this war. He believed then, along with many Italians of the time, that this was the chance for Italy to bring civilization to the 'savage' world of Africa, an enthusiasm that Montanelli blamed also on his passion for the works of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. In spite of these initial passions, it was this very experience that led to Montanelli's biggest change of mind with regard to Italian fascism.\n\nThis amounted to the realisation that the Abyssinia experience was none other than a pretext to elevate Mussolini on an ever-higher pedestal, a show more than the substance of a revolutionary change of the colonization and civilization of Africa. With few exceptions, such as the defense of [[Gondar]], the conquest had been uneven and uneventful. One of the fascist leaders of the time, [[Farinacci]], not finding enemies, began throwing hand grenades in the lake of Ascianghi: one exploded in his hand resulting in a silver medal award.\n\nMontanelli began writing about the war to his father who \u2013 in Montanelli's total ignorance \u2013 sent the letters to one of the most famous journalists of those times, [[Ugo Ojetti]], who published them regularly on the most prestigious Italian newspaper: ''Il Corriere della Sera''.\n\nIn Ethiopia, Montanelli, who was 26 at the time, had a relationship with a 12-year-old Eritrean girl.<ref>''L'ora della verit\u00e0'', TV show by Gianni Bisiach, 1969.</ref> The girl remained at his side as a [[sexual slave]] for the entire stay in Africa.<ref>Interview from Enzo Biagi to Indro Montanelli in 1982 in \"''RT-Era ieri''\", Rai 3 at 23:45 on 13 October 2008.</ref> The [[madamato]], first tolerated and sometimes carried out by high-ranking officer, was forbidden in April 1937 to limit venereal infections and to avoid contacts between Italians and Africans: the provision was then followed the year after the enactment of the racial laws. Before returning to Italy, he ceded her to General [[Alessandro Pirzio Biroli]], who introduced her into his small harem.<ref>''Questo secolo'', TV show by Enzo Biagi, 1982.</ref>\n\n===Reporter during Spanish Civil War===\nOn his return from Abyssinia, Montanelli became foreign correspondent in Spain for the daily newspaper ''Il Messaggero'', where he experienced the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s troops. In this period he shared a room with [[Kim Philby]], who, decades later, would reveal himself to the world as one of the greatest Soviet mole spies that ever existed. One day he disappeared. Years later Montanelli received a mysterious note saying: \"Thanks for everything. Including your socks\". It was Philby. After the capture of the city of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], Montanelli wrote that '(...) it had been a long military walk with only one enemy: the heat'. This judgement contrasted with the propaganda of the times that painted that 'battle' as a glorious bloodshed on the side of the Italian contingent. In fact the only casualty he noted, but never reported, by Montanelli was a single death in the [[Alpini]] regiment caused by a mule kick that threw the unfortunate trooper down into a dry river bed. For this article he was reimpatriated, tried and expelled from the Fascist party and from the 'journalist book'. When, in the trial, he was asked why he had written such an unpatriotic article, he replied: \"Show me a single casualty of that battle: because a battle without casualties is not a real battle!\" The trial ended with a full absolution.\n\n===Reportages from Eastern and Northern Europe===\nThe position taken against fascism led him to first serious disagreements. He was taken off the ticket of the Party and he did nothing to get it back. So to avoid the worst, in 1938, the then minister of culture, Giuseppe Bottai, offered Montanelli the job of director of the Institute of Culture in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], and lecturer in Italian at the [[University of Tartu]]. In this period the then director of the ''Corriere della Sera'', [[Aldo Borelli]], asked Montanelli to engage in a 'collaboration' as foreign correspondent (he could not be employed as journalist, because this had been forbidden by the fascist regime). Montanelli began to correspond for this newspaper from Estonia and Albania (during the Italian annexation of this country).\n\nOn 1 September 1939 Germany [[invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]]. Montanelli was sent to report from the front in a Mercedes accompanied by German state functionaries. In the vicinity to the city of [[Grudzi\u0105dz]] the car was stopped by a convoy of German tanks. On one of these stood Hitler himself, but a few feet from Montanelli. When Hitler was told that the only person in casual clothes was Italian, he jumped out of the tank and eyeing Montanelli like a madman, began a ten-minute hysterical speech followed by military salute and exit. [[Albert Speer]], who had also been in the convoy with fellow artist [[Arno Breker]], corroborated the story in 1979.  Apart from this episode \u2013 which Montanelli was forbidden to report \u2013 there had been little to report because the invasion of Poland was completed so rapidly that it was over within weeks. It was allegedly him who reported about the [[Skirmish of Krojanty]] and created a myth from it.\n\nMontanelli was not welcome in Italy, and decided to move to [[Lithuania]]. The joint German-Russian invasion of Poland instinctively told him that more was brewing on the Soviet Union border. His instinct was correct because shortly after his arrival in [[Kaunas]] \u2013 the seat of Lithuanian government \u2013 the Soviet Union declared an Ultimatum to the Baltic Republics. At this point Montanelli continued to travel towards [[Tallinn]] as it was his wish to see the last of a free and democratic Estonia, which was soon invaded by Soviet Union. At this point, Montanelli was not popular in Italy, nor Germany because of his pro-Estonian and pro-Polish articles and had been expelled by the Soviet Union for being a foreigner. So he was forced by the events to cross the Baltic sea and reach [[Helsinki]].\n\nIn [[Finland]] Montanelli began writing articles about the Lapps and the reindeer, although this was not for long as Molotov had made requests on the Finnish government for the annexation of part of the Finnish land to the Soviet Union.  The Finnish delegation, headed by [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|Paasikivi]], had refused to give in to these requests and on their return it was clear that war was in the air.  Montanelli was not able to write about the details of the talks between the Soviet and Finnish delegations, as they were shrouded in strict secrecy, although he was able to interview Paasikivi, who was happy to fill him in on everything except for the content of the talks.\n\nThroughout the so-called [[Winter War]] which ensued, Montanelli wrote hotly pro-Finnish articles both from the front and from bomb-stricken Helsinki writing about the almost mythical enterprises of the [[battle of Tolvaj\u00e4rvi]], and of men like captain Pajakka who with 200 Lapps successfully confronted 40,000 Russians in the region of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]. Back in Italy Montanelli's stories had been followed with great enthusiasm by the public, but not so enthusiastic was the response of the fascist leaders who were committed to an alliance with the Soviet Union. When Borelli, director of the ''Corriere della Sera'', had been ordered to censor Montanelli's articles, he had had the courage to reply that \"thanks to his articles the ''Corriere'' increased its sales from 500,000 to 900,000 copies: are you going to reimburse me?\". When the Winter War was over, and the non-aggression pact was signed between the Soviet Union and Finland, Montanelli was personally thanked by the elusive [[Gustaf Mannerheim|Mannerheim]] himself, for writing in favour of the Finnish cause.\n\n===Invasion of Norway===\nBefore his return to Italy Montanelli witnessed the [[invasion of Norway]], and was arrested by the German army for his hostility towards the German-Italian alliance. He escaped with the help of his friend [[Vidkun Quisling]], and made a run for the north of the country where the English and the French were disembarking their troops at Narvik. He was met by the one-eyed, one-armed Major [[Adrian Carton de Wiart|Carton de Wiart]] who explained that there were no more than 10,000 Allied troops in Norway \u2013 many of them not even trained for battle. Nobody seemed to know where their garrison was. The British wanted to go inland and attack the Germans, but the French wanted to stay put and consolidate their positions. After having seen the clockwork invasion of Poland by the German troops, this disarray was a worrying sight.  When the Germans began bombing these positions the Allies were forced to embark once again and beat a hasty withdrawal to England.\n\n=== The Balkans and Greece ===\nWith Italy's entrance in the war (June 1940), Montanelli was sent to France and the Balkans; then he was assigned the responsibility of following the Italian military campaign from Greece and Albania as correspondent. Here he recounted to have written little:\n{{Quote | I remained at that front various months, writing almost nothing, a small reason was because I fell ill with typhus and a huge one because I refused to push as a glorious military campaign the quaking pummeling that we caught down there.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Tiziana | last1 = Abate | first2 = Indro | last2 = Montanelli | title = Soltanto un giornalista |trans-title=Only a Journalist}}.</ref>}}\n\nAn article published on 12 September 1940 issue of Panorama was considered \"defeatist\" by the censors of Minculpop ([[Ministero della Cultura Popolare]]), who in turn ordered the closure of the periodical.\n\n===Condemned to death===\nAfter witnessing war and destruction in the Balkans, and the disastrous [[Italian invasion of Greece]], Montanelli decided to join the partisan movement against the fascist regime, by joining the [[Partito d'Azione]]. Here he met with socialist [[Sandro Pertini]] (who would be president of Italy from 1978 to 1985).\n\nHe was eventually once again captured by the Germans, tried and condemned to death. In the Milan prison of San Vittore he met with [[Mike Bongiorno]], who would later become one of the most famous quizmasters of Italian TV. In the prison he also made the acquaintance of [[General della Rovere]], who was said to have been arrested while on a secret mission on behalf of the Allies. The reality was that this man was a thief called Giovanni Bertoni, a spy for the Germans. But Bertoni was so taken in by the military character he was playing that he refused to relay any information to his German masters and was executed like a real general. After the war Montanelli was to devote a book to this incident (''Il generale Della Rovere'', 1959, later turned into an [[Leone d'oro|award-winning]] movie directed by [[Roberto Rossellini]] and starring [[Vittorio De Sica]]).\n\nSalvation came at the end of 1944 with the help of unknown conspirators who arranged for his transfer to a prison in Verona. The transfer was then transformed into a dash for the Swiss border. The identity of these conspirators remained a mystery until decades later, when it appeared that it had been the result of collusion by several agencies. Among them, Marshall Mannerheim allegedly put pressure on his German allies (\"You are executing a gentleman\" he said to von Falkenhorst, the commander of the German troops stationed in Finland) resulting in Berlin's opening of an inquiry.\n\nIn 1945 while hiding in Switzerland, he published the novel ''Drei Kreuze'' (''Three Crosses''), later appeared in Italian with the title ''Qui non-riposano'' (''Here they do not rest''). Inspired by [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''The Bridge of San Luis Rey'', the story begins on 17 September 1944 when a Val d'Ossola priest buries three unknown corpses and commemorates them with three anonymous crosses.\n\n===Later career and writings===\nMontanelli continued his career at the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' newspaper in [[Milan]], famously authoring deeply sympathetic articles from [[Hungary]], during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. His first hand reportages inspired him to write the play, ''[[I sogni muoiono all'alba]]'' (Dreams Die at Dawn), later adapted to film. From the mid-1960s, after the death of the paper's proprietors, Mario and Vittorio Crespi, and the serious illness of the third brother, Aldo, ownership of the paper was vested upon Aldo's daughter, Giulia Maria. Under her tight control (earning her Montanelli's moniker the [[czarina]]), the daily took a sudden turn to the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. This new launch took place in 1972 with the abrupt dismissal of the director [[Giovanni Spadolini]].  Montanelli expressed a cutting indictment of the procedure in an interview on [[L'espresso]], declaring: \"A director is not sent away like a thieving domestic\" and, turning to the Crespi family, he branded their \"authoritarian, bullying junta ways that they have chosen in order to impose their decision\".\n\nAfter subsequently breaking definitely with Corriere della Sera he founded and directed the Milan daily ''[[Il Giornale]]'' in 1973, together with [[Enzo Bettiza]].\n\nOn 2 September 1977, Montanelli was shot four times in the legs by a two-man commando of the [[Red Brigades]], outside the Milanese head-office of the [[Corriere della Sera]]. His friend and surgeon was amazed on how \"four shots could hit those [long, thin] chicken legs of his and still completely miss a major artery or nerve bundle\". He credited his indoctrination as a child in the [[Balilla]] fascist youth and its mantra, \"to die on your feet\", for saving his life. He maintained that had he not held on to the railing during the incident the fourth shot would have surely hit him in the stomach. In his typical ironical and satirical vein he also thanked [[Il Duce]]. In a petty instance of insult to injury the \"Corriere della Sera\" dedicated an article to the incident omitting his name from the title (\"Milan [...] journalist [[kneecapped]]\").\n\n===Quarrel with Berlusconi and final years===\nWhen [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the then proprietor of ''Il Giornale'', entered politics and founded a new personalistic party [[Forza Italia]], Montanelli came under heavy pressure to switch his editorial line to a position favourable to Berlusconi. Montanelli never hid his bad opinion of Berlusconi: \"He lies as he breathes\", the journalist declared. In the end, protesting his independence, he founded a new daily, for which he resurrected the name ''[[La Voce (newspaper)|La Voce]]'' (\"The Voice\"), which had belonged to an historical newspaper run by [[Giuseppe Prezzolini]]. ''La Voce'', always an elitist paper, folded after about a year, and Montanelli returned to ''Corriere della Sera''. In 1994, Montanelli was awarded the [[International Editor of the Year Award]] from the [[World Press Review]].\n\nFrom 1995 to 2001 he was the chief letters editor of ''Corriere della Sera'', answering a letter a day on a page of the newspaper known as \"La Stanza di Montanelli\" (\"Montanelli's Room\"). Montanelli spent his last years vigorously opposing Silvio Berlusconi's politics. He was mentor to a significant group of colleagues, followers and students including Mario Cervi, [[Marco Travaglio]], [[Paolo Mieli]], Roberto Ridolfi, Andrea Claudio Galluzzo, [[Beppe Severgnini]] and Roberto Gervaso.\n\nHe died on 22 July 2001 at the ''La Madonnina'' clinic in Milan.

The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically {{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}.\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

His son {{ill|Mikhail Antonovich Vrubel|ru|\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1799-1859) became a professional military.

At that time, the Astrakhan governor was a famous cartographer and admiral {{ill|Grigori Basargin|ru|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863.

In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them.

They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting.

His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A. I. Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century.

The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition.

The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov.

Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]]{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}.\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle.

There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"...

Edwards, together with [[Kyriak Kostandi]], tried to reform the Odessa Art School and decided to decided to elicit Vrubel's help. He settled Vrubel in his own house and tried to persuade him to stay in Odessa forever.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=151\u2014153}} In summer, Serov arrived in Odessa and Vrubel for the first time told him about his plan to paint the \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\". In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version.

Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\n\nAt the same time, Adrian Prakhov organized painting of the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] and, without regard to his personal attitudes, invited Vrubel. Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but can be seen in some icons from the Italian Renaissance. Though he clearly understood their significance and originality, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings since they differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would have unbalanced the relative integrity of already-assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noted that the a new cathedral \"in a very special style\" would need to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously appealed to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer his acquired during the painting of sacred images techniques to  create completely the opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would unlikely connect both with the public and the critics from the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued the destroyed shit together. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich \u2013 the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait - fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis manifested itself in the following incident. Once, Vrubel visited Prakhov where was already a company of artists participating in the painting of the cathedral. Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and he will have to urgently travel to Kharkiv; thus, painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for a sun. Confused Prakhiv had to explain to him the Vrubel\u2019s disappearance with his infatuation with one English singer from the cafesantan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=183\u2014184}} Furthermore, friends tried to ensure that Vrubel gets a regular income.

Most likely, he travelled there because he fell in love with a circus horsewoman which he met thanks to Yasinsky's brother who performed under the pseudonym \"Alexander Zemgano\". As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov.

However, Vrubel' illustrations passed with difficulties since due to its complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. However, the main difficulty was the fact that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. Despite this, on April 10, 1891, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] and right after the publication was widely discussed in the press. It was the press that harshly criticized illustrations made by Vrubel, primarily for its \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him and thus the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious in his eyes as for others was  \"incomprehensibility\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the plot and at the same time made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist. The Demon was an archetypal \"fallen angel\" that simultaneously bridged men and female figures.

Later was used as a stamp of Abramtsevo factory]] \n\nOn July 20, 1890, a 22-year old painter A. Mamontov died in the [[Abramtsevo Colony]]. His friend Mikhail Vrubel attended the funeral and was so fond of local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that Mikhail proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and by any means was trying to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to be a freeloader in noble families and started earning good money by fulfilling orders on several furnace compositions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A. Mamontov; projecting the extension in the \"Roman-Byzantine style\" to the Mamontov's mansion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=245\u2014246}} According to Dmitrieva, \"Vrubel\u2026 seemed to be irreplaceable as he could easily do any art, except writing texts.

From the one hand, movement supporters discussed a revival of Russian traditional crafts. From the other hand, machine fabrication contradicted the uniqueness which was the main art principle in Art Nouveau.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|pp=195\u2014196}} Vrubel worked in both Abramtsevo and Talashkino. However, both of these studies differed in the accents of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of maiolic art in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved). Elizaveta Mamontova later wrote:\n{{Quote|I visited Vrubel, he painted a life-size Snow Maiden's head in watercolour against the background of a pine tree covered with snow. Beautiful in colours, but the face had gumboil and angry eyes. How ironic, he had to come to Rome to paint the Russian winter.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=268}}}}\n\nVrubel continued to work in Abramtsevo. He returned from Italy with an idea to draw landscapes from photographs which resulted in a single earning of 50 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=269}} One of his most significant works after the return was the panel \"Venice\" that was also painted based on the photograph. The main feature of this composition is its timelessness \u2013 it is impossible to say when the action took place. The figures were chaotically arranged, \"compressing\" space, which is projected onto the plane. A pair for the Venice became the \"Spain\" which critics recognize as one of the Vrubel's most perfectly arranged paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=55}}\n\n===Decorative works===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043d\u0438.jpg|thumb|left|\u201dRobert and the Nuns.

Due to regular commissioned works made for Mamontov, Vrubel\u2019s reputation in Moscow grew greatly. For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A. Morozov's house in Podsosenskiy lane.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=272}}\n\nVrubel' decorative works illustrate how universal his talents were. The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries. For instance, at the end of his life,  [[Aleksandr Matveyev (sculptor)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] mentioned that \"without Vrubel there would be no [[Sergey Konenkov]]...\".{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}}\n\nThe gothic composition \"Robert and the Nuns\" is usually considered as the most important Vrubel's sculpture; it decorates the staircase of the Morozov mansion.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}} Literature on architecture emphasizes the exclusive role that Vrubel played in forming artistic appearances of the Moscow Art Nouveau. The artist created several compositions (small sculptural plastics from maiolica and tiles) which decorated important buildings in modern and pseudo-Russian style ([[Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station]], {{ill|Osobnyak M.

Thus, Benois demanded from Vrubel sketches of the alleged panels. After arriving in Nizhny Novgorod on April 25, Benois sent a telegram: \n{{quote| Vrubel's panels are terrifying; we need to take them off, waiting for the juri.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=304}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

On the contrary, Maxim Gorky was against Vrubel. He made fun of \"Mikula\" by comparing it with a fictional character Chernomor. \"The Princess of the Dream\" resent him with its \"antics, ugliness of otherwise beautiful plot\". In five articles, Gorky exposed Vrubel's \"poverty of spirit and poverty of imagination\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=309\u2014311}}\n\n[[File:Vrubel Siren.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Lilacs, 1900.

Around the same time, the Russian premiere of the [[fairy-tail opera]] \u201c[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]\u201d was about to take place.

Originally, Konstantin Korovin was responsible for the decorations and costumes but because of illness had to renounce the order in favour of Mikhail Vrubel who had never even attended an opera before.

Nevertheless, on July 28 they engaged in the [[Russian Church, Geneva|Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] in Geneva, Switzerland. The couple spent their honeymoon in a guesthouse in [[Lucerne]]. Then Vrubel continued his work on the panel for the Morozov\u2019s gothic cabinet.

However, Vrubel did not many commissions in the city and had to live on his wife\u2019s money. This prompted him to turn to theatrical painting and costume designs.

His [[migraine]]s got so strong that the painter had to take [[phenacetin]] in large quantities (according to his sister in law \u2013 up to 25 [[grain]]s and more).

The painter was able to finish ''Pan'' in one day while being in [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]\u2019s mansion in [[Talashkino]].

Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom.

Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively.

Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910)==\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

At the same time, Vrubel\u2019s hallucinations were caused by a [[bipolar disorder]] common among artists.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=437}} Due to progressive methods applied in the Usoltsev's clinic and frequent visits of Nadezhda and Anna Vrubel (they rented a house nearby and visited Mikhail daily), Vrubel almost fully rehabilitated. Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients. The doctor constantly invited artists and singers for organized house concerts. Patients attended evening events together with medical staff{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}. Usoltsev valued Vrubel's art and in every possible way, encouraged his creative pursuits.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

As with the illustrations for Lermontov' works, Vrubel created a lot of graphic sketches trying to catch and solve the problem of a \"black-white colourness\". However, the final version had the figures of sea princess on it, about which Vrubel later told to Prakhov:\n{{Quote|After all, I did not intend to paint any \"sea princesses\" in my \"Pearl\". I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906.

His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time.

However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis.

On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses.

Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him.

In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\".

Hence he borrowed 25 rubles from me and left. He came back soon, took a large basin and a bucket of water, and poured some cologne from a beautiful bottle from  [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]]  into the water. He undressed and stood in a basin, pouring himself out of a bucket. Then he lighted the iron stove and put four eggs inside, and later ate them with a loaf of baked bread.

After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]].

According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia.

19th-20th century Russian painter who worked in all genres of art, including painting, graphics, decorative sculpture, and theatrical art. In 1896, Vrubel married the famous singer [[Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel]] whom he regularly painted. \n\nSoviet historian {{ill|Nina Dmitrieva|ru|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430}} compared Vrubel\u2019s artistic biography to a three-act drama with prologue and epilogue, while the transition between acts was rapid and unexpected. The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically {{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}.\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

Great-grandfather of the artist \u2013 Anton Antonovich Vrubel \u2013 was originally from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and served as a judge in his local town. His son {{ill|Mikhail Antonovich Vrubel|ru|\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1799-1859) became a professional military. He retired at the rank of Major General, was twice married and had three sons and four daughters .{{sfn|\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430|1914|p=156}} For the last ten years of his life, Mikhail Antonovich served as an [[ataman]] of the [[Astrakhan Cossacks]]. At that time, the Astrakhan governor was a famous cartographer and admiral {{ill|Grigori Basargin|ru|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863. From the left \u2013 Elizaveta Vessel-Vrubel]]\nDue to constant relocations of their father, Anna and Mikhail spent their childhood moving to the places where Alexander was assigned to serve. In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting. According to Dmitrieva, \"the boy was like a boy, gifted, but rather promising a versatile amateur than an obsessed artist, whom he later became\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel with his sister Anna.

At that time, a copy of \"[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The last Judgement]]\" by [[Michelangelo]] was exhibited in Saratov. The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A.

Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century. The 1880s have just only passed, the first search for national antiquity just started, which no one else besides specialists was interested in, and even those specialists were interested more from the historical point rather than artistic <\u2026> Vrubel in Kiev was the first who bridged archaeological pioneering and restorations to a live contemporary art. At the same time, he did not think of stylization. He felt like an accomplice in the hard work of the ancient masters and tried to be worthy of them.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}}}}\n\nPrakhov\u2019s invitation was almost coincidental \u2013 he was looking for a qualified painter with some academic training to paint murals in the church but at the same time not to be recognised enough so he would not require a higher salary{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=113}}. Judging from the correspondence with the family, Vrubel's contract with Prakhov was for the completion of four icons in the duration of 76 days. The salary  indicated  was 300 rubles paid in every 24 working days.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=123}}\n[[File:St. Cyril's Church's Frescoes.jpg|thumb|right|\"Descent of Holy Spirit on the Apostles\"]] \nVrubel staged his arrival in Kiev in his signature style. Lev Kovalsky, who in 1884 was a student at the  Kiev Art School appointed to pick Mikhail up in the station, later recalled:\n{{Quote|... Against a background of primitive Kirillovsky hills, a blond, almost white, young man with a particular head and small, almost white, moustaches, stood behind my back.

The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition. The background is coloured in blue while the golden rays are coming up to the apostles from the circle featuring the [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}} The model for the Mary\u2019s figure was a paramedic M. Ershova \u2013 a frequent guest in the Prakhov's house and the future wife of one of the painters participating in the restoration process.  To Mary\u2019s left stands the apostle that was painted from [[protoiereus]] Petr (Lebedintsev) who at that time taught at the Richelieu lyceum. To Mary's right stands the second apostle for whom the Kiev archaeologist {{ill|Viktor Goshkevich|ru|\u0413\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} was modelling. The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov. Besides the \"Descent\", Vrubel painted the \"The entry into Jerusalem\" and \"The Angels\u2019Lamentation\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=124}} The \"Descent\" was painted directly on the wall, without any cardboard and even any preliminary sketches \u2013 only certain details were previously specified on small sheets of paper. Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]]{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}.\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle.

There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"...

In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version.

Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but can be seen in some icons from the Italian Renaissance. Though he clearly understood their significance and originality, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings since they differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would have unbalance the relative integrity of already-assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noted that the a new cathedral \"in a very special style\" would need to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously appealed to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer his acquired during the painting of sacred images techniques to  create completely the opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would unlikely connect both with the public and the critics from the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued the destroyed shit together. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich \u2013 the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait - fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis manifested itself in the following incident. Once, Vrubel visited Prakhov where was already a company of artists participating in the painting of the cathedral. Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and he will have to urgently travel to Kharkiv; thus, painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for a sun.

Most likely, he travelled there because he fell in love with a circus horsewoman which he met thanks to Yasinsky's brother who performed under the pseudonym \"Alexander Zemgano\". As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov.

Altogether, there were 18 painters, including Ilya Repin, [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Leonid Pasternak]], [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]. In this cohort, Vrubel was the only one who was completely unknown to the public.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} It is not known who drew the attention of the publishers to Vrubel. According to different versions, Vrubel was introduced to Konchalovsky by Mamontov, Korovin and even Pasternak who was responsible for editing.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} The salary for the work was quite small (800 rubles for 5 big and 13 small illustrations){{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=238}}. However, Vrubel' illustrations passed with difficulties since due to its complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. However, the main difficulty was the fact that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. Despite this, on April 10, 1891, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] and right after the publication was widely discussed in the press. It was the press that harshly criticized illustrations made by Vrubel, primarily for its \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him and thus the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious in his eyes as for others was  \"incomprehensibility\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the plot and at the same time made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist. The Demon was an archetypal \"fallen angel\" that simultaneously bridged men and female figures. Tamara was differently depicted on every image, and that emphasized her unavoidable choice between earthly and heavenly.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=14}} According to Dmitrieva, Vrubel\u2019 illustrations show the painterl being at the top of his game as a graphic artist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=37}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d (\u0441\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Demon Seated, 1890.

His friend Mikhail Vrubel attended the funeral and was so fond of local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that Mikhail proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and by any means was trying to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to be a freeloader in noble families and started earning good money by fulfilling orders on several furnace compositions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A. Mamontov; projecting the extension in the \"Roman-Byzantine style\" to the Mamontov's mansion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=245\u2014246}} According to Dmitrieva, \"Vrubel\u2026 seemed to be irreplaceable as he could easily do any art, except writing texts.

However, both of these studies differed in the accents of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of maiolic art in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]].

He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.

Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved).

Due to regular commissioned works made for Mamontov, Vrubel\u2019s reputation in Moscow grew greatly. For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A. Morozov's house in Podsosenskiy lane.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=272}}\n\nVrubel' decorative works illustrate how universal his talents were. The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries. For instance, at the end of his life,  [[Aleksandr Matveyev (sculptor)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] mentioned that \"without Vrubel there would be no [[Sergey Konenkov]]...\".{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}}\n\nThe gothic composition \"Robert and the Nuns\" is usually considered as the most important Vrubel's sculpture; it decorates the staircase of the Morozov mansion.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}} Literature on architecture emphasizes the exclusive role that Vrubel played in forming artistic appearances of the Moscow Art Nouveau.

According to the Korovin\u2019s memoirs, after getting a large salary for watercolour panels, he spent them as follows:\n{{quote|He organized the dinner in the hotel \"Paris\" where he also lived. He invited everyone who stayed there.

Savva Mamontov was a curator of the exposition dedicated to the [[Far North (Russia)|Russian North]]. It was him who noticed that the neighbouring section of arts lacks the paintings that would cover two large empty walls. Mamontov discussed with the Minister of Finance his idea to cover these walls with large panels with total area 20 \u00d7 5 m and ordered these panels from Vrubel.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=297}} At that time, the painter was busy decorating the Morozov's mansion in Moscow. However, he agreed to take the offer even though the order was quite big \u2013 the total area of paintings was 100 square meters, and it needed to be finished in three months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=299}} He planned to decorate the first wall with the painting \"[[Mikula Selyaninovich]]\" that metaphorically depicted the Russian land. For the second wall, Vrubel chose \"The Princess of the Dream\" inspired by a work of the same name made by the French poet [[Edmond Rostand]]. The second painting symbolically represented the painter's dream of beauty.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=60}}\n\nIt was impossible to complete the order in such short notice. That is why Vrubel instructed painter T. Safonov from Nizhny Novgorod to start working on \"Mikula\". Safonov was supposed to paint according to Vrubel's sketches. The decorative frieze was finished by A.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

According to the memoirs of his acquaintances, Vrubel started designing costumes for Nadezhda, redoing costumes for Tatiana Larina.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=319}} As was noted by Dmitrieva, Vrubel owes the fruitfulness of the ''Moscow period'' to Nadezhda and her admiration with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=75}} They personally met each other in 1898 when Nadezhda was invited to the [[Private Opera|Moscow private opera]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=64}} Zabela remembered that Vrubel listens to the opera \u201cSadko\u201d in which she sang the role of Princess of Volkhov no less than 90 times.

His [[migraine]]s got so strong that the painter had to take [[phenacetin]] in large quantities (according to his sister in law \u2013 up to 25 [[grain]]s and more).

The painter was able to finish ''Pan'' in one day while being in [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]\u2019s mansion in [[Talashkino]]. The plot was drawn in a canvas on which he previously started to paint the portrait of his wife.

Stored at the [[Russian Museum]]]]\n\nTen years later, Vrubel returned to the theme of Demon which is evident from his correspondence with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the end of 1898. Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom. His eyes, as if prophetically, captured the whole tragic fate of his fragility.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}}}\n\nThe birth of Savva led to a dramatic change in the routine of the family. Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively. Despite usual 3-4 hours, he worked up to 14 hours, and sometimes even more, with a flash of artificial lightning, never leaving the room and barely coming off the painting. Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910)==\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

As with the illustrations for Lermontov' works, Vrubel created a lot of graphic sketches trying to catch and solve the problem of a \"black-white colourness\". However, the final version had the figures of sea princess on it, about which Vrubel later told to Prakhov:\n{{Quote|After all, I did not intend to paint any \"sea princesses\" in my \"Pearl\". I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nVera Usoltseva, the wife of doctor Usoltsev, described Vrubel's condition to Nadezhda Vrubel as follows:\n{{Quote| Mikhail's condition did not change. His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time. But, unfortunately, he tore his new summer coat and trousers apart. He pretended to be calm, went to bed, covered himself with a blanket, and started to tugging the cloth underneath and tearing it into strips before the servant had noticed \u2026 His physical strength is high, which is rare for an intelligent person\u2026 You asked, should you write to him or not. No, you should not. He does not pay attention to letters and does not write them himself.

However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis. In addition, the painter was diagnosed with an [[optic neuropathy]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=449\u2014450}} Mikhail was kept in the clinic almost exclusively at the expense of his wife, which was not an easy task because a month of stay in the Usoltsev's clinic cost 100-150 rubles. On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in. He entered with a wrong, heavy gait as if he was dragging his feet. To tell the truth, I was shocked when I saw Vrubel. It was a frail and sick person in a dirty, crumpled shirt. He had a reddish face and bird of prey eyes; protruding hair instead of a beard. First impression: crazy! <...> In real life, all small Vrubel's movement reflected his disorder. However, when his hand took a pencil or a lump of coal, it became very steady and confident. Lines that he drew were infallible.\n\nHis artistic strength survived everything else in him. The human died, was destroyed, but the master continued to live.\n\nDuring the first session, the first draft was already finished. I am really sorry that nobody thought of taking a picture of this dark drawing. It was almost even more remarkable in terms of performance, facial expression, and similarity than the later portrait painted with coloured pencils.{{sfn|\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432|2002|pp=242\u2014244}}}}\n\nThen Ryabushinsky commissioned Serov to paint the portrait of Vrubel. They organized the work, so Vrubel was able to paint Bruysov in the mornings, while Serov painted Vrubel in the afternoons.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=453}} Even though Nadezhda Zabela was concerned if Vrubel could handle such stress, Usoltsev categorically said that \"as an artist, he was healthy and deeply healthy.\" The first issue of the \"Zolotoe runo\" was published on February 1, 1906, with the Bryusov's poem \"To M. A. Vrubel\" opening the issue. Twelve days later, Vrubel complained to his wife that he could not read or paint. In few days, he became completely blind.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=456}}\n===Fading away.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses. The request was approved, and Vrubel started receiving 75 rubles in summer and 100 rubles in winter months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=458}}\n\nAfter Vrubel lost his sight, his violent seizures occurred much rarer. Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him. Especially often they re-read [[Ivan Turgenev]] 's [[prose poetry]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] 's novella [[The Steppe (novella)|The Steppe]] on the grounds of which Vrubel once created a painting. Ekaterina Ge later recalled:\n{{quote|...

Some days he experienced enlightening and then complained about the misfortune that befell him.

In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\". Even before that the doctor Usoltsev wrote that \"It was different with him than with any other patients that usually lose the most thin or aesthetic sense first because for them they come the last; Vrubel's aesthetic sense died last because it was the first for him\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=461}}\n\nOn the eve of his death on 1 (14) April, 1910, Vrubel put himself in order, washed with cologne, and at night said to the nurse who was caring of him: \u201cNikolay, it\u2019s enough for me to lie here \u2013 we will go to the Academy.\u201d Indeed, the next day the coffin with Vrubel was put in the Academy of Arts.

She was buried near with her husband. Russian sculptor [[Leonid Sherwood]] decided to construct the tombstone on their graves, but by 1913 he was able only to set up the black granite pedestal. After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. Then they started to move the graves of famous artists from the Novodevichy Cemetery to a new museum, but the transfer remained unfinished due to lack of finance and later beginning of the [[World War II|war]]. An alleged transfer of the Vrubel\u2019s ash did not take place as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://family-history.ru/material/biography/mesto/vrubel/mogila/ |title=\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 |publisher=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Family-History.ru |access-date=2014-11-17}}</ref> In 2015, the public initiated establishment of the new tombstone on the Vrubel\u2019s grave, but local authorities refused the installation<ref>{{cite web\n|title=\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://planeta.ru/campaigns/mihail_vrubel |publisher=Planeta.ru |access-date=2017-10-29}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0410. |title=\u0412 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/26736/3763475/ |date=2017-09-26 |publisher=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 |access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>\n\nVrubel\u2019s works are exhibited in [[The State Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow, [[Russian Museum]] in Saint Petersburg, Vrubel Museum of Fine Arts in Omsk, Kiev Art Gallery, [[Odessa Art Museum]], [[Belarusian National Arts Museum]], and other places.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D|title=\u041c. \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u201c\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u201d - \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c |publisher=www.artmuseum.by|accessdate=2019-01-11 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103060635/http://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D |archivedate=2019-01-03}}</ref> Many commemorative sights and objects are named after Vrubel in Omsk, Kiev, Voronezh, Moscow, Saratov, Odessa.\n\nMany researchers and critics have differently evaluated the impact that Vrubel had on Russian and Global art. According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia. Vrubel had to wait for his admirers, customers and patrons to appear only in the mid-1890s.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68, 73}}\n\n==In the cinema==\n* [[1953]] \u2014 ''[[Rimsky-Korsakov (film)|Rimsky-Korsakov]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430, \u0410. \u041d.\n|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0432 XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0435\n|publisher=\u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|year=1999\n|pages=448\n|isbn=5-250-02693-1\n|ref=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412. \u042f.\n|title=\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430. \u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u041e\u041b\u041c\u0410-\u041f\u0420\u0415\u0421\u0421\n|year=2002\n|pages=415\n|isbn=5-94850-030-6\n|ref=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\n|title=\u0412\u0435\u0441\u044c \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 \u043d\u0430 1914 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0433. \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\n|place=Saint Petersburg\n|publisher=\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0410. \u0421. \u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u00ab\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\u00bb\n|year=1914\n|isbn=5-94030-052-9\n|ref=Suvorkin}} \n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\n|title=\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\n|place=Leningrad\n|publisher=\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\n|year=1976\n|pages=383\n|ref=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d, \u041c. \u042e.\n|title=\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c. \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u0410\u0412\u0420\u041e\u0420\u0410\n|year=2010\n|pages=160\n|isbn=978-5-7300-0825-0\n|ref=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d. \u0410.\n|title=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432. \u0412\u044b\u043f.

Agent-based modeling is a rule-based, [[computational modeling]] methodology that focuses on rules and interactions among the individual components or the agents of the system.<ref name=sysBiology>{{cite journal|author1=An G.|author2=Mi Q.|author3=Dutta-Moscato J.|author4=Vodovotz Y.|year=2009|title=Agent-based models in translational systems biology|journal=Systems Biology and Medicine|volume=1|issue=3|pages=159\u2013171|doi=10.1002/wsbm.45|pmid=20835989|pmc=3640333}}</ref>  The goal of this modeling method is to generate populations of the system components of interest and simulate their interactions in a virtual world.  Agent-based models start with rules for behavior and seek to reconstruct, through computational instantiation of those behavioral rules, the observed patterns of behavior.<ref name=sysBiology/>  Several of the characteristics of agent-based models important to biological studies include: \n# Modular structure: The behavior of an agent-based model is defined by the rules of its agents.  Existing agent rules can be modified or new agents can be added without having to modify the entire model.\n# Emergent properties: Through the use of the individual agents that interact locally with rules of behavior, agent-based models result in a synergy that leads to a higher level whole with much more intricate behavior than those of each individual agent.<ref name=review>{{cite web|author=Politopoulos, I. |date=11 September 2007 |title=Review and Analysis of Agent-based Models in Biology |url=http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/research/techreports/tr2007/ulcs-07-021.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727085744/http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/research/techreports/tr2007/ulcs-07-021.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n# Abstraction: Either by excluding non-essential details or when details are not available, agent-based models can be constructed in the absence of complete knowledge of the system under study.

Forest resources make up approximately 15% of the province\u2019s economy, so infestations caused by insects such as the MPB can have significant impacts on the economy.  The MPB outbreaks are considered a major natural disturbance that can result in widespread mortality of the [[lodgepole pine]] tree, one of the most abundant commercial tree species in British Columbia.  Insect outbreaks have resulted in the death of trees over areas of several thousand square kilometers.\n\nThe agent-based model developed for this study was designed to simulate the MPB attack behavior in order to evaluate how [[Forest management|management]] practices influence the spatial distribution and patterns of insect population and their preferences for attacked and killed trees.  Three management strategies were considered by the model: 1) no management, 2) sanitation harvest and 3) salvage harvest.  In the model, the Beetle Agent represented the MPB behavior; the Pine Agent represented the forest environment and tree health evolution; the Forest Management Agent represented the different management strategies. The Beetle Agent follows a series of rules to decide where to fly within the forest and to select a healthy tree to attack, feed, and breed.  The MPB typically kills host trees in its natural environment in order to successfully reproduce.  The beetle [[larvae]] feed on the inner bark of mature host trees, eventually killing them.  In order for the beetles to reproduce, the host tree must be sufficiently large and have thick inner bark.  The MPB outbreaks end when the food supply decreases to the point that there is not enough to sustain the population or when climatic conditions become unfavorable for the beetle.  The Pine Agent simulates the resistance of the host tree, specifically the Lodgepole pine tree, and monitors the state and attributes of each stand of trees.  At some point in the MPB attack, the number of beetles per tree reaches the host tree capacity.  When this point is reached, the beetles release a chemical to direct beetles to attack other trees.  The Pine Agent models this behavior by calculating the beetle population density per stand and passes the information to the Beetle Agents.  The Forest Management Agent was used, at the stand level, to simulate two common [[silviculture]] practices (sanitation and salvage) as well as the strategy where no management practice was employed.  With the sanitation harvest strategy, if a stand has an infestation rate greater than a set threshold, the stand is removed as well as any healthy neighbor stand when the average size of the trees exceeded a set threshold.  For the salvage harvest strategy, a stand is removed even it is not under a MPB attack if a predetermined number of neighboring stands are under a MPB attack.\n\nThe study considered a forested area in the North-Central Interior of British Columbia of approximately 560 [[hectare]].  The area consisted primarily of Lodgepole pine with smaller proportions of [[Douglas fir]] and [[White spruce]].  The model was executed for five time steps, each step representing a single year.  Thirty simulation runs were conducted for each forest management strategy considered.  The results of the simulation showed that when no management strategy was employed, the highest overall MPB infestation occurred.  The results also showed that the salvage forest management technique resulted in a 25% reduction in the number of forest strands killed by the MPB, as opposed to a 19% reduction by the salvage forest management strategy.  In summary, the results show that the model can be used as a tool to build forest management policies.\n\n==Invasive species==\n[[Invasive species]] refers to \"non-native\" plants and animals that adversely affect the environments they invade.  The introduction of invasive species may have environmental, economic, and ecological implications.  In the paper titled \"An Agent-Based Model of Border Enforcement for Invasive Species Management\", an agent-based model is presented that was developed to evaluate the impacts of [[Port of entry|port]]-specific and [[importer]]-specific enforcement regimes for a given [[crop|agricultural commodity]] that presents invasive species risk.  Ultimately, the goal of the study was to improve the allocation of enforcement resources and to provide a tool to policy makers to answer further questions concerning border enforcement and invasive species risk.\n\nThe agent-based model developed for the study considered three types of agents: invasive species, importers, and border enforcement agents.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ameden, H.|author2=Boxall, P.|author3=Cash, S.|author4=Vickers, A.|year=2009|title=An Agent-Based Model of Border Enforcement for Invasive Species Management|journal=Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=57|issue=4|pages=481\u2013496|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7976.2009.01166.x|lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>  In the model, the invasive species can only react to their surroundings, while the importers and border enforcement agents are able to make their own decisions based on their own goals and objectives.  The invasive species has the ability to determine if it has been released in an area containing the target crop, and to spread to adjacent plots of the target crop.  The model incorporates spatial probability maps that are used to determine if an invasive species becomes established.  The study focused on shipments of [[broccoli]] from [[Mexico]] into [[California]] through the ports of entry [[Calexico, California]] and [[Otay Mesa, California]].  The selected invasive species of concern was the [[beetle|crucifer flea beetle]] (''Phyllotreta cruciferae'').  California is by far the largest producer of broccoli in the United States and so the concern and potential impact of an invasive species introduction through the chosen ports of entry is significant.  The model also incorporated a spatially explicit damage function that was used to model invasive species damage in a realistic manner.  Agent-based modeling provides the ability to analyze the behavior of [[heterogeneous]] actors, so three different types of importers were considered that differed in terms of commodity infection rates (high, medium, and low), pretreatment choice, and cost of transportation to the ports.  The model gave predictions on inspection rates for each port of entry and importer and determined the success rate of border agent inspection, not only for each port and importer but also for each potential level of pretreatment (no pretreatment, level one, level two, and level three).\n\nThe model was implemented and ran in [[NetLogo]], version 3.1.5.  Spatial information on the location of the ports of entry, major highways, and transportation routes was included in the analysis as well as a map of California broccoli crops layered with invasive species establishment probability maps.  BehaviorSpace,<ref>[http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html BehaviorSpace Guide]</ref>  a software tool integrated with NetLogo, was used to test the effects of different parameters (e.g. shipment value, pretreatment cost) in the model.  On average, 100 iterations were calculated at each level of the parameter being used, where an iteration represented a one-year run.\n\nThe results of the model showed that as inspection efforts increase, importers increase due care, or the pretreatment of shipments, and the total monetary loss of California crops decreases.  The model showed that importers respond to an increase in inspection effort in different ways.  Some importers responded to increased inspection rate by increasing pretreatment effort, while others chose to avoid shipping to a specific port, or shopped for another port.  An important result of the model results is that it can show or provide recommendations to policy makers about the point at which importers may start to shop for ports, such as the inspection rate at which port shopping is introduced and the importers associated with a certain level of pest risk or transportation cost are likely to make these changes.  Another interesting outcome of the model is that when inspectors were not able to learn to respond to an importer with previously infested shipments, damage to California broccoli crops was estimated to be $150 million.  However, when inspectors were able to increase inspection rates of importers with previous violations, damage to the California broccoli crops was reduced by approximately 12%.  The model provides a mechanism to predict the introduction of invasive species from agricultural imports and their likely damage.  Equally as important, the model provides policy makers and border control agencies with a tool that can be used to determine the best allocation of inspectional resources.\n\n==Aphid population dynamics==\nIn the article titled \"Aphid Population Dynamics in Agricultural Landscapes: An Agent-based Simulation Model\", an agent-based model is presented to study the [[population dynamics]] of the [[Rhopalosiphum|bird cherry-oat aphid]], ''Rhopalosiphum padi'' (L.).<ref name=aphid>{{cite conference|author1=Evans, A.|author2=Morgan, D.|author3=Parry, H.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=Aphid Population Dynamics in Agricultural Landscapes: An Agent-based Simulation Model|publisher=International Environmental Modeling and Software Society (iEMSs)|conference=2010 International Congress on Environmental Modeling and Software|location=Osnabruck, Germany|url=http://www.iemss.org/iemss2004/pdf/landscape/parraphi.pdf}}</ref>  The study was conducted in a five square kilometer region of [[North Yorkshire]], a county located in the [[Yorkshire]] and the [[Humber]] region of [[England]].  The agent-based modeling method was chosen because of its focus on the behavior of the individual agents rather than the population as a whole.  The authors propose that traditional models that focus on populations as a whole do not take into account the complexity of the concurrent interactions in [[ecosystems]], such as reproduction and competition for resources which may have significant impacts on population trends.  The agent-based modeling approach also allows modelers to create more generic and modular models that are more flexible and easier to maintain than modeling approaches that focus on the population as a whole.  Other proposed advantages of agent-based models include realistic representation of a phenomenon of interest due to the interactions of a group of autonomous agents, and the capability to integrate quantitative variables, [[differential equations]], and rule based behavior into the same model.\n\nThe model was implemented in the modeling toolkit [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|Repast]] using the [[Java (programming language)|JAVA]] programming language.  The model was run in daily time steps and focused on the autumn and winter seasons.  Input data for the model included habitat data, daily minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures, and wind speed and direction.  For the Aphid agents, age, position, and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] ([[alate]] or [[apterous]]) were considered.  Age ranged from 0.00 to 2.00, with 1.00 being the point at which the agent becomes an adult.  Reproduction by the Aphid agents is dependent on age, morphology, and daily minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures.  Once [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] hatch, they remain in the same location as their parents.  The morphology of the nymphs is related to population density and the nutrient quality of the [[aphid|aphid\u2019s]] food source.  The model also considered mortality among the Aphid agents, which is dependent on age, temperatures, and quality of habitat.  The speed at which an Aphid agent ages is determined by the daily minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures.  The model considered movement of the Aphid agents to occur in two separate phases, a migratory phase and a foraging phase, both of which affect the overall [[population distribution]].\n\nThe study started the simulation run with an initial population of 10,000 alate aphids distributed across a grid of 25 meter cells.  The simulation results showed that there were two major population peaks, the first in early autumn due to an influx of alate immigrants and the second due to lower temperatures later in the year and a lack of immigrants.  Ultimately, it is the goal of the researchers to adapt this model to simulate broader ecosystems and animal types.\n\n==Aquatic population dynamics==\nIn the article titled \"Exploring Multi-Agent Systems In Aquatic Population Dynamics Modeling\", a model is proposed to study the population dynamics of two species of [[macrophyte]]s.<ref name=aquatic>{{cite conference|author1=Li, H.|author2=Mynett, A.|author3=Qi, H.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Exploring Multi-Agent Systems In Aquatic Population Dynamics Modeling|conference=Proc. 8th International Conference on Hydroinformatics|location=Chile}}</ref>  [[Aquatic plant]]s play a vital role in the [[ecosystem]]s in which they live as they may provide shelter and food for other aquatic organisms.  However, they may also have harmful impacts such as the excessive growth of [[Non-native species|non-native plants]] or [[eutrophication]] of the lakes in which they live leading to [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions.  Given these possibilities, it is important to understand how the environment and other organisms affect the growth of these aquatic plants to allow mitigation or prevention of these harmful impacts.\n\n[[Potamogeton|''Potamogeton pectinatus'']] is one of the aquatic plant agents in the model.  It is an [[annual plant|annual growth plant]] that absorbs nutrients from the soil and reproduces through root [[tubers]] and [[rhizomes]].  Reproduction of the plant is not impacted by water flow, but can be influenced by animals, other plants, and humans.  The plant can grow up to two meters tall, which is a limiting condition because it can only grow in certain water depths, and most of its biomass is found at the top of the plant in order to capture the most sunlight possible.  The second plant agent in the model is ''Chara aspera'', also a rooted aquatic plant.  One major difference in the two plants is that the latter reproduces through the use of very small seeds called oospores and bulbills which are spread via the flow of water.  ''Chara aspera'' only grows up to 20&nbsp;cm and requires very good light conditions as well as good water quality, all of which are limiting factors on the growth of the plant.  ''Chara aspera'' has a higher growth rate than ''Potamogeton pectinatus'' but has a much shorter life span.  The model also considered environmental and animal agents.  Environmental agents considered included water flow, light penetration, and water depth.  Flow conditions, although not of high importance to ''Potamogeton pectinatus'', directly impact the seed dispersal of ''Chara aspera''.  Flow conditions affect the direction as well as the distance the seeds will be distributed.  Light penetration strongly influences ''Chara aspera'' as it requires high water quality.  [[Mass attenuation coefficient|Extinction coefficient]] (EC) is a measure of light penetration in water.  As EC increases, the growth rate of ''Chara aspera'' decreases.  Finally, depth is important to both species of plants.  As water depth increases, the light penetration decreases making it difficult for either species to survive beyond certain depths.\n\nThe area of interest in the model was a lake in the [[Netherlands]] named [[Lake Veluwe]].  It is a relatively shallow lake with an average depth of 1.55 meters and covers about 30 square kilometers.  The lake is under eutrophication stress which means that nutrients are not a limiting factor for either of the plant agents in the model.  The initial position of the plant agents in the model was randomly determined.  The model was implemented using [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|Repast]] software package and was executed to simulate the growth and decay of the two different plant agents, taking into account the environmental agents previously discussed as well as interactions with other plant agents.  The results of the model execution show that the population distribution of ''Chara aspera'' has a spatial pattern very similar to the GIS maps of observed distributions.  The authors of the study conclude that the agent rules developed in the study are reasonable to simulate the spatial pattern of macrophyte growth in this particular lake.\n\n==Bacteria aggregation leading to biofilm formation==\nIn the article titled \"iDynoMiCS: next-generation individual-based modelling of biofilms\", an agent-based model is presented that models the colonisation of bacteria onto a surface, leading to the formation of [[biofilm]]s.<ref name=idynomics>{{cite journal|vauthors=Lardon LA, Merkey BV, Martins S, D\u00f6tsch A, Picioreanu C, Kreft JU, Smets BF|year=2011|title=iDynoMiCS: next-generation individual-based modelling of biofilms|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=13|issue=9|pages=2416\u20132434|pmid=21410622|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02414.x}}</ref> The purpose of iDynoMiCS (standing for individual-based Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator) is to simulate the growth of populations and communities of individual microbes (small unicellular organisms such as bacteria, [[archaea]] and [[protist]]s) that compete for space and resources in biofilms immersed in aquatic environments. iDynoMiCS can be used to seek to understand how individual microbial dynamics lead to emergent population- or biofilm-level properties and behaviours. Examining such formations is important in soil and river studies, dental hygiene studies, infectious disease and medical implant related infection research, and for understanding biocorrosion.<ref name=mmmb>{{cite book|vauthors=Wanner O, Eberl H, Morgenroth E, Noguera D, Picioreanu C, Rittmann B, van Loosdrecht M |year=2006|title= Mathematical Modeling of Biofilms|publisher=IWA Publishing|location=London}}</ref> An agent-based modelling paradigm was employed to make it possible to explore how each individual bacterium, of a particular species, contributes to the development of the biofilm.  The initial illustration of iDynoMiCS considered how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of [[denitrifying bacteria]] that induce the denitrification pathway under [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] or low oxygen conditions.<ref name=\"idynomics\"/> The study explores the hypothesis that the existence of diverse strategies of denitrification in an environment can be explained by solely assuming that faster response incurs a higher cost. The agent-based model suggests that if metabolic pathways can be switched without cost the faster the switching the better. However, where faster switching incurs a higher cost, there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations. This suggests that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different biological environments. Since this introduction the applications of iDynoMiCS continues to increase: a recent exploration of the [[plasmid]] invasion in biofilms being one example.<ref name=plasmid>{{cite journal|vauthors=Merkey BV, Lardon LA, Seoane JM, Kreft JU, Smets BF|year=2011|title=Growth dependence of conjugation explains limited plasmid invasion in biofilms: an individual-based modeling study|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=13|issue=9|pages=2435\u20132452|pmid=21906217|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02535.x}}</ref> This study explored the hypothesis that poor plasmid spread in biofilms is caused by a dependence of conjugation on the growth rate of the plasmid donor agent. Through simulation, the paper suggests that plasmid invasion into a resident biofilm is only limited when plasmid transfer depends on growth. Sensitivity analysis techniques were employed that suggests parameters relating to timing (lag before plasmid transfer between agents) and spatial reach are more important for plasmid invasion into a biofilm than the receiving agents growth rate or probability of segregational loss. Further examples that use iDynoMiCS continue to be published, including use of iDynoMiCS in modelling of a ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' biofilm with glucose substrate.<ref name=pseudo>{{cite conference|author1=Steffens, Matthew J.|author2=Clement, Barbara J.|author3=Wentworth, Christopher D.|year=2011|title=Individual-based Modeling of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm with Glucose Substrate|publisher=American Physical Society|conference=Fall 2011 Meeting of the APS Prairie Section, ''November 10\u201312, 2011, abstract #E1.006''}}</ref>\n\niDynoMiCS has been developed by an international team of researchers in order to provide a common platform for further development of all individual-based models of microbial biofilms and such like. The model was originally the result of years of work by Laurent Lardon, Brian Merkey, and Jan-Ulrich Kreft, with code contributions from Joao Xavier. With additional funding from the [[Alternatives to animal testing|National Centre for Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)]] in 2013, the development of iDynoMiCS as a tool for biological exploration continues apace, with new features being added when appropriate. From its inception, the team have committed to releasing iDynoMiCS as an [[Open-source software|open source]] platform, encouraging collaborators to develop additional functionality that can then be merged into the next stable release. IDynoMiCS has been implemented in the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language, with MATLAB and R scripts provided to analyse results.

The model consists of millions of agents, with each agent representing a mammary stem cell, a progenitor cell, or a differentiated cell in the breast.  Simulations were first run on the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] Lawrencium supercomputer to parameterize and benchmark the model against a variety of ''in vivo'' mammary gland measurements.  The model was then used to test the three different mechanisms to determine which one led to simulation results that matched ''in vivo'' experiments the best.  Surprisingly, radiation-induced cell inactivation by death did not contribute to increased stem cell frequency independently of the dose delivered in the model. Instead the model revealed that the combination of increased self-renewal and cell proliferation during puberty led to stem cell enrichment. In contrast epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the model was shown to increase stem cell frequency not only in pubertal mammary glands but also in adult glands. This latter prediction, however, contradicted the ''in vivo'' data; irradiation of adult mammary glands did not lead to increased stem cell frequency. These simulations therefore suggested self-renewal as the primary mechanism behind pubertal stem cell increase.\n\nTo further evaluate self-renewal as the mechanism, a second agent-based model was created to simulate the growth dynamics of human mammary epithelial cells (containing stem/progenitor and differentiated cell subpopulations) ''in vitro'' after irradiation.  By comparing the simulation results with data from the ''in vitro'' experiments, the second agent-based model further confirmed that cells must extensively proliferate to observe a self-renewal dependent increase in stem/progenitor cell numbers after irradiation.\n\nThe combination of the two agent-based models and the ''in vitro''/''in vivo'' experiments provide insight into why children exposed to ionizing radiation have a substantially greater breast cancer risk than adults. Together, they support the hypothesis that the breast is susceptible to a transient increase in stem cell self-renewal when exposed to radiation during puberty, which primes the adult tissue to develop cancer decades later.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Autonomous agent]]\n* [[Intelligent agent]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{collective animal behaviour|state=expand}}\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=none}}\n\n[[Category:Multi-agent systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012}}\n[[Agent-based model]]s have many applications in [[biology]], primarily due to the characteristics of the modeling method.

Forest resources make up approximately 15% of the province\u2019s economy, so infestations caused by insects such as the MPB can have significant impacts on the economy.  The MPB outbreaks are considered a major natural disturbance that can result in widespread mortality of the [[lodgepole pine]] tree, one of the most abundant commercial tree species in British Columbia.  Insect outbreaks have resulted in the death of trees over areas of several thousand square kilometers.\n\nThe agent-based model developed for this study was designed to simulate the MPB attack behavior in order to evaluate how [[Forest management|management]] practices influence the spatial distribution and patterns of insect population and their preferences for attacked and killed trees.  Three management strategies were considered by the model: 1) no management, 2) sanitation harvest and 3) salvage harvest.  In the model, the Beetle Agent represented the MPB behavior; the Pine Agent represented the forest environment and tree health evolution; the Forest Management Agent represented the different management strategies. The Beetle Agent follows a series of rules to decide where to fly within the forest and to select a healthy tree to attack, feed, and breed.  The MPB typically kills host trees in its natural environment in order to successfully reproduce.  The beetle [[larvae]] feed on the inner bark of mature host trees, eventually killing them.  In order for the beetles to reproduce, the host tree must be sufficiently large and have thick inner bark.  The MPB outbreaks end when the food supply decreases to the point that there is not enough to sustain the population or when climatic conditions become unfavorable for the beetle.  The Pine Agent simulates the resistance of the host tree, specifically the Lodgepole pine tree, and monitors the state and attributes of each stand of trees.  At some point in the MPB attack, the number of beetles per tree reaches the host tree capacity.  When this point is reached, the beetles release a chemical to direct beetles to attack other trees.  The Pine Agent models this behavior by calculating the beetle population density per stand and passes the information to the Beetle Agents.  The Forest Management Agent was used, at the stand level, to simulate two common [[silviculture]] practices (sanitation and salvage) as well as the strategy where no management practice was employed.  With the sanitation harvest strategy, if a stand has an infestation rate greater than a set threshold, the stand is removed as well as any healthy neighbor stand when the average size of the trees exceeded a set threshold.  For the salvage harvest strategy, a stand is removed even it is not under a MPB attack if a predetermined number of neighboring stands are under a MPB attack.\n\nThe study considered a forested area in the North-Central Interior of British Columbia of approximately 560 [[hectare]].  The area consisted primarily of Lodgepole pine with smaller proportions of [[Douglas fir]] and [[White spruce]].  The model was executed for five time steps, each step representing a single year.  Thirty simulation runs were conducted for each forest management strategy considered.  The results of the simulation showed that when no management strategy was employed, the highest overall MPB infestation occurred.  The results also showed that the salvage forest management technique resulted in a 25% reduction in the number of forest strands killed by the MPB, as opposed to a 19% reduction by the salvage forest management strategy.  In summary, the results show that the model can be used as a tool to build forest management policies.\n\n==Invasive species==\n[[Invasive species]] refers to \"non-native\" plants and animals that adversely affect the environments they invade.  The introduction of invasive species may have environmental, economic, and ecological implications.  In the paper titled \"An Agent-Based Model of Border Enforcement for Invasive Species Management\", an agent-based model is presented that was developed to evaluate the impacts of [[Port of entry|port]]-specific and [[importer]]-specific enforcement regimes for a given [[crop|agricultural commodity]] that presents invasive species risk.  Ultimately, the goal of the study was to improve the allocation of enforcement resources and to provide a tool to policy makers to answer further questions concerning border enforcement and invasive species risk.\n\nThe agent-based model developed for the study considered three types of agents: invasive species, importers, and border enforcement agents.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ameden, H.|author2=Boxall, P.|author3=Cash, S.|author4=Vickers, A.|year=2009|title=An Agent-Based Model of Border Enforcement for Invasive Species Management|journal=Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=57|issue=4|pages=481\u2013496|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7976.2009.01166.x|lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>  In the model, the invasive species can only react to their surroundings, while the importers and border enforcement agents are able to make their own decisions based on their own goals and objectives.  The invasive species has the ability to determine if it has been released in an area containing the target crop, and to spread to adjacent plots of the target crop.  The model incorporates spatial probability maps that are used to determine if an invasive species becomes established.  The study focused on shipments of [[broccoli]] from [[Mexico]] into [[California]] through the ports of entry [[Calexico, California]] and [[Otay Mesa, California]].  The selected invasive species of concern was the [[beetle|crucifer flea beetle]] (''Phyllotreta cruciferae'').  California is by far the largest producer of broccoli in the United States and so the concern and potential impact of an invasive species introduction through the chosen ports of entry is significant.  The model also incorporated a spatially explicit damage function that was used to model invasive species damage in a realistic manner.  Agent-based modeling provides the ability to analyze the behavior of [[heterogeneous]] actors, so three different types of importers were considered that differed in terms of commodity infection rates (high, medium, and low), pretreatment choice, and cost of transportation to the ports.  The model gave predictions on inspection rates for each port of entry and importer and determined the success rate of border agent inspection, not only for each port and importer but also for each potential level of pretreatment (no pretreatment, level one, level two, and level three).\n\nThe model was implemented and ran in [[NetLogo]], version 3.1.5.  Spatial information on the location of the ports of entry, major highways, and transportation routes was included in the analysis as well as a map of California broccoli crops layered with invasive species establishment probability maps.  BehaviorSpace,<ref>[http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html BehaviorSpace Guide]</ref>  a software tool integrated with NetLogo, was used to test the effects of different parameters (e.g. shipment value, pretreatment cost) in the model.  On average, 100 iterations were calculated at each level of the parameter being used, where an iteration represented a one-year run.\n\nThe results of the model showed that as inspection efforts increase, importers increase due care, or the pretreatment of shipments, and the total monetary loss of California crops decreases.  The model showed that importers respond to an increase in inspection effort in different ways.  Some importers responded to increased inspection rate by increasing pretreatment effort, while others chose to avoid shipping to a specific port, or shopped for another port.  An important result of the model results is that it can show or provide recommendations to policy makers about the point at which importers may start to shop for ports, such as the inspection rate at which port shopping is introduced and the importers associated with a certain level of pest risk or transportation cost are likely to make these changes.  Another interesting outcome of the model is that when inspectors were not able to learn to respond to an importer with previously infested shipments, damage to California broccoli crops was estimated to be $150 million.  However, when inspectors were able to increase inspection rates of importers with previous violations, damage to the California broccoli crops was reduced by approximately 12%.  The model provides a mechanism to predict the introduction of invasive species from agricultural imports and their likely damage.  Equally as important, the model provides policy makers and border control agencies with a tool that can be used to determine the best allocation of inspectional resources.\n\n==Aphid population dynamics==\nIn the article titled \"Aphid Population Dynamics in Agricultural Landscapes: An Agent-based Simulation Model\", an agent-based model is presented to study the [[population dynamics]] of the [[Rhopalosiphum|bird cherry-oat aphid]], ''Rhopalosiphum padi'' (L.).<ref name=aphid>{{cite conference|author1=Evans, A.|author2=Morgan, D.|author3=Parry, H.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2004|title=Aphid Population Dynamics in Agricultural Landscapes: An Agent-based Simulation Model|publisher=International Environmental Modeling and Software Society (iEMSs)|conference=2010 International Congress on Environmental Modeling and Software|location=Osnabruck, Germany|url=http://www.iemss.org/iemss2004/pdf/landscape/parraphi.pdf}}</ref>  The study was conducted in a five square kilometer region of [[North Yorkshire]], a county located in the [[Yorkshire]] and the [[Humber]] region of [[England]].  The agent-based modeling method was chosen because of its focus on the behavior of the individual agents rather than the population as a whole.  The authors propose that traditional models that focus on populations as a whole do not take into account the complexity of the concurrent interactions in [[ecosystems]], such as reproduction and competition for resources which may have significant impacts on population trends.  The agent-based modeling approach also allows modelers to create more generic and modular models that are more flexible and easier to maintain than modeling approaches that focus on the population as a whole.  Other proposed advantages of agent-based models include realistic representation of a phenomenon of interest due to the interactions of a group of autonomous agents, and the capability to integrate quantitative variables, [[differential equations]], and rule based behavior into the same model.\n\nThe model was implemented in the modeling toolkit [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|Repast]] using the [[Java (programming language)|JAVA]] programming language.  The model was run in daily time steps and focused on the autumn and winter seasons.  Input data for the model included habitat data, daily minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures, and wind speed and direction.  For the Aphid agents, age, position, and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] ([[alate]] or [[apterous]]) were considered.  Age ranged from 0.00 to 2.00, with 1.00 being the point at which the agent becomes an adult.  Reproduction by the Aphid agents is dependent on age, morphology, and daily minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures.  Once [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] hatch, they remain in the same location as their parents.  The morphology of the nymphs is related to population density and the nutrient quality of the [[aphid|aphid\u2019s]] food source.  The model also considered mortality among the Aphid agents, which is dependent on age, temperatures, and quality of habitat.  The speed at which an Aphid agent ages is determined by the daily minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures.  The model considered movement of the Aphid agents to occur in two separate phases, a migratory phase and a foraging phase, both of which affect the overall [[population distribution]].\n\nThe study started the simulation run with an initial population of 10,000 alate aphids distributed across a grid of 25 meter cells.  The simulation results showed that there were two major population peaks, the first in early autumn due to an influx of alate immigrants and the second due to lower temperatures later in the year and a lack of immigrants.  Ultimately, it is the goal of the researchers to adapt this model to simulate broader ecosystems and animal types.\n\n==Aquatic population dynamics==\nIn the article titled \"Exploring Multi-Agent Systems In Aquatic Population Dynamics Modeling\", a model is proposed to study the population dynamics of two species of [[macrophyte]]s.<ref name=aquatic>{{cite conference|author1=Li, H.|author2=Mynett, A.|author3=Qi, H.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Exploring Multi-Agent Systems In Aquatic Population Dynamics Modeling|conference=Proc. 8th International Conference on Hydroinformatics|location=Chile}}</ref>  [[Aquatic plant]]s play a vital role in the [[ecosystem]]s in which they live as they may provide shelter and food for other aquatic organisms.  However, they may also have harmful impacts such as the excessive growth of [[Non-native species|non-native plants]] or [[eutrophication]] of the lakes in which they live leading to [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions.  Given these possibilities, it is important to understand how the environment and other organisms affect the growth of these aquatic plants to allow mitigation or prevention of these harmful impacts.\n\n[[Potamogeton|''Potamogeton pectinatus'']] is one of the aquatic plant agents in the model.  It is an [[annual plant|annual growth plant]] that absorbs nutrients from the soil and reproduces through root [[tubers]] and [[rhizomes]].  Reproduction of the plant is not impacted by water flow, but can be influenced by animals, other plants, and humans.  The plant can grow up to two meters tall, which is a limiting condition because it can only grow in certain water depths, and most of its biomass is found at the top of the plant in order to capture the most sunlight possible.  The second plant agent in the model is ''Chara aspera'', also a rooted aquatic plant.  One major difference in the two plants is that the latter reproduces through the use of very small seeds called oospores and bulbills which are spread via the flow of water.  ''Chara aspera'' only grows up to 20&nbsp;cm and requires very good light conditions as well as good water quality, all of which are limiting factors on the growth of the plant.  ''Chara aspera'' has a higher growth rate than ''Potamogeton pectinatus'' but has a much shorter life span.  The model also considered environmental and animal agents.  Environmental agents considered included water flow, light penetration, and water depth.  Flow conditions, although not of high importance to ''Potamogeton pectinatus'', directly impact the seed dispersal of ''Chara aspera''.  Flow conditions affect the direction as well as the distance the seeds will be distributed.  Light penetration strongly influences ''Chara aspera'' as it requires high water quality.  [[Mass attenuation coefficient|Extinction coefficient]] (EC) is a measure of light penetration in water.  As EC increases, the growth rate of ''Chara aspera'' decreases.  Finally, depth is important to both species of plants.  As water depth increases, the light penetration decreases making it difficult for either species to survive beyond certain depths.\n\nThe area of interest in the model was a lake in the [[Netherlands]] named [[Lake Veluwe]].  It is a relatively shallow lake with an average depth of 1.55 meters and covers about 30 square kilometers.  The lake is under eutrophication stress which means that nutrients are not a limiting factor for either of the plant agents in the model.  The initial position of the plant agents in the model was randomly determined.  The model was implemented using [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|Repast]] software package and was executed to simulate the growth and decay of the two different plant agents, taking into account the environmental agents previously discussed as well as interactions with other plant agents.  The results of the model execution show that the population distribution of ''Chara aspera'' has a spatial pattern very similar to the GIS maps of observed distributions.  The authors of the study conclude that the agent rules developed in the study are reasonable to simulate the spatial pattern of macrophyte growth in this particular lake.\n\n==Bacteria aggregation leading to biofilm formation==\nIn the article titled \"iDynoMiCS: next-generation individual-based modelling of biofilms\", an agent-based model is presented that models the colonisation of bacteria onto a surface, leading to the formation of [[biofilm]]s.<ref name=idynomics>{{cite journal|vauthors=Lardon LA, Merkey BV, Martins S, D\u00f6tsch A, Picioreanu C, Kreft JU, Smets BF|year=2011|title=iDynoMiCS: next-generation individual-based modelling of biofilms|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=13|issue=9|pages=2416\u20132434|pmid=21410622|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02414.x}}</ref> The purpose of iDynoMiCS (standing for individual-based Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator) is to simulate the growth of populations and communities of individual microbes (small unicellular organisms such as bacteria, [[archaea]] and [[protist]]s) that compete for space and resources in biofilms immersed in aquatic environments. iDynoMiCS can be used to seek to understand how individual microbial dynamics lead to emergent population- or biofilm-level properties and behaviours. Examining such formations is important in soil and river studies, dental hygiene studies, infectious disease and medical implant related infection research, and for understanding biocorrosion.<ref name=mmmb>{{cite book|vauthors=Wanner O, Eberl H, Morgenroth E, Noguera D, Picioreanu C, Rittmann B, van Loosdrecht M |year=2006|title= Mathematical Modeling of Biofilms|publisher=IWA Publishing|location=London}}</ref> An agent-based modelling paradigm was employed to make it possible to explore how each individual bacterium, of a particular species, contributes to the development of the biofilm.  The initial illustration of iDynoMiCS considered how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of [[denitrifying bacteria]] that induce the denitrification pathway under [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] or low oxygen conditions.<ref name=\"idynomics\"/> The study explores the hypothesis that the existence of diverse strategies of denitrification in an environment can be explained by solely assuming that faster response incurs a higher cost. The agent-based model suggests that if metabolic pathways can be switched without cost the faster the switching the better. However, where faster switching incurs a higher cost, there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations. This suggests that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different biological environments. Since this introduction the applications of iDynoMiCS continues to increase: a recent exploration of the [[plasmid]] invasion in biofilms being one example.<ref name=plasmid>{{cite journal|vauthors=Merkey BV, Lardon LA, Seoane JM, Kreft JU, Smets BF|year=2011|title=Growth dependence of conjugation explains limited plasmid invasion in biofilms: an individual-based modeling study|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=13|issue=9|pages=2435\u20132452|pmid=21906217|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02535.x}}</ref> This study explored the hypothesis that poor plasmid spread in biofilms is caused by a dependence of conjugation on the growth rate of the plasmid donor agent. Through simulation, the paper suggests that plasmid invasion into a resident biofilm is only limited when plasmid transfer depends on growth. Sensitivity analysis techniques were employed that suggests parameters relating to timing (lag before plasmid transfer between agents) and spatial reach are more important for plasmid invasion into a biofilm than the receiving agents growth rate or probability of segregational loss.

Biofilm structures that are formed in simulation can be viewed as a movie using [[POV-Ray]] files that are generated as the simulation is run.\n\n==Mammary stem cell enrichment following irradiation during puberty==\nExperiments have shown that exposure to ionizing irradiation of pubertal mammary glands results in an increase in the ratio of mammary [[stem cell]]s in the gland.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nguyen | first1 = David| last2 = Oketch-Rabah | first2 = HA | last3 = Illa-Bochaca | first3 = Irineu | last4 = Geyer | first4 = FC | last5 = Reis-Filho | first5 = JS | last6 = Mao | first6 = JH | last7 = Ravani | first7 = SA | last8 = Zavadil | first8 = J | last9 = Borowsky | first9 = AD | last10 = Jerry | first10 = DJ | last11 = Dunphy | first11 = KA | last12 = Seo | first12 = JH | last13 = Haslam | first13 = S | last14 = Medina | first14 = D |  last15 = Barcellos-Hoff | first15 = Mary Helen | year = 2011 | title = Radiation acts on the microenvironment to affect breast carcinogenesis by distinct mechanisms that decrease cancer latency and affect tumor type | url = | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 640\u201351| doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2011.03.011 | pmid = 21575864 | pmc = 3110779}}</ref> This is important because stem cells are thought to be key targets for cancer initiation by ionizing radiation because they have the greatest long-term proliferative potential and mutagenic events persist in multiple daughter cells.

The model consists of millions of agents, with each agent representing a mammary stem cell, a progenitor cell, or a differentiated cell in the breast.  Simulations were first run on the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] Lawrencium supercomputer to parameterize and benchmark the model against a variety of ''in vivo'' mammary gland measurements.  The model was then used to test the three different mechanisms to determine which one led to simulation results that matched ''in vivo'' experiments the best.  Surprisingly, radiation-induced cell inactivation by death did not contribute to increased stem cell frequency independently of the dose delivered in the model. Instead the model revealed that the combination of increased self-renewal and cell proliferation during puberty led to stem cell enrichment. In contrast epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the model was shown to increase stem cell frequency not only in pubertal mammary glands but also in adult glands. This latter prediction, however, contradicted the ''in vivo'' data; irradiation of adult mammary glands did not lead to increased stem cell frequency. These simulations therefore suggested self-renewal as the primary mechanism behind pubertal stem cell increase.\n\nTo further evaluate self-renewal as the mechanism, a second agent-based model was created to simulate the growth dynamics of human mammary epithelial cells (containing stem/progenitor and differentiated cell subpopulations) ''in vitro'' after irradiation.  By comparing the simulation results with data from the ''in vitro'' experiments, the second agent-based model further confirmed that cells must extensively proliferate to observe a self-renewal dependent increase in stem/progenitor cell numbers after irradiation.\n\nThe combination of the two agent-based models and the ''in vitro''/''in vivo'' experiments provide insight into why children exposed to ionizing radiation have a substantially greater breast cancer risk than adults. Together, they support the hypothesis that the breast is susceptible to a transient increase in stem cell self-renewal when exposed to radiation during puberty, which primes the adult tissue to develop cancer decades later.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Autonomous agent]]\n* [[Intelligent agent]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{collective animal behaviour|state=expand}}\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=none}}\n\n[[Category:Multi-agent systems]]\n", "name_user": "Agrignard", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add Gama Platform as a refernce toolkis to developped Agent-Based Modelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model_in_biology"}
