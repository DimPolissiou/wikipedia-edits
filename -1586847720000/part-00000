At the next race in [[2019 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] he produced a strong drive to finish 6th, scoring his first Formula One points. The [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix|Chinese Grand Prix]] was the first of Norris' retirements that season, after damage from a first lap collision caused him to retire later in the race. His next retirement came two races later in [[2019 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] after a collision with [[Lance Stroll]]. After an 8th-place finish at the next race in [[2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix|Azerbaijan]], Norris suffered another retirement in [[2019 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] after his car suffered a suspension failure.\n\nNorris was on course to finish 7th in [[2019 French Grand Prix|France]] before hydraulic problems late in the race caused him to fall to 10th, eventually being classified 9th after a penalty for [[Daniel Ricciardo]]. This was followed by a 6th-place finish in [[2019 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]]. In [[2019 German Grand Prix|Germany]], Norris was forced to start from the back of the grid due to an engine penalty.

In [[2019 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], Norris was running in 5th place at the beginning of the race before [[Alexander Albon]] collided with him during an overtake attempt. Norris' pace suffered for the rest of the race due to the resulting floor damage and he eventually finished in 11th place. At the next race in [[2019 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], Norris' bad luck continued. Whilst making his pit stop from 7th place, a wheel was fitted incorrectly and after almost exiting the pits, he stopped and was pushed back into his pit box by his mechanics for them to fit the wheel correctly. He spent almost two minutes in the pits and eventually withdrew later in the race after being far behind the other drivers. Norris ended the season with another three strong drives resulting in consecutive points finishes.\n\nNorris finished his debut season in Formula One in 11th place in the championship with 49 points. This was considerably behind teammate Sainz, however Norris out-qualified Sainz 11-10 over the course of the season.

At the next race in [[2019 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] he produced a strong drive to finish 6th, scoring his first Formula One points. The [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix|Chinese Grand Prix]] was the first of Norris' retirements that season, after damage from a first lap collision caused him to retire later in the race. His next retirement came two races later in [[2019 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] after a collision with [[Lance Stroll]]. After an 8th-place finish at the next race in [[2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix|Azerbaijan]], Norris suffered another retirement in [[2019 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] after his car suffered a suspension failure.\n\nNorris was on course to finish 7th in [[2019 French Grand Prix|France]] before hydraulic problems late in the race caused him to fall to 10th, eventually being classified 9th after a penalty for [[Daniel Ricciardo]]. This was followed by a 6th-place finish in [[2019 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]]. In [[2019 German Grand Prix|Germany]], Norris was forced to start from the back of the grid due to an engine penalty. He would later retire from the race after a power failure. Norris produced another points finish in [[2019 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], starting 7th and finishing 9th. At the [[2019 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], he made his way from 11th up to 5th in the early stages of the race. He looked on course for the best finish of his career thus far, maintaining his 5th place until he suffered a power failure on his final lap, eventually being classified outside the points in 11th.\n\nThree consecutive points finishes followed. In [[2019 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], Norris was running in 5th place at the beginning of the race before [[Alexander Albon]] collided with him during an overtake attempt. Norris' pace suffered for the rest of the race due to the resulting floor damage and he eventually finished in 11th place. At the next race in [[2019 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], Norris' bad luck continued. Whilst making his pit stop from 7th place, a wheel was fitted incorrectly and after almost exiting the pits, he stopped and was pushed back into his pit box by his mechanics for them to fit the wheel correctly. He spent almost two minutes in the pits and eventually withdrew later in the race after being far behind the other drivers. Norris ended the season with another three strong drives resulting in consecutive points finishes.\n\nNorris finished his debut season in Formula One in 11th place in the championship with 49 points. This was considerably behind teammate Sainz, however Norris out-qualified Sainz 11-10 over the course of the season. In July 2019, Norris signed a multi-year contract to stay with McLaren for the [[2020 Formula One World Championship|2020 season]] and beyond.<ref>{{cite web|title= Lando Norris signs new McLaren contract after superb start to F1 career|url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/09/lando-norris-new-mclaren-contract-f1-carols-sainz|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\"\n!

Fans typically are interested in even minor details of the object(s) of their fandom and spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, often as a part of a [[social network]] with particular practices (a fandom); this is what differentiates \"fannish\" (fandom-affiliated) fans from those with only a casual interest.\n\nA fandom can grow around any area of [[human interest]] or activity. The subject of fan interest can be narrowly defined, focused on something like an individual [[celebrity]], or more widely defined, encompassing entire [[hobby|hobbies]], [[genre]]s or [[fashion]]s. While it is now used to apply to groups of people fascinated with any subject, the term has its roots in those with an enthusiastic appreciation for sports. [[Merriam\u2013Webster|Merriam-Webster's dictionary]] traces the usage of the term back as far as 1903.<ref name=\"mw-1903\">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fandom|title=Fandom - Definition of fandom by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref>\n\nFandom as a term can also be used in a broad sense to refer to the [[interconnected]] [[social network]]s of individual fandoms,{{vague|date=November 2016}} many of which overlap. There are a number of large conventions that cater to fandom in this broad sense, catering to interests in film, comics, anime, television shows, cosplay, and the opportunity to buy and sell related merchandise.

[[Amateur press association]]s are another form of fan publication and networking. Originally using print-based media, these sub-cultures have migrated much of their communications and interaction onto the Internet, which they also use for the purpose of archiving detailed information pertinent to their given fanbase. Often, fans congregate on forums and discussion boards to share their love for and criticism of a specific work. This congregation can lead to a high level of organization and community within the fandom, as well as infighting. Although there is some level of hierarchy among most of the discussion boards in which certain contributors are valued more highly than others, newcomers are most often welcomed into the fold. Most importantly, these sorts of discussion boards can have an effect on the media itself as was the case in the television show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.

The subject of fan interest can be narrowly defined, focused on something like an individual [[celebrity]], or more widely defined, encompassing entire [[hobby|hobbies]], [[genre]]s or [[fashion]]s. While it is now used to apply to groups of people fascinated with any subject, the term has its roots in those with an enthusiastic appreciation for sports.

This congregation can lead to a high level of organization and community within the fandom, as well as infighting. Although there is some level of hierarchy among most of the discussion boards in which certain contributors are valued more highly than others, newcomers are most often welcomed into the fold.

Unfortunately, George II, while willing to consider such an alliance, stated that he would only allow \"both marriages or neither\" which meant that the Anglo-Prussian alliance could not happen until Frederick was allowed to wed as well.  Then, on 12 July, Hotham, in an attempt to strengthen his position by discrediting the Austrian contingent at court, produced letters incriminating Seckendorff and several of the King's associates.

Her husband, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|King Frederick William I of Prussia]], saw the advantage of the union, but was torn between his desire to draw closer to Protestant England and his position as a subject of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]].  His mutual dislike for his English brother-in-law and first cousin did not help matters.\n\nThe Austrians had for years heavily funded the efforts of General [[Seckendorff (family)|von Seckendorff]] to buy off Frederick William's closest associates and so influence the King towards a pro-Austrian and anti-British policy.\n\n<ref>\n{{citebook\n|last = Aspray\n|first = Robert\n|title = Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma\n|publisher = Ticknor and Fields\n|location = New York\n|year = 1986\n|pages = [https://archive.org/details/frederickgreatma00aspr/page/27 27\u201328]\n|isbn = 0-89919-352-8\n|url = https://archive.org/details/frederickgreatma00aspr/page/27\n}}</ref>\n\nColonel Hotham, who had been appointed a [[Groom of the Bedchamber]] in 1727 on the accession of George II, was empowered by the king with the authority to arrange for a double marriage between the two houses.

Unfortunately, George II, while willing to consider such an alliance, stated that he would only allow \"both marriages or neither\" which meant that the Anglo-Prussian alliance could not happen until Frederick was allowed to wed as well.  Then, on 12 July, Hotham, in an attempt to strengthen his position by discrediting the Austrian contingent at court, produced letters incriminating Seckendorff and several of the King's associates.

''Dictionary of London Place Names''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-280106-6}}</ref>  Approximately \n{{convert|7|miles|km}} south-east of [[Charing Cross]], it includes one of the [[List of highest points in London|highest points in London]], at {{convert|367|ft}},<ref name=OSHeight>{{Cite map |title= Spot Height in feet, TQ337707 |author= Ordnance Survey |publisher= Ordnance Survey |year= 1862}}</ref> offering views over the capital.  The area has no defined boundaries and straddles five London boroughs and three [[London postal district|postal districts]], although there is a [[Crystal Palace (ward)|Crystal Palace]] electoral ward and [[Crystal Palace Park]] in the [[London Borough of Bromley]].  It is contiguous with [[Anerley]], [[Dulwich Wood]], [[Gipsy Hill]], [[Penge]], [[South Norwood]], [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]] and [[Upper Norwood]].\n\nThe district was a natural oak forest until development began in the 19th century, and before the arrival of the Crystal Palace, it was known as [[Sydenham Hill]]. The [[Norwood Ridge]] and an historic oak tree were used to mark parish boundaries.  The area is represented by three [[Parliamentary constituencies of the UK parliament|parliamentary constituencies]], four [[London Assembly constituencies]] and fourteen local [[Councillors#United Kingdom|councillors]]. After the Crystal Palace burned down in 1936, the site of the building and its grounds became Crystal Palace Park, the location of the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|National Sports Centre]] which contains an athletics track, stadium and other sports facilities. Crystal Palace Park has also been used as the setting for a number of concerts and films, such as ''[[The Italian Job]]'' and ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1952 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' and contains the [[Crystal Palace Park Concert Platform]], in place since 1997. Two television transmitter [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|masts]] make the district a landmark location, visible from many parts of Greater London. Local landmarks include the Crystal Palace Triangle, a shopping district made up of three streets forming a triangle; Westow Park, a smaller park that lies off the triangle to the south west of Crystal Palace Park; and the Stambourne Woodland Walk.\n\nA [[pneumatic railway]] was briefly trialed in the area in 1864. Once the railways arrived, Crystal Palace was eventually served by two railway stations, the [[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station|high level]] and [[Crystal Palace railway station|low level]] stations, built to handle the large volume of passengers visiting the exhibition building. After the Palace was destroyed by fire, and with [[Beeching axe#Background|railway travel declining]], passenger numbers fell and the high level station was closed in 1954 and demolished 7&nbsp;years later.  Rail services gradually declined, and for a period in the 1960s and 1970s, there were plans to construct an urban motorway through the area as part of the [[London Ringways]] plan. With rising passenger numbers, additional [[London Overground]] services began stopping at the station and a [[Crystal Palace railway station#Station redevelopment for East London Line|major station redevelopment]] in 2012 led to proposals to extend the [[Croydon Tramlink]] service to the railway and bus stations. In 2016, Crystal Palace was named one of the best places to live in London.<ref name=Standard>{{cite web|title=Best places to live in London|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/best-places-to-live-in-london-vauxhall-bermondsey-and-crystal-palace-make-prestigious-list-a3207686.html|work=Evening Standard website|publisher=Evening Standard|accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ridge and the historic [[oak]] tree known as The Vicars Oak (at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of the [[A212 road|A212]] Church Road and [[A214 road|A214]] Westow Hill) were used to mark parish boundaries.<ref name=\"BritHistNorwood\">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49779 |title=Norwood: Introduction |author=F.

Following the success of the exhibition, the Palace was moved and reconstructed in 1854 in a modified and enlarged form in the grounds of the Penge Place estate at [[Sydenham Hill]]. The buildings housed the [[Crystal Palace School| Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature and Crystal Palace School of Engineering]].

''Dictionary of London Place Names''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-280106-6}}</ref>  Approximately \n{{convert|7|miles|km}} south-east of [[Charing Cross]], it includes one of the [[List of highest points in London|highest points in London]], at {{convert|367|ft}},<ref name=OSHeight>{{Cite map |title= Spot Height in feet, TQ337707 |author= Ordnance Survey |publisher= Ordnance Survey |year= 1862}}</ref> offering views over the capital.  The area has no defined boundaries and straddles five London boroughs and three [[London postal district|postal districts]], although there is a [[Crystal Palace (ward)|Crystal Palace]] electoral ward and [[Crystal Palace Park]] in the [[London Borough of Bromley]].  It is contiguous with [[Anerley]], [[Dulwich Wood]], [[Gipsy Hill]], [[Penge]], [[South Norwood]], [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]] and [[Upper Norwood]].\n\nThe district was a natural oak forest until development began in the 19th century, and before the arrival of the Crystal Palace, it was known as [[Sydenham Hill]]. The [[Norwood Ridge]] and an historic oak tree were used to mark parish boundaries.  The area is represented by three [[Parliamentary constituencies of the UK parliament|parliamentary constituencies]], four [[London Assembly constituencies]] and fourteen local [[Councillors#United Kingdom|councillors]]. After the Crystal Palace burned down in 1936, the site of the building and its grounds became Crystal Palace Park, the location of the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|National Sports Centre]] which contains an athletics track, stadium and other sports facilities. Crystal Palace Park has also been used as the setting for a number of concerts and films, such as ''[[The Italian Job]]'' and ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1952 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' and contains the [[Crystal Palace Park Concert Platform]], in place since 1997. Two television transmitter [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|masts]] make the district a landmark location, visible from many parts of Greater London. Local landmarks include the Crystal Palace Triangle, a shopping district made up of three streets forming a triangle; Westow Park, a smaller park that lies off the triangle to the south west of Crystal Palace Park; and the Stambourne Woodland Walk.\n\nA [[pneumatic railway]] was briefly trialed in the area in 1864. Once the railways arrived, Crystal Palace was eventually served by two railway stations, the [[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station|high level]] and [[Crystal Palace railway station|low level]] stations, built to handle the large volume of passengers visiting the exhibition building. After the Palace was destroyed by fire, and with [[Beeching axe#Background|railway travel declining]], passenger numbers fell and the high level station was closed in 1954 and demolished 7&nbsp;years later.  Rail services gradually declined, and for a period in the 1960s and 1970s, there were plans to construct an urban motorway through the area as part of the [[London Ringways]] plan. With rising passenger numbers, additional [[London Overground]] services began stopping at the station and a [[Crystal Palace railway station#Station redevelopment for East London Line|major station redevelopment]] in 2012 led to proposals to extend the [[Croydon Tramlink]] service to the railway and bus stations. In 2016, Crystal Palace was named one of the best places to live in London.<ref name=Standard>{{cite web|title=Best places to live in London|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/best-places-to-live-in-london-vauxhall-bermondsey-and-crystal-palace-make-prestigious-list-a3207686.html|work=Evening Standard website|publisher=Evening Standard|accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ridge and the historic [[oak]] tree known as The Vicars Oak (at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of the [[A212 road|A212]] Church Road and [[A214 road|A214]] Westow Hill) were used to mark parish boundaries.<ref name=\"BritHistNorwood\">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49779 |title=Norwood: Introduction |author=F.

The forest was a popular area for Londoners' recreation right up to the 19th century, when it began to be built over.<ref name=BritHistNorwood /> It was also a home of [[Romani people|Gypsies]], with some local street names and pubs recording the link.<ref name=BritHistNorwood />  The area still retains vestiges of woodland. \n\n=== The Crystal Palace ===\n[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Image of the Crystal Palace before it was destroyed by fire.|The Crystal Palace]]\n{{Main|The Crystal Palace}}\n\nThe Crystal Palace, designed by [[Joseph Paxton]], was a remarkable construction of prefabricated parts. It was a [[Cast iron|cast-iron]] and [[glass]] building originally erected in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to house the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851. Following the success of the exhibition, the Palace was moved and reconstructed in 1854 in a modified and enlarged form in the grounds of the Penge Place estate at [[Sydenham Hill]]. The buildings housed the [[Crystal Palace School| Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature and Crystal Palace School of Engineering]]. It attracted visitors for over seven decades.<ref name=\"ricEduPotter\">{{cite web|last=Potter|first=Russell|title=The Crystal Palace|url=http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/cryspal.html|date=29 January 2007|accessdate=12 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nSydenham Hill is one of the [[List of highest points in London|highest locations in London]]; 109&nbsp;metres (357&nbsp;ft) above sea level ([[spot height]] on Ordnance Survey Map); and the size of the Palace and prominence of the site made it easy to identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill.

{"title_page": "1978 Georgian demonstrations", "text_new": "{{short description|1978 protests in Tbilisi, Georgia}}\nOn 14 April 1978, demonstrations in [[Tbilisi]], capital of the [[Georgian SSR]], took place in response to an attempt by the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] to change the constitutional status of languages in Georgia. After a new [[1977 Soviet Constitution|Soviet Constitution]] was adopted in October 1977, the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the Georgian SSR considered a draft constitution in which, in contrast to the Constitution of 1936, [[Georgian language|Georgian]] was no longer declared to be the sole [[State language]]. A series of indoor and outdoor actions of protest ensued and implied with near-certainty there would be a clash between several thousands of demonstrators and the Soviet government, but Georgian Communist Party chief [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] negotiated with the central authorities in [[Moscow]] and managed to obtain permission to retain the previous status of the Georgian language.\n\nThis highly unusual concession to an open expression of opposition to state policy of the [[Soviet Union]] defused popular anger in Tbilisi, but triggered tensions in the [[Abkhaz ASSR]] ([[Abkhazia]]), an [[autonomous republic]] in northwest Georgia, where [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] Communist officials protested against what they saw as a capitulation to Georgian nationalism and demanded that their autonomy be transferred from Georgia to the [[Russian SFSR]]. The request was rejected but a number of political, cultural and economic concessions were made. Since 1990, 14 April has been celebrated in Georgia as the Day of the Georgian Language.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe late 1970s witnessed the reemergence of a Georgian national movement which called for the revival of Georgian national culture and, in its most radical form, saw no compromise to Georgia's ultimate independence from the Soviet Union, a rare instance of pro-independence [[dissident]] movement in the Union at the time. Although Georgian opposition [[intelligentsia]] preached avoidance of conflict with non-Georgian minorities, as such conflict would hamper the road to independence, and forged ties with the Russian dissidents of the time, including [[Andrei Sakharov]], the movement had a strong anti-Russian emphasis and alarmed some minorities, especially in Abkhazia, where there was a lingering ethnic discord between Georgian and Abkhaz communities. In early 1977, the Soviet Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]) managed to suppress most Russian dissident groups and moved to Georgia, with the irreconcilable Georgian opposition leaders, [[Merab Kostava]] and [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], being arrested in April. Such measures failed to curb the movement, however. New influential young dissidents such as Tamar Chkheidze, Avtandil Imnadze, later [[Giorgi Chanturia]], and Irakli Tsereteli, emerged in support of the jailed leaders, and several underground publications ([[samizdat]]) were founded.<ref name=\"Small Nations\">Cornell, Svante E.

The upsurge of the national movement in Georgia proper led to tensions between minorities as well, in particular with the Abkhaz, who interpreted the concession by the Soviet authorities as a retreat in the face of Georgian nationalism and saw this as an opportunity to secede from Georgia. In May 1978, several thousands of Abkhaz nationalists assembled in the village of [[Lykhny]] to support 130 Abkhaz Communists, who had signed the letter to Moscow, demanding that the Abkhaz ASSR be allowed to be transferred from Georgia to the Russian SFSR. The Kremlin dispatched I.V.

After a new [[1977 Soviet Constitution|Soviet Constitution]] was adopted in October 1977, the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the Georgian SSR considered a draft constitution in which, in contrast to the Constitution of 1936, [[Georgian language|Georgian]] was no longer declared to be the sole [[State language]]. A series of indoor and outdoor actions of protest ensued and implied with near-certainty there would be a clash between several thousands of demonstrators and the Soviet government, but Georgian Communist Party chief [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] negotiated with the central authorities in [[Moscow]] and managed to obtain permission to retain the previous status of the Georgian language.\n\nThis highly unusual concession to an open expression of opposition to state policy of the [[Soviet Union]] defused popular anger in Tbilisi, but triggered tensions in the [[Abkhaz ASSR]] ([[Abkhazia]]), an [[autonomous republic]] in northwest Georgia, where [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] Communist officials protested against what they saw as a capitulation to Georgian nationalism and demanded that their autonomy be transferred from Georgia to the [[Russian SFSR]]. The request was rejected but a number of political, cultural and economic concessions were made. Since 1990, 14 April has been celebrated in Georgia as the Day of the Georgian Language.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe late 1970s witnessed the reemergence of a Georgian national movement which called for the revival of Georgian national culture and, in its most radical form, saw no compromise to Georgia's ultimate independence from the Soviet Union, a rare instance of pro-independence [[dissident]] movement in the Union at the time. Although Georgian opposition [[intelligentsia]] preached avoidance of conflict with non-Georgian minorities, as such conflict would hamper the road to independence, and forged ties with the Russian dissidents of the time, including [[Andrei Sakharov]], the movement had a strong anti-Russian emphasis and alarmed some minorities, especially in Abkhazia, where there was a lingering ethnic discord between Georgian and Abkhaz communities. In early 1977, the Soviet Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]) managed to suppress most Russian dissident groups and moved to Georgia, with the irreconcilable Georgian opposition leaders, [[Merab Kostava]] and [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], being arrested in April. Such measures failed to curb the movement, however. New influential young dissidents such as Tamar Chkheidze, Avtandil Imnadze, later [[Giorgi Chanturia]], and Irakli Tsereteli, emerged in support of the jailed leaders, and several underground publications ([[Samizdat]]) were founded.<ref name=\"Small Nations\">Cornell, Svante E.
