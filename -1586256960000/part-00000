{"title_page": "Nannygate", "text_new": "{{See also|Nannygate (disambiguation)}}\n{{good article}}\n\"'''Nannygate'''\" is a popular term for the 1993 revelations that caused two of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s choices for [[United States Attorney General]] to become derailed.\n\nIn January 1993, Clinton's nomination of corporate lawyer [[Zo\u00eb Baird]] for the position came under attack after it became known that she and her husband had broken federal law by employing two [[Illegal immigration|people who had immigrated illegally]] from [[Peru]] as a nanny and chauffeur for their young child.  They had also failed to pay [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] taxes for the workers, the so-called \"[[Nanny Tax]]\", until shortly before the disclosures. While the [[Clinton administration]] thought the matter was relatively unimportant, the news elicited a firestorm of public opinion, most of it against Baird.  Within eight days, her nomination lost political support in the [[U.S. Congress]] and was withdrawn.\n\nThe following month, Clinton's choice of federal judge [[Kimba Wood]] for the job was leaked to the press, but within a day it became known that she too had employed someone who had immigrated illegally to look after her child.  Although Wood had done so at a time when such a hiring was legal, and had paid Social Security taxes for the worker, the disclosures were enough to cause the immediate withdrawal of Wood from consideration.  The [[Clinton administration]] then said that the hiring practices for household help would be examined for all of the more than thousand presidential appointments under consideration, causing the whole process to slow down significantly.  Determined to choose a woman for the Attorney General post, Clinton finally selected state prosecutor [[Janet Reno]], who was confirmed and served through all eight years of the administration.\n\nThe Nannygate matter caused wealthy Americans to ask each other if they too had a \"Zo\u00eb Baird problem\", as the hiring of illegal aliens and the paying of household help off the books were both commonplace.  Two fault lines, gender and class, were exposed in the discussion over Nannygate: in the former, a double standard was seen wherein female appointees faced a greater risk of being questioned and disqualified based upon their childcare arrangements, while in the latter, affluent professional women who could afford live-in childcare arrangements were seen as trying to get away with an illegal act. Nannygate-type controversies have subsequently affected other political appointees both in the U.S. and in other countries.\n\n== The Baird nomination ==\nPresident-elect [[Bill Clinton]] had vowed to assemble an administration that \"looked like America\", and it was widely assumed that one of the major cabinet posts would go to a woman.<ref name=\"human-118\"/>  In particular, he wanted to nominate one for the position of [[United States Attorney General]], something women's political action groups were also requesting.<ref name=\"human-118\"/><ref name=\"nyt011393\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/13/us/new-presidency-justice-department-parts-attorney-general-designate-s-record.html | title=Parts of Attorney General-Designate's Record Disturb Some Clinton Backers | author=Johnston, David | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 13, 1993}}</ref><ref name=\"nyt012293\"/><ref name=\"nyt-hiring\"/>  No woman had previously served in this post.<ref name=\"nyt122592\"/>  His choice, whose nomination was announced on December 24, 1992, was [[Zo\u00eb Baird]], a 40-year-old senior vice president and general counsel at [[Aetna|Aetna Life and Casualty Company]] who had previously worked in the [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] during the [[Carter administration]].<ref name=\"nyt122592\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/25/us/woman-clinton-completes-cabinet-points-its-diversity-getting-things-done-zoe.html | title=Woman in the News: Clinton Completes Cabinet And Points to Its Diversity: Getting Things Done: Zoe Baird | author=Lewis, Neil A. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 25, 1992}}</ref>\n\nLittle known before the nomination (Clinton had not met her until their interview),<ref>Clinton, ''My Life'', p. 456.</ref> Baird was a skilled networker who had been the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of several powerful Washington insiders, including Clinton transition team leader [[Warren Christopher]] and once-and-future White House Counsel [[Lloyd Cutler]].<ref name=\"adv-baby\"/><ref name=\"balakian-142\"/><ref name=\"harris-14\"/>  Picking Baird gave Clinton the ability to satisfy the women's groups' desires while still showing independence by not choosing one of their preferred selections.<ref name=\"nyt012293\"/>  Despite the lack of familiarity and getting a lukewarm response from some Clinton backers \u2013 those in the legal public interest community said \"Zo\u00eb who?\"<ref name=\"time-debacle\"/> and her corporate sympathies discouraged liberals<ref name=\"sampson-310\"/> \u2013 Baird was expected to gain confirmation in the U.S. Senate.<ref name=\"nyt011393\"/>  Baird and her husband, [[Yale Law School]] professor [[Paul Gewirtz]], had a three-year-old son.<ref name=\"nyt122592\"/><ref name=\"ap-deport\"/>\n\nOn January 14, 1993, a page-one story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' broke the news<ref name=\"time-debacle\"/> that Baird had hired a married pair of [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]] from [[Peru]], Lillian and Victor Cordero, between 1990 and 1992.<ref name=\"sampson-310\">Sampson, \"Rejecting Zoe Baird\", p. 310.</ref><ref name=\"nyt011493\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/14/us/clinton-s-choice-for-justice-dept-hired-illegal-aliens-for-household.html | title=Clinton's Choice for Justice Dept.

They had also failed to pay [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] taxes for the workers, the so-called \"[[Nanny Tax]]\", until shortly before the disclosures. While the [[Clinton administration]] thought the matter was relatively unimportant, the news elicited a firestorm of public opinion, most of it against Baird.  Within eight days, her nomination lost political support in the [[U.S. Congress]] and was withdrawn.\n\nThe following month, Clinton's choice of federal judge [[Kimba Wood]] for the job was leaked to the press, but within a day it became known that she too had employed someone who had immigrated illegally to look after her child.  Although Wood had done so at a time when such a hiring was legal, and had paid Social Security taxes for the worker, the disclosures were enough to cause the immediate withdrawal of Wood from consideration.  The [[Clinton administration]] then said that the hiring practices for household help would be examined for all of the more than thousand presidential appointments under consideration, causing the whole process to slow down significantly.  Determined to choose a woman for the Attorney General post, Clinton finally selected state prosecutor [[Janet Reno]], who was confirmed and served through all eight years of the administration.\n\nThe Nannygate matter caused wealthy Americans to ask each other if they too had a \"Zo\u00eb Baird problem\", as the hiring of illegal aliens and the paying of household help off the books were both commonplace.  Two fault lines, gender and class, were exposed in the discussion over Nannygate: in the former, a double standard was seen wherein female appointees faced a greater risk of being questioned and disqualified based upon their childcare arrangements, while in the latter, affluent professional women who could afford live-in childcare arrangements were seen as trying to get away with an illegal act. Nannygate-type controversies have subsequently affected other political appointees both in the U.S. and in other countries.\n\n== The Baird nomination ==\nPresident-elect [[Bill Clinton]] had vowed to assemble an administration that \"looked like America\", and it was widely assumed that one of the major cabinet posts would go to a woman.<ref name=\"human-118\"/>  In particular, he wanted to nominate one for the position of [[United States Attorney General]], something women's political action groups were also requesting.<ref name=\"human-118\"/><ref name=\"nyt011393\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/13/us/new-presidency-justice-department-parts-attorney-general-designate-s-record.html | title=Parts of Attorney General-Designate's Record Disturb Some Clinton Backers | author=Johnston, David | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 13, 1993}}</ref><ref name=\"nyt012293\"/><ref name=\"nyt-hiring\"/>  No woman had previously served in this post.<ref name=\"nyt122592\"/>  His choice, whose nomination was announced on December 24, 1992, was [[Zo\u00eb Baird]], a 40-year-old senior vice president and general counsel at [[Aetna|Aetna Life and Casualty Company]] who had previously worked in the [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] during the [[Carter administration]].<ref name=\"nyt122592\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/25/us/woman-clinton-completes-cabinet-points-its-diversity-getting-things-done-zoe.html | title=Woman in the News: Clinton Completes Cabinet And Points to Its Diversity: Getting Things Done: Zoe Baird | author=Lewis, Neil A. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 25, 1992}}</ref>\n\nLittle known before the nomination (Clinton had not met her until their interview),<ref>Clinton, ''My Life'', p. 456.</ref> Baird was a skilled networker who had been the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of several powerful Washington insiders, including Clinton transition team leader [[Warren Christopher]] and once-and-future White House Counsel [[Lloyd Cutler]].<ref name=\"adv-baby\"/><ref name=\"balakian-142\"/><ref name=\"harris-14\"/>  Picking Baird gave Clinton the ability to satisfy the women's groups' desires while still showing independence by not choosing one of their preferred selections.<ref name=\"nyt012293\"/>  Despite the lack of familiarity and getting a lukewarm response from some Clinton backers \u2013 those in the legal public interest community said \"Zo\u00eb who?\"<ref name=\"time-debacle\"/> and her corporate sympathies discouraged liberals<ref name=\"sampson-310\"/> \u2013 Baird was expected to gain confirmation in the U.S. Senate.<ref name=\"nyt011393\"/>  Baird and her husband, [[Yale Law School]] professor [[Paul Gewirtz]], had a three-year-old son.<ref name=\"nyt122592\"/><ref name=\"ap-deport\"/>\n\nOn January 14, 1993, a page-one story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' broke the news<ref name=\"time-debacle\"/> that Baird had hired a married pair of [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]] from [[Peru]], Lillian and Victor Cordero, between 1990 and 1992.<ref name=\"sampson-310\">Sampson, \"Rejecting Zoe Baird\", p. 310.</ref><ref name=\"nyt011493\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/14/us/clinton-s-choice-for-justice-dept-hired-illegal-aliens-for-household.html | title=Clinton's Choice for Justice Dept.

Its purpose is to intercept attacks, either by stopping projectiles such as arrows or by glancing a blow to the side of the shield-user. Shields vary greatly in size, ranging from large shields that protect the user's entire body to small shields that are mostly for use in hand-to-hand combat. Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of thick wooden planking, to protect soldiers from spears and crossbow bolts, other shields were thinner and designed mainly for glancing blows away (such as a sword blow). In prehistory, shields were made of wood, animal hide, or wicker. In antiquity and in the Middle Ages, shields were used by foot soldiers and mounted soldiers. Even after the invention of gunpowder and firearms, shields continued to be used. In the 18th century, Scottish clans continued to use small shields, and in the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples continued to use shields. In the 20th and 21st century, shields are used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist action, hostage rescue, and siege-breaching.\n\n====Torso====\n[[File:Army IOTV.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ballistic vest]].]]\nA [[ballistic vest]] helps absorb the impact from [[firearm]]-fired [[projectile]]s and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] from explosions, and is worn on the [[torso]]. Soft vests are made from many layers of woven or laminated fibers and can be capable of protecting the wearer from small caliber [[handgun]] and [[shotgun]] projectiles, and small fragments from explosives such as [[hand grenade]]s. \n\nMetal or ceramic plates can be used with a soft vest, providing additional protection from [[rifle]] rounds, and metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from a [[knife]]. Soft vests are commonly worn by [[police]] forces, private citizens and private [[security guard]]s or [[bodyguard]]s, whereas hard-plate reinforced vests are mainly worn by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams.\n\nModern body armor may combine a ballistic vest with other items of protective clothing, such as a [[combat helmet]]. Vests intended for police and military use may also include ballistic shoulder and side protection armor components, and [[bomb disposal]] officers wear heavy armor and helmets with face visors and spine protection.\n\n====Head====\n[[File:ACH 005.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Army|U.S.]] soldier wearing a [[combat helmet]].]]\n\nA [[combat helmet]] are among the oldest forms of [[personal protective equipment]], and are known to have been worn by the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] around 900BC, followed by the [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and up to the end of the 1600s by many combatants.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.nps.gov/archive/colo/Jthanout/HisArmur.html {{deadlink|date=March 2020}}</ref> Their materials and construction became more advanced as weapons became more and more powerful. Initially constructed from [[leather]] and [[brass]], and then [[bronze]] and [[iron]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages, they soon came to be made entirely from forged [[steel]] in many societies after about 950AD.<ref>[http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/weaponswarfare/g/galea.htm Galea - About the Galea<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At that time, they were purely military equipment, protecting the head from cutting blows with [[sword]]s, flying [[arrow]]s, and low-velocity [[musket]]ry. Today's militaries often use high-quality helmets made of ballistic materials such as [[Kevlar]] and [[Aramid]], which have excellent bullet and fragmentation stopping power. Some helmets also have good non-ballistic protective qualities, though many do not.<ref>[http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_kevlar_helmet.php Kevlar Pasgt Helmet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Non-ballistic injuries may be caused by many things, such as concussive [[shock wave|shockwaves]] from [[explosion]]s, physical attacks, motor vehicle accidents, or falls.<ref>http://www.operation-helmet.org</ref>\n\nA [[ballistic face mask]], is designed to protect the wearer from ballistic threats. Ballistic face masks are usually made of [[kevlar]] or other bullet resistant materials and the inside of the mask may be padded for shock absorption, depending on the design. Due to weight restrictions, protection levels range only up to [[National Institute of Justice|NIJ]] Level IIIA.\n\n====Respirator====\nA [[gas mask]] is worn over the face to protect the wearer from inhaling \"airborne [[pollutant]]s\" and toxic [[gas]]es.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://protectivefacemaskusa.com/|title=Protective Face Mask USA|website=Protective Face Mask USA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Airborne toxic materials may be gaseous or particulate.  Many gas masks include protection from both types. During riots where tear gas or CS-gas is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and rioters alike.\n\n====Limbs====\nProtection of [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] from bombs is provided by a [[bombsuit]].\n\n===Sports===\n\n====Limbs====\n[[File:Cycle-glove fingerless.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of fingerless cycling gloves.]]\n\nGloves are frequently used to keep the hands warm, a function that is particularly necessary when cycling in cold weather. The hands are also relatively inactive, and do not have a great deal of muscle mass, which also contributes to the possibility of chill. Gloves are therefore vital for [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] the hands from cold, wind, and [[evaporative cooling]]. Putting a hand out to break a fall is a natural reaction,  however, the hands are one of the more difficult parts of the body to repair.  There is little or no spare skin, and immobilising the hands sufficiently to promote healing involves significant inconvenience to the patient. [[Fingerless gloves|Fingerless]] gloves, have a lightly padded palm of [[leather]] (natural or synthetic), [[gel]] or other material. Full-finger gloves are useful in winter, when real warmth is not an issue. These are also generally waterproof but will become soggy in heavy rain.\n\n===Construction===\n\n====Head====\n[[File:Cargo loading, Operation Deep Freeze 2007 070208-N-4868G-323.JPEG|right|thumb|[[U.S. Navy]] sailors loading cargo onto a container ship in [[Antarctica]]]]\nA [[hard hat]] is a type of [[helmet]] predominantly used in workplace environments, such as [[construction]] sites, to protect the [[Human head|head]] from injury by falling objects, impact with other objects, debris, bad weather and electric shock. Inside the helmet is a suspension that spreads the helmet's weight over the top of the head. It also provides a space of approximately 3&nbsp;cm (1.2 inch) between the helmet's shell and the wearer's head so that if an object strikes the shell, the impact is less likely to be transmitted directly to the skull. Rigid [[plastic]] has been the most common material.\n\n====Respiratory system====\n[[File:Air-Purifying Respirator.jpg|thumb|right|A half face particulate mask.]] \nA [[respirator]] is designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful [[dust]]s, fumes, vapors, and/or [[gas]]es. Respirators come in a wide range of types and sizes used by the military, private industry, and the public.  Respirators range from cheaper, single-use, disposable [[mask]]s to reusable models with replaceable cartridges. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'', which forces contaminated air through a filtering element, and the ''air-supplied respirator'', in which an alternate supply of fresh air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contents.\nThe term [[respirator]] in the hospital setting refers to the N95 filtering face piece masks that are commonly used to care for patients with Tuberculosis.  There was much controversy over the use of these masks during the H1N1 outbreak of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Archived CDC webpage|url=https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm}}</ref>\n\n==PPE by body area==\n\n===Protective headgear===\n[[Image:Protection.jpg|thumb|right|a beekeeping hat, veil, and suit]]\n\n====Masks====\nSome [[mask]]s made of hard material like those used by [[goaltender]]s in [[ice hockey]] (a [[goalie mask]]) and [[catcher]]s in [[baseball]] as protection against being struck in the face.\n* For [[gas mask]]s and similar, see [[#Respiratory protection]].\n* See [[Mask (disambiguation)]]\n\n====Helmets====\nSee [[Helmet#Types of helmet]]\n\n====Eye protection====\n[[Image:Seal Swim Goggles.jpg|thumb|right|Goggles]]\nSee [[Eye protection]].\n\n====Hearing protection====\n[[Image:Chainsaw helmet.jpg|thumb|right|ear defenders and visor on a safety helmet]]\n*[[Earplug]]\n*[[Earmuffs]] \n*Earpads/earflaps\n\n====Other head/neck protection====\n*[[Throat guard]]\n*[[Headguard]] ([[Head guard]])\n*[[Boxing headgear]]\n*[[Mouthguard]]\n*Armored/insulated [[hood (headgear)|hood]]\n*[[Association football headgear]]\n\n<!-- redundant given above picture of hardhat with ear protectors:  [[Image:Aa hardhat with visor.jpg|thumb|right|Safety helmet with visor]]-->\n\n===Arm/shoulder protection===\n*[[Shoulder pads]]\n*[[Forearm guard]]\n*[[Fist guard]]\n*[[Knuckle guard]]\n*[[Wrist guard]]\n*[[Elbow guard]]\n*[[Elbow pad]]\n*[[Hand/Wrist Wraps]]\n\n===Hand protection===\n\n[[Image:Disposable nitrile glove.jpg|thumb|right|100px|nitrile glove]]\n\n*[[Glove]]s are available to protect against:\n** Chemicals, contamination and infection (e.g. [[Rubber gloves|disposable latex]]/vinyl/[[Medical gloves|nitrile gloves]])\n** Electricity, when voltage is too high\n** Extremes of temperature (e.g. oven gloves, [[welder]]'s gloves)\n** Mechanical hazards (e.g. rigger gloves, chainmail gloves)\n** Mechanic gloves prime concern is to protect hands against mechanical type of applications, where harsh elements of mechanical work is directly detecting your hands required to be secured against the highest or lowest levels of risks depending upon the working environment which is normally measured in terms of different rating standards specifying the class of gloves.\n** Lacerations and other wounds from sharp objects\n*[[Baseball glove]]\n*[[Belay gloves]]\n*[[Cycling gloves]]\n*[[Falconry]] gloves\n*[[Grip (gymnastics)|Gymnastics grips]]\n*[[Hand guard]]s\n*[[Hand/wrist wraps]]\n*[[Hockey glove]]\n*[[Wicket-keeper]]'s gloves\n\n===Body protection===\n{{see also|Blunt trauma personal protective equipment}}\n*[[jockstrap|Athletic supporter]] with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]], also called Abdomen guard or [[cricket box]]\n*[[Chestguard]] ([[Chest guard]], [[Hogu]])\n*[[Rib guard]]\n\n===Foot/Leg/hip protection===\n[[Image:Wooden Shoes-willow-plain wood.jpg|thumb|right|100px|clogs]]\n\n*[[Foot guard]]\n*[[Hip pads]] ([[Hip pad]]<!-- whatever article will be created first -->)\n*[[Knee pads]]\n*[[Instep guard]]/[[instep protector]]\n*[[Shin guard]] ([[shin guards]]<!-- whatever article will be created first -->)\n*Combined knee-shin guards\n*[[Padded shorts]]\n*[[Bouldering mat]]\n*[[Chaps]] are individual pant leggings made of leather and worn by farriers, cowboys, and rodeo contestants to protect the legs from contact with hooves, thorny undergrowth, and other such work hazards.

In the 20th and 21st century, shields are used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist action, hostage rescue, and siege-breaching.\n\n====Torso====\n[[File:Army IOTV.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ballistic vest]].]]\nA [[ballistic vest]] helps absorb the impact from [[firearm]]-fired [[projectile]]s and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] from explosions, and is worn on the [[torso]]. Soft vests are made from many layers of woven or laminated fibers and can be capable of protecting the wearer from small caliber [[handgun]] and [[shotgun]] projectiles, and small fragments from explosives such as [[hand grenade]]s. \n\nMetal or ceramic plates can be used with a soft vest, providing additional protection from [[rifle]] rounds, and metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from a [[knife]]. Soft vests are commonly worn by [[police]] forces, private citizens and private [[security guard]]s or [[bodyguard]]s, whereas hard-plate reinforced vests are mainly worn by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams.\n\nModern body armor may combine a ballistic vest with other items of protective clothing, such as a [[combat helmet]]. Vests intended for police and military use may also include ballistic shoulder and side protection armor components, and [[bomb disposal]] officers wear heavy armor and helmets with face visors and spine protection.\n\n====Head====\n[[File:ACH 005.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Army|U.S.]] soldier wearing a [[combat helmet]].]]\n\nA [[combat helmet]] are among the oldest forms of [[personal protective equipment]], and are known to have been worn by the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] around 900BC, followed by the [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and up to the end of the 1600s by many combatants.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.nps.gov/archive/colo/Jthanout/HisArmur.html {{deadlink|date=March 2020}}</ref> Their materials and construction became more advanced as weapons became more and more powerful. Initially constructed from [[leather]] and [[brass]], and then [[bronze]] and [[iron]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages, they soon came to be made entirely from forged [[steel]] in many societies after about 950AD.<ref>[http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/weaponswarfare/g/galea.htm Galea - About the Galea<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At that time, they were purely military equipment, protecting the head from cutting blows with [[sword]]s, flying [[arrow]]s, and low-velocity [[musket]]ry. Today's militaries often use high-quality helmets made of ballistic materials such as [[Kevlar]] and [[Aramid]], which have excellent bullet and fragmentation stopping power. Some helmets also have good non-ballistic protective qualities, though many do not.<ref>[http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_kevlar_helmet.php Kevlar Pasgt Helmet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Non-ballistic injuries may be caused by many things, such as concussive [[shock wave|shockwaves]] from [[explosion]]s, physical attacks, motor vehicle accidents, or falls.<ref>http://www.operation-helmet.org</ref>\n\nA [[ballistic face mask]], is designed to protect the wearer from ballistic threats. Ballistic face masks are usually made of [[kevlar]] or other bullet resistant materials and the inside of the mask may be padded for shock absorption, depending on the design. Due to weight restrictions, protection levels range only up to [[National Institute of Justice|NIJ]] Level IIIA.\n\n====Respirator====\nA [[gas mask]] is worn over the face to protect the wearer from inhaling \"airborne [[pollutant]]s\" and toxic [[gas]]es.  The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Airborne toxic materials may be gaseous or particulate.  Many gas masks include protection from both types. During riots where tear gas or CS-gas is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and rioters alike.\n\n====Limbs====\nProtection of [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] from bombs is provided by a [[bombsuit]].\n\n===Sports===\n\n====Limbs====\n[[File:Cycle-glove fingerless.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of fingerless cycling gloves.]]\n\nGloves are frequently used to keep the hands warm, a function that is particularly necessary when cycling in cold weather. The hands are also relatively inactive, and do not have a great deal of muscle mass, which also contributes to the possibility of chill. Gloves are therefore vital for [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] the hands from cold, wind, and [[evaporative cooling]]. Putting a hand out to break a fall is a natural reaction,  however, the hands are one of the more difficult parts of the body to repair.  There is little or no spare skin, and immobilising the hands sufficiently to promote healing involves significant inconvenience to the patient. [[Fingerless gloves|Fingerless]] gloves, have a lightly padded palm of [[leather]] (natural or synthetic), [[gel]] or other material. Full-finger gloves are useful in winter, when real warmth is not an issue. These are also generally waterproof but will become soggy in heavy rain.\n\n===Construction===\n\n====Head====\n[[File:Cargo loading, Operation Deep Freeze 2007 070208-N-4868G-323.JPEG|right|thumb|[[U.S. Navy]] sailors loading cargo onto a container ship in [[Antarctica]]]]\nA [[hard hat]] is a type of [[helmet]] predominantly used in workplace environments, such as [[construction]] sites, to protect the [[Human head|head]] from injury by falling objects, impact with other objects, debris, bad weather and electric shock. Inside the helmet is a suspension that spreads the helmet's weight over the top of the head. It also provides a space of approximately 3&nbsp;cm (1.2 inch) between the helmet's shell and the wearer's head so that if an object strikes the shell, the impact is less likely to be transmitted directly to the skull. Rigid [[plastic]] has been the most common material.\n\n====Respiratory system====\n[[File:Air-Purifying Respirator.jpg|thumb|right|A half face particulate mask.]] \nA [[respirator]] is designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful [[dust]]s, fumes, vapors, and/or [[gas]]es. Respirators come in a wide range of types and sizes used by the military, private industry, and the public.  Respirators range from cheaper, single-use, disposable [[mask]]s to reusable models with replaceable cartridges. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'', which forces contaminated air through a filtering element, and the ''air-supplied respirator'', in which an alternate supply of fresh air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contents.\nThe term [[respirator]] in the hospital setting refers to the N95 filtering face piece masks that are commonly used to care for patients with Tuberculosis.  There was much controversy over the use of these masks during the H1N1 outbreak of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Archived CDC webpage|url=https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm}}</ref>\n\n==PPE by body area==\n\n===Protective headgear===\n[[Image:Protection.jpg|thumb|right|a beekeeping hat, veil, and suit]]\n\n====Masks====\nSome [[mask]]s made of hard material like those used by [[goaltender]]s in [[ice hockey]] (a [[goalie mask]]) and [[catcher]]s in [[baseball]] as protection against being struck in the face.\n* For [[gas mask]]s and similar, see [[#Respiratory protection]].\n* See [[Mask (disambiguation)]]\n\n====Helmets====\nSee [[Helmet#Types of helmet]]\n\n====Eye protection====\n[[Image:Seal Swim Goggles.jpg|thumb|right|Goggles]]\nSee [[Eye protection]].\n\n====Hearing protection====\n[[Image:Chainsaw helmet.jpg|thumb|right|ear defenders and visor on a safety helmet]]\n*[[Earplug]]\n*[[Earmuffs]] \n*Earpads/earflaps\n\n====Other head/neck protection====\n*[[Throat guard]]\n*[[Headguard]] ([[Head guard]])\n*[[Boxing headgear]]\n*[[Mouthguard]]\n*Armored/insulated [[hood (headgear)|hood]]\n*[[Association football headgear]]\n\n<!-- redundant given above picture of hardhat with ear protectors:  [[Image:Aa hardhat with visor.jpg|thumb|right|Safety helmet with visor]]-->\n\n===Arm/shoulder protection===\n*[[Shoulder pads]]\n*[[Forearm guard]]\n*[[Fist guard]]\n*[[Knuckle guard]]\n*[[Wrist guard]]\n*[[Elbow guard]]\n*[[Elbow pad]]\n*[[Hand/Wrist Wraps]]\n\n===Hand protection===\n\n[[Image:Disposable nitrile glove.jpg|thumb|right|100px|nitrile glove]]\n\n*[[Glove]]s are available to protect against:\n** Chemicals, contamination and infection (e.g. [[Rubber gloves|disposable latex]]/vinyl/[[Medical gloves|nitrile gloves]])\n** Electricity, when voltage is too high\n** Extremes of temperature (e.g. oven gloves, [[welder]]'s gloves)\n** Mechanical hazards (e.g. rigger gloves, chainmail gloves)\n** Mechanic gloves prime concern is to protect hands against mechanical type of applications, where harsh elements of mechanical work is directly detecting your hands required to be secured against the highest or lowest levels of risks depending upon the working environment which is normally measured in terms of different rating standards specifying the class of gloves.\n** Lacerations and other wounds from sharp objects\n*[[Baseball glove]]\n*[[Belay gloves]]\n*[[Cycling gloves]]\n*[[Falconry]] gloves\n*[[Grip (gymnastics)|Gymnastics grips]]\n*[[Hand guard]]s\n*[[Hand/wrist wraps]]\n*[[Hockey glove]]\n*[[Wicket-keeper]]'s gloves\n\n===Body protection===\n{{see also|Blunt trauma personal protective equipment}}\n*[[jockstrap|Athletic supporter]] with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]], also called Abdomen guard or [[cricket box]]\n*[[Chestguard]] ([[Chest guard]], [[Hogu]])\n*[[Rib guard]]\n\n===Foot/Leg/hip protection===\n[[Image:Wooden Shoes-willow-plain wood.jpg|thumb|right|100px|clogs]]\n\n*[[Foot guard]]\n*[[Hip pads]] ([[Hip pad]]<!-- whatever article will be created first -->)\n*[[Knee pads]]\n*[[Instep guard]]/[[instep protector]]\n*[[Shin guard]] ([[shin guards]]<!-- whatever article will be created first -->)\n*Combined knee-shin guards\n*[[Padded shorts]]\n*[[Bouldering mat]]\n*[[Chaps]] are individual pant leggings made of leather and worn by farriers, cowboys, and rodeo contestants to protect the legs from contact with hooves, thorny undergrowth, and other such work hazards.

[[Metabolite]]s are [[glucuronidated]] and [[excretion|excreted]] in the [[urine]]. PCP is excreted 9% in its unchanged form.<ref name=beyT />\n\nWhen smoked, some of the compound is broken down by heat into [[1-phenyl-1-cyclohexene|1-phenylcyclohexene]] (PC) and [[piperidine]].\n\n[[File:PCP2PCandPOPERIDINE.png|thumb|400px|center|Conversion of PCP into PC and piperidine by heat.]]\n\nIt takes 15 to 60 minutes for effects of PCP to onset.<ref name=beyT />\n\n==Chemistry==\nPCP is an [[arylcyclohexylamine]].\n\n===Analogues===\n[[File:ACHA SAR.png|210px|right|thumbnail|Possible analogues of PCP]]\n\nFewer than 30 different [[structural analog|analogs]] of PCP were reported as being used on the street during the 1970s and 1980s, mainly in the United States.<ref name=\"Morris2014\" />  Only of a few of these compounds were widely used including [[rolicyclidine]] (PCPy), [[eticyclidine]] (PCE), and [[tenocyclidine]] (TCP).<ref name=\"Morris2014\" />  Less common analogs include [[3-HO-PCP]], [[3-MeO-PCMo]], and [[3-MeO-PCP]].\n\nThe generalized structural motif required for PCP-like activity is derived from structure-activity relationship studies of PCP derivatives. All of these derivatives are likely to share some of their psychoactive effects with PCP itself, although a range of potencies and varying mixtures of anesthetic, dissociative, and stimulant effects are known, depending on the particular drug and its substituents. In some countries such as the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, all of these compounds would be considered controlled substance analogs of PCP under the [[Federal Analog Act]] and are hence illegal drugs if sold for human consumption.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Itzhak Y, Kalir A, Weissman BA, Cohen S | title = New analgesic drugs derived from phencyclidine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 496\u20139 | date = May 1981 | pmid = 7241506 | doi = 10.1021/jm00137a004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudieu I, Vignon J, Chicheportiche M, Kamenka JM, Trouiller G, Chicheportiche R | title = Role of the aromatic group in the inhibition of phencyclidine binding and dopamine uptake by PCP analogs | journal = Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 699\u2013705 | date = Mar 1989 | pmid = 2544905 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(89)90020-8 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPCP was initially made in 1926 and brought to market as an [[anesthetic]] medication in the 1950s.<ref name=Zed2007/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bunney|first1=W.

Her appointment was part of a multi-pronged initiative by the Nixon Administration following a press conference on February 6, 1969. During this press conference, Vera Glaser, a reporter for the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]], asked President Nixon,\n\n{{quote|Mr. President, in staffing your administration, you have so far made about 200 high-level Cabinet and other policy position appointments, and of these only three have gone to women. Can you tell us, sir, whether we can expect a more equitable recognition of women's abilities, or are we going to remain a lost sex?<ref name=AMSJ/>}}\n\nIn February 1971, Nixon gave [[Fred Malek]], head of Presidential Personnel to Nixon and a former classmate of Franklin's at Harvard Business School, the task of hiring a woman who would spearhead the effort to recruit other women for policy-making government jobs.  Malek asked Franklin to be this recruiter, and on April 12, 1971, Franklin began her position for this presidential initiative. An official press release from the White House announced Franklin on April 22, 1971 as a \"Staff Assistant to the President for Executive Manpower\" \u2013 a title that was later changed simply to \"Staff Assistant to the President\" after her first press conference, wherein the press questioned how she could recruit women with the word \"Manpower\" in her title.<ref name=AMSJ/>\n\nOn April 21, 1971, Nixon issued a directive to the heads of White House departments and independent agencies to create specific action plans to \"clearly demonstrate our recognition of the equality of women by making greater use of their skills in high level positions.\" He required these executive departments to (1) Develop and put into action a plan for attracting more qualified women to top appointive positions by the end of the year; (2) Develop and put into action a plan for significantly increasing the number of women, career and appointive, in mid-level positions; (3) Ensure the substantial numbers of the vacancies on their Advisory Boards and Committees be filled with well-qualified women; and (4) Designate an overall coordinator who will be held responsible for the success of the project.

The book is written by Lee Stout, Librarian Emeritus and former Head of Public Services and Outreach for Special Collections at the Penn State University Libraries. When he retired in 2007, Stout had served as Penn State's university archivist for 27 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.archivists.org/history/leaders/lee-j-stout |title=Lee J.

Stout was cataloging Franklin's papers when he became interested in those which detailed her service to recruit women in the Nixon Administration. He called Franklin and suggested an [[oral history]] project to preserve the memories of the men and women involved in this Presidential initiative.<ref>http://www.libraries.psu.edu/findingaids/1.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the \"A Few Good Women\" oral history project was created with an Advisory Board chaired by Franklin and with a cooperative relationship with the Penn State University Libraries. Initially, the Board had a list of twelve women appointees from the Nixon administration to be interviewed, including Margita White, [[Constance B. Newman]], and [[Helen Delich Bentley]], former Congresswoman and Chair of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]].  The list eventually expanded to include nearly 50 interviews, which are currently housed in the Special Collections Library at Penn State University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/304827-1 |title=Book Discussion on [A Matter of Simple Justice&#93; - C-SPAN Video Library |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afgw.libraries.psu.edu/ |title=A Few Good Women |publisher=Afgw.libraries.psu.edu |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>\n\n''A Matter of Simple Justice: The Untold Story of Barbara Hackman Franklin and A Few Good Women''  is based on the \"A Few Good Women\" oral history project. In a two-part format, the book first focuses primarily on the historical narrative of the Nixon administration's efforts to bring women into high-level government positions, Franklin's specific efforts, and the results of this period. In the second part of the book, Stout highlights the personal stories of many of the other interviewees from this project, such as Ambassador Anne Armstrong, Senator [[Elizabeth Dole]], Judge [[Cynthia Holcomb Hall|Cynthia Hall]], and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [[Carla Hills]]. Interviewees talk about early influences, breaking down barriers, the impact on family, the role of networking, and the particular challenge of gaining entry to the legal profession.\n\nThe \"A Few Good Women\" project has received major funding from the Aetna Foundation, which has also provided grants for the \"A Few Good Women\" teaching aids project, designed by Penn State University Libraries staff.

The JCCT had been moribund since the events at [[Tiananmen Square]] in June 1989, when the U.S. placed a sanction on China banning high-level government-to-government contact.

During this press conference, Vera Glaser, a reporter for the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]], asked President Nixon,\n\n{{quote|Mr. President, in staffing your administration, you have so far made about 200 high-level Cabinet and other policy position appointments, and of these only three have gone to women.

By May 1973, this number further increased to 130 women, and Franklin had created a talent bank of 1,000 qualified women for future openings.

The book is written by Lee Stout, Librarian Emeritus and former Head of Public Services and Outreach for Special Collections at the Penn State University Libraries. When he retired in 2007, Stout had served as Penn State's university archivist for 27 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.archivists.org/history/leaders/lee-j-stout |title=Lee J. Stout &#124; Society of American Archivists |publisher=.archivists.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>  In 1994, Franklin donated her governmental papers to the Penn State University Archives.  Stout was cataloging Franklin's papers when he became interested in those which detailed her service to recruit women in the Nixon Administration. He called Franklin and suggested an [[oral history]] project to preserve the memories of the men and women involved in this Presidential initiative.<ref>http://www.libraries.psu.edu/findingaids/1.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the \"A Few Good Women\" oral history project was created with an Advisory Board chaired by Franklin and with a cooperative relationship with the Penn State University Libraries. Initially, the Board had a list of twelve women appointees from the Nixon administration to be interviewed, including Margita White, [[Constance B. Newman]], and [[Helen Delich Bentley]], former Congresswoman and Chair of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]].  The list eventually expanded to include nearly 50 interviews, which are currently housed in the Special Collections Library at Penn State University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/304827-1 |title=Book Discussion on [A Matter of Simple Justice&#93; - C-SPAN Video Library |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afgw.libraries.psu.edu/ |title=A Few Good Women |publisher=Afgw.libraries.psu.edu |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>\n\n''A Matter of Simple Justice: The Untold Story of Barbara Hackman Franklin and A Few Good Women''  is based on the \"A Few Good Women\" oral history project. In a two-part format, the book first focuses primarily on the historical narrative of the Nixon administration's efforts to bring women into high-level government positions, Franklin's specific efforts, and the results of this period. In the second part of the book, Stout highlights the personal stories of many of the other interviewees from this project, such as Ambassador Anne Armstrong, Senator [[Elizabeth Dole]], Judge [[Cynthia Holcomb Hall|Cynthia Hall]], and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [[Carla Hills]]. Interviewees talk about early influences, breaking down barriers, the impact on family, the role of networking, and the particular challenge of gaining entry to the legal profession.\n\nThe \"A Few Good Women\" project has received major funding from the Aetna Foundation, which has also provided grants for the \"A Few Good Women\" teaching aids project, designed by Penn State University Libraries staff. The teaching aids are designed to provide the oral histories, biographies, audio segments, images, and digitized historical documents of the \"A Few Good Women\" collection in the form of a curriculum for students in grades 6-12.<ref name=AMSJ/><ref>{{cite web|last=Stout |first=Lee |url=http://www.amatterofsimplejustice.com/book/book_info.html |title=Book Information |publisher=A Matter of Simple Justice |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>\n\n===Consumer Product Safety Commission===\nFranklin's accomplishments as a staff assistant to President Nixon led to her nomination by Nixon as one of the first of five original commissioners of the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC).

During these years, Franklin concentrated on improving safety for children and pioneering the use of cost/benefit analysis.

She led a Presidential mission to China in December 1992 for the purpose of normalizing commercial relations between the United States and China. In China, she and her counterpart, Minister [[Li Lanqing]], reconvened the Seventh Session of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT). The JCCT had been moribund since the events at [[Tiananmen Square]] in June 1989, when the U.S. placed a sanction on China banning high-level government-to-government contact. Her mission lifted that sanction and brought back $1 billion in new contracts for American companies. This mission gave a \"green light\" to U.S. companies interested in business opportunities in China, and trade with China grew dramatically in the ensuing years as did U.S. investment in China.<ref name=bhfranklincom/>\n\nIn a letter to the editor of the New York Times published on December 29, 1992, Franklin said:<ref>{{cite web|author=Published: December 29, 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/29/opinion/l-talks-with-china-mean-jobs-for-us-934192.html |title=Talks With China Mean Jobs for U.S. - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1992-12-29 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Several weeks ago President Bush asked me to lead a Presidential mission to China, following his decision to resume high-level economic talks with the Chinese.

President Bush's policy of constructive engagement is a long-term investment in our economic future and is already delivering results in China and in the United States ...

After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\". The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo is no longer found on its vehicles but remains the corporate emblem used in Japan.\n\n[[File:Toyota logo.svg|thumb|left|Toyota wordmark, used as the main logo until 1989 and is currently used as a corporate logo]]\n[[File: Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro P4250811.jpg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Tacoma]] TRD Pro still uses Toyota wordmark]]\n\nStill, no guidelines existed for the use of the brand name, so \"TOYOTA\", which was used throughout most of the world, led to inconsistencies in its worldwide marketing campaigns.\n\nTo remedy this, Toyota introduced a new worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand. The logo made its debut on the 1989 Toyota Celsior and quickly gained worldwide recognition. The three ovals in the new logo combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. The overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |title=Company > Vision & Philosophy > Nov/Dec 2004 |publisher=TOYOTA |accessdate=October 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022095517/http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |title=Passion &#124; Toyota Motor Corporation Global Website |publisher=Toyota-global.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024915/http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toyota AA 1936 - Picture by Bertel Schmitt.jpg|thumb|Hubcap of 1936 Toyota AA, with the old \"Toyoda\" name]]\n\nThe new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most of the vehicles themselves in 1990.\n\nIn countries or regions using [[traditional Chinese character]]s, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".<ref name=\"Crown Motors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crown-motors.com/tch/corpinfo/story.aspx|title=Crown Motors Ltd.

selling vehicles in the United States of America\n}}\nToyota first entered the [[pickup truck]] market in 1947 with the [[Toyota SB|SB]] that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the [[Toyota RK|RK]] (renamed in 1959 as the [[Toyota Stout|Stout]]) and in 1968 by the compact [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]]. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable, and many of these trucks from as early as the late 1970s are still on the road today, some with over 300,000 miles. Extended- and crew-cab versions of these small haulers were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market.\n\nRiding on the success of the [[compact pickup]]s in the US, Toyota decided to attempt to enter the traditionally domestic-dominated full-size pickup market, introducing the [[Toyota T100|T100]] for the 1993 US model year, with production ending in 1998. While having a bed at the traditional full-size length of 8 feet, the suspension and engine characteristics were still similar to that of a compact pickup. It proved to be as economical and reliable as any typical Toyota pickup, but sales never became what Toyota brass had hoped for. It was criticized as being too small to appeal to the traditional American full-size pickup buyer. Another popular full-size truck essential, a V8 engine, was never available. Additionally, the truck was at first only available as a regular cab, though Toyota addressed this shortcoming and added the Xtracab version in mid-1995.\n\nIn 1999 for the 2000 model year, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]]. The Tundra addressed criticisms that the T100 did not have the look and feel of a legitimate American-style full-size pickup. It also added the V8 engine that the T100 was criticized for not having. However, the Tundra still came up short in towing capacity as well as still feeling slightly carlike. These concerns were addressed with an even larger 2007 redesign. A stronger V6 and a second V8 engine among other things were added to the option list. As of early 2010, the Tundra has captured 16% of the full-size half-ton market in the US.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The all-new Tundra was assembled in [[San Antonio, Texas]], US. Toyota assembled around 150,000 Standard and Double Cabs, and only 70,000 Crew Max's in 2007. The smaller Tacoma (which traces its roots back to the original Hilux) was also produced at the company's San Antonio facility.\n\nOutside the United States, Toyota produced the [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]] in Standard and Double Cab, gasoline and diesel engine, and 2WD and 4WD versions. The BBC's ''Top Gear'' TV show featured two episodes of a Hilux that was deemed \"virtually indestructible\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |title=Top Gear \u2013 Episode Archive \u2013 Series 3 |publisher=BBC |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106115656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Luxury-type vehicles====\n{{Further|List of Lexus vehicles}}\n[[File:2012 Toyota Crown-Royal 01.jpg|thumb|right|Toyota Crown Royal]]\n\nAs of 2009, the company sold nine luxury-branded models under its Lexus division, ranging from the [[Lexus LS|LS]] sedan to [[Lexus RX|RX]] crossover and [[Lexus LX|LX]] SUV.<ref name=Toyotaworld/> Luxury-type sedans produced under the Toyota brand included the [[Toyota Century|Century]], [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], and [[Toyota Crown Majesta|Crown Majesta]].<ref name=Toyotaworld/> A limited-edition model produced for the [[Emperor of Japan]] was the [[Toyota Century Royal|Century Royal]].

After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\". The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo is no longer found on its vehicles but remains the corporate emblem used in Japan.\n\n[[File:Toyota logo.svg|thumb|left|Toyota wordmark, used as the main logo until 1989 and is currently used as a corporate logo]]\n[[File: Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro P4250811.jpg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Tacoma]] TRD Pro still uses Toyota wordmark]]\n\nStill, no guidelines existed for the use of the brand name, so \"TOYOTA\", which was used throughout most of the world, led to inconsistencies in its worldwide marketing campaigns.\n\nTo remedy this, Toyota introduced a new worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand. The logo made its debut on the 1989 Toyota Celsior and quickly gained worldwide recognition. The three ovals in the new logo combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. The overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |title=Company > Vision & Philosophy > Nov/Dec 2004 |publisher=TOYOTA |accessdate=October 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022095517/http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |title=Passion &#124; Toyota Motor Corporation Global Website |publisher=Toyota-global.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024915/http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toyota AA 1936 - Picture by Bertel Schmitt.jpg|thumb|Hubcap of 1936 Toyota AA, with the old \"Toyoda\" name]]\n\nThe new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most of the vehicles themselves in 1990.\n\nIn countries or regions using [[traditional Chinese character]]s, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".<ref name=\"Crown Motors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crown-motors.com/tch/corpinfo/story.aspx|title=Crown Motors Ltd.

selling vehicles in the United States of America\n}}\nToyota first entered the [[pickup truck]] market in 1947 with the [[Toyota SB|SB]] that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the [[Toyota RK|RK]] (renamed in 1959 as the [[Toyota Stout|Stout]]) and in 1968 by the compact [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]]. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable, and many of these trucks from as early as the late 1970s are still on the road today, some with over 300,000 miles. Extended- and crew-cab versions of these small haulers were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market.\n\nRiding on the success of the [[compact pickup]]s in the US, Toyota decided to attempt to enter the traditionally domestic-dominated full-size pickup market, introducing the [[Toyota T100|T100]] for the 1993 US model year, with production ending in 1998. While having a bed at the traditional full-size length of 8 feet, the suspension and engine characteristics were still similar to that of a compact pickup. It proved to be as economical and reliable as any typical Toyota pickup, but sales never became what Toyota brass had hoped for. It was criticized as being too small to appeal to the traditional American full-size pickup buyer. Another popular full-size truck essential, a V8 engine, was never available. Additionally, the truck was at first only available as a regular cab, though Toyota addressed this shortcoming and added the Xtracab version in mid-1995.\n\nIn 1999 for the 2000 model year, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]]. The Tundra addressed criticisms that the T100 did not have the look and feel of a legitimate American-style full-size pickup. It also added the V8 engine that the T100 was criticized for not having. However, the Tundra still came up short in towing capacity as well as still feeling slightly carlike. These concerns were addressed with an even larger 2007 redesign. A stronger V6 and a second V8 engine among other things were added to the option list. As of early 2010, the Tundra has captured 16% of the full-size half-ton market in the US.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The all-new Tundra was assembled in [[San Antonio, Texas]], US. Toyota assembled around 150,000 Standard and Double Cabs, and only 70,000 Crew Max's in 2007. The smaller Tacoma (which traces its roots back to the original Hilux) was also produced at the company's San Antonio facility.\n\nOutside the United States, Toyota produced the [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]] in Standard and Double Cab, gasoline and diesel engine, and 2WD and 4WD versions. The BBC's ''Top Gear'' TV show featured two episodes of a Hilux that was deemed \"virtually indestructible\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |title=Top Gear \u2013 Episode Archive \u2013 Series 3 |publisher=BBC |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106115656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Luxury-type vehicles====\n{{Further|List of Lexus vehicles}}\n[[File:2012 Toyota Crown-Royal 01.jpg|thumb|right|Toyota Crown Royal]]\n\nAs of 2009, the company sold nine luxury-branded models under its Lexus division, ranging from the [[Lexus LS|LS]] sedan to [[Lexus RX|RX]] crossover and [[Lexus LX|LX]] SUV.<ref name=Toyotaworld/> Luxury-type sedans produced under the Toyota brand included the [[Toyota Century|Century]], [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], and [[Toyota Crown Majesta|Crown Majesta]].<ref name=Toyotaworld/> A limited-edition model produced for the [[Emperor of Japan]] was the [[Toyota Century Royal|Century Royal]].
