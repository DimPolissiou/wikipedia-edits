Feldman]], and [[Adam Schroeder]], and written by Niccol. The film stars [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank, adopted and raised by a corporation inside a [[simulated reality|simulated]] television show revolving around his life, until he discovers it and decides to escape.  Additional roles are performed by [[Laura Linney]], [[Noah Emmerich]], [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Holland Taylor]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Brian Delate]].\n\n''The Truman Show'' was originally a [[spec script]] by Niccol, inspired by an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' called \"[[Special Service]]\".<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576574592522839126 | title=Films Inspired by Rod Serling's \"The Twilight Zone\" \u2013 Snapshot | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=September 23, 2011 | accessdate=July 14, 2012 | author=Steinberg, Don}}</ref> Unlike the finished product, it was more of a [[science-fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in [[New York City]]. [[Scott Rudin]] purchased the script, and set up production at [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Brian De Palma]] was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million\u2014$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at [[Seaside, Florida]], a master-[[planned community]] located in the [[Florida Panhandle]].\n\nThe film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the [[71st Academy Awards]], [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[The Saturn Award]]s. ''The Truman Show'' has been analyzed as a [[thesis]] on [[Christianity]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[simulated reality]], [[existentialism]], and [[reality television]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTruman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program broadcast live around the clock worldwide. He has spent his entire life in the seaside town of Seahaven Island, which in reality is an enormous set near [[Hollywood]], equipped with state of the art technology to simulate day and night and weather conditions, as well as 5000 cameras to record Truman's every move. The producers discourage Truman from leaving Seahaven by instilling him with [[aquaphobia]] through the \"death\" of his TV father in a boating \"accident\", and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling. All of Seahaven's other residents are actors. Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behaviour and give audiences a relatable everyman.\n\nDespite Christof's control, he could not predict all of Truman\u2019s actions. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but fell for Sylvia, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]]. Sylvia warned him that his reality is fake before being removed from the show, where Truman is told she moved to [[Fiji]] with her father. While Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to think about Sylvia. He uses scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia has become part of a \"Free Truman\" campaign that demands the end of the show and Truman's freedom and accuses Christof of making his life worse, which Christof denies.\n\nAs the show goes on, Truman starts noticing unusual events: a spotlight falling out of the sky, a radio frequency that precisely describes his movements, and rain that falls only on him. Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back onto the set, but other actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure him, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress; during an argument with Truman, she [[breaking character|breaks character]] and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having [[amnesia|lost his memory]] after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences and Truman seems to return to his routines, except he begins sleeping in his basement.\n\nOne evening, the production staff discovers that the sleeping Truman is completely out of their sight. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, finding that he has left a snowman dummy and a tape recorder playing snoring sounds in his place, and has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, revealing that Truman is gone, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history, while a citywide search for Truman is launched. Audiences around the world, including the media, are drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat, after an attempt to fetch Truman fails. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but, while Christof\u2019s bosses and assistants demand that he ends the show, Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.\n\nTruman continues to sail until, to his despair, his boat strikes the wall of the dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is \"no more truth\" in the real world and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: \"In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night,\" (previously his catch-phrase), takes a bow, and exits. The viewers cheer Truman on, while Sylvia races to greet him. A defeated Christof's supervisors end the program for the last time and the viewers check their television guides to see what else is on television.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies to be the first child legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has a job in the insurance business and a wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. [[Robin Williams]] was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' because Carrey's performance reminded him of [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name=\"pro\" /> Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in comedic roles.<ref>{{cite news | author = Weinraub, Bernard | title = Director Tries a Fantasy As He Questions Reality | work = The New York Times | date = May 21, 1998 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E0D71539F932A15756C0A96E958260 | accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do ''The Truman Show'' for $12 million.<ref name=\"12mil\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/new-truman-villain-harris-1117435072/|title=New ''Truman'' villain: Harris|date=April 7, 1997|work=Variety|author=Busch, Anita M.|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref> Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's [[improvisation]]al skills, and the two became more interactive.<ref name=\"pro\" /> The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.<ref name=\"part2\" />\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Hannah Gill acting as Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife, a nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on [[product placement]] for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items she has recently \"purchased\", one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. Linney heavily studied [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears catalogs]] from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.<ref name=\"part1\" />\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Christof: The creator of ''The Truman Show''. Christof remains dedicated to the program at all costs, often overseeing and directing its course in person (rather than through aides), but at the climax, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation. [[Dennis Hopper]] was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over \"creative differences\". Harris was a last-minute replacement.<ref name=\"12mil\" /> Hopper later stated he was fired after two days because Weir and producer [[Scott Rudin]] had made a deal that if they didn't both approve of Hopper's performance, they would replace him.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/at-home-with-dennis-hopper | title=Farewell then Dennis Hopper}}</ref> A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure.<ref name=\"part2\" /> Harris considered making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.<ref name=\"pro\" />\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Louis Coltrane playing Marlon, Truman's best friend since early childhood. Marlon is a [[vending machine]] operator for the company Goodies, who promises Truman he would never lie to him, despite the latest events in Truman's life. Emmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\"<ref name=\"pro\" /> Very little of this is shown in the finished film, but several deleted scenes depict Louis actively expressing guilt over Truman's situation, and in one sequence he spots Truman during his escape and purposely says nothing. His name is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of two jazz musicians, [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[John Coltrane]], and in one scene he plays trumpet.\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia was hired to play a background extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but was thrown out of the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against ''The Truman Show'', urging Christof to release its lead.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Alanis Montclair playing Angela Burbank, Truman's mother: Christof orders that she attempt to persuade Truman to have children.\n* [[Brian Delate]] as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his character on the show was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and as he tries to get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Simeon (control room director). Though second-in-command at the lunar room, he is conflicted when ordered to attempt to kill Truman via storm.\n* [[Peter Krause]] as Laurence (Truman's boss): At Truman's office, Laurence often interrupts Truman when he talks about his dreams of moving to [[Fiji]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Andrew Niccol]] completed a one-page [[film treatment]] titled ''The Malcolm Show'' in May 1991.<ref>{{cite news | author = Benedict Carver | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117477740 | title = 'Truman' suit retort | work = Variety | date = June 22, 1998 | accessdate = May 15, 2009}}</ref> The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in New York City.<ref name=\"part1\">{{Cite video |title=How's It Going to End?

It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7.\" Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star,<ref name=\"part1\" /> but because of commitments with ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' and ''[[Liar Liar]]'', he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year.<ref name=\"pro\" /> Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role.<ref name=\"part1\" /> Niccol rewrote the script twelve times,<ref name=\"pro\" /> while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history.

[[Sound stage]]s at Universal Studios were reserved for the story's setting of Seahaven before Weir's wife introduced him to [[Seaside, Florida]], a \"master-planned community\" located in the Florida Panhandle. Pre-production offices were immediately opened in Seaside, where the majority of filming took place.

And, like ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real.\" He deemed it an eerie coincidence that ''Big Brother'' made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program ''[[The Joe Schmo Show]]'': \"Unlike Truman, [[Matt Kennedy Gould|Matt Gould]] could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes.

Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to ''The Truman Show'' because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's ''Utopia'' and real-life groups such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]].<ref name=\"Robert\" /> It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban \"[[picket fence]]\" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the \"[[American Dream]]\" of the 1950s. The \"American Dream\" concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.<ref name=\"Robert\">Beuka, Robert.

Additional roles are performed by [[Laura Linney]], [[Noah Emmerich]], [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Holland Taylor]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Brian Delate]].\n\n''The Truman Show'' was originally a [[spec script]] by Niccol, inspired by an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' called \"[[Special Service]]\".<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576574592522839126 | title=Films Inspired by Rod Serling's \"The Twilight Zone\" \u2013 Snapshot | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=September 23, 2011 | accessdate=July 14, 2012 | author=Steinberg, Don}}</ref> Unlike the finished product, it was more of a [[science-fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in [[New York City]]. [[Scott Rudin]] purchased the script, and set up production at [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Brian De Palma]] was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million\u2014$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at [[Seaside, Florida]], a master-[[planned community]] located in the [[Florida Panhandle]].\n\nThe film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the [[71st Academy Awards]], [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[The Saturn Award]]s. ''The Truman Show'' has been analyzed as a [[thesis]] on [[Christianity]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[simulated reality]], [[existentialism]], and [[reality television]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTruman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program broadcast live around the clock worldwide. He has spent his entire life in the seaside town of Seahaven Island, which in reality is an enormous set near [[Hollywood]], equipped with state of the art technology to simulate day and night and weather conditions, as well as 5000 cameras to record Truman's every move. The producers discourage Truman from leaving Seahaven by instilling him with [[aquaphobia]] through the \"death\" of his TV father in a boating \"accident\", and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling. All of Seahaven's other residents are actors. Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behaviour and give audiences a relatable everyman.\n\nDespite Christof's control, he could not predict all of Truman\u2019s actions. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but fell for Sylvia, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]]. Sylvia warned him that his reality is fake before being removed from the show, where Truman is told she moved to [[Fiji]] with her father. While Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to think about Sylvia. He uses scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia has become part of a \"Free Truman\" campaign that demands the end of the show and Truman's freedom and accuses Christof of making his life worse, which Christof denies.\n\nAs the show goes on, Truman starts noticing unusual events: a spotlight falling out of the sky, a radio frequency that precisely describes his movements, and rain that falls only on him. Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back onto the set, but other actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure him, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress; during an argument with Truman, she [[breaking character|breaks character]] and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having [[amnesia|lost his memory]] after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences and Truman seems to return to his routines, except he begins sleeping in his basement.\n\nOne evening, the production staff discovers that the sleeping Truman is completely out of their sight. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, finding that he has left a snowman dummy and a tape recorder playing snoring sounds in his place, and has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, revealing that Truman is gone, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history, while a citywide search for Truman is launched. Audiences around the world, including the media, are drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat, after an attempt to fetch Truman fails. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but, while Christof\u2019s bosses and assistants demand that he ends the show, Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.\n\nTruman continues to sail until, to his despair, his boat strikes the wall of the dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is \"no more truth\" in the real world and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: \"In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night,\" (previously his catch-phrase), takes a bow, and exits. The viewers cheer Truman on, while Sylvia races to greet him. A defeated Christof's supervisors end the program for the last time and the viewers check their television guides to see what else is on television.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies to be the first child legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has a job in the insurance business and a wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. [[Robin Williams]] was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' because Carrey's performance reminded him of [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name=\"pro\" /> Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in comedic roles.<ref>{{cite news | author = Weinraub, Bernard | title = Director Tries a Fantasy As He Questions Reality | work = The New York Times | date = May 21, 1998 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E0D71539F932A15756C0A96E958260 | accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do ''The Truman Show'' for $12 million.<ref name=\"12mil\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/new-truman-villain-harris-1117435072/|title=New ''Truman'' villain: Harris|date=April 7, 1997|work=Variety|author=Busch, Anita M.|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref> Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's [[improvisation]]al skills, and the two became more interactive.<ref name=\"pro\" /> The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.<ref name=\"part2\" />\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Hannah Gill acting as Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife, a nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on [[product placement]] for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items she has recently \"purchased\", one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. Linney heavily studied [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears catalogs]] from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.<ref name=\"part1\" />\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Christof: The creator of ''The Truman Show''. Christof remains dedicated to the program at all costs, often overseeing and directing its course in person (rather than through aides), but at the climax, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation. [[Dennis Hopper]] was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over \"creative differences\". Harris was a last-minute replacement.<ref name=\"12mil\" /> Hopper later stated he was fired after two days because Weir and producer [[Scott Rudin]] had made a deal that if they didn't both approve of Hopper's performance, they would replace him.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/at-home-with-dennis-hopper | title=Farewell then Dennis Hopper}}</ref> A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure.<ref name=\"part2\" /> Harris considered making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.<ref name=\"pro\" />\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Louis Coltrane playing Marlon, Truman's best friend since early childhood. Marlon is a [[vending machine]] operator for the company Goodies, who promises Truman he would never lie to him, despite the latest events in Truman's life. Emmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\"<ref name=\"pro\" /> Very little of this is shown in the finished film, but several deleted scenes depict Louis actively expressing guilt over Truman's situation, and in one sequence he spots Truman during his escape and purposely says nothing. His name is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of two jazz musicians, [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[John Coltrane]], and in one scene he plays trumpet.\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia was hired to play a background extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but was thrown out of the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against ''The Truman Show'', urging Christof to release its lead.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Alanis Montclair playing Angela Burbank, Truman's mother: Christof orders that she attempt to persuade Truman to have children.\n* [[Brian Delate]] as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his character on the show was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and as he tries to get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Simeon (control room director). Though second-in-command at the lunar room, he is conflicted when ordered to attempt to kill Truman via storm.\n* [[Peter Krause]] as Laurence (Truman's boss): At Truman's office, Laurence often interrupts Truman when he talks about his dreams of moving to [[Fiji]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Andrew Niccol]] completed a one-page [[film treatment]] titled ''The Malcolm Show'' in May 1991.<ref>{{cite news | author = Benedict Carver | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117477740 | title = 'Truman' suit retort | work = Variety | date = June 22, 1998 | accessdate = May 15, 2009}}</ref> The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in New York City.<ref name=\"part1\">{{Cite video |title=How's It Going to End?

Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to ''The Truman Show'' because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's ''Utopia'' and real-life groups such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]].<ref name=\"Robert\" /> It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban \"[[picket fence]]\" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the \"[[American Dream]]\" of the 1950s. The \"American Dream\" concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.<ref name=\"Robert\">Beuka, Robert.

The capsid is a \"shield\" that protects the viral nucleic acids from getting degraded by host enzymes or other types of pesticides or pestilences. It also functions to attach the virion to its host, and enable the virion to penetrate the host cell membrane. Many copies of a single viral protein or a number of different viral proteins make up the capsid, and each of these viral proteins are coded for by one gene from the viral genome.

{"title_page": "Personal public transport", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n'''Personal public transport''' ('''PPT''') is a network of vehicles distributed throughout an area and available to the general public in such a way that each user has the ability to determine the route and schedule on a [[self-service]] basis. The design of a PPT system encourages utility (usually trips) over revenue.\n\n==Overview==\nWhile most [[public transport]] systems operate on specific routes with set timetables, PPT systems utilize a network of vehicles at various locations for users when they desire them, allowing those users to take any route that serves their needs and to return the vehicle to any designated point within the coverage area. The user operates or directs, in an auto-drive vehicle, the vehicle to the destination versus this being done by a driver or conductor in traditional public transport options. Similar to traditional public transport options, the system is managed by a [[transit authority]] or [[private transport]] operator but the pricing model encourages users to return the vehicle quickly. Maximizing vehicle utility over revenue means operators seek revenue from other sources such as advertising, subsidy and system sponsorship.\n\n==Terminology==\nPersonal public transport was conceptualized to explain the unique difference in service provided over traditional public transport options such as [[bus]], [[rail transport|rail]], [[taxicab|taxi]] and [[rapid transit]] as well as [[paratransit]] and [[personal rapid transport]].\n\n==Coverage area==\nInstead of utilizing routes, in the way that traditional public transport does, a PPT system operates within a defined area, termed the coverage area. Vehicles can be found or left anywhere the law allows within that area or at specific locations within the coverage area. Examples of specific locations can be public or private demarcated areas shared with other vehicles or specific station locations.\n\n==Vehicles and services==\nThe vehicle is designed to cater to an individual user or a small party\u2019s transport needs. The vehicles are intended for a single trip on public thoroughfares either shared by other modes or segregated. The user is responsible for adhering to all laws and regulations while using the vehicle and enforcement is done through existing public law enforcement mechanisms such as licensing and ticketing.\n\n==Access to PPT==\nWhile a PPT is a general public transport service, it generally requires users to be registered with the system or to pay a deposit to ensure the return of the vehicle in good working condition. The tipping point of successful PPT systems has been the application of [[information technology systems]] (ITS) enabling user identification and [[vehicle tracking system|vehicle tracking]] in a system. This is usually aided by Radio Frequency Identification Devices ([[RFID]]) and real-time information flow using wireless internet. [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] devices are also common in vehicles to guard against theft.\n\n==Financing and pricing==\nPPT is financed through a variety of mechanisms similar to other public transportation projects. Capital costs are usually covered through government subsidy (exceptions do exist) and there are multiple revenue streams which strive to cover operating costs. Revenue streams vary greatly depending on the system and attributes and laws of the area it is implemented. Many times government subsidies are needed to meet the operating costs.\nThe pricing model of PPT encourages short trips and multiple uses over revenue. This pricing model prioritizes utility at the expense of revenue and is a key differentiating factor between PPT and private vehicle hire and some other modes of public transport.\n\n==Examples==\n{{see also|Personal rapid transit}}\nMany [[bicycle sharing]] programs globally are examples of PPT.<ref>[http://www.itdp.org/documents/Public_cycle_sharing_toolkit_121204_lowres.pdf?bcsi_scan_9688b637a46568db=0&bcsi_scan_filename=Public_cycle_sharing_toolkit_121204_lowres.pdf Ministry of Urban Development Government of India.

Southsea is located to the south of Portsmouth city centre and to the east of [[Old Portsmouth]]. It developed as a fashionable [[Victorian era|Victorian]] seaside resort in the 19th century, originally named Croxton Town<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/southsea.html|title=A History of Southsea|website=www.localhistories.org}}</ref>, but later adopting the name of nearby [[Southsea Castle]], a seafront fort constructed in 1544 to help defend the [[Solent]] and approaches to [[Portsmouth Harbour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southseacastle.co.uk/tudor-castle/about-the-castle|title=About Southsea Castle'|publisher=Portsmouth Museums|publication-date=2015|accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref> Southsea subsequently grew into a dense residential [[suburb]] and large, distinct commercial and entertainment area, separate from the centre of Portsmouth.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.xi</ref> \n\nThe areas surrounding Albert Road, Palmerston Road, and Osborne Road contain several bars, restaurants and independent shops. Palmerston Road is the main [[High Street]] of Southsea and contains various shops and restaurants, as well as the local [[library]]. Albert Road is a distinct street containing shopping and cultural venues, which includes the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea|Kings Theatre]], a regional theatre built in 1907.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://albertroad.insouthsea.co.uk/|title=Albert Road Association'|publisher=ARTA|publication-date=2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Southsea Front and Common.png|thumb|left|250px|Southsea Front and Common c.1905]]\nThe history of Southsea is generally part of the history of Portsmouth, as Southsea started with the growth of [[Portsmouth dockyard]] and of the city, with the expansion of British maritime power during the [[British Empire]].<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.1</ref> Before the 16th century Southsea was principally composed of small farms, open grassland and undrained marshland (morass), outside the main naval base and the city itself. However the growing expectation of a possible French attack on the naval base led [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to order the building of [[Southsea Castle]] in 1544, adjacent to the channel approaches to [[Portsmouth Harbour]]. Southsea was first recorded as a place name in a Royal plan in 1577.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.5\u20137</ref> Henry VIII visited Southsea Castle in 1545, from where he witnessed the sinking of the warship [[Mary Rose]] in the [[Solent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southseacastle.co.uk/tudor-castle/about-the-castle|title=Southsea Castle History|publisher=Portsmouth Museums|publication-date=2015|accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref>\n\nThe first references to the development of the suburb appear in the Portsea [[Poor Rate]] returns of 1790 and describe small areas of building and farming plots. Most of the land was undeveloped and open grass and marshland still dominated the area.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.14</ref> In the early 19th century, development continued on land owned by [[Thomas Croxton]], and the community became known as Croxton Town. The first houses were built by 1809 for skilled workers in what were called the \"mineral\" streets (such as Silver Street and Nickel Street). Around 1810, streets such as Hampshire Terrace, Landport Terrace, King's Terrace, Wish Street (which later became King's Road and Elm Grove), Jubilee Terrace and Bellevue Terrace were built adjacent to the old walls of the city. Although the streets still exist, many of them were among the most heavily bombed areas of Portsmouth in the [[Second World War]], and like much of Southsea they experienced significant redevelopment in [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|Postwar Britain]].<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.15</ref>\n\nThe development of Southsea continued during the [[Napoleonic era]] and as the dockyard continued to grow, new homes were required for the increasing personnel, and many houses, villas and apartments were built. The architect and builder [[Thomas Ellis Owen]] created many of these, and the surviving buildings retain a coherent late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and early [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style, and form a [[conservation area]] today, with many of the buildings having listed status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/ext/documents-external/dev-cons-area-2-guidlines-owenssouthsea.pdf|title=Portsmouth Council \u2013 Owen Conservation Area Details|publisher=Portsmouth Council|publication-date=2015|accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref> Owen built properties in Kent Road, Queen's Terrace, Sussex Terrace, Elm Grove, Beach Road, Grove Road South, Clarendon Road, Osborne Road and Portland Terrace. The area between Castle Road and Victoria Road South was built up between 1835 and 1860.\n\nDuring the same period, Southsea grew as a leisure and bathing destination. In 1816 a pump room and baths were erected near the present day [[Clarence Pier]], and by 1820 a large complex was developed including vapour baths, showers, and card playing and assembly rooms.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.16\u201317</ref> The remaining marshland was drained, leading to the creation of ''Southsea Common'', some 480 acres (about 2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of open grassland. Due to military requirements for clear lines of fire adjacent to Southsea Castle, the area was developed and remains today as a park and garden.<ref name=\"Quail, Sarah 2000 pp.19\u201320\">Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.19\u201320</ref> Apartments and hotels were constructed towards the common and waterfront, along Southsea Terrace, Western Parade and Clarence Parade. The first large hotel was the Portland Hotel (destroyed in the Second World War) near Kent Road. Others soon followed, including the purpose-built Queens Hotel (1861), Pier Hotel (1865) and Beach Mansions Hotel (1866).<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.42\u201343</ref> In 1852 the Clarence Esplanade and a memorial were erected by public subscription, and development of the resort led in 1861 to [[Clarence Pier]] being constructed as a promenade pier and landing place for steamers.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.45\u201347</ref> Other piers were also built, including the Victoria and Albert Piers, with the construction of [[South Parade Pier]] in 1879 marking the culmination of seafront development in the Victorian period.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.46</ref>  \n[[File:Kings Tower Web-Res.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kings Theatre, Southsea|Kings Theatre]]]] \nBy the 1860s the suburb of Southsea had grown along Clarendon Road as far as Granada Road. In 1857 Southsea gained its own Improvement Commissioners responsible for [[Pavement (architecture)|paving]], [[street cleaning]] and [[Street light|public lighting]]. The [[Southsea Railway]] came in 1885 and brought further development to the area, although it was to be financially unsuccessful and eventually closed in 1914.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.51</ref> By the mid to late [[Victorian era]], Southsea had become recognised as a largely middle-class neighbourhood, with many naval officers and other professionals taking up residence. During this time the writer [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] lived in [[Portsmouth]], moving to Southsea in June 1882 with less than \u00a310 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|10|1882|r=-2}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) to his name. He set up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, Southsea.<ref>Daniel Stashower, (2000). Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle.

During this time significant local public buildings were constructed including the [[Queens Hotel (Southsea)|Queens Hotel]], in the [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian Baroque style]] built in 1903 and the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea|Kings Theatre]] built in 1907. The onset of the [[First World War]] saw an increase in fortifications on the seafront. Parades were held on Southsea Common. Southsea continued to thrive as a resort destination and a suburb of Portsmouth in the inter-war years, with many visitors in summer. At that time parts of the Common were converted into ornamental gardens and the Ladies' Mile was set out in 1925.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.88\u2013102</ref> However the [[Second World War]] had an immense impact on the urban and social fabric of the area. Huge areas of Southsea were destroyed by bombing during [[The Blitz]]. Although some of Victorian Southsea escaped the bombing, areas such as the Kings Road and Elm Grove were extensively damaged and the Palmerston Road shopping areas were completely destroyed. The beachfront, piers and promenades were closed for the duration of the war.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.113</ref>  Following the end of the war, in 1945 Southsea and the rest of Portsmouth embarked on a massive clearance and rebuilding scheme. Many areas of destroyed, damaged and intact low-income housing were cleared to make way for new building schemes. The Kings Road Estate and Roslyn House, among others, were developed between 1945 and the 1970s. Palmerston Road shopping area was developed in the 1950s and still stands today.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.116\u2013117</ref> Although visitor numbers to the resort area never recovered, Southsea continued to develop throughout the 20th century and today remains a mixed residential area and leisure destination.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.120</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nOn 15 September 2000, parts of Southsea were flooded<ref>[http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/politics/southsea-homes-boosted-by-new-flood-defences-1-4558157 Southsea homes boosted by new flood defences \u2013 The News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> when the pumping station which pumps surface water out to sea was itself flooded during a particularly heavy storm.\n\nOn 9 August 2011 a fire broke out at the old Joanna's Nightclub, a derelict building opposite South Parade Pier. Police sectioned off most of the area and guests at the nearby [[Best Western]] Royal Beach Hotel were evacuated as a precaution.<ref name=\"Notriots\"/> Despite rumours circulating on social network sites, the incident was reportedly not linked to the [[2011 England riots|riots]] taking place.

The Common owes its existence to the demands of the military in the early nineteenth century for a clear range of fire from the harbour defences at any enemy ships which dared to approach Portsmouth and its dockyard.<ref name=\"Quail, Sarah 2000 pp.19\u201320\"/>\n\nThe common is a popular recreation ground, and also serves as the venue for a number of annual events, including the Southsea Show, Para Spectacular, Military Vehicle Show, Kite Festival, [[Victorious Festival]] and a variety of circuses including the [[Moscow State Circus]] and [[Chinese State Circus]]. It was also the place where fans of [[Portsmouth F.C.]] gathered to celebrate their victory in the [[2008 FA Cup Final]].\n\nOn 6 June 1994 a drumhead service was held on Southsea Common in front of the War Memorial to commemorate the 50th anniversary of [[D-Day]]. The service was attended by all the heads of the states which had participated in the allied landings, notably [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. The service was also witnessed by over 100,000 members of the public. Historically, a blessing before battle was offered during a drumhead service which is conducted in the field with the drums forming the altar and the colours serving as the altar cloth.\n\nOn 28 June 2005 the Common was a venue for the [[Trafalgar 200]] celebrations, the seafront an ideal point from which to witness the [[International Fleet Review 2005|International Fleet Review]] and evening firework display.\n\nIn August 2010, \"[[Ultrasauros (sculpture)|Ultrasauros]]\", a life-size (52&nbsp;ft high) model of an [[ultrasauros]] dinosaur was erected on the common in conjunction with the Portsmouth's [[Aspex Gallery]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dinosaur takes up residence on Southsea Common |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/newshome/Dinosaur-takes-up-residence-on.6451323.jp|publisher=The News|location=Portsmouth|accessdate=3 October 2010|publication-date=2 August 2010 }}</ref> The sculpture was destroyed by a fire, thought to have been caused by an electrical fault, on 1 October.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-11482856|title=Dinosaur model fire on Southsea Common 'not arson'|work=BBC News|publication-date=6 October 2011|accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 [[Victorious Festival]] moved from the [[Portsmouth Historic Dockyard]] to Southsea Common.

The majority of the larger trees are [[Huntingdon Elm]]s planted in the 1920s, but nearer the entrance to the Skate Park there is a fine example of a hybrid of the Siberian Elm ''[[Ulmus pumila]]''. Huntingdon Elms once lined the Ladies' Mile\u2014an avenue through the centre of the Common\u2014but many were lost in the [[Great Storm of 1987]] and replaced by the Dutch [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] elm cultivar [[Ulmus 'Lobel'|'Lobel']].<ref name=\"Common\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/nostalgia/the-southsea-trees-which-escaped-disease-but-not-hurricane-1-6142130 |title=Southsea Common Trees |publisher=Portsmouth News |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Ladies' Mile is also home to several semi-mature Canary Island Date Palms ''[[Phoenix canariensis]]''. Planted in 1996, these palms are now some of the largest in the UK and for the last few years have fruited and produced viable seed, the first time this species of palm has been recorded doing so in the UK. Other palms growing close to the Common include ''[[Trachycarpus fortunei]]'', (Ladies' Mile, Rock Gardens and Rose Garden), ''[[Chamaerops humilis]]'' (in front of the Pyramids Centre), ''[[Butia capitata]]'' (in Burgoyne Gardens) and ''[[Brahea armata]]'', (Canoe Lake and D-Day Island). Many ''[[Cordyline australis]]'' are also planted in the area, though these are not true palms, but more closely related to yuccas and agaves.<ref name=\"Common\" />\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n\n===Seafront===\n* Southsea beach is mostly flint gravel, but with sand exposed at low tide. There are two piers: [[South Parade Pier]] and [[Clarence Pier]]; both house amusement arcades. South Parade Pier also contains a ballroom and a bar area. Clarence Pier is adjacent to a permanent [[amusement park]].\n* There are a number of miniature golf courses, a skateboard park, and public grass and clay tennis courts. During winter 2008 three beach volleyball courts were added to these attractions.\n* The Blue Reef Aquarium is situated on the seafront.\n* Just off the seafront is Southsea Model Village<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhaunts.com/model-village/|title=Southsea Model Village|website=www.localhaunts.com}}</ref> which is a 1/12 scale model village with forty miniature buildings, houses, forts, castles and a miniature railway. It was opened in 1956 in part of [[Lumps Fort]]. The other part of the Fort has been converted into Southsea Rose Garden.\n\n===Historical features===\n*A prominent sight out to sea are the four large round forts created in the 1860s as part of an attempt to fortify the city against the threat of invasion. They formed part of defences which included land-based forts around the city. The forts were never used in action and became known as [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]]'s Folly, after the Prime Minister who initiated them.\n*To commemorate the [[millennium]], the [https://www.visitportsmouth.co.uk/things-to-do/millennium-promenade-p276841 Millennium Promenade] was created extending to Gunwharf Quays from Southsea seafront. The walkway is marked on the pavement, and is lined by distinctive blue street lanterns.\n*English Heritage [https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/ext/your-council/your-city/blue-plaques blue plaques] commemorating notable figures in Southsea include Lieutenant Norman Holbrooke VC, Fred T Jane, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Ellis Owen, Peter Sellers, Commander Edwin Unwin VC, and Dame Frances A Yates.\n\n===Canoe Lake===\nCanoe Lake is the last remnant of an area of marsh and open water known as the Great Morass, drained in 1886, on which much of Southsea now sits. The lake is topped up from the sea by a sluice gate at high tide. Some marine wildlife can be spotted in the lake, including fish, crabs, [[moon jellyfish]]<ref>[http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/canoe-lake-visitor-may-be-tiny-but-it-has-a-real-sting-1-3752042 Canoe Lake visitor may be tiny but it has a real sting \u2013 The News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and reportedly even small sharks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solent-fishing-forums.co.uk/not-beach-or-boat_topic4917.html|title=Not beach.... or boat!!|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[swan|Swans]] and [[mallard]] are frequent visitors, with less frequent visits from [[tufted duck]], [[Mediterranean gull]], [[cormorant]], [[little grebe]] and occasionally a lone  [[black swan]].

The event featured live music, street art and theatre, stalls, food from around the world, an [[outdoor cinema]], competitions and skate demos. Businesses along Albert Road remained open for the day. The first event was held in 2007 when it was expected 2000 visitors would attend and 20,000 turned up on the day. The second \"Love Albert Road Day\" was held on 28 September 2008 when 40,000 visitors attended.\n\n===Museums===\n* [[The D-Day Story]] (which holds the [[Overlord Embroidery]]) is located on the seafront in Southsea close to [[Southsea castle]].\n*[http://portsmouthnaturalhistory.co.uk Cumberland House] natural history museum contains a butterfly house and aquarium. \n* Toward the eastern end of the seafront is the [[Royal Marines Museum]]. Based in the lavishly decorated former Officers' Mess of [[Eastney Barracks]] (built in the 1860s for the Royal Marine Artillery), the museum includes ''The Making of the Royal Marines Commando'' exhibition, opened in 2008, and a refurbished Medal Room with over 8,000 medals earned by Royal Marines\u2014including all ten Victoria Crosses won by them.\n\n==Climate==\n\nDue to its southerly location and sheltering of northerly winds from [[Portsdown Hill]], Southsea enjoys one of the mildest winters in the [[United Kingdom]], and experiences higher temperatures than areas surrounding it. Summers tend to be warm with fewer extreme high temperatures than other areas in the South East of England. \n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Southsea, [[Portsmouth]] 1976\u20132005\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 9.6\n|Feb high C = 8.8\n|Mar high C = 10.6\n|Apr high C = 13.4\n|May high C = 16.8\n|Jun high C = 19.4\n|Jul high C = 21.8\n|Aug high C = 21.8\n|Sep high C = 19.3\n|Oct high C = 15.8\n|Nov high C = 12.0\n|Dec high C = 10.0\n|Jan low C = 5.1\n|Feb low C = 4.3\n|Mar low C = 5.4\n|Apr low C = 6.4\n|May low C = 9.6\n|Jun low C = 12.3\n|Jul low C = 15.0\n|Aug low C = 15.0\n|Sep low C = 12.8\n|Oct low C = 10.9\n|Nov low C = 7.5\n|Dec low C = 5.9\n|Jan precipitation mm = 65\n|Feb precipitation mm = 50\n|Mar precipitation mm = 52\n|Apr precipitation mm = 42\n|May precipitation mm = 28\n|Jun precipitation mm = 40\n|Jul precipitation mm = 32\n|Aug precipitation mm = 43\n|Sep precipitation mm = 62\n|Oct precipitation mm = 81\n|Nov precipitation mm = 72\n|Dec precipitation mm = 80\n|Jan rain days = 11.2\n|Feb rain days = 9.5\n|Mar rain days = 8.3\n|Apr rain days = 7.6\n|May rain days = 6.5\n|Jun rain days = 7.4\n|Jul rain days = 5.4\n|Aug rain days = 6.6\n|Sep rain days = 8.5\n|Oct rain days = 10.9\n|Nov rain days = 10.3\n|Dec rain days = 11.2\n|Jan sun = 67.9\n|Feb sun = 89.6\n|Mar sun = 132.7\n|Apr sun = 200.5\n|May sun = 240.8\n|Jun sun = 247.6\n|Jul sun = 261.8\n|Aug sun = 240.7\n|Sep sun = 172.9\n|Oct sun = 121.8\n|Nov sun = 82.3\n|Dec sun = 60.5\n|Jan percentsun = 26\n|Feb percentsun = 31\n|Mar percentsun = 36\n|Apr percentsun = 49\n|May percentsun = 51\n|Jun percentsun = 51\n|Jul percentsun = 54\n|Aug percentsun = 54\n|Sep percentsun = 46\n|Oct percentsun = 38\n|Nov percentsun = 31\n|Dec percentsun = 25\n\n|source 1 = Met Office<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/regmapavge.html# |title=Regional mapped climate averages |publisher=Met Office |date=November 2008|accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n|source 2 = BADC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/midas_stations/search_by_name.cgi.py?name=southsea&minyear=&maxyear= |title=Southsea Weather Station |publisher=BADC |date=October 2013|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== Southsea Town Council ==\nSouthsea Parish Council was created in 1999 following a successful submission to the UK Government under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997.

There was a long-standing campaign to disband the town council.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  In a poll of local residents in February 2010, 66.3 percent voted to abolish it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Southsea Town Council was abolished on 23 April 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/axe-finally-falls-on-southsea-town-council-1-1252980|title=Axe finally falls on Southsea Town Council|publisher=The News|location=Portsmouth|publication-date=24 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe town council had limited powers and a small budget funded by the local precept. It campaigned on local issues, seeking to influence the unitary authority Portsmouth City Council, awarded funds to local causes and funded infrastructure improvements in the local area.

Two unstaffed halts were added at [[Albert Road Bridge Halt railway station|Albert Road]] and [[Jessie Road Bridge Halt railway station|Jessie Road/Devonshire Avenue]]. The line was not able to compete with the Portsmouth corporation tram services. It was closed in 1914 and never re-opened.

However the growing expectation of a possible French attack on the naval base led [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to order the building of [[Southsea Castle]] in 1544, adjacent to the channel approaches to [[Portsmouth Harbour]]. Southsea was first recorded as a place name in a Royal plan in 1577.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.5\u20137</ref> Henry VIII visited Southsea Castle in 1545, from where he witnessed the sinking of the warship [[Mary Rose]] in the [[Solent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southseacastle.co.uk/tudor-castle/about-the-castle|title=Southsea Castle History|publisher=Portsmouth Museums|publication-date=2015|accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref>\n\nThe first references to the development of the suburb appear in the Portsea [[Poor Rate]] returns of 1790 and describe small areas of building and farming plots. Most of the land was undeveloped and open grass and marshland still dominated the area.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.14</ref> In the early 19th century, development continued on land owned by [[Thomas Croxton]], and the community became known as Croxton Town. The first houses were built by 1809 for skilled workers in what were called the \"mineral\" streets (such as Silver Street and Nickel Street). Around 1810, streets such as Hampshire Terrace, Landport Terrace, King's Terrace, Wish Street (which later became King's Road and Elm Grove), Jubilee Terrace and Bellevue Terrace were built adjacent to the old walls of the city. Although the streets still exist, many of them were among the most heavily bombed areas of Portsmouth in the [[Second World War]], and like much of Southsea they experienced significant redevelopment in [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|Postwar Britain]].<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.15</ref>\n\nThe development of Southsea continued during the [[Napoleonic era]] and as the dockyard continued to grow, new homes were required for the increasing personnel, and many houses, villas and apartments were built. The architect and builder [[Thomas Ellis Owen]] created many of these, and the surviving buildings retain a coherent late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and early [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style, and form a [[conservation area]] today, with many of the buildings having listed status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/ext/documents-external/dev-cons-area-2-guidlines-owenssouthsea.pdf|title=Portsmouth Council \u2013 Owen Conservation Area Details|publisher=Portsmouth Council|publication-date=2015|accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref> Owen built properties in Kent Road, Queen's Terrace, Sussex Terrace, Elm Grove, Beach Road, Grove Road South, Clarendon Road, Osborne Road and Portland Terrace. The area between Castle Road and Victoria Road South was built up between 1835 and 1860.\n\nDuring the same period, Southsea grew as a leisure and bathing destination. In 1816 a pump room and baths were erected near the present day [[Clarence Pier]], and by 1820 a large complex was developed including vapour baths, showers, and card playing and assembly rooms.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.16\u201317</ref> The remaining marshland was drained, leading to the creation of ''Southsea Common'', some 480 acres (about 2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of open grassland. Due to military requirements for clear lines of fire adjacent to Southsea Castle, the area was developed and remains today as a park and garden.<ref name=\"Quail, Sarah 2000 pp.19\u201320\">Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.19\u201320</ref> Apartments and hotels were constructed towards the common and waterfront, along Southsea Terrace, Western Parade and Clarence Parade. The first large hotel was the Portland Hotel (destroyed in the Second World War) near Kent Road. Others soon followed, including the purpose-built Queens Hotel (1861), Pier Hotel (1865) and Beach Mansions Hotel (1866).<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.42\u201343</ref> In 1852 the Clarence Esplanade and a memorial were erected by public subscription, and development of the resort led in 1861 to [[Clarence Pier]] being constructed as a promenade pier and landing place for steamers.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.45\u201347</ref> Other piers were also built, including the Victoria and Albert Piers, with the construction of [[South Parade Pier]] in 1879 marking the culmination of seafront development in the Victorian period.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.46</ref>  \n[[File:Kings Tower Web-Res.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kings Theatre, Southsea|Kings Theatre]]]] \nBy the 1860s the suburb of Southsea had grown along Clarendon Road as far as Granada Road. In 1857 Southsea gained its own Improvement Commissioners responsible for [[Pavement (architecture)|paving]], [[street cleaning]] and [[Street light|public lighting]]. The [[Southsea Railway]] came in 1885 and brought further development to the area, although it was to be financially unsuccessful and eventually closed in 1914.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.51</ref> By the mid to late [[Victorian era]], Southsea had become recognised as a largely middle-class neighbourhood, with many naval officers and other professionals taking up residence. During this time the writer [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] lived in [[Portsmouth]], moving to Southsea in June 1882 with less than \u00a310 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|10|1882|r=-2}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) to his name. He set up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, Southsea.<ref>Daniel Stashower, (2000). Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle. Penguin Books, pp.58\u201359.</ref> Areas of Southsea suffered from the rapid development of the suburb; certain streets suffered from poverty and there was a major [[cholera]] outbreak in 1848.<ref name=\"autogenerated71\">Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.71</ref> The works of the commission helped bring about some improvements and eventually led to the setting up of the Southsea Improvement Association.<ref name=\"autogenerated71\"/>\n\n===20th century===\nSouthsea continued to grow eastwards in the early 20th century, extending to the area of [[Eastney]]. During this time significant local public buildings were constructed including the [[Queens Hotel (Southsea)|Queens Hotel]], in the [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian Baroque style]] built in 1903 and the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea|Kings Theatre]] built in 1907. The onset of the [[First World War]] saw an increase in fortifications on the seafront. Parades were held on Southsea Common. Southsea continued to thrive as a resort destination and a suburb of Portsmouth in the inter-war years, with many visitors in summer. At that time parts of the Common were converted into ornamental gardens and the Ladies' Mile was set out in 1925.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.88\u2013102</ref> However the [[Second World War]] had an immense impact on the urban and social fabric of the area. Huge areas of Southsea were destroyed by bombing during [[The Blitz]]. Although some of Victorian Southsea escaped the bombing, areas such as the Kings Road and Elm Grove were extensively damaged and the Palmerston Road shopping areas were completely destroyed. The beachfront, piers and promenades were closed for the duration of the war.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.113</ref>  Following the end of the war, in 1945 Southsea and the rest of Portsmouth embarked on a massive clearance and rebuilding scheme. Many areas of destroyed, damaged and intact low-income housing were cleared to make way for new building schemes. The Kings Road Estate and Roslyn House, among others, were developed between 1945 and the 1970s. Palmerston Road shopping area was developed in the 1950s and still stands today.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. pp.116\u2013117</ref> Although visitor numbers to the resort area never recovered, Southsea continued to develop throughout the 20th century and today remains a mixed residential area and leisure destination.<ref>Quail, Sarah (2000) ''Southsea Past'', Philimore Publishing. p.120</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nOn 15 September 2000, parts of Southsea were flooded<ref>[http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/politics/southsea-homes-boosted-by-new-flood-defences-1-4558157 Southsea homes boosted by new flood defences \u2013 The News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> when the pumping station which pumps surface water out to sea was itself flooded during a particularly heavy storm.\n\nOn 9 August 2011 a fire broke out at the old Joanna's Nightclub, a derelict building opposite South Parade Pier. Police sectioned off most of the area and guests at the nearby [[Best Western]] Royal Beach Hotel were evacuated as a precaution.<ref name=\"Notriots\"/> Despite rumours circulating on social network sites, the incident was reportedly not linked to the [[2011 England riots|riots]] taking place. The building was demolished a few days later.<ref name=\"Notriots\">{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/east-hampshire/southsea_fire_not_linked_to_riots_1_2947396|title=Southsea fire not linked to riots|publisher=The News|location=Portsmouth|publication-date=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Southsea Common==\n[[File:Huntingdon Elm Southsea Common 2.jpg|thumb|left|Row of wind-pruned [[Huntingdon Elm]]s, Southsea Common]]\nSouthsea Common is a large expanse of mown grassland parallel to the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle. The Common owes its existence to the demands of the military in the early nineteenth century for a clear range of fire from the harbour defences at any enemy ships which dared to approach Portsmouth and its dockyard.<ref name=\"Quail, Sarah 2000 pp.19\u201320\"/>\n\nThe common is a popular recreation ground, and also serves as the venue for a number of annual events, including the Southsea Show, Para Spectacular, Military Vehicle Show, Kite Festival, [[Victorious Festival]] and a variety of circuses including the [[Moscow State Circus]] and [[Chinese State Circus]]. It was also the place where fans of [[Portsmouth F.C.]] gathered to celebrate their victory in the [[2008 FA Cup Final]].\n\nOn 6 June 1994 a drumhead service was held on Southsea Common in front of the War Memorial to commemorate the 50th anniversary of [[D-Day]]. The service was attended by all the heads of the states which had participated in the allied landings, notably [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. The service was also witnessed by over 100,000 members of the public. Historically, a blessing before battle was offered during a drumhead service which is conducted in the field with the drums forming the altar and the colours serving as the altar cloth.\n\nOn 28 June 2005 the Common was a venue for the [[Trafalgar 200]] celebrations, the seafront an ideal point from which to witness the [[International Fleet Review 2005|International Fleet Review]] and evening firework display.\n\nIn August 2010, \"[[Ultrasauros (sculpture)|Ultrasauros]]\", a life-size (52&nbsp;ft high) model of an [[ultrasauros]] dinosaur was erected on the common in conjunction with the Portsmouth's [[Aspex Gallery]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dinosaur takes up residence on Southsea Common |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/newshome/Dinosaur-takes-up-residence-on.6451323.jp|publisher=The News|location=Portsmouth|accessdate=3 October 2010|publication-date=2 August 2010 }}</ref> The sculpture was destroyed by a fire, thought to have been caused by an electrical fault, on 1 October.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-11482856|title=Dinosaur model fire on Southsea Common 'not arson'|work=BBC News|publication-date=6 October 2011|accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 [[Victorious Festival]] moved from the [[Portsmouth Historic Dockyard]] to Southsea Common.

The majority of the larger trees are [[Huntingdon Elm]]s planted in the 1920s, but nearer the entrance to the Skate Park there is a fine example of a hybrid of the Siberian Elm ''[[Ulmus pumila]]''. Huntingdon Elms once lined the Ladies' Mile\u2014an avenue through the centre of the Common\u2014but many were lost in the [[Great Storm of 1987]] and replaced by the Dutch [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] elm cultivar [[Ulmus 'Lobel'|'Lobel']].<ref name=\"Common\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/nostalgia/the-southsea-trees-which-escaped-disease-but-not-hurricane-1-6142130 |title=Southsea Common Trees |publisher=Portsmouth News |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Ladies' Mile is also home to several semi-mature Canary Island Date Palms ''[[Phoenix canariensis]]''. Planted in 1996, these palms are now some of the largest in the UK and for the last few years have fruited and produced viable seed, the first time this species of palm has been recorded doing so in the UK. Other palms growing close to the Common include ''[[Trachycarpus fortunei]]'', (Ladies' Mile, Rock Gardens and Rose Garden), ''[[Chamaerops humilis]]'' (in front of the Pyramids Centre), ''[[Butia capitata]]'' (in Burgoyne Gardens) and ''[[Brahea armata]]'', (Canoe Lake and D-Day Island). Many ''[[Cordyline australis]]'' are also planted in the area, though these are not true palms, but more closely related to yuccas and agaves.<ref name=\"Common\" />\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n\n===Seafront===\n* Southsea beach is mostly flint gravel, but with sand exposed at low tide. There are two piers: [[South Parade Pier]] and [[Clarence Pier]]; both house amusement arcades. South Parade Pier also contains a ballroom and a bar area. Clarence Pier is adjacent to a permanent [[amusement park]].\n* There are a number of miniature golf courses, a skateboard park, and public grass and clay tennis courts. During winter 2008 three beach volleyball courts were added to these attractions.\n* The Blue Reef Aquarium is situated on the seafront.\n* Just off the seafront is Southsea Model Village<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhaunts.com/model-village/|title=Southsea Model Village|website=www.localhaunts.com}}</ref> which is a 1/12 scale model village with forty miniature buildings, houses, forts, castles and a miniature railway. It was opened in 1956 in part of [[Lumps Fort]]. The other part of the Fort has been converted into Southsea Rose Garden.\n\n===Historical features===\n*A prominent sight out to sea are the four large round forts created in the 1860s as part of an attempt to fortify the city against the threat of invasion. They formed part of defences which included land-based forts around the city. The forts were never used in action and became known as [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]]'s Folly, after the Prime Minister who initiated them.\n*To commemorate the [[millennium]], the [https://www.visitportsmouth.co.uk/things-to-do/millennium-promenade-p276841 Millennium Promenade] was created extending to Gunwharf Quays from Southsea seafront.

The event featured live music, street art and theatre, stalls, food from around the world, an [[outdoor cinema]], competitions and skate demos. Businesses along Albert Road remained open for the day. The first event was held in 2007 when it was expected 2000 visitors would attend and 20,000 turned up on the day. The second \"Love Albert Road Day\" was held on 28 September 2008 when 40,000 visitors attended.\n\n===Museums===\n* [[The D-Day Story]] (which holds the [[Overlord Embroidery]]) is located on the seafront in Southsea close to [[Southsea castle]].\n*[http://portsmouthnaturalhistory.co.uk Cumberland House] natural history museum contains a butterfly house and aquarium. \n* Toward the eastern end of the seafront is the [[Royal Marines Museum]]. Based in the lavishly decorated former Officers' Mess of [[Eastney Barracks]] (built in the 1860s for the Royal Marine Artillery), the museum includes ''The Making of the Royal Marines Commando'' exhibition, opened in 2008, and a refurbished Medal Room with over 8,000 medals earned by Royal Marines\u2014including all ten Victoria Crosses won by them.\n\n==Climate==\n\nDue to its southerly location and sheltering of northerly winds from [[Portsdown Hill]], Southsea enjoys one of the mildest winters in the [[United Kingdom]], and experiences higher temperatures than areas surrounding it.

The competition ceased in 2006 with the [[RLIF]] wanting more nations to play in regular tournaments with the 'Big Three'. England replaced Great Britain as the third nation and the fourth nation has to qualify, depending on where the tournament is being played the fourth nation is either from the Northern or Southern Hemisphere.\n\n===2009\u20132013: First competitions===\nThe inaugural Four Nations was played in England and France in 2009 with France qualifying to be the fourth nation via winning the [[2005 European Nations Cup|2005 European Championship]]. The big three dominated the tournament with Australia beating England in the final. The next tournament was played the following year in 2010 with Australia and New Zealand hosting the tournament. PNG qualified as the fourth nation through the [[Pacific Cup|2009 Pacific Cup]]. The big three again dominated and Australia beat New Zealand in the final for their third title. 2011 was the third consecutive tournament being held in England and Wales, Wales qualified by winning the [[2010 European Cup|2010 European Championship]]. The final was a repeat of 2009 with Australia beating England. The tournament was not played in 2012 to give teams a rest before the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013 World Cup]].\n\n===2014\u2013: Regular competition===\nThe next Four Nations was played in 2014 after the World Cup. The competition was played in the Southern Hemisphere for the first time since 2010 with Samoa qualifying as the fourth nation. Samoa impressed, although they did not win a game they had close games against the big three. New Zealand beat Australia in the final.\n\nThe next tournament took place in England in 2016. Scotland qualified for the tournament and also became the first qualifying nation to avoid losing every game when they drew with New Zealand 18-all. The final for the 2016 tournament took place at [[Anfield Stadium]] in [[Liverpool]];  after every prior Four Nations final in England had been held at [[Elland Road]], [[Leeds]], and was won by Australia against New Zealand.\n\n==Format==\n===Qualification===\nThe fourth nation alternates between Europe and the Pacific and to date each tournament has seen a different team take part.  [[Rugby League European Cup]] decides the qualifier from Europe and the [[Pacific Rugby League International]] decides the qualifier from the Pacific.\n\nIn 2009 a qualifying tournament was held, the [[Pacific Cup]], involving [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]], [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]], [[Tonga national rugby league team|Tonga]], [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]] and the [[Cook Islands national rugby league team|Cook Islands]]. The winners, [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]], qualified for the 2010 Four Nations. Likewise in 2010, the [[European Nations Cup (rugby league)|European Nations Cup]] decided the fourth participant in the 2011 tournament, Wales.<ref name=\"nrl1\"/> In 2014, a single game was staged to decide the fourth team for that year with [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]] beating [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]] 32\u201316. That same year, it was announced that the winner of the [[2014 European Cup (rugby league)|2014 European Cup]] would qualify for the 2016 Four Nations, the winning team being [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]] who qualified on points difference by just 3 points over [[France national rugby league team|France]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The competition ceased in 2006 with the [[RLIF]] wanting more nations to play in regular tournaments with the 'Big Three'. England replaced Great Britain as the third nation and the fourth nation has to qualify, depending on where the tournament is being played the fourth nation is either from the Northern or Southern Hemisphere.\n\n===2009\u20132013: First competitions===\nThe inaugural Four Nations was played in England and France in 2009 with France qualifying to be the fourth nation via winning the [[2005 European Nations Cup|2005 European Championship]]. The big three dominated the tournament with Australia beating England in the final. The next tournament was played the following year in 2010 with Australia and New Zealand hosting the tournament. PNG qualified as the fourth nation through the [[Pacific Cup|2009 Pacific Cup]]. The big three again dominated and Australia beat New Zealand in the final for their third title. 2011 was the third consecutive tournament being held in England and Wales, Wales qualified by winning the [[2010 European Cup|2010 European Championship]]. The final was a repeat of 2009 with Australia beating England. The tournament was not played in 2012 to give teams a rest before the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013 World Cup]].\n\n===2014\u2013: Regular competition===\nThe next Four Nations was played in 2014 after the World Cup. The competition was played in the Southern Hemisphere for the first time since 2010 with Samoa qualifying as the fourth nation. Samoa impressed, although they did not win a game they had close games against the big three. New Zealand beat Australia in the final.\n\nThe next tournament took place in England in 2016. Scotland qualified for the tournament and also became the first qualifying nation to avoid losing every game when they drew with New Zealand 18-all. The final for the 2016 tournament took place at [[Anfield Stadium]] in [[Liverpool]];  after every prior Four Nations final in England had been held at [[Elland Road]], [[Leeds]], and was won by Australia against New Zealand.\n\n==Format==\n===Qualification===\nThe fourth nation alternates between Europe and the Pacific and to date each tournament has seen a different team take part.  [[Rugby League European Cup]] decides the qualifier from Europe and the [[Pacific Rugby League International]] decides the qualifier from the Pacific.\n\nIn 2009 a qualifying tournament was held, the [[Pacific Cup]], involving [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]], [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]], [[Tonga national rugby league team|Tonga]], [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]] and the [[Cook Islands national rugby league team|Cook Islands]]. The winners, [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]], qualified for the 2010 Four Nations. Likewise in 2010, the [[European Nations Cup (rugby league)|European Nations Cup]] decided the fourth participant in the 2011 tournament, Wales.<ref name=\"nrl1\"/> In 2014, a single game was staged to decide the fourth team for that year with [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]] beating [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]] 32-16. That same year, it was announced that the winner of the [[2014 European Cup (rugby league)|2014 European Cup]] would qualify for the 2016 Four Nations, the winning team being [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]] who qualified on points difference by just 3 points over [[France national rugby league team|France]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
