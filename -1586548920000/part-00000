Fran\u00e7ois ([[Ga\u00ebl Morel]]), a shy young man from the lower middle class, is working towards his high school diploma. He spends most of his time talking about movies and literature with his best friend, Ma\u00eft\u00e9 ([[\u00c9lodie Bouchez]]), whose mother Mme Alvarez ([[Mich\u00e8le Moretti]]) is Fran\u00e7ois's French teacher. Mme Alvarez and Ma\u00eft\u00e9 are communists. At the boarding school, Fran\u00e7ois becomes acquainted with Serge ([[St\u00e9phane Rideau]]), the sensual son of immigrant farmers. At night, he joins Fran\u00e7ois in the dormitory to chat. Finally, Serge draws Fran\u00e7ois into an erotic relationship.\n\nFran\u00e7ois discovers his homosexuality and develops a deep attraction for Serge, who had only acted out of curiosity. Fran\u00e7ois confides this discovery to Ma\u00eft\u00e9, who swallows her disappointment and encourages him to come out of the closet. When Serge becomes increasingly interested in Ma\u00eft\u00e9, she declares herself to be interested in nobody.\n\nSerge's brother Pierre dies while serving in the army in Algeria, and Ma\u00eft\u00e9's mother suffers a nervous breakdown, having previously refused to help Pierre desert. An Algerian-born French exile, Henri ([[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gorny]]), enrolls in the boys' boarding school and aggravates their conflicts, adding a political conflict. He is obsessed with events in Algeria and supports the [[Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]], which opposes Algerian independence and defends the rights of French settlers there. He treats Fran\u00e7ois without sympathy and bluntly tells him to own up to his homosexuality. His political stance provokes Serge's hatred. Henri finally engages Ma\u00eft\u00e9, his political opposite, and they yield to their mutual attraction.\n\nEach member of the quartet develops in the course of the film, shifting repeatedly from stubborn positions to more flexible appreciations of their circumstances, explained in French class by a reading of \"[[The Oak and the Reed]]\", one of [[Aesop's Fables]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[\u00c9lodie Bouchez]] as Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Alvarez\n* [[Ga\u00ebl Morel]] as Fran\u00e7ois Forestier\n* [[St\u00e9phane Rideau]] as Serge Bartolo\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gorny]] as Henri Mariani\n* [[Mich\u00e8le Moretti]] as Madame Alvarez\n* [[Jacques Nolot]] as Monsieur Morelli\n* Eric Kreikenmayer as Pierre Bartolo, the Groom\n* Nathalie Vignes as Ir\u00e8ne, the Bride\n* Michel Ruhl as Monsieur Cassagne\n* Fatia Maite as Aicha Morelli\n\n==Production==\nThe project was first conceived as part of a television film series dealing with adolescence, ''Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles de leurs \u00e2ges'', entitled ''Le ch\u00eane et le roseau'' (''The Oak and the Reed''), which made up the first 55 minutes of ''Wild Reeds''.

Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single \"[[Right Round]]\".\n\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the number-six record ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012). She has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including \"[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]\", \"[[Your Love Is My Drug]]\", \"[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]\", \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", \"[[Die Young (Kesha song)|Die Young]]\", \"[[My First Kiss]]\" with [[3OH!3]], and the chart-topping \"[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]\", \"[[We R Who We R]]\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, and \"[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]\" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. \"Tik Tok\", at one point, was the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|best-selling digital single in history]], selling over 16.5 million units internationally. As of November 2019, the song has sold over 25 million copies. In 2020, Kesha released her fourth studio album [[High Road (Kesha album)|''High Road'']]. She has also written songs for other artists, including \"[[Till the World Ends]]\" for [[Britney Spears]] (2011).\n\nKesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as ''[[Kesha v. Dr. Luke]]'', were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claims [[breach of contract]] and [[defamation]] by Kesha.\n\nAs of 2019, Kesha has reportedly sold over 71 million records in the United States and over 134 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"PR Newswire\">{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-music-superstar-pitbull-to-host-the-2013-american-music-awards-on-sunday-november-24th-at-8-pm-etpt-on-abc-230672391.html|title=International Music Superstar Pitbull To Host The 2013 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 24th at 8 p.m. ETPT on ABC|author=|date=November 5, 2013|page=1|agency= PR Newswire|publisher=UBM pic|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC\">{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101171769|title=International Music Superstar Pitbull To Host The \"2013 American Music Awards\u00ae\" on Sunday, November 24th At 8 PM ET/PT On ABC|author=|date=November 5, 2013|page=1|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> She was also listed as the 26th top artist on ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]''{{'}}s decade end charts from 2010 to 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/top-artists-2010s|title=Billboard\u2019s Top Artists of the 2010s|website=Billboard|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> Kesha has received several awards and nominations, including her win for the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act]] in 2010.\n\n==Early life==\nKesha Rose Sebert was born in [[Los Angeles, California]] on March 1, 1987.

Jangamas are disciples of Lord Shiva as mentioned in '''BASAVA''' Puranas. A visit of a jangam to a house is treated as the visit of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] himself and the jangam shall be given good alms and the jangam blesses the natives. The Jangam is the wandering holy man in Virashaivism. The meaning of word Jangam is 'moving linga' and considered superioir to 'sthira linga'.\n\nJangama is one who is endowed with true spirit of Agamic knowledge, and has sacrificed his life for giving Samskara or good character building practices in all sections of the society including all Sudra castes without any discrimination.\n\nJangama is a community which has people who are engaged in professions like priestly hood,religious preachings and some in various kings courts as advisors and some designated positions in various parts of India, mostly in southern India.\nPriests who make poojas to lord mallikarjuna in srisailam belong to verrashaiva jangama community.\n\n==History==\nAccording to the [[Hindu mythology]] of India, Goddess Parvati had claimed that she had given birth to Lord Ganesh (elephant-headed Deity) when she died as Sati (previous incarnation who died by self-immolation). She told [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]. that he too should also create a similar lord. [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] proceeded to cut his thigh and his blood spilled on the lifeless statue known as Kusha which immediately came alive and was thereafter referred to as Jangam.

They function as priests or [[Guru]] for all those Lingayaths who follow the Shivite cult. In most of [[Shiva]] temples  the Jangams perform the Pooja (prayer and worship of [[Shiva]]) as per ParameswarAgama. The Jangam priests may preside over all rituals however special regard is given to marriage rites in [[Lingayatism]] and [[Shaivism]] section of [[Hinduism]].\n\nVeerashaiva jangam  worship is centred on the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] as the universal god in the iconographic form of ''Ishtalinga''.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lingayat Lingayat: Hindu sect], Encyclopedia Britannica (2015) {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/912326585 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/912325035 cite #1 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

The name [[Desikar|pandaram]] is from Tamil word meaninh ''storing place of valuable jewels, navarathna''. They are generally stored in the [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]  temples.

The divinity of the Jangam is reflected in many narrative stories in the Purana's and other collections, and in which the Jangamas are  actually depicted as Shiva.\n\nHistorically (in [[Tamil Nadu]]), Jangam [[Lingayatism|Lingayath]] pandaram  were known as \"Virashaiva Jangam\" and also called as ardent worshippers of Shiva. \u201cLinga Pooja/ Lingadharanam\u201d and \"Kula Deiva Pongal\" (at Bramma Mugurtha Time) are the main (must) ceremony in the marriage among Jangam Lingayats Pandarams. Most of Hindus cremate the dead, but in Jangam Lingayat Pandaram, the dead are buried. \"Mootcha Deepam\" and \"Linga Pooja\" are important rituals in funeral.The dead are buried (must be) with their Ishta linga in their hand in a simple sitting cross-legged dhyana position. Unlike other Hindus, who's function are presided by Brahmins, in jangam lingyat pandaram tradition 'Jangam Bhandari' (Jangama purohit)a Head priest specifically for jangams will preside the [[marriage]] and also funeral. Jangam lingayat Pandaram have faith on \"Kuladeiva kovil\" and Lord [[Veerabhadra]] and believe they are \u201cShivanneen Kulanthaikal\u201d.\n\n===Jangam or Jangama or Jangam Ayya (Acharya) (the priest hood section of Veerashaiva Lingayathism) in [[Karnataka]]===\n\nVeerashaivism contains two sections, one the ancient race of Veerashaiva jangam ( the priests at Srisailam and Kedarnath since the times of [[Adi Shankara]]charya) and the Lingayat which constitutes all different working classes who later joined the society after they changed their way of life as lingayatism, a sect of  Hinduism. Jangamas wear Ishtalinga on their chest hanging through a thread in Karnataka. After death they are buried in Dhyana-Mudra with [[Lingam|Linga]] in hand or they have given Samadhi or called Lingaekya or merger in god Linga. They believe in formless god in form of Ista-Linga and no other idol. ''The Jangam Lingayat or Jangam are known as [[Lingayatism|Lingayath]] or True Shivavatari or Movable [[Lingam]] or Jangam Sage or Jangama or Lingayat Priest or Jangam Guru or [[Guru]]/ Jangam Ayya (Acharya) in [[Lord Basava]] Period of Veerashaiva[Lingayath ]Religion]  and [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples in [[Karnataka]]''.\n[[thumb]]\n\n===Jangam [[Jogi (caste)|Jogi]] or Jangam: From the Region of [[Haryana]]===\nJangam [[Jogi (caste)|Jogi]] are folk musicians associated with region of Haryana. Jangam is a style of devotional music dedicated to [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] by Jangam community from Haryana. Their instruments are small and portable (being travellers) like dafli, khanjari, khartal.  Jangam G\u0101yan:  Devotional Music and Folk Music of India:   Jangam G\u0101yan is a narrative sung by the Jangam and is performed in the temple courtyards of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples to huge gatherings. Sometimes, there are public performances in village squares. The members of this community are wandering mendicants and earn their living mainly by performing the element in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples. The Jangams are also live in Shiva the state of [[Haryana]] in [[India]]. The community is concentrated in and around [[Kurukshetra]], the great battle field of the epic of Mahabharata and in the historical town of Thaneswar which has been a strong centre of the Pasupati ([[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]) tradition of [[Shaivism]].  Besides, they also move as itinerant religious mendicants in the adjoining states of [[Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttaranchal]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in north India.\n\n=== Historical background of Jangam Math in [[Nepal]] ===\nIn the 9th century, the king Narendra Dev of Lichhivi dynasty has described the Jangam Pratishthan, which is available in stone inscription in Anantlingeshwor temple, in which he has addressed the name of the Chancellor of Jangam Pratisthan and explained rights and duties performed by the Pratisthan. With this evidence, we can say that Jangam community was present in [[Nepal]] before the 9th century. The king of Karnatvansh Shri Nanya Dev became ruler of Mithila state (Northern Bihar) by expanding his dynasty in the 11th century. During the period Veerashaiva Jangam were the Rajaguru of the King Nanya Dev. After ruling the Mithila dynasty for 240 years, King Harisingh Dev Mall became the king of Nepal Mandal and established the capital at Bhaktapur City. Devi Tula Bhavani was the deity they worshiped and they started spreading the religion of veerashaivism in the region. When Malla Vansh (dynasty) was established in Nepal Mandal [[Veerashaiva]] religion had started. The veerashaiva philosophy was being popularized by the disciples. It establishes that [[Veerashaiva]] religion section of [[Hinduism]] had its roots since the 9th century. There is a Jangam math in Bhaktapur. There is a stone inscription belonging to Nepali Year 692, which explains the role of Hari Singh Dev Mall of mallavansa, who renovated the Jangam math in Bhaktapur. With this, we can say that Veerashiava Religion was established in Nepal in the 13th century. There are many Stone writings and Tamrapatra available in jangam math in [[Nepal]]. Jangamwadi Math, Jangambari, Varanasi, [[Uttar Pradesh]]: Jangamwadi Math is the oldest Math among all the maths of Kashi, [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] Uttar Pradesh, India and is also known as Jnana Simhasana or Jnana Peetha. Jangam means ''knower of Shiva'', wadi means ''living place''. One among the five of the holiest shrines for the [[Lingayatism|Lingayath religion]].\n\n===Jangam or Jangam [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] or Jangam Ayya (Acharya) in [[Andhra Pradesh]] ===\nAt present, Jangam follows the [[Hindu mythology]] of Jangam i.e., according to [[Hindu mythology]]  of [[Shiva]]  they would live by Religious priestly performance (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru). Jangam or Jangama is one who is endowed with the true [[knowledge]], sacrificed his life for the society, and avoided all the worldly happiness and attained the divine happiness. Jangam, a [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit word]], etymologically means that which moves. When this word applied to a person, in the context of [[Lingayatism|Lingayath religion]], it symbolizes a man who moves from place to place preaching moral and religious values in [[Shaivism]], [[Lingayatism]] and [[Jangama dhyana]] section of [[Hinduism]].\n\n== True Jangam ==\nJangams are factually considered as movable lingas. Jangam is considered a human linga shrine. Jangams are divided into Virakhtas or celibates, Samanyas or common Jangams, Ganachans or managers, and Mathapathis or Beadles.Pancha peethadhishas represent five faces of Shiva and Pacha ganadhishas are\n the highest class of Jangams, dedicate themselves to celibacy. They are not allowed to celebrate marriages. They are comparatively a small body and move about the country accompanied by their disciples. The Samanya Jangam is the ordinary Jangam who had the initiation performed on him. He is a married man, who conducts marriages, begs, serves in a temple or lives by agriculture. When a Jangam goes begging, he wears a garter of bells called Jang below his right knee, and carries a cobra cane. Mathapatis or beadles and Ganachans or managers are Jangams who hold rent-free lands. They are considered rather inferior to the regular or Samanya Jangams.\n \n''The two main categories of Jangam are 1) Sthira 2) Chara.'' Sthira Jangama: is a person who, staying in math (mutt) i.e., has to carry on mass education, preaching to the local people, and giving them the necessary guidance to achieve spiritual progress called   [[Jangama dhyana]], and to perform certain rites and rituals concerned with birth, marriage, death, holy communication on special occasions etc. Chara Jangama is one who constantly moves around, preaching as he goes, without settling himself at any particular place and without accumulating any [[property]] of his own.\n\n== Demographic distribution ==\nThe community is distributed throughout [[India]] and also in [[Nepal]]. However, they form a significant proportion of population in the southern states of [[India]] mainly [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Gujarat]].\n\n==Ancient Jangam Tradition==\nIn Jangam community, the male child after the initiation (Ayyachar) will be handed over to the custody of Jangam (Guru). The child will be brought up under the shelter of Jangam (in mutt/math) and by his blessings he, too, can become a Jangam (Guru) of any of the maths. Jangam priests live in \u2018maths\u2019 and guide their followers in Hindu religious and spiritual matters.\n\n== Main Tenets of Jangam ==\nThe Linga is tied to the womb in the 8th or 9th month of mother's pregnancy for the prospective child. Linga wearing ceremony to the child is thus performed before the child takes birth.\n\nLingayath or veerashaiva jangam worship is centred on the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] as the universal god in the iconographic form of ''Ishtalinga''.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lingayat Lingayat: Hindu sect], Encyclopedia Britannica (2015) {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/912326585 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/912325035 cite #1 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

Those who perform this traditional dance are called Jangam dancers. The term Jangam has been derived from the movable emblem of [[Shiva]]. Jangam is a sub-caste of the  Veerashaiva community called [Veerashaivism religion] under Hinduism. The Jangams Acharaya migrated from [[Karnataka]] and [[Andra Pradesh]] Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu states of [[India]] in order to disseminate the Shaivaite cult and to act as priests for performing religious rites in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] and Hindu temples. While performing Jangam dance, the dancers recite verses of Girija kalyana on the mythological marriage of Siva and Parvati. The recitation is done in a ritualistic hypnotic monotone. As performers, they entertain Hindu people during religious and social festivals. Their dramatic presence is heightened by their headgear, a brass band with the image of a snake and peacock feathers flashing in the air. Their narrative and rhythmic movement is embellished by bells, gongs, manjim or cymbals, and chhenna or percussion sticks, weaving the most incredible musical patterns.\n\n== Jangam Mythology ==\nJangam : Born out of Lord Shiva's Thigh and Religious priestly (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru): Jangam sages, who claim they originated from a part (thigh) of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva's]] body. Jangam claims that he is born out of the thigh of Shiva. [[Hindu mythology]] has it, ''Shiva wanted to give some donation to Brahma and Vishnu but when they refused he became so angry that it led to his creating the Jangam Sages.''. ''Jangam or Jangama over the generations have been able to maintain a distinct identity over generations.'' What sets them apart is their attire and the rituals that they follow. The ''Jangam sages'' go from one place to another and explain the different saints the story of the holy union of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] and Parvati. With the Shivpuran ([[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]) on the tip of their hand, enacting the epic tale for them is nothing but a piece of cake. [[Hindu mythology]] has it, [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] had blessed them with ''immortality'' but declared that they would ''live by religious begging in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples  (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru )''. Another version is that [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] at his wedding created two recipients of his alms, one Jangam, from the sweat of his brow, the other [[Lingam]], from his thigh. These Jangams accept alms from devout. ''The jangams meanwhile suggest, they don't earn more money, a month. They do so by religious Prayer (The chanting of mantras) begging (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) in [[Prayer in Hinduism]]''. ''At present, [[21st century|The 21st Century]], Still now they (some Jangam)  follows the [[Hindu mythology]] of Jangam i.e., according to [[Hindu mythology]] [[Shiva]]  had blessed them (Jangam) with immortality  (i.e., entire world is destroyed by nature or some other factors to destroyed the nature, Jangam will Live) but declared that they would live by Religious Begging in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples  (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) (The Lord's Prayer) after some religious event completed by them in [[Prayer in Hinduism]].''\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lingayatism]]\n*[[Jangama dhyana]]\n*[[Burra katha]]\n*[[Shaivism]]\n*[[Veeragase]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lingayatreligion.com/LingayatBasics/Jangama.htm Lingayat's Unique Symbol for Alimighty, Supreme GOD - Lingam and Jangam Guru ]\n*[http://www.indpaedia.com/ind/index.php/Jangam  Jangam in Tamil Nadu (Madras Census Report, 1901)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013224502/http://andhraguyz.com/My_Andhra/p2_articleid/987 Jangam Katha as art]\n*[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/virash.html Overview Of World Religions (http://www.philtar.ac.uk)]\n*[https://ich.unesco.org/en/state/india-IN UNESCO -Intangible Cultural Heritage UNESCO- Jangam (https://ich.unesco.org/en/state/india-IN)]\n*[[Jangama dhyana|Jangama Dhyana]] \n*[http://www.vepachedu.org/burrakatha.htm Ancient Jangam Burra Katha]\n*[[Veeragase|Ancient Jangam Verragase Dance]]\n*[[Burra katha|Jangam Katha]]\n*[http://ignca.nic.in/ICH/ich_photos/ich00026/index.htm Intangible Cultural Heritage - Jangam Gayan (http://ignca.nic.in)]\n*[http://www.jangamacademy.org Jangam Nepal]\n*[http://www.dekulture.com/33-genre-jangam.php Jangam Devotional Music]\n*[http://sangeetnatak.gov.in Intangible Cultural Heritage - Jangam (http://sangeetnatak.gov.in)]\n*[http://www.saivism.net/sects/vira/virasaivism.asp Vira Saivism: Jangam or Jangama  (http://www.saivism.net)]\n*[http://www.vepachedu.org/Virashaivism.htm Jangam in Andhra Pradesh]\n*[http://ignca.gov.in/ICH/ich_detail/ich00026.pdf Jangam in Haryana]\n*[http://kirtads.kerala.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/OBC-07.pdf Jangam in Kerala]\n\n[[Category:Indian Hindu monks]]\n[[Category:Lingayatism]]\n[[Category:Shaivism]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Shaiva order of wandering religious monks}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=November 2019}}\n{{Primary sources|date=November 2019}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2019}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2016}}\n{{Saivism}}\n\nThe '''Jangam''' or '''Jangama''' are a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] order of wandering religious [[monk]]s.

The divinity of the Jangam is reflected in many narrative stories in the Purana's and other collections, and in which the Jangamas are  actually depicted as Shiva. \n\nHistorically (in [[Tamil Nadu]]), Jangam [[Lingayatism|Lingayath]] pandaram  were known as \"Virashaiva Jangam\" and also called as ardent worshippers of Shiva. \u201cLinga Pooja/ Lingadharanam\u201d and \"Kula Deiva Pongal\" (at Bramma Mugurtha Time) are the main (must) ceremony in the marriage among Jangam Lingayats Pandarams. Most of Hindus cremate the dead, but in Jangam Lingayat Pandaram, the dead are buried. \"Mootcha Deepam\" and \"Linga Pooja\" are important rituals in funeral.The dead are buried (must be) with their Ishta linga in their hand in a simple sitting cross-legged dhyana position. Unlike other Hindus, who's function are presided by Brahmins, in jangam lingyat pandaram tradition 'Jangam Bhandari' (Jangama purohit)a Head priest specifically for jangams will preside the [[marriage]] and also funeral. Jangam lingayat Pandaram have faith on \"Kuladeiva kovil\" and Lord [[Veerabhadra]] and believe they are \u201cShivanneen Kulanthaikal\u201d.\n\n===Jangam or Jangama or Jangam Ayya (Acharya) (the priest hood section of Veerashaiva Lingayathism) in [[Karnataka]]=== \n\nVeerashaivism contains two sections, one the ancient race of Veerashaiva jangam ( the priests at Srisailam and Kedarnath since the times of [[Adi Shankara]]charya) and the Lingayat which constitutes all different working classes who later joined the society after they changed their way of life as lingayatism, a sect of  Hinduism. Jangamas wear Ishtalinga on their chest hanging through a thread in Karnataka. After death they are buried in Dhyana-Mudra with [[Lingam|Linga]] in hand or they have given Samadhi or called Lingaekya or merger in god Linga.

Jangam is a style of devotional music dedicated to [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] by Jangam community from Haryana. Their instruments are small and portable (being travellers) like dafli, khanjari, khartal.  Jangam G\u0101yan:  Devotional Music and Folk Music of India:   Jangam G\u0101yan is a narrative sung by the Jangam and is performed in the temple courtyards of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples to huge gatherings. Sometimes, there are public performances in village squares. The members of this community are wandering mendicants and earn their living mainly by performing the element in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples. The Jangams are also live in Shiva the state of [[Haryana]] in [[India]]. The community is concentrated in and around [[Kurukshetra]], the great battle field of the epic of Mahabharata and in the historical town of Thaneswar which has been a strong centre of the Pasupati ([[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]) tradition of [[Shaivism]].  Besides, they also move as itinerant religious mendicants in the adjoining states of [[Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttaranchal]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in north India.\n\n=== Historical background of Jangam Math in [[Nepal]] ===\nIn the 9th century, the king Narendra Dev of Lichhivi dynasty has described the Jangam Pratishthan, which is available in stone inscription in Anantlingeshwor temple, in which he has addressed the name of the Chancellor of Jangam Pratisthan and explained rights and duties performed by the Pratisthan. With this evidence, we can say that Jangam community was present in [[Nepal]] before the 9th century. The king of Karnatvansh Shri Nanya Dev became ruler of Mithila state (Northern Bihar) by expanding his dynasty in the 11th century. During the period Veerashaiva Jangam were the Rajaguru of the King Nanya Dev. After ruling the Mithila dynasty for 240 years, King Harisingh Dev Mall became the king of Nepal Mandal and established the capital at Bhaktapur City. Devi Tula Bhavani was the deity they worshiped and they started spreading the religion of veerashaivism in the region. When Malla Vansh (dynasty) was established in Nepal Mandal [[Veerashaiva]] religion had started. The veerashaiva philosophy was being popularized by the disciples. It establishes that [[Veerashaiva]] religion section of [[Hinduism]] had its roots since the 9th century. There is a Jangam math in Bhaktapur. There is a stone inscription belonging to Nepali Year 692, which explains the role of Hari Singh Dev Mall of mallavansa, who renovated the Jangam math in Bhaktapur. With this, we can say that Veerashiava Religion was established in Nepal in the 13th century. There are many Stone writings and Tamrapatra available in jangam math in [[Nepal]]. Jangamwadi Math, Jangambari, Varanasi, [[Uttar Pradesh]]: Jangamwadi Math is the oldest Math among all the maths of Kashi, [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] Uttar Pradesh, India and is also known as Jnana Simhasana or Jnana Peetha. Jangam means ''knower of Shiva'', wadi means ''living place''. One among the five of the holiest shrines for the [[Lingayatism|Lingayath religion]].\n\n===Jangam or Jangam [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] or Jangam Ayya (Acharya) in [[Andhra Pradesh]] ===\nAt present, Jangam follows the [[Hindu mythology]] of Jangam i.e., according to [[Hindu mythology]]  of [[Lord Shiva]]  they would live by Religious priestly performance (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru). Jangam or Jangama is one who is endowed with the true [[knowledge]], sacrificed his life for the society, and avoided all the worldly happiness and attained the divine happiness. Jangam, a [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit word]], etymologically means that which moves. When this word applied to a person, in the context of [[Lingayatism|Lingayath religion]], it symbolizes a man who moves from place to place preaching moral and religious values in [[Shaivism]], [[Lingayatism]] and [[Jangama dhyana]] section of [[Hinduism]].\n\n== True Jangam ==\nJangams are factually considered as movable lingas. Jangam is considered a human linga shrine. Jangams are divided into Virakhtas or celibates, Samanyas or common Jangams, Ganachans or managers, and Mathapathis or Beadles.Pancha peethadhishas represent five faces of Shiva and Pacha ganadhishas are\n the highest class of Jangams, dedicate themselves to celibacy. They are not allowed to celebrate marriages. They are comparatively a small body and move about the country accompanied by their disciples. The Samanya Jangam is the ordinary Jangam who had the initiation performed on him. He is a married man, who conducts marriages, begs, serves in a temple or lives by agriculture. When a Jangam goes begging, he wears a garter of bells called Jang below his right knee, and carries a cobra cane. Mathapatis or beadles and Ganachans or managers are Jangams who hold rent-free lands. They are considered rather inferior to the regular or Samanya Jangams.\n \n''The two main categories of Jangam are 1) Sthira 2) Chara.'' Sthira Jangama: is a person who, staying in math (mutt) i.e., has to carry on mass education, preaching to the local people, and giving them the necessary guidance to achieve spiritual progress called   [[Jangama dhyana]], and to perform certain rites and rituals concerned with birth, marriage, death, holy communication on special occasions etc. Chara Jangama is one who constantly moves around, preaching as he goes, without settling himself at any particular place and without accumulating any [[property]] of his own.\n\n== Demographic distribution ==\nThe community is distributed throughout [[India]] and also in [[Nepal]]. However, they form a significant proportion of population in the southern states of [[India]] mainly [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Gujarat]].\n\n==Ancient Jangam Tradition==\nIn Jangam community, the male child after the initiation (Ayyachar) will be handed over to the custody of Jangam (Guru). The child will be brought up under the shelter of Jangam (in mutt/math) and by his blessings he, too, can become a Jangam (Guru) of any of the maths. Jangam priests live in \u2018maths\u2019 and guide their followers in Hindu religious and spiritual matters.\n\n== Main Tenets of Jangam ==\nThe Linga is tied to the womb in the 8th or 9th month of mother's pregnancy for the prospective child. Linga wearing ceremony to the child is thus performed before the child takes birth.\n\nLingayath or veerashaiva jangam worship is centred on the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] as the universal god in the iconographic form of ''Ishtalinga''.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lingayat Lingayat: Hindu sect], Encyclopedia Britannica (2015) {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/912326585 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/912325035 cite #1 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

The co-artists beat drums and speak to him, enriching certain events in the story. Currently, Jangam Katha is called as [[Burra katha]], Tamboora Katha and Saradha Katha Jangamayyala kathaalu\n\n===[[Veeragase]] Dance===\n[[Veeragase|Jangam Verragase Dance]] dance is to be mainly performed by the Jangams also called as [[Shiva|Maheshwaras]]. The performers of Veeragase Dance are also called \u201cLingadevaru\u201d. [[Veeragase]] gets its term from the [[Hindu]] lord \u2013 [[Veerabhadra]].

Jangama dhyana is an ancient Jangam meditation technique which involves concentrating the mind and sight between the eyebrows.\n\n===Jangam Dance, Indian Folk Dance===\nJangam Dance is an Indian folk dance performed in the honour of [[Lord Shiva]] in [[Hindu Temples]]. Those who perform this traditional dance are called Jangam dancers. The term Jangam has been derived from the movable emblem of [[Lord Shiva]]. Jangam is a sub-caste of the  Veerashaiva community called [Veerashaivism religion] under Hinduism. The Jangams Acharaya migrated from [[Karnataka]] and [[Andra Pradesh]] Maharashtra, Tamilnadu states of [[India]] in order to disseminate the Shaivaite cult and to act as priests for performing religious rites in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] and Hindu temples. While performing Jangam dance, the dancers recite verses of Girija kalyana on the mythological marriage of Siva and Parvati. The recitation is done in a ritualistic hypnotic monotone. As performers, they entertain Hindu people during religious and social festivals. Their dramatic presence is heightened by their headgear, a brass band with the image of a snake and peacock feathers flashing in the air. Their narrative and rhythmic movement is embellished by bells, gongs, manjim or cymbals, and chhenna or percussion sticks, weaving the most incredible musical patterns.\n\n== Jangam Mythology ==\nJangam : Born out of Lord Shiva's Thigh and Religious priestly (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru): Jangam sages, who claim they originated from a part (thigh) of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva's]] body. Jangam claims that he is born out of the thigh of Shiva. [[Hindu mythology]] has it, ''Shiva wanted to give some donation to Brahma and Vishnu but when they refused he became so angry that it led to his creating the Jangam Sages.''. ''Jangam or Jangama over the generations have been able to maintain a distinct identity over generations.'' What sets them apart is their attire and the rituals that they follow. The ''Jangam sages'' go from one place to another and explain the different saints the story of the holy union of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] and Parvati. With the Shivpuran ([[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]) on the tip of their hand, enacting the epic tale for them is nothing but a piece of cake. [[Hindu mythology]] has it, [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] had blessed them with ''immortality'' but declared that they would ''live by religious begging in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples  (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru )''. Another version is that [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] at his wedding created two recipients of his alms, one Jangam, from the sweat of his brow, the other [[Lingam]], from his thigh. These Jangams accept alms from devout. ''The jangams meanwhile suggest, they don't earn more money, a month. They do so by religious Prayer (The chanting of mantras) begging (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) in [[Prayer in Hinduism]]''. ''At present, [[21st century|The 21st Century]], Still now they (some Jangam)  follows the [[Hindu mythology]] of Jangam i.e., according to [[Hindu mythology]] [[Lord Shiva]]  had blessed them (Jangam) with immortality  (i.e., entire world is destroyed by nature or some other factors to destroyed the nature, Jangam will Live) but declared that they would live by Religious Begging in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples  (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) (The Lord's Prayer) after some religious event completed by them in [[Prayer in Hinduism]].''\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lingayatism]]\n*[[Jangama dhyana]]\n*[[Burra katha]]\n*[[Shaivism]]\n*[[Veeragase]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lingayatreligion.com/LingayatBasics/Jangama.htm Lingayat's Unique Symbol for Alimighty, Supreme GOD - Lingam and Jangam Guru ]\n*[http://www.indpaedia.com/ind/index.php/Jangam  Jangam in Tamil Nadu (Madras Census Report, 1901)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013224502/http://andhraguyz.com/My_Andhra/p2_articleid/987 Jangam Katha as art]\n*[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/virash.html Overview Of World Religions (http://www.philtar.ac.uk)]\n*[https://ich.unesco.org/en/state/india-IN UNESCO -Intangible Cultural Heritage UNESCO- Jangam (https://ich.unesco.org/en/state/india-IN)]\n*[[Jangama dhyana|Jangama Dhyana]] \n*[http://www.vepachedu.org/burrakatha.htm Ancient Jangam Burra Katha]\n*[[Veeragase|Ancient Jangam Verragase Dance]]\n*[[Burra katha|Jangam Katha]]\n*[http://ignca.nic.in/ICH/ich_photos/ich00026/index.htm Intangible Cultural Heritage - Jangam Gayan (http://ignca.nic.in)]\n*[http://www.jangamacademy.org Jangam Nepal]\n*[http://www.dekulture.com/33-genre-jangam.php Jangam Devotional Music]\n*[http://sangeetnatak.gov.in Intangible Cultural Heritage - Jangam (http://sangeetnatak.gov.in)]\n*[http://www.saivism.net/sects/vira/virasaivism.asp Vira Saivism: Jangam or Jangama  (http://www.saivism.net)]\n*[http://www.vepachedu.org/Virashaivism.htm Jangam in Andhra Pradesh]\n*[http://ignca.gov.in/ICH/ich_detail/ich00026.pdf Jangam in Haryana]\n*[http://kirtads.kerala.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/OBC-07.pdf Jangam in Kerala]\n\n[[Category:Indian Hindu monks]]\n[[Category:Lingayatism]]\n[[Category:Shaivism]]\n", "name_user": "Titodutta", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: india \u2192 India,  ,  \u2192 ,  (2), Tamilnadu \u2192 Tamil Nadu, charecter \u2192 character", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jangam"}
