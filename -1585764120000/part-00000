They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].\n\nThe term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].\n\nThe G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5\" (139.6&nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971\u20131995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5\" (127&nbsp;mm) bolt circle.\n\nG20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC \u00be- and 1-ton pickups although using the \u00bd ton pickup's brake rotors.\n\nA light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20\u2014the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75\" (120.7&nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.\n\nThe G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131966)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=OldChevyVan.jpg\n|name= First generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1964\u20131966\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Compact van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|{{convert|153|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#194|{{convert|194|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n\nThe first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.\n\n''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"[[cab over]]\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as \"Handi-Van\".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added \"Sportvan\", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.\n\n===Updates===\n\n====1964====\nThe original \"classic\" flat windshield van. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.\nThe Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.\n\n====1965====\nFor 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.\nThe exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.\nThe 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder\n\n====1966====\nThis was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model \"Sportvan\" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|2nd|second}}Second generation (1967\u20131970)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=1968 Sportvan Custom 108.jpg\n|name= Second generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1967\u20131970\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>LWB: {{convert|2743|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and \"conventional\" air conditioning (with dash vents & controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.\n\n===1967===\nThe \"second-generation\" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108\" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&3/4\" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.\nFor 1967, the 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&nbsp;hp (116&nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].\n\n===1968===\nThis was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.\n\nThe optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).\n\nA column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.\n\n===1969===\nFor the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.\n\n\"Body-integrated\" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.\n\nUp front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.\n\n===1970===\n1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.\n\nAir conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.\n\n== Third generation (1971\u20131995) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Chevrolet Beauville -- 01-17-2011.jpg\n| name = Third generation\n| aka = Chevrolet Beauville<br />Chevrolet Bonaventure<br />Chevrolet G series<br />[[Chevrolet Nomad]]<br />Chevrolet Sport Van<br />GMC Rally Wagon<br />GMC Vandura<br />Chevrolet Bonanza\n| production = 1971&ndash;1995\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = Full-size [[van]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[van]]<br />3+1 door [[wagon]]<br />4-door [[van]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|125|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|146|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| length = {{convert|178.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|79.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|79.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)\n| engine = [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|4.1L]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|4.3L]] [[V6]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|5.0L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|5.7L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L29|7.4L]] V8<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2 L|6.2L diesel V8]] (1982\u201393)<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|6.5L diesel V8]] (1994\u201395)\n| layout = [[Car layout#Front-engine, rear-wheel_drive|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed automatic<br />3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual\n| assembly = [[Lordstown, Ohio]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| related = [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n}}\n[[File:GMC Vandura Campwagon.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Vandura Campwagon]]\n[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]\nIn 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a \"G\" designation (G10, G20, and G30).\n\nFor the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982\u20131995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 1971 ====\nAll new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.\n\n==== 1973 ====\nFor 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called \"Van-Tastic\" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the \"Hi-Cube Van.\" In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.\n\n==== 1978 ====\n[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980\u20131982 Chevrolet Van]]\nThe front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.\n\n1979 <ref>CGL1590107240</ref>\nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Chevrolet Panel Van Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500\n\n==== 1980-1983 ====\nAll 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.\n[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]\nChevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.\n\nAfter 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.\n[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]\nThe 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.\n\n==== 1984-1989 ====\nNew swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.\n\n==== 1990 ====\nUnlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase<ref>{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.\n\n==== 1992-1995 ====\n[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]\nIn 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.\nG30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the \"Vortec\". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The \"Sportvan\" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the \"Conversion\" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as \"Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc.\"\n\n==Concept vehicles==\nIn 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.  It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/business/private-sector-an-electrovan-not-an-edsel.html?scp=1&sq=An%20Electrovan,%20Not%20an%20Edsel |title=Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Hall, Douglas Kent (1977).

They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].\n\nThe term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].\n\nThe G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5\" (139.6&nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971\u20131995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5\" (127&nbsp;mm) bolt circle.\n\nG20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC \u00be- and 1-ton pickups although using the \u00bd ton pickup's brake rotors.\n\nA light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20\u2014the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75\" (120.7&nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.\n\nThe G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131966)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=OldChevyVan.jpg\n|name= First generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1964\u20131966\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Compact van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|{{convert|153|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#194|{{convert|194|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n\nThe first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.\n\n''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"[[cab over]]\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as \"Handi-Van\".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added \"Sportvan\", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.\n\n===Updates===\n\n====1964====\nThe original \"classic\" flat windshield van. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.\nThe Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.\n\n====1965====\nFor 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.\nThe exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.\nThe 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder\n\n====1966====\nThis was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model \"Sportvan\" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|2nd|second}}Second generation (1967\u20131970)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=1968 Sportvan Custom 108.jpg\n|name= Second generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1967\u20131970\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>LWB: {{convert|2743|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and \"conventional\" air conditioning (with dash vents & controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.\n\n===1967===\nThe \"second-generation\" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108\" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&3/4\" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.\nFor 1967, the 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&nbsp;hp (116&nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].\n\n===1968===\nThis was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.\n\nThe optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).\n\nA column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.\n\n===1969===\nFor the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.\n\n\"Body-integrated\" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.\n\nUp front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.\n\n===1970===\n1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.\n\nAir conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.\n\n== Third generation (1971\u20131995) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Chevrolet Beauville -- 01-17-2011.jpg\n| name = Third generation\n| aka = Chevrolet Beauville<br />Chevrolet Bonaventure<br />Chevrolet G series<br />[[Chevrolet Nomad]]<br />Chevrolet Sport Van<br />GMC Rally Wagon<br />GMC Vandura<br />Chevrolet Bonanza\n| production = 1971&ndash;1995\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = Full-size [[van]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[van]]<br />3+1 door [[wagon]]<br />4-door [[van]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|125|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|146|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| length = {{convert|178.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|79.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|79.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)\n| engine = [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|4.1L]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|4.3L]] [[V6]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|5.0L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|5.7L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L29|7.4L]] V8<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2 L|6.2L diesel V8]] (1982\u201393)<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|6.5L diesel V8]] (1994\u201395)\n| layout = [[Car layout#Front-engine, rear-wheel_drive|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed automatic<br />3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual\n| assembly = [[Lordstown, Ohio]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| related = [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n}}\n[[File:GMC Vandura Campwagon.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Vandura Campwagon]]\n[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]\nIn 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a \"G\" designation (G10, G20, and G30).\n\nFor the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982\u20131995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 1971 ====\nAll new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.\n\n==== 1973 ====\nFor 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called \"Van-Tastic\" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the \"Hi-Cube Van.\" In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.\n\n==== 1978 ====\n[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980\u20131982 Chevrolet Van]]\nThe front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.\n\n=== 1979 === <ref>CGL1590107240</ref>\nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Chevrolet Panel Van Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500\n\n==== 1980-1983 ====\nAll 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.\n[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]\nChevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.\n\nAfter 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.\n[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]\nThe 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.\n\n==== 1984-1989 ====\nNew swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.\n\n==== 1990 ====\nUnlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase<ref>{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.\n\n==== 1992-1995 ====\n[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]\nIn 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.\nG30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the \"Vortec\". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The \"Sportvan\" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the \"Conversion\" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as \"Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc.\"\n\n==Concept vehicles==\nIn 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.  It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/business/private-sector-an-electrovan-not-an-edsel.html?scp=1&sq=An%20Electrovan,%20Not%20an%20Edsel |title=Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Hall, Douglas Kent (1977).

His map named Santa Cruz Island the ''Isla de Gente Barbuda'' (island of the bearded people). Between 1602 and 1769 there was no recorded European contact with the island. Finally, in 1769, the land-and-sea expedition of Don [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] reached Santa Cruz Island. Traveling with him were Father [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez Vizca\u00edno]] and Father [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]]. Father Pal\u00f3u wrote of Father Vizca\u00edno's visit to the Santa Cruz village of Xaxas that the missionaries on ship went ashore and \"they were well received by the heathen and presented with fish, in return for which the Indians were given some strings of beads.\" The island was considered for establishment of a Catholic [[Spanish missions in California|mission]] to serve the large Chumash population. When [[Mission San Buenaventura]] was founded across the channel in 1782, it commenced the slow religious conversion of the Santa Cruz Chumash. Beset by diseases such as [[measles]], the Chumash declined in numbers until, in 1822, the last of the Chumash left the island for mainland California missions.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref name=Chiles/>{{rp|100}}\n\nThe name of Santa Cruz for the island came about when Gaspar de Portola expedition visited the Chumash village Xaxas on the island.  The Chumash on the next day returned a staff, topped by an iron cross, which had been inadvertently left behind by the Spanish.  Hence, the name ''La Isla de la Santa Cruz'' (island of the holy cross) appeared on their exploration map of 1770.  [[George Vancouver]] used the same name on his 1793 map.<ref name=Chiles/>\n\nWith [[Independence of Mexico|Mexico's independence from Spain]] in 1821, the Mexican government asserted its control over [[Alta California]]. In an effort to increase the Mexican presence, the government began sending convicted criminals to California in 1830. Around 80 prisoners were sent to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] where, upon arrival, 31 incorrigibles were sent to Santa Cruz Island.

Dr. James Barron Shaw was hired to manage things, and charged by Barron to start a sheep operation. He built corrals and houses for himself and his employees and expanded the road system. He imported cattle, horses, and sheep to the island and erected one of the earliest wharves along the California coast at Prisoners' Harbor. Shaw was the first rancher to ship sheep to San Francisco by steamer, some selling at $30 per animal. By 1869, the year he left Santa Cruz, Shaw's island sheep ranch was well known, and some 24,000 sheep grazed the hills and valleys of Santa Cruz Island.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref name=Chiles/>{{rp|102}}  At that time, the gross proceeds from the ranch on Santa Cruz Island were supposedly $50,000.<ref name=\"nps\" /><ref name=\"Chiles\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}}  Barron sold the island for $150,000 in 1869, and Shaw left for San Francisco and Los Alamos where he continued ranching.\n\nThe island was purchased by ten investors from San Francisco, headed by Gustave Mah\u00e9. One of the investors, [[Justinian Caire]], was a French immigrant and founder of a successful San Francisco hardware business that sold equipment to miners. By 1886 Caire had acquired all of the shares of the Santa Cruz Island Company which he and his colleagues had founded in 1869. He then implemented his vision of building a self-sustaining sheep and cattle ranch, vineyard, nut and fruit grove operation on the island.  Main Ranch was augmented with nine other ranches, Prisoners' Harbor, Christy, Scorpion, Smugglers, Forney's Cove/Rancho Nuevo, Poso, Buena Vista Portezuela, and Sur Ranch.  In 1885, he operated the largest private telephone system in the US at that time.  A post office operated from 1895 until 1903, while there were 110 workers on the island in 1889.  The operation received water from four springs, El Pato, Gallina, The Dindos and The Peacock, which fed into a 26,000 gallon reservoir, tanks and dams.  The vineyard was planted in 1884 and by 1895, the winery was maturing 86,000 gallons from the 200 acre vineyard.\n\nJustinian Caire's will stipulated his two sons, Arthur and Frederic, were to be executors of his will and continue management of operations with little change, though Justinian signed over to his wife Albina, all shares in the Justinian Caire Company and Santa Cruz Company the year before he died in 1897. His sons continued a successful livestock, winemaking<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Chiles|first=Frederic Caire|title=Justinian Caire and Santa Cruz Island: The Rise and Fall of a California Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwzehBXEKyQC|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=February 14, 2013|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806189475}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2015}} and ranching industry on the island after his death, at least until Albina distributed Santa Cruz Island Company shares amongst her children between late 1910 and early 1911.<ref name=\"nps\" /><ref name=\"Chiles\" />{{rp|104\u2013138}} Albina, Fred, Arthur, Delphine and Helene received 86 percent of the stock, while the two married daughters Amelie and Agla\u00eb received 14 percent. Beginning in 1910 an extended and complicated litigation was brought by Caire's two married daughters against their mother and four siblings. The married daughters' families, led by in-law Ambrose Gherini, retained {{convert|6,000|acres|0|abbr=out}} on the east end of the island. But the majority of Caire's descendants were compelled in to sell the remaining 90 percent of the island, in 1937, to pay their legal costs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"nps\"/><ref name=Chiles/>{{rp|138\u2013157}}\n\nThe buyer was Los Angeles oilman Edwin Stanton. Stanton's purchase of the major part of Santa Cruz Island brought a major shift in agricultural production on the island. After trying for a short time to continue the sheep operation, bringing in 10,000 head, he decided to switch to beef production. At the time, the beef industry in California was growing rapidly, with Santa Barbara County among the top ten beef producers in the state.<ref name=\"nps\"/>\nEdwin Stanton's ranch on Santa Cruz Island saw changes that reflected the evolution of cattle ranching in a working landscape. While retaining most of the 19th century structures dating from the Caire period, Stanton constructed a few buildings to meet the needs of his cattle ranch, the most notable of which is Rancho del Norte on the isthmus. Pasture fencing and corrals were altered to suit the cattle operation and an extensive water system was added to provide water to the cattle.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref name=Chiles/>{{rp|157\u2013159}}\n\nThe Gherini family, descendants of Justinian Caire's two daughters who successfully sued to break up Caire's legacy, continued their sheep ranching operations on the east end of Santa Cruz Island until 1984, using Scorpion Ranch as their base. This was the area east of the Monta\u00f1on range, which included Scorpion Harbor and Smugglers Cove. They managed the island with resident managers and laborers and often worked as a family during shearing and during the summer. Production dropped during the 1970s and 1980s and the expense of ranching on a remote island rose.\n\nProtracted litigation between the Gherinis and the federal government started in 1980, when the northern Channel Islands were designated a national park and Congress authorized the purchase of the family's remaining land. But the purchase was held up as family members pushed the federal government to pay what they believed was the appropriate amount. In the early 1990s, the government managed to buy the interests of Francis Gherini's three siblings for about $4 million apiece. But the former Oxnard attorney continued to insist that the offer was too low, keeping his 25% interest in the 6,264-acre (25.35 km2) ranch and leaving the Park Service with 75%, effectively blocking the establishment of the park.  After 16 years of negotiation, in November 1996, government officials settled with Gherini for 14 million dollars which included 2 million dollars in back interest, clearing the way for the park to be opened to the public.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/38772270.html?dids=38772270:38772270&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+6%2C+1999&author=KATE+FOLMAR%3BTRACY+WILSON&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=1&desc=VENTURA+COUNTY+NEWS%3B+Family+Gets+%2412.7+Million+for+Lost+Land%3B+Courts%3A+Jury+awards+the+Gherinis+compensation+for+the+6%2C300+acres+taken+from+them+to+create+Channel+Islands+National+Park | authors=Folmar, Kate; Wilson, Tracy | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Family Gets $12.7 Million for Lost Land; Courts: Jury awards the Gherinis compensation for the 6,300 acres taken from them to create Channel Islands National Park | date=February 6, 1999}}</ref>  The last of the 10,000 sheep on the island were removed by 1999.<ref name=\"Chiles\" />{{rp|138\u2013157}}\n\nWith Edwin Stanton's death in 1964, his widow and son, Carey, re-incorporated the Santa Cruz Island Company and continued the cattle operations on the island. Carey Stanton died unexpectedly in 1987 at the ranch and was buried in the family plot in the island chapel yard at the Main Ranch.

Finally, in 1769, the land-and-sea expedition of Don [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] reached Santa Cruz Island. Traveling with him were Father [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez Vizca\u00edno]] and Father [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]]. Father Pal\u00f3u wrote of Father Vizca\u00edno's visit to the Santa Cruz village of Xaxas that the missionaries on ship went ashore and \"they were well received by the heathen and presented with fish, in return for which the Indians were given some strings of beads.\" The island was considered for establishment of a Catholic [[Spanish missions in California|mission]] to serve the large Chumash population. When [[Mission San Buenaventura]] was founded across the channel in 1782, it commenced the slow religious conversion of the Santa Cruz Chumash. Beset by diseases such as [[measles]], the Chumash declined in numbers until, in 1822, the last of the Chumash left the island for mainland California missions.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref name=Chiles/>{{rp|100}}\n\nThe name of Santa Cruz for the island came about when Gaspar de Portola expedition visited the Chumash village Xaxas on the island.

Dr. James Barron Shaw was hired to manage things, and charged by Barron to start a sheep operation. He built corrals and houses for himself and his employees and expanded the road system. He imported cattle, horses, and sheep to the island and erected one of the earliest wharves along the California coast at Prisoners' Harbor. Shaw was the first rancher to ship sheep to San Francisco by steamer, some selling at $30 per animal. By 1869, the year he left Santa Cruz, Shaw's island sheep ranch was well known, and some 24,000 sheep grazed the hills and valleys of Santa Cruz Island.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref name=Chiles/>{{rp|102}}  At that time, the gross proceeds from the ranch on Santa Cruz Island were supposedly $50,000.<ref name=\"nps\" /><ref name=\"Chiles\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}}  Barron sold the island for $150,000 in 1869, and Shaw left for San Francisco and Los Alamos where he continued ranching.\n\nThe island was purchased by ten investors from San Francisco, headed by Gustave Mah\u00e9. One of the investors, [[Justinian Caire]], was a French immigrant and founder of a successful San Francisco hardware business that sold equipment to miners. By 1886 Caire had acquired all of the shares of the Santa Cruz Island Company which he and his colleagues had founded in 1869. He then implemented his vision of building a self-sustaining sheep and cattle ranch, vineyard, nut and fruit grove operation on the island.  Main Ranch was augmented with nine other ranches, Prisoners' Harbor, Christy, Scorpion, Smugglers, Forney's Cove/Rancho Nuevo, Poso, Buena Vista Portezuela, and Sur Ranch.  In 1885, he operated the largest private telephone system in the US at that time.  A post office operated from 1895 until 1903, while there were 110 workers on the island in 1889.  The operation received water from four springs, El Pato, Gallina, The Dindos and The Peacock, which fed into a 26,000 gallon reservoir, tanks and dams.  The vineyard was planted in 1884 and by 1895, the winery was maturing 86,000 gallons from the 200 acre vineyard.\n\nJustinian Caire's will stipulated his two sons, Arthur and Frederic, were to be executors of his will and continue management of operations with little change, though Justinian signed over to his wife Albina, all shares in the Justinian Caire Company and Santa Cruz Company the year before he died in 1897.

The married daughters' families, led by in-law Ambrose Gherini, retained {{convert|6,000|acres|0|abbr=out}} on the east end of the island. But the majority of Caire's descendants were compelled in to sell the remaining 90 percent of the island, in 1937, to pay their legal costs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"nps\"/><ref name=Chiles/>{{rp|138\u2013157}}\n\nThe buyer was Los Angeles oilman Edwin Stanton. Stanton's purchase of the major part of Santa Cruz Island brought a major shift in agricultural production on the island. After trying for a short time to continue the sheep operation, bringing in 10,000 head, he decided to switch to beef production. At the time, the beef industry in California was growing rapidly, with Santa Barbara County among the top ten beef producers in the state.<ref name=\"nps\"/>\nEdwin Stanton's ranch on Santa Cruz Island saw changes that reflected the evolution of cattle ranching in a working landscape. While retaining most of the 19th century structures dating from the Caire period, Stanton constructed a few buildings to meet the needs of his cattle ranch, the most notable of which is Rancho del Norte on the isthmus. Pasture fencing and corrals were altered to suit the cattle operation and an extensive water system was added to provide water to the cattle.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref name=Chiles/>{{rp|157\u2013159}}\n\nThe Gherini family, descendants of Justinian Caire's two daughters who successfully sued to break up Caire's legacy, continued their sheep ranching operations on the east end of Santa Cruz Island until 1984, using Scorpion Ranch as their base. This was the area east of the Monta\u00f1on range, which included Scorpion Harbor and Smugglers Cove. They managed the island with resident managers and laborers and often worked as a family during shearing and during the summer. Production dropped during the 1970s and 1980s and the expense of ranching on a remote island rose.\n\nProtracted litigation between the Gherinis and the federal government started in 1980, when the northern Channel Islands were designated a national park and Congress authorized the purchase of the family's remaining land. But the purchase was held up as family members pushed the federal government to pay what they believed was the appropriate amount. In the early 1990s, the government managed to buy the interests of Francis Gherini's three siblings for about $4 million apiece. But the former Oxnard attorney continued to insist that the offer was too low, keeping his 25% interest in the 6,264-acre (25.35 km2) ranch and leaving the Park Service with 75%, effectively blocking the establishment of the park.  After 16 years of negotiation, in November 1996, government officials settled with Gherini for 14 million dollars which included 2 million dollars in back interest, clearing the way for the park to be opened to the public.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/38772270.html?dids=38772270:38772270&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+6%2C+1999&author=KATE+FOLMAR%3BTRACY+WILSON&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=1&desc=VENTURA+COUNTY+NEWS%3B+Family+Gets+%2412.7+Million+for+Lost+Land%3B+Courts%3A+Jury+awards+the+Gherinis+compensation+for+the+6%2C300+acres+taken+from+them+to+create+Channel+Islands+National+Park | authors=Folmar, Kate; Wilson, Tracy | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Family Gets $12.7 Million for Lost Land; Courts: Jury awards the Gherinis compensation for the 6,300 acres taken from them to create Channel Islands National Park | date=February 6, 1999}}</ref>  The last of the 10,000 sheep on the island were removed by 1999.<ref name=\"Chiles\" />{{rp|138\u2013157}}\n\nWith Edwin Stanton's death in 1964, his widow and son, Carey, re-incorporated the Santa Cruz Island Company and continued the cattle operations on the island.

Nothing came of this proposal, and the property was sold to Edwin Stanton. Stanton's son and heir was not interested in a government purchase of his island. He took steps to avoid such events by forging an agreement with The Nature Conservancy, and the property was transferred to the organization upon his death in 1987.

Ordered with 62:15 gearing with the overspeed set at {{convert|72|mph|abbr=on}}, the gearing was changed to 60:17 (overspeed at {{convert|83|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}) during 1968\u20131969.  All except 3201 and 3207 would eventually be re-geared back to 62:15 once they entered [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter service]].  After [[Amtrak]] took over long-distance routes in 1971, various units were leased to Amtrak for West Coast service (primarily on the [[Coast Starlight]]) until Amtrak purchased their [[EMD SDP40F|SDP40F]] locomotives, while the rest were used in freight service and on Company specials. Beginning in 1973 the SDP45s were used for [[Peninsula Commute|commuter service]] on the [[San Francisco]] [[Peninsula Commute]], replacing the [[FM H-24-66|Fairbanks-Morse Train Masters]].  SP's commuter service was demanding work and the locomotives required electrical modification to meet those demands. A \"Passenger Start\" switch was installed inside the cab electrical cabinet; in the \"COMM\" position the units were held in Parallel, in the \"FRT/PASS\" position normal transition was made.  They stayed on the commute route (often working in freight service on weekends) until 1985 when [[Caltrain]] equipment arrived, and they were placed into freight service until their retirement, initially working out of [[Roseville, California|Roseville]], then in local and hauler service in the [[Los Angeles Basin]]. All were retired between 1986 (3208) and 1990 (3204) and sold for [[scrap]].\n\nThe [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] purchased eight SDP45s in 1967 to replace [[EMD F-unit|F-units]] on the ''[[Empire Builder]]''.  Normally paired back-to-back, they were also used singly leading [[EMD F-unit|F-units]].  These joined six smaller [[EMD SDP40|SDP40]] locomotives ordered in 1966 for the [[Western Star (train)|Western Star]].  After the startup of [[Amtrak]] in 1971, [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] successor [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] converted all fourteen SDP locomotives to freight service.\n\nThe [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]] ordered 34 SD45Ms in 1969 and 1970.  Intended for freight service, these units had standard (angled) long hood ends, the extra space aft of the radiators had concrete ballast.  Their longer frames permitted a larger fuel tank which gave the locomotives a greater range between fuel stops.  \n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Roster ==\n{|class = \"wikitable\"\n! Order !! Built !!

This steam generator placement followed the pattern set by the [[EMD SDP35|SDP35]] and [[EMD SDP40|SDP40]].\n\n==Original Owners==\nThe [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] ordered their ten on May 9, 1966 with the units being placed in service between May 24 and July 26, 1967, initially on the ''[[City of San Francisco (train)|City of San Francisco]]'' between [[Oakland]] and [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], and eventually used system-wide.

For instance, has Mel Hutchwright never watched television that he has to be introduced to characters who've been such a part of the nation's life for nearly half a century?

Have Rita and Barbara Knox ever been seen together?  Of course they have, all the time!

[[Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]), [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) and [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) are in awe of the author but [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) is unimpressed. Norris offers Mel a bed for the night at Emily's, while Blanche buys his drinks. Mel tells the book club how he has been suffering from [[writer's block]]. In the Rovers, he is enthralled to see the women fighting and declaring it has cured his writer's block, decides he will stay in Weatherfield to complete his book.\n\nMel continues to sponge off Emily and Norris. When he hears that Ken has written a book he enjoys poking fun at him. Mel continues to scrounge drinks as he feigns sincerity with [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]) and Norris saying that he has named two of the heroes in his novel after them. He also dupes [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) into giving him a free lunch at the caf\u00e9.\n\nMel takes [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) for lunch at the Clock Restaurant. He gets drunk and manages to dupe Audrey in to paying the bill by promising to base the hero of his book on her late husband [[Alf Roberts|Alf]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]).

In 2019, McKellen recorded a special message in character as Lionel for [[Sue Nichols]], who plays [[Audrey Roberts]], on the occasion of her receiving the Outstanding Achievement Award at [[The British Soap Awards]] ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/a27688173/british-soap-awards-2019-ian-mckellen-sue-nicholls/|title=British Soap Awards 2019 gets a very special surprise from former Coronation Street star Ian McKellen|date=1 June 2019|accessdate=1 April 2020|first=Sam|last=Warner|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>\n\n==Creation and casting==\nIn March 2005, it was announced that British veteran actor, Ian McKellen, had joined ''Coronation Street'' for ten episodes as a \"dodgy novelist\".<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4337079.stm|title=Actor McKellen joins the Street|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=10 March 2005|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> Producer Tony Wood said: \"We are delighted that an actor of Ian McKellen's calibre has agreed to appear in the show, it is a testament to the direction we have been taking the show in the last 12 months. Ian will be perfect as Mel Hutchwright and the cast and crew are looking forward to working with him on what promises to be a very funny storyline.\"<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Wood later revealed that the role of Mel was not originally written for McKellen. Wood and the casting director recalled that McKellen wanted a part in the serial and approached his agent, who was not keen on giving the script to McKellen, however, the actor read it and loved the writing for the character.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=12\u201318 November 2005|title='We want the Inside Soap Award!'|magazine=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=45|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nMcKellen described in a humorous account posted on his website his experience of working on the set of the show: \"Often I felt a Pirandellian urge to laugh at it all.  For instance, has Mel Hutchwright never watched television that he has to be introduced to characters who've been such a part of the nation's life for nearly half a century?  It\u2019s like working with a castful of twins.  There's fluttery Emily who is a dead ringer for her creator Eileen Derbyshire. Ken Barlow looks just like the amiable Bill Roache.  Have Rita and Barbara Knox ever been seen together?  Of course they have, all the time!

[[Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]), [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) and [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) are in awe of the author but [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) is unimpressed. Norris offers Mel a bed for the night at Emily's, while Blanche buys his drinks. Mel tells the book club how he has been suffering from [[writer's block]]. In the Rovers, he is enthralled to see the women fighting and declaring it has cured his writer's block, decides he will stay in Weatherfield to complete his book.\n\nMel continues to sponge off Emily and Norris. When he hears that Ken has written a book he enjoys poking fun at him. Mel continues to scrounge drinks as he feigns sincerity with [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]) and Norris saying that he has named two of the heroes in his novel after them. He also dupes [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) into giving him a free lunch at the caf\u00e9.\n\nMel takes [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) for lunch at the Clock Restaurant. He gets drunk and manages to dupe Audrey in to paying the bill by promising to base the hero of his book on her late husband [[Alf Roberts|Alf]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]). Drunken Mel suggests to Audrey they should go for a \"lie down\", which she refuses.\n\nMel is not who he appears to be and the first signals of this are seen when Norris discovers Mel isn't typing in the front room of Emily's house at all, but it is a tape recording of someone typing. He's hurt realising Mel lied to him but Mel manages to worm his way out of it. Norris intends to persuade the Book Club to raise the money to fund the publishing of Mel's next book.
