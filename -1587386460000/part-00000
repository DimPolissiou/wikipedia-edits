Psychobilly bands and lyrics usually take an [[politics|apolitical]] stance, a reaction to the right- and left-wing political attitudes which divided other British youth cultures.<ref name=\"Downey, 77\"/> It is often played with an upright [[double bass]], instead of the [[bass guitar|electric bass]] which is more common in modern rock music, and the [[hollowbody electric guitar]], rather than the solid-bodied electric guitars that predominate in rock. Many psychobilly bands are [[power trio|trios]] of electric guitar, upright bass and drums, with one of the instrumentalists doubling as vocalist.\n\nPsychobilly has its origins in [[New York City|New York City's]] 1970s punk underground, in which [[The Cramps]] are widely given credit for being progenitors of the genre and the first psychobilly band to gain a following.<ref name=\"wapost\">{{cite news |first=Alexander F. |last=Remington |title=Lux Interior, 62 - Co-Founder of the Cramps, An Early Psychobilly Band |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/05/AR2009020503630.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=August 23, 2017 |quote=Lux Interior ... was lead singer and co-founder of the pioneering psychobilly band the Cramps, ... which formed in the early 1970s, [and] were the first band to gain a following in psychobilly ....}}</ref> The music gained popularity in [[Europe]] in the early 1980s, with the UK band [[The Meteors]], but remained underground in the United States until the late 1990s.<ref>Downey, p.77. \"Before Tiger Army started touring in support of their 1999 debut, the psycho scene in the U.S. was practically nonexistent. There were fans in a few towns who hung with the rockabillies or punks, but psycho was their little imported secret.\"</ref><ref>Downey, p.78. \"European record labels like Nervous (U.K.) and Crazy Love (Germany) were crucial as psychobilly continued to be virtually unnoticed in the U.S.\"</ref> The second wave of psychobilly began with the 1986 release of British band [[Demented Are Go]]'s debut album ''[[In Sickness & In Health]]''.<ref name=\"Downey, 78\"/> The genre soon spread throughout [[Europe]], inspiring a number of new acts such as [[Mad Sin]] (formed in Germany in 1987) and the [[Nekromantix]] (formed in [[Denmark]] in 1989), who released the album ''[[Curse of the Coffin]]'' in 1991.<ref name=\"Downey, 80\"/> Since then the advent of several notable psychobilly bands, such as the US band [[Tiger Army]] and the Australian band [[The Living End]], has led to its mainstream popularity and attracted international attention to the genre.\n\n==History==\nThe evolution of psychobilly as a genre is often described as having occurred in waves.

As early as 1983, both bands issued recordings that displayed the rockabilly and garage punk influences of psychobilly, as well as a lyrical tendency towards horror and dark themes, often presented with humour. Although it was not acknowledged as such at the time, Montreal's Mongols likely came closest to true psychobilly. From the somber Cramps-ish original title track to the covers of deranged rockabilly (Hasil Adkins), fifties rhythm 'n' blues (via psychobilly forefathers The Sonics), sixties garage rock by Quebec teenage sensations Les Lutins, and obscure, off-kilter instrumentals (one by The Nautiloids), their mini-LP ''Sleepwalk'' (1986) runs the gamut of all the musical bases of the genre. In addition, a few years later, The Mongols had their only other recording, \"B\u00e9b\u00e9 Cadavre\" (Cadaver Baby), included on the ''Lach\u00e9s Lousses'' compilation (1990). Edmonton's Dusty Chaps might also be seen as an early exponent of the style with the inclusion of their sinister \"Psychopath of Love\" on Nervous Records' compilation ''Boppin' In Canada'' (1991). Following in those tracks, in the mid-nineties, were Vancouver's Deadcats. Their guitarist, Mike Dennis, had previously played in hardcore punk bands The Bill Of Rights and Forbidden Beat. Besides his own band, Dennis also issued early recordings by Montreal psychobillies The Alley Dukes, and Bloodshot Bill - who is also sometimes associated with the genre - on his Flying Saucer Records label.

Often the [[guitarist]] or [[bassist]] will be the lead [[singing|vocalist]], with few acts having a dedicated singer (Mad Sin being one of the examples with a dedicated singer).\n\nPsychobilly guitarists often play rockabilly-style hollowbody archtop guitars with f-holes and a tremolo bar. Guitarists may play punk-style power chords one moment, and then shift into rockabilly-style fingerpicking and rockabilly guitar-style seventh chords, with a heavy focus on minor chords and palm muting. Notes are often bent, either by pulling the string down or by using the tremolo bar. Gretsch hollowbody guitars are a popular choice. Guitarists often use 1950s-style tube amplifiers such as by makers such as Fender and it is common to see stacks of two speaker cabinets. As with rockabilly guitarists, the overdrive tone usually comes from what is produced naturally by overdriving the tube amp, rather than by plugging into a distortion [[Effects unit|pedal]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nAn upright [[double bass]] is often used instead of the electric bass found in most rock bands (though an electric bass is sometimes optional). The use of the upright bass is influenced by 1950s rockabilly and rock and roll musicians, particularly in the use of [[walking bass]] lines and the use of slapping.\nThe bass is often played in the [[Double bass#Slap-style bass|slap style]], in which the player snaps the string by pulling it until it hits the fingerboard, or hits the strings against the fingerboard, which adds a high-pitched percussive \"clack\" or \"slap\" sound to the low-pitched notes. [[Kim Nekroman]] and [[Geoff Kresge]] are two examples of psychobilly bassists who have developed a rapid, percussive slap bass technique. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17CJcHKMsRk&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D17CJcHKMsRk This live Nekromantix song showcases Kim's rapid percussive slapping].\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUcM724fbHU&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKUcM724fbHU This live [[Tiger Army]] song shows Kresge's rapid slap bass technique.]\n\nPsychobilly bassists often use gut strings, to get the deep, low 1950s tone. Like rockabilly bassists, psychobilly bassists often use both a bridge pickup and a fingerboard pickup, with the latter being used to pick up slapping and percussive sounds. Psychobilly bassists often decorate their basses by painting them with retro pin-up style images or designs or by putting stickers on them.\n\n[[File:HorrorPops live 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[HorrorPops]] frontwoman [[Patricia Day]] plays an elaborately decorated [[double bass]], a common instrument in psychobilly.]]\nSome acts have made their upright bass the centerpiece of their stage shows; some psychobilly musicians elaborately decorate their upright bass, such as Nekromantix frontman [[Kim Nekroman]], whose \"coffinbass\" is in the shape of a [[coffin]], with a headstock in the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]. Nekroman created his original \"coffinbass\" from an actual child-sized coffin, and has since designed new models to achieve better acoustics, as well as collapsibility for easier transportation.<ref name=\"thursby\">{{cite web\n |last       = Thursby\n |first      = Erin\n |title      = On the Lighter Side of Death: Interview With Nekromantix\n |website    = EU Jacksonville\n |date       = April 26, 2007\n |url        = http://eujacksonville.com/pages/04-19-07/nekromantix.htm\n |archive-url= https://archive.is/20121208124208/http://eujacksonville.com/pages/04-19-07/nekromantix.htm\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date= December 8, 2012\n |accessdate = August 10, 2007}}</ref> Another notable act to use a coffin-shaped bass is the [[Brazil]]ian psychobilly band Os Catalepticos.<ref name=\"Downey, 82\"/> [[HorrorPops]] frontwoman [[Patricia Day]] also uses an elaborately painted and decorated double bass.\n\nThe Cramps performed without a bass player in their early career, using two guitars instead. They did not add a bass guitar to their arrangement until 1986, and have used an electric bass since that time. Cramps guitarist/bassist [[Poison Ivy (musician)|Poison Ivy]] sees this as one of the distinctions that separate the band from the psychobilly movement: \"I think psychobilly has evolved into a gamut of things... It seems to involve upright bass and playing songs extremely fast. That's certainly not what we do.\"<ref name=\"Downey, 78\"/>\n\nSamantha Von Trash's history of psychobilly lists 13 essential albums for people new to psychobilly: The Cramps: ''Songs the Lord Taught Us''; Reverend Horton Heat: ''Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em''; The Misfits: ''Static Age''; Social Distortion: ''Mommy's Little Monster''; ''The Essential Johnny Cash''; Cult of the Psychic Fetus: ''Funeral Home Sessions''; Cult of the Psychic Fetus: ''She Devil''; Demented Are Go: ''Satan's Rejects''; 7 Shot Screamers: ''Keep the Flame Alive''; Nekromantix: ''Curse of the Coffin''; \"Rockabilly Riot!\" compilation; Thee Merry Widows' self-titled EP; Stray Cats: either ''Built For Speed'' or ''Rock This Town''.\n\n===Stage shows===\n[[File:LivingEnd2009.jpg|thumb|[[The Living End]] demonstrate psychobilly stage antics; in this photo, the guitarist is standing on top of the upright bass.|alt=]]<!-- I love the bass rig...not just an 8x10\", but also ANOTHER 2x10\" on top...raw power!! -->\nThe performance style in psychobilly concerts emphasizes high energy and a lot of interactions between the band members and with the audience. The HorrorPops sometimes switch instruments for fun, and Kim Nekroman does stunts such as playing the fingerboard of his Coffinbass with his tongue. Demented are Go are known for their wild stage show, which included simulated on-stage sex with a vacuum cleaner. The Australian band [[Zombie Ghost Train]] were known for appearing on stage in \"zombified\" clothes, featuring rips and bloodstains, and zombie make up, complete with fake stitches across the face.\n[[File:Gibson ES-335 sunburst.jpg|thumb|upright|Psychobilly guitarists often play 1950s-style hollowbody guitars.]]\nThe [[Phenomenauts]] are known for their inventive and fun-filled live shows, which often include smoke machines, the Streamerator 2000, and various on-stage theatrics. [[Big John Bates]] was banned in one venue due to concerns about their overly risque stage antics. [[Deadbolt (band)|Deadbolt]] is known for its use of power tools during their live sets, and it is customary for the audience to be showered with sparks of red-hot metal during their live shows. [[King Kurt]], a 1980s band, was known for its infamous \"food fight\" gigs, in which eggs and bags of flour were thrown around on and off stage and audience members were given free haircuts. \"King Kurt had a bad reputation for doing things that would make people question the band's stability. These included going on stage in dresses, dressed as Zulus, and playing drinking games on stage. Tabloids often accused them of mixing drugs ...into whatever they made people drink on stage, tossing dead animals into the crowds, and rampant sex occurring as they played.\"<ref name=\"furious.com\"/>\n\n\"At any psychobilly show, you might see some dancing\u2026 only, it's not your average dancing.

Original psychobilly act [[The Meteors]] articulated a very [[politics|apolitical]] stance to the scene, a reaction to the right- and left-wing political attitudes dividing British youth cultures of the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=\"Downey, 77\"/> This attitude has carried through later generations of psychobilly. [[Nekromantix]] frontman [[Kim Nekroman]] describes: \"We are all different people and have different political views. Psychobilly is all about having fun. Politics is not fun and therefore has nothing to do with psychobilly!\"<ref name=\"Downey, 78\"/>\nNate Katz explains the rationale for psychobilly's apolitical stance as follows:<ref name=\"furious.com\"/>\n<blockquote>\n1980 was an important year for Britain. Recently elected [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s policies led to a drastic decline in employment, especially among the blue collared and youth (Kim, 2005). A year later, there were five [[race riot]]s within the London area... On a political level, London was incredibly tense. Fans of psychobilly (known as psychos) wanted none of this, or at the very least a break from the stress created by the political world. By establishing an unwritten rule that the music was to be [[apolitical]], psychobilly music became a method of escape from the real world.</blockquote>\n\nKatz notes that at the \"same time [in the 1980s], the revival of the B-movie, particularly the return of horror movies, occurred...[,] such as ''The Howling'', ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', a remake of ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', and ''An American Werewolf in London'' (All 80s Movies). Psychos gravitated towards these movies due to their lack of seriousness, mindless gore, and enjoyed the throwback to the original [[B-movies]] of the 1950s.\"<ref name=\"furious.com\"/>\n\n==Fashion and subculture==\n[[File:Nekromantix 2011-08-13 06.jpg|thumb|right|The Nekromantix, shown here in a 2011 show, illustrate several aspects of psychobilly fashion, including shaved heads, pompadour hairstyles, and prominent tattoos.]]\n\nAccording to Nate Katz, \"in its early days, Psychobilly relied almost entirely on word of mouth to be spread throughout London... If your friends did not know of it [a band or gig], the odds were that you did not either.\"<ref name=\"furious.com\"/> The then manager of [[The Meteors]], Nick Garrard, produced a magazine called 'Cat Talk' which was heavy on Meteors content & their new style of Psychobilly music. One of the band's original fans (Proff) produced gig flyers with a heavy horror/Frankenstein theme. Roy Williams of [[Nervous Records]] created a newsletter that would be passed around known as 'Zorch News', which allowed fans to keep up with psychobilly news that specifically related to bands involved with Nervous Records.<ref name=\"furious.com\"/> \"Despite being starved of the oxygen of mainstream music press attention for more than 25 years, psychobilly has thrived in the underground[,] building a network of fiercely loyal followers and producing a huge number of bands who each peddle their own brand of the genre.\"<ref name=\"amazon.com\"/> [[Fanzine]]s are one of the ways the psychobilly scene created a social network, with ''Deathrow'' being the \"...only long running psychobilly fanzine.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1282427.Deathrow |title=Deathrow: The Chronicles of Psychobilly: The Very Best of Britain's Essential Psycho Fanzine Issues 1-38 |first=Alan |last=Wilson |date=October 1, 2006 |publisher=Cherry Red Books |location=London |isbn=978-1-90144-755-2 |via=[[Goodreads.com]] |accessdate=September 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815184726/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1282427.Deathrow |archivedate=August 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPsychobilly musicians and fans, who are sometimes called \"psychos\" or just \"Psychobillies,\" often dress in styles that borrow from 1950s [[rockabilly]] and [[rock and roll]], as well as 1970s [[punk fashion]]s. Long \"Old Mans\" overcoats, army trousers, bleached jeans & Dr Martin Boots were all part of the early \"Psycho\" uniform along with band logo T-shirts. Heavily painted & studded leather jackets were also worn. This was topped off by a 1950s style quiff or flat-top, often bleached with shaved back & sides. Psychobilly band members of both sexes often have prominent [[tattoo]]s, often with a vintage theme.<ref name=\"Downey, 77\"/> Psychobilly \"tattoos followed the same general notions as band designs, being highly influenced by the same movies.

As early as 1983, both bands issued recordings that displayed the rockabilly and garage punk influences of psychobilly, as well as a lyrical tendency towards horror and dark themes, often presented with humour. Although it was not acknowledged as such at the time, Montreal's Mongols likely came closest to true psychobilly. From the somber Cramps-ish original title track to the covers of deranged rockabilly (Hasil Adkins), fifties rhythm 'n' blues (via psychobilly forefathers The Sonics), sixties garage rock by Quebec teenage sensations Les Lutins, and obscure, off-kilter instrumentals (one by The Nautiloids), their mini-LP ''Sleepwalk'' (1986) runs the gamut of all the musical bases of the genre. In addition, a few years later, The Mongols had their only other recording, \"B\u00e9b\u00e9 Cadavre\" (Cadaver Baby), included on the ''Lach\u00e9s Lousses'' compilation (1990). Edmonton's Dusty Chaps might also be seen as an early exponent of the style with the inclusion of their sinister \"Psychopath of Love\" on Nervous Records' compilation ''Boppin' In Canada'' (1991). Following in those tracks, in the mid-nineties, were Vancouver's Deadcats. Their guitarist, Mike Dennis, had previously played in hardcore punk bands The Bill Of Rights and Forbidden Beat.

Often the [[guitarist]] or [[bassist]] will be the lead [[singing|vocalist]], with few acts having a dedicated singer (Mad Sin being one of the examples with a dedicated singer).\n\nPsychobilly guitarists often play rockabilly-style hollowbody archtop guitars with f-holes and a tremolo bar. Guitarists may play punk-style power chords one moment, and then shift into rockabilly-style fingerpicking and rockabilly guitar-style seventh chords, with a heavy focus on minor chords and palm muting. Notes are often bent, either by pulling the string down or by using the tremolo bar. Gretsch hollowbody guitars are a popular choice. Guitarists often use 1950s-style tube amplifiers such as by makers such as Fender and it is common to see stacks of two speaker cabinets. As with rockabilly guitarists, the overdrive tone usually comes from what is produced naturally by overdriving the tube amp, rather than by plugging into a distortion [[Effects unit|pedal]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nAn upright [[double bass]] is often used instead of the electric bass found in most rock bands (though an electric bass is sometimes optional). The use of the upright bass is influenced by 1950s rockabilly and rock and roll musicians, particularly in the use of [[walking bass]] lines and the use of slapping.\nThe bass is often played in the [[Double bass#Slap-style bass|slap style]], in which the player snaps the string by pulling it until it hits the fingerboard, or hits the strings against the fingerboard, which adds a high-pitched percussive \"clack\" or \"slap\" sound to the low-pitched notes. [[Kim Nekroman]] and [[Geoff Kresge]] are two examples of psychobilly bassists who have developed a rapid, percussive slap bass technique. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17CJcHKMsRk&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D17CJcHKMsRk This live Nekromantix song showcases Kim's rapid percussive slapping].\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUcM724fbHU&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKUcM724fbHU This live [[Tiger Army]] song shows Kresge's rapid slap bass technique.]\n\nPsychobilly bassists often use gut strings, to get the deep, low 1950s tone. Like rockabilly bassists, psychobilly bassists often use both a bridge pickup and a fingerboard pickup, with the latter being used to pick up slapping and percussive sounds. Psychobilly bassists often decorate their basses by painting them with retro pin-up style images or designs or by putting stickers on them.\n\n[[File:HorrorPops live 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[HorrorPops]] frontwoman [[Patricia Day]] plays an elaborately decorated [[double bass]], a common instrument in psychobilly.]]\nSome acts have made their upright bass the centerpiece of their stage shows; some psychobilly musicians elaborately decorate their upright bass, such as Nekromantix frontman [[Kim Nekroman]], whose \"coffinbass\" is in the shape of a [[coffin]], with a headstock in the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]. Nekroman created his original \"coffinbass\" from an actual child-sized coffin, and has since designed new models to achieve better acoustics, as well as collapsibility for easier transportation.<ref name=\"thursby\">{{cite web\n |last       = Thursby\n |first      = Erin\n |title      = On the Lighter Side of Death: Interview With Nekromantix\n |website    = EU Jacksonville\n |date       = April 26, 2007\n |url        = http://eujacksonville.com/pages/04-19-07/nekromantix.htm\n |archive-url= https://archive.is/20121208124208/http://eujacksonville.com/pages/04-19-07/nekromantix.htm\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date= December 8, 2012\n |accessdate = August 10, 2007}}</ref> Another notable act to use a coffin-shaped bass is the [[Brazil]]ian psychobilly band Os Catalepticos.<ref name=\"Downey, 82\"/> [[HorrorPops]] frontwoman [[Patricia Day]] also uses an elaborately painted and decorated double bass.\n\nThe Cramps performed without a bass player in their early career, using two guitars instead. They did not add a bass guitar to their arrangement until 1986, and have used an electric bass since that time. Cramps guitarist/bassist [[Poison Ivy (musician)|Poison Ivy]] sees this as one of the distinctions that separate the band from the psychobilly movement: \"I think psychobilly has evolved into a gamut of things... It seems to involve upright bass and playing songs extremely fast. That's certainly not what we do.\"<ref name=\"Downey, 78\"/>\n\nSamantha Von Trash's history of psychobilly lists 13 essential albums for people new to psychobilly: The Cramps: ''Songs the Lord Taught Us''; Reverend Horton Heat: ''Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em''; The Misfits: ''Static Age''; Social Distortion: ''Mommy's Little Monster''; ''The Essential Johnny Cash''; Cult of the Psychic Fetus: ''Funeral Home Sessions''; Cult of the Psychic Fetus: ''She Devil''; Demented Are Go: ''Satan's Rejects''; 7 Shot Screamers: ''Keep the Flame Alive''; Nekromantix: ''Curse of the Coffin''; \"Rockabilly Riot!\" compilation; Thee Merry Widows' self-titled EP; Stray Cats: either ''Built For Speed'' or ''Rock This Town''.\n\n===Stage shows===\n[[File:LivingEnd2009.jpg|thumb|[[The Living End]] demonstrate psychobilly stage antics; in this photo, the guitarist is standing on top of the upright bass.|alt=]]<!-- I love the bass rig...not just an 8x10\", but also ANOTHER 2x10\" on top...raw power!! -->\nThe performance style in psychobilly concerts emphasizes high energy and a lot of interactions between the band members and with the audience. The HorrorPops sometimes switch instruments for fun, and Kim Nekroman does stunts such as playing the fingerboard of his Coffinbass with his tongue. Demented are Go are known for their wild stage show, which included simulated on-stage sex with a vacuum cleaner. The Australian band [[Zombie Ghost Train]] were known for appearing on stage in \"zombified\" clothes, featuring rips and bloodstains, and zombie make up, complete with fake stitches across the face.\n[[File:Gibson ES-335 sunburst.jpg|thumb|upright|Psychobilly guitarists often play 1950s-style hollowbody guitars.]]\nThe [[Phenomenauts]] are known for their inventive and fun-filled live shows, which often include smoke machines, the Streamerator 2000, and various on-stage theatrics. [[Big John Bates]] was banned in one venue due to concerns about their overly risque stage antics. [[Deadbolt (band)|Deadbolt]] is known for its use of power tools during their live sets, and it is customary for the audience to be showered with sparks of red-hot metal during their live shows. [[King Kurt]], a 1980s band, was known for its infamous \"food fight\" gigs, in which eggs and bags of flour were thrown around on and off stage and audience members were given free haircuts. \"King Kurt had a bad reputation for doing things that would make people question the band's stability. These included going on stage in dresses, dressed as Zulus, and playing drinking games on stage. Tabloids often accused them of mixing drugs ...into whatever they made people drink on stage, tossing dead animals into the crowds, and rampant sex occurring as they played.\"<ref name=\"furious.com\"/>\n\n\"At any psychobilly show, you might see some dancing\u2026 only, it's not your average dancing. That would be what's called [[moshing|\"wrecking\"]]. According to wreckingpit.com, wrecking is more like a demented hybrid of \"[[slam-dancing]] and freestyle wrestling\".

Original psychobilly act [[The Meteors]] articulated a very [[politics|apolitical]] stance to the scene, a reaction to the right- and left-wing political attitudes dividing British youth cultures of the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=\"Downey, 77\"/> This attitude has carried through later generations of psychobilly. [[Nekromantix]] frontman [[Kim Nekroman]] describes: \"We are all different people and have different political views. Psychobilly is all about having fun. Politics is not fun and therefore has nothing to do with psychobilly!\"<ref name=\"Downey, 78\"/>\nNate Katz explains the rationale for psychobilly's apolitical stance as follows:<ref name=\"furious.com\"/>\n<blockquote>\n1980 was an important year for Britain. Recently elected [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s policies led to a drastic decline in employment, especially among the blue collared and youth (Kim, 2005). A year later, there were five [[race riot]]s within the London area... On a political level, London was incredibly tense. Fans of psychobilly (known as psychos) wanted none of this, or at the very least a break from the stress created by the political world. By establishing an unwritten rule that the music was to be [[apolitical]], psychobilly music became a method of escape from the real world.</blockquote>\n\nKatz notes that at the \"same time [in the 1980s], the revival of the B-movie, particularly the return of horror movies, occurred...[,] such as ''The Howling'', ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', a remake of ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', and ''An American Werewolf in London'' (All 80s Movies). Psychos gravitated towards these movies due to their lack of seriousness, mindless gore, and enjoyed the throwback to the original [[B-movies]] of the 1950s.\"<ref name=\"furious.com\"/>\n\n==Fashion and subculture==\n[[File:Nekromantix 2011-08-13 06.jpg|thumb|right|The Nekromantix, shown here in a 2011 show, illustrate several aspects of psychobilly fashion, including shaved heads, pompadour hairstyles, and prominent tattoos.]]\n\nAccording to Nate Katz, \"in its early days, Psychobilly relied almost entirely on word of mouth to be spread throughout London... If your friends did not know of it [a band or gig], the odds were that you did not either.\"<ref name=\"furious.com\"/> The then manager of [[The Meteors]], Nick Garrard, produced a magazine called 'Cat Talk' which was heavy on Meteors content & their new style of Psychobilly music. One of the band's original fans (Proff) produced gig flyers with a heavy horror/Frankenstein theme. Roy Williams of [[Nervous Records]] created a newsletter that would be passed around known as 'Zorch News', which allowed fans to keep up with psychobilly news that specifically related to bands involved with Nervous Records.<ref name=\"furious.com\"/> \"Despite being starved of the oxygen of mainstream music press attention for more than 25 years, psychobilly has thrived in the underground[,] building a network of fiercely loyal followers and producing a huge number of bands who each peddle their own brand of the genre.\"<ref name=\"amazon.com\"/> [[Fanzine]]s are one of the ways the psychobilly scene created a social network, with ''Deathrow'' being the \"...only long running psychobilly fanzine.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1282427.Deathrow |title=Deathrow: The Chronicles of Psychobilly: The Very Best of Britain's Essential Psycho Fanzine Issues 1-38 |first=Alan |last=Wilson |date=October 1, 2006 |publisher=Cherry Red Books |location=London |isbn=978-1-90144-755-2 |via=[[Goodreads.com]] |accessdate=September 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815184726/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1282427.Deathrow |archivedate=August 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPsychobilly musicians and fans, who are sometimes called \"psychos\" or just \"Psychobillies,\" often dress in styles that borrow from 1950s [[rockabilly]] and [[rock and roll]], as well as 1970s [[punk fashion]]s. Long \"Old Mans\" overcoats, army trousers, bleached jeans & Dr Martin Boots were all part of the early \"Psycho\" uniform along with band logo T-shirts. Heavily painted & studded leather jackets were also worn. This was topped off by a 1950s style quiff or flat-top, often bleached with shaved back & sides. Psychobilly band members of both sexes often have prominent [[tattoo]]s, often with a vintage theme.<ref name=\"Downey, 77\"/> Psychobilly \"tattoos followed the same general notions as band designs, being highly influenced by the same movies.

Schabacker published several books which continued the work of [[Charles Dow]] and [[William Peter Hamilton]] in their books ''Stock Market Theory and Practice'' and ''Technical Market Analysis''.  In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends'' which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline.  It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of [[point and figure chart]] analysis.  With the emergence of behavioural finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioural finance and coined the term \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\".<ref> Paul V. Azzopardi, \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\", ibid</ref>\n\n[[Dow theory]] is based on the collected writings of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the use and development of modern technical analysis at the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis techniques include [[Ralph Nelson Elliott]], [[William Delbert Gann]] and [[Richard Wyckoff]] who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century. More technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing emphasis on computer-assisted techniques using specially designed computer software.\n\n==General description==\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratio, new products, research and the like.

These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the [[moving average]], [[relative strength index]], and [[MACD]]. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options ([[implied volatility]]) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; [[Harmonics]]; [[Dow theory]]; and [[Elliott wave theory]]) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.\n\nContrasting with technical analysis is ''[[fundamental analysis]]'', the study of [[economic]] factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering the trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part II: \"Mass Psychology\"; Chapter 17: \"Managing versus Forecasting\", pp. 65\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nTechnical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the [[relative strength index]], [[moving average]]s, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, [[business cycle]]s, [[stock market cycles]] or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.\n\nTechnical analysis stands in contrast to the [[fundamental analysis]] approach to security and stock analysis. In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple).  Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell.  Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]] won't.  Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the facts of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institutions will typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics.  In a recent review, Irwin and Park<ref name=SurveysReview/> reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as [[data snooping]], so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Paulos2003>{{cite book | author = Paulos, J.A. | year = 2003 | title = A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market | url = https://archive.org/details/mathematicianpla00paul | url-access = registration | publisher = Basic Books | isbn =  }}</ref> Academics such as [[Eugene Fama]] say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the ''[[Efficient-market hypothesis#Weak-form efficiency|weak form]]'' of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].<ref>Fama, Eugene (May 1970).\n\n[http://www.e-m-h.org/Fama70.pdf  \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,\"] ''The Journal of Finance'', v. 25 (2), pp. 383-417.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Griffioen, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=566882 Technical Analysis in Financial Markets]''</ref> Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to identify trends, tendencies, and trading opportunities.<ref>[[Jack D.

A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity's trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors.  Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.<ref>Elder (2008), Chapter 1 - section \"Trend vs Counter-Trending Trading\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ownthedollar.com/2009/12/beware-stock-market-selffulfilling-prophecy/|title=Beware of the Stock Market as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Market action discounts everything===\nBased on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.\n\n===Prices move in trends===\n{{See also|Market trend}}\nTechnical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by [[Dow theory]].<ref name= Murphy/>\n\nAn example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the \"zig-zag\" movement in the price. The series of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows\" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Michael N. (2006). ''Technical Analysis Plain and Simple: Charting the Markets in Your Language'', Financial Times Press, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-13-134597-4}}.</ref> In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.\n\nNote that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.\n\n===History tends to repeat itself===\nTechnical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart.<ref name= Murphy/> Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher [[probability]] of success.<ref name=Baiynd2011>{{cite book |author=Baiynd, Anne-Marie |title=The Trading Book: A Complete Solution to Mastering Technical Systems and Trading Psychology |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780071766494 |pages=272 |year=2011 |url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |access-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050543/http://mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |archive-date=2012-03-25 |df= |author-link=Anne-Marie Baiynd }}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends.<ref name=\"Kirkpatrick_3\"/> For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are [[bearish]] or [[bullish]]. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment.<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=87}}</ref> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors ''are'' bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of [[contrarian investing|contrarian trading]].<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=86}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations. In the United States, the industry is represented by both the CMT Association and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (AAPTA). The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis. In Canada the industry is represented by the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts.<ref>''Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians'', p. 7</ref> In Australia, the industry is represented by the Australian Technical Analysts Association (ATAA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataa.com.au|title=Home - Australian Technical Analysts Association|publisher=}}</ref> (which is affiliated to IFTA) and the Australian Professional Technical Analysts (APTA) Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.apta.org.au | title=Home}}</ref>\n\nProfessional technical analysis societies have worked on creating a body of knowledge that describes the field of Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The [[CMT Association]] has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMT Association Knowledge Base |url=https://cmtassociation.org/development/knowledge-base/ }}</ref>\n\n===Software===\nTechnical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of [[financial market]]s (e.g. the [[stock market]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Systematic trading==\n\n===Neural networks===\nSince the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are [[artificial intelligence]] adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal [[Function approximation|function approximators]],<ref>K. Funahashi, On the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks, Neural Networks vol 2, 1989</ref><ref>K. Hornik, Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, vol 2, 1989</ref> meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to [[fundamental analysis]], as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.\n\nAs ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.<ref>R.

However, large-scale application is problematic because of the problem of matching the correct neural topology to the market being studied.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Backtesting===\nSystematic trading is most often employed after testing an investment strategy on historic data. This is known as backtesting. Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators, but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.\n\nThe use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation,<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|pp=54, 116\u2013118}}</ref> and are unsuitable for computer processing.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993}}</ref> Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.\n\n==Combination with other market forecast methods==\n[[John Murphy (technical analyst)|John Murphy]] states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and [[open interest]].<ref name=Murphy/> Other data, such as indicators and [[sentiment analysis]], are considered secondary.\n\nHowever, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is [[John Bollinger]], who coined the term ''rational analysis'' in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/450723/the_capital_growth_letter.htm|title=The Capital Growth Letter - Research and Markets|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|publisher=}}</ref> Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.\n\nTechnical analysis is also often combined with [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] and [[economics]]. For example, neural networks may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.<ref>http://www.iijournals.com/JOT/default.asp?Page=2&ISS=22278&SID=644085</ref>\n\nInvestor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|title=SFO|publisher=|access-date=2007-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006150127/http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Empirical evidence==\nWhether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy.

In his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton economist [[Burton Malkiel]] said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: \"The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.\"<ref>Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, W. W. Norton & Company (April 2003) p. 168.</ref>  Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits. Malkiel has compared technical analysis to \"[[astrology]]\".<ref name=huebscher>Robert Huebscher.

July 7, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, professors Andrew Lo and Craig McKinlay published a paper which cast doubt on the random walk hypothesis. In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis' applicability<ref>Lo, Andrew; MacKinlay, Craig. ''A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05774-3}}</ref> that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH. In a 2000 paper, [[Andrew Lo]] back-analyzed data from the U.S. from 1962 to 1996 and found that \"several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value\".<ref name=Foundations/>  Burton Malkiel dismissed the irregularities mentioned by Lo and McKinlay as being too small to profit from.<ref name=huebscher/>\n\nTechnicians say{{who|date=March 2011}} that the EMH and random walk theories both ignore the realities of markets, in that participants are not completely rational and that current price moves are not independent of previous moves.<ref name=Kahn/><ref>Poser, Steven W.

The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down).  The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|title=AsiaPacFinance.com Trading Indicator Glossary|publisher=|access-date=2011-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901022339/http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|archive-date=2011-09-01|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nApplying Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory<ref>[[Prospect theory]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} to price movements, Paul V. Azzopardi<ref>Azzopardi, Paul V. (2012), \"Why Financial Markets Rise Slowly but Fall Sharply: Analysing market behaviour with behavioural finance\", Harriman House, ASIN: B00B0Y6JIC </ref> provided a possible explanation why fear makes prices fall sharply while greed pushes up prices gradually.  This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk.  By gauging greed and fear in the market<ref>https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/</ref>, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.\n\n==Scientific technical analysis==\n\nCaginalp and Balenovich in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Gunduz Caginalp & Donald Balenovich |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation for technical analysis |journal=Journal of Technical Analysis |volume=59 |pages=5\u201322 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/TechAn90.pdf}}</ref> used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are that the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.\n\nJapanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent<ref>G. Caginalp and H. Laurent, \"The Predictive Power of Price Patterns.\" Applied Mathematical Finance, Vol. 5, pp. 181-206, 1998.</ref> were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short-term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992\u20131996.\n\nAmong the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue.  However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk.  One study, performed by Poterba and Summers,<ref>J.M. Poterba and L.H. Summers, \"Mean reversion in stock prices: Evidence and Implications,\" Journal of Financial Economics 22, 27-59, 1988.</ref> found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value.  As Fisher Black\nnoted,<ref>Black, F. 1986. Noise. Journal of Finance 41:529-43.</ref> \"noise\" in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.\n\nOne method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine<ref>G. Caginalp and G. Constantine, \"Statistical inference and modeling of momentum in stock prices,\" Applied Mathematical Finance 2, 225-242, 1995.</ref> who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow's price is not yesterday's price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.\n\nStarting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties.<ref>J. V. Andersen, S. Gluzman and D. Sornette, Fundamental Framework for Technical Analysis, European Physical Journal B 14, 579-601 (2000)</ref> The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the [[Froude number]] characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a [[renormalisation group]] approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically signifificant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.\n\nA survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin<ref>C-H Park and S.H. Irwin, \"The Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\" AgMAS Project Research Report No. 2004-04</ref> showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.\n\nIn 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis<ref>G. Caginalp and M. DeSantis, \"Nonlinearity in the dynamics of financial markets,\" Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 12(2), 1140-1151, 2011.</ref> have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the \"buying on dips\" does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.\n\nIn 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.<ref>K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, \"Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence\" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Ticker-tape reading==\n\n{{Main|Ticker tape}}\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, '''tape reading''' was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a [[stock ticker]]. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60's, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.\n\n[[Jesse Livermore]], one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the 'market key'), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book 'How to Trade in Stocks'.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940}}</ref> Livermore's system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data. He also made use of volume data (which he estimated from how stocks behaved and via 'market testing', a process of testing market liquidity via sending in small market orders), as described in his 1940s book.\n\n== Quotation board ==\n\nAnother form of technical analysis used so far was via interpretation of [[Stock market data systems|stock market data]] contained in quotation boards, that in the times before [[electronic visual display|electronic screens]], were huge [[blackboard|chalkboards]] located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements.<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|pp=1, 18}}</ref> It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as [[Brokerage firm|brokerage houses]], [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]], etc.) via the aforementioned tape, [[telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephone]] and later [[telex]].<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThis analysis tool was used both, on the spot, mainly by market professionals for [[day trading]] and [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]], as well as by general public through the printed versions in newspapers showing the data of the negotiations of the previous day, for [[Swing trading|swing]] and [[Trend following|position trades]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940|pp=17-18}}</ref>\n\n==Charting terms and indicators==\n\n===Concepts===\n* [[Average true range]]{{spaced ndash}}averaged daily trading range, adjusted for price gaps.\n* [[Breakout (technical analysis)|Breakout]]{{spaced ndash}}the concept whereby prices forcefully penetrate an area of prior [[Support (technical analysis)|support]] or [[Resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]], usually, but not always, accompanied by an increase in volume.\n* [[Chart pattern]]{{spaced ndash}}distinctive pattern created by the movement of security or commodity prices on a chart\n* [[Stock market cycles|Cycles]]{{spaced ndash}}time targets for potential change in price action (price only moves up, down, or sideways)\n* [[Dead cat bounce]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon whereby a spectacular decline in the price of a stock is immediately followed by a moderate and temporary rise before resuming its downward movement\n* [[Elliott wave principle]] and the [[golden ratio]] to calculate successive price movements and retracements\n* [[Fibonacci ratio]]s{{spaced ndash}}used as a guide to determine support and resistance\n* [[Momentum (technical analysis)|Momentum]]{{spaced ndash}}the rate of price change\n* [[Point and figure chart|Point and figure analysis]]{{spaced ndash}}A priced-based analytical approach employing numerical filters which may incorporate time references, though ignores time entirely in its construction\n* [[Resistance (technical analysis)|Resistance]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of selling activity\n* [[Support (technical analysis)|Support]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of buying activity\n* [[Market trend|Trending]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon by which price movement tends to persist in one direction for an extended period of time\n\n===Types of charts===\n* [[Candlestick chart]]{{spaced ndash}}Of Japanese origin and similar to OHLC, candlesticks widen and fill the interval between the open and close prices to emphasize the open/close relationship.

Schabacker published several books which continued the work of [[Charles Dow]] and [[William Peter Hamilton]] in their books ''Stock Market Theory and Practice'' and ''Technical Market Analysis''.  In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends'' which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline.  It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of [[point and figure chart]] analysis.  With the emergence of behavioural finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioural finance and coined the term \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\".<ref> Paul V. Azzopardi, \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\", ibid</ref>\n\n[[Dow theory]] is based on the collected writings of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the use and development of modern technical analysis at the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis techniques include [[Ralph Nelson Elliott]], [[William Delbert Gann]] and [[Richard Wyckoff]] who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century. More technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing emphasis on computer-assisted techniques using specially designed computer software.\n\n==General description==\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratio, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts.  Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns and [[market trend]]s in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, John J.

These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the [[moving average]], [[relative strength index]], and [[MACD]]. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options ([[implied volatility]]) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; [[Harmonics]]; [[Dow theory]]; and [[Elliott wave theory]]) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.\n\nContrasting with technical analysis is ''[[fundamental analysis]]'', the study of [[economic]] factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering the trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part II: \"Mass Psychology\"; Chapter 17: \"Managing versus Forecasting\", pp. 65\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nTechnical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the [[relative strength index]], [[moving average]]s, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, [[business cycle]]s, [[stock market cycles]] or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.\n\nTechnical analysis stands in contrast to the [[fundamental analysis]] approach to security and stock analysis. In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple).  Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell.  Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]] won't.  Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the facts of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institutions will typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics.  In a recent review, Irwin and Park<ref name=SurveysReview/> reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as [[data snooping]], so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Paulos2003>{{cite book | author = Paulos, J.A. | year = 2003 | title = A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market | url = https://archive.org/details/mathematicianpla00paul | url-access = registration | publisher = Basic Books | isbn =  }}</ref> Academics such as [[Eugene Fama]] say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the ''[[Efficient-market hypothesis#Weak-form efficiency|weak form]]'' of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].<ref>Fama, Eugene (May 1970).\n\n[http://www.e-m-h.org/Fama70.pdf  \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,\"] ''The Journal of Finance'', v. 25 (2), pp. 383-417.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Griffioen, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=566882 Technical Analysis in Financial Markets]''</ref> Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to identify trends, tendencies, and trading opportunities.<ref>[[Jack D.

A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity's trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors.  Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.<ref>Elder (2008), Chapter 1 - section \"Trend vs Counter-Trending Trading\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ownthedollar.com/2009/12/beware-stock-market-selffulfilling-prophecy/|title=Beware of the Stock Market as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Market action discounts everything===\nBased on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.\n\n===Prices move in trends===\n{{See also|Market trend}}\nTechnical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by [[Dow theory]].<ref name= Murphy/>\n\nAn example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the \"zig-zag\" movement in the price. The series of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows\" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Michael N. (2006). ''Technical Analysis Plain and Simple: Charting the Markets in Your Language'', Financial Times Press, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-13-134597-4}}.</ref> In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.\n\nNote that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.\n\n===History tends to repeat itself===\nTechnical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart.<ref name= Murphy/> Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher [[probability]] of success.<ref name=Baiynd2011>{{cite book |author=Baiynd, Anne-Marie |title=The Trading Book: A Complete Solution to Mastering Technical Systems and Trading Psychology |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780071766494 |pages=272 |year=2011 |url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |access-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050543/http://mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |archive-date=2012-03-25 |df= |author-link=Anne-Marie Baiynd }}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends.<ref name=\"Kirkpatrick_3\"/> For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are [[bearish]] or [[bullish]]. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment.<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=87}}</ref> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors ''are'' bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of [[contrarian investing|contrarian trading]].<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=86}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations. In the United States, the industry is represented by both the CMT Association and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (AAPTA). The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis. In Canada the industry is represented by the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts.<ref>''Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians'', p. 7</ref> In Australia, the industry is represented by the Australian Technical Analysts Association (ATAA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataa.com.au|title=Home - Australian Technical Analysts Association|publisher=}}</ref> (which is affiliated to IFTA) and the Australian Professional Technical Analysts (APTA) Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.apta.org.au | title=Home}}</ref>\n\nProfessional technical analysis societies have worked on creating a body of knowledge that describes the field of Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The [[CMT Association]] has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMT Association Knowledge Base |url=https://cmtassociation.org/development/knowledge-base/ }}</ref>\n\n===Software===\nTechnical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of [[financial market]]s (e.g. the [[stock market]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Systematic trading==\n\n===Neural networks===\nSince the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are [[artificial intelligence]] adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal [[Function approximation|function approximators]],<ref>K. Funahashi, On the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks, Neural Networks vol 2, 1989</ref><ref>K. Hornik, Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, vol 2, 1989</ref> meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to [[fundamental analysis]], as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.\n\nAs ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.<ref>R.

However, large-scale application is problematic because of the problem of matching the correct neural topology to the market being studied.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Backtesting===\nSystematic trading is most often employed after testing an investment strategy on historic data. This is known as backtesting. Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators, but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.\n\nThe use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation,<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|pp=54, 116\u2013118}}</ref> and are unsuitable for computer processing.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993}}</ref> Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.\n\n==Combination with other market forecast methods==\n[[John Murphy (technical analyst)|John Murphy]] states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and [[open interest]].<ref name=Murphy/> Other data, such as indicators and [[sentiment analysis]], are considered secondary.\n\nHowever, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is [[John Bollinger]], who coined the term ''rational analysis'' in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/450723/the_capital_growth_letter.htm|title=The Capital Growth Letter - Research and Markets|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|publisher=}}</ref> Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.\n\nTechnical analysis is also often combined with [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] and [[economics]]. For example, neural networks may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.<ref>http://www.iijournals.com/JOT/default.asp?Page=2&ISS=22278&SID=644085</ref>\n\nInvestor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|title=SFO|publisher=|access-date=2007-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006150127/http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Empirical evidence==\nWhether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy.

In his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton economist [[Burton Malkiel]] said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: \"The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.\"<ref>Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, W. W. Norton & Company (April 2003) p. 168.</ref>  Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits. Malkiel has compared technical analysis to \"[[astrology]]\".<ref name=huebscher>Robert Huebscher.

July 7, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, professors Andrew Lo and Craig McKinlay published a paper which cast doubt on the random walk hypothesis. In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis' applicability<ref>Lo, Andrew; MacKinlay, Craig. ''A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05774-3}}</ref> that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH. In a 2000 paper, [[Andrew Lo]] back-analyzed data from the U.S. from 1962 to 1996 and found that \"several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value\".<ref name=Foundations/>  Burton Malkiel dismissed the irregularities mentioned by Lo and McKinlay as being too small to profit from.<ref name=huebscher/>\n\nTechnicians say{{who|date=March 2011}} that the EMH and random walk theories both ignore the realities of markets, in that participants are not completely rational and that current price moves are not independent of previous moves.<ref name=Kahn/><ref>Poser, Steven W.

''Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably'', John Wiley and Sons, p. 71. {{ISBN|0-471-42007-7}}.</ref> Some signal processing researchers negate the random walk hypothesis that stock market prices resemble [[Wiener process]]es, because the statistical moments of such processes and real stock data vary significantly with respect to window size and [[similarity measure]].<ref>Eidenberger, Horst (2011). \"Fundamental Media Understanding\" Atpress. {{ISBN|978-3-8423-7917-6}}.</ref> They argue that feature transformations used for the description of audio and [[biosignal]]s can also be used to predict stock market prices successfully which would contradict the random walk hypothesis.\n\nThe random walk index (RWI) is a technical indicator that attempts to determine if a stock's price movement is random in nature or a result of a statistically significant trend.  The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down).  The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|title=AsiaPacFinance.com Trading Indicator Glossary|publisher=|access-date=2011-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901022339/http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|archive-date=2011-09-01|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nApplying Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory<ref>[[Prospect theory]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} to price movements, Paul V. Azzopardi<ref>Azzopardi, Paul V. (2012), \"Why Financial Markets Rise Slowly but Fall Sharply: Analysing market behaviour with behavioural finance\", Harriman House, ASIN: B00B0Y6JIC </ref> provided a possible explanation why fear makes prices fall sharply while greed pushes up prices gradually.  This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk.  By gauging greed and fear in the market<ref>https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/</ref>, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.\n\n==Scientific technical analysis==\n\nCaginalp and Balenovich in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Gunduz Caginalp & Donald Balenovich |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation for technical analysis |journal=Journal of Technical Analysis |volume=59 |pages=5\u201322 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/TechAn90.pdf}}</ref> used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are that the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.\n\nJapanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent<ref>G. Caginalp and H. Laurent, \"The Predictive Power of Price Patterns.\" Applied Mathematical Finance, Vol. 5, pp. 181-206, 1998.</ref> were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short-term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992\u20131996.\n\nAmong the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue.  However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk.  One study, performed by Poterba and Summers,<ref>J.M. Poterba and L.H. Summers, \"Mean reversion in stock prices: Evidence and Implications,\" Journal of Financial Economics 22, 27-59, 1988.</ref> found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value.  As Fisher Black\nnoted,<ref>Black, F. 1986. Noise. Journal of Finance 41:529-43.</ref> \"noise\" in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.\n\nOne method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine<ref>G. Caginalp and G. Constantine, \"Statistical inference and modeling of momentum in stock prices,\" Applied Mathematical Finance 2, 225-242, 1995.</ref> who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow's price is not yesterday's price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.\n\nStarting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties.<ref>J. V. Andersen, S. Gluzman and D. Sornette, Fundamental Framework for Technical Analysis, European Physical Journal B 14, 579-601 (2000)</ref> The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the [[Froude number]] characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a [[renormalisation group]] approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically signifificant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.\n\nA survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin<ref>C-H Park and S.H. Irwin, \"The Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\" AgMAS Project Research Report No. 2004-04</ref> showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.\n\nIn 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis<ref>G. Caginalp and M. DeSantis, \"Nonlinearity in the dynamics of financial markets,\" Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 12(2), 1140-1151, 2011.</ref> have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the \"buying on dips\" does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.\n\nIn 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.<ref>K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, \"Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence\" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Ticker-tape reading==\n\n{{Main|Ticker tape}}\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, '''tape reading''' was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a [[stock ticker]]. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60's, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.\n\n[[Jesse Livermore]], one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the 'market key'), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book 'How to Trade in Stocks'.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940}}</ref> Livermore's system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data. He also made use of volume data (which he estimated from how stocks behaved and via 'market testing', a process of testing market liquidity via sending in small market orders), as described in his 1940s book.\n\n== Quotation board ==\n\nAnother form of technical analysis used so far was via interpretation of [[Stock market data systems|stock market data]] contained in quotation boards, that in the times before [[electronic visual display|electronic screens]], were huge [[blackboard|chalkboards]] located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements.<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|pp=1, 18}}</ref> It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as [[Brokerage firm|brokerage houses]], [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]], etc.) via the aforementioned tape, [[telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephone]] and later [[telex]].<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThis analysis tool was used both, on the spot, mainly by market professionals for [[day trading]] and [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]], as well as by general public through the printed versions in newspapers showing the data of the negotiations of the previous day, for [[Swing trading|swing]] and [[Trend following|position trades]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940|pp=17-18}}</ref>\n\n==Charting terms and indicators==\n\n===Concepts===\n* [[Average true range]]{{spaced ndash}}averaged daily trading range, adjusted for price gaps.\n* [[Breakout (technical analysis)|Breakout]]{{spaced ndash}}the concept whereby prices forcefully penetrate an area of prior [[Support (technical analysis)|support]] or [[Resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]], usually, but not always, accompanied by an increase in volume.\n* [[Chart pattern]]{{spaced ndash}}distinctive pattern created by the movement of security or commodity prices on a chart\n* [[Stock market cycles|Cycles]]{{spaced ndash}}time targets for potential change in price action (price only moves up, down, or sideways)\n* [[Dead cat bounce]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon whereby a spectacular decline in the price of a stock is immediately followed by a moderate and temporary rise before resuming its downward movement\n* [[Elliott wave principle]] and the [[golden ratio]] to calculate successive price movements and retracements\n* [[Fibonacci ratio]]s{{spaced ndash}}used as a guide to determine support and resistance\n* [[Momentum (technical analysis)|Momentum]]{{spaced ndash}}the rate of price change\n* [[Point and figure chart|Point and figure analysis]]{{spaced ndash}}A priced-based analytical approach employing numerical filters which may incorporate time references, though ignores time entirely in its construction\n* [[Resistance (technical analysis)|Resistance]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of selling activity\n* [[Support (technical analysis)|Support]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of buying activity\n* [[Market trend|Trending]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon by which price movement tends to persist in one direction for an extended period of time\n\n===Types of charts===\n* [[Candlestick chart]]{{spaced ndash}}Of Japanese origin and similar to OHLC, candlesticks widen and fill the interval between the open and close prices to emphasize the open/close relationship.
