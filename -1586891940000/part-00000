His satirical reporting on the [[Scopes Trial]], which he dubbed the \"Monkey Trial,\" also gained him attention.\n\nAs a scholar, Mencken is known for ''[[The American Language]]'', a multi-volume study of how the English language is spoken in the United States. As an admirer of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], he was an outspoken opponent of [[organized religion]], [[theism]], [[populism]], and [[representative democracy]], the latter of which he viewed as systems in which inferior men dominated their superiors.<ref name=\"Democracy\"/> Mencken was a supporter of scientific progress, and was critical of [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]]. He was also an ardent critic of economics.\n\nMencken opposed the American entry into both [[American entry into World War I|World War I]] and [[Military history of the United States during World War II|World War II]].

He was the son of Anna Margaret (Abhau) and [[August Mencken Sr.]], a cigar factory owner.

Apart from five years of married life, Mencken was to live in that house for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.menckenhouse.org/about/about_house.htm |title=Detailed description |publisher=Mencken's home |place=Baltimore |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027092318/http://www.menckenhouse.org/about/about_house.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2005 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn his best-selling memoir ''[[Happy Days, 1880\u20131892|Happy Days]]'', he described his childhood in Baltimore as \"placid, secure, uneventful and happy.\"<ref>''Happy Days'', p. vii</ref>\n\nWhen he was nine years old, he read [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'', which he later described as \"the most stupendous event in my life.\"<ref>St. Petersburg Times&nbsp;\u2013 September 23, 1987</ref> He became determined to become a writer and read voraciously. In one winter while in high school he read [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and then \"proceeded backward to [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Richard Steele|Steele]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]] and the other magnificos of the Eighteenth century.\" He read the entire canon of [[Shakespeare]] and became an ardent fan of [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Thomas Huxley]].{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | pp = 90\u201393}} As a boy, Mencken also had practical interests, photography and chemistry in particular, and eventually had a home chemistry laboratory in which he performed experiments of his own devising, some of them inadvertently dangerous.<ref>''Newspaper Days, 1899\u20131906'', p. 58.</ref>\n\nHe began his primary education in the mid-1880s at Professor Knapp's School on the east side of Holliday Street between East Lexington and Fayette Streets, next to the [[Holliday Street Theatre]] and across from the newly constructed [[Baltimore City Hall]]. The site today is the [[War Memorial Plaza|War Memorial and City Hall Plaza]] laid out in 1926 in memory of World War I dead. At 15, in June 1896, he graduated as valedictorian from the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]], at the time a males-only mathematics, technical and science-oriented public high school.\n\nHe worked for three years in his father's cigar factory. He disliked the work, especially the sales aspect of it, and resolved to leave, with or without his father's blessing. In early 1898 he took a writing class at the Cosmopolitan University.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | p = 93}} This was to be the entirety of Mencken's formal education in journalism, or in any other subject. Upon his father's death a few days after Christmas in the same year, the business passed to his uncle, and Mencken was free to pursue his career in journalism. He applied in February 1899 to the ''Morning Herald'' newspaper (which became the ''[[Baltimore Morning Herald]]'' in 1900) and was hired part-time, but still kept his position at the factory for a few months. In June he was hired as a full-time reporter.\n\n==Career==\nMencken served as a reporter at the ''Herald'' for six years. Less than two-and-a-half years after the [[Great Baltimore Fire]], the paper was purchased in June 1906 by [[Charles H. Grasty]], the owner and editor of ''[[Baltimore News-American|The News]]'' since 1892, and competing owner and publisher Gen. [[Felix Agnus]], of the town's oldest (since 1773) and largest daily, ''[[Baltimore News-American|The Baltimore American]].'' They proceeded to divide the staff, assets and resources of ''The Herald'' between them. Mencken then moved to ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', where he worked for Charles H. Grasty. He continued to contribute to ''The Sun,'' ''The Evening Sun'' (founded 1910) and ''The Sunday Sun'' full-time until 1948, when he stopped writing after suffering a [[stroke]].\n\nMencken began writing the editorials and opinion pieces that made his name at ''The Sun.'' On the side, he wrote short stories, a novel, and even poetry, which he later revealed. In 1908, he became a literary critic for ''[[The Smart Set]]'' magazine, and in 1924 he and [[George Jean Nathan]] founded and edited ''[[The American Mercury]]'', published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. It soon developed a national circulation and became highly influential on college campuses across America. In 1933, Mencken resigned as editor.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:Sara Haardt.jpg|thumb|right|Sara (Haardt) Mencken]]\nIn 1930, Mencken married [[Sara Haardt]], a [[German-American]] professor of English at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior. Haardt had led an unsuccessful effort in [[Alabama]] to ratify the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.al.com/south/literary3.html |type=short biographical sketch |publisher=AL |title=Sara Haardt}}</ref><ref>Alabama rejected the Nineteenth Amendment on September 22, 1919, though it later ratified it as a symbolic gesture on September 8, 1953.</ref> The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued. The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage \"the end of hope\" and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, had gone to the altar. \"The [[Holy Spirit]] informed and inspired me,\" Mencken said. \"Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this one seemed to be a superb one.\"<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.menckenhouse.org/txt/about/about_hlm.htm |title=Mencken |type=bio |publisher=Mencken house}}</ref> Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the [[American South]]. Haardt was in poor health from [[tuberculosis]] throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of [[meningitis]], leaving Mencken grief-stricken.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.al.com/south/literary3.html |title=The Real South: Famous People |publisher=AL |contribution=Literary Figures: Sally Haardt}}</ref> He had always championed her writing and, after her death, had a collection of her short stories published under the title ''Southern Album''.\n\n===Great Depression, war and after===\n[[File:H L Mencken Carl Van Vechten.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Mencken photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1932]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], Mencken did not support the [[New Deal]]. This cost him popularity, as did his strong reservations regarding U.S. participation in [[World War II]], and his overt contempt for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He ceased writing for ''The Baltimore Sun'' for several years, focusing on his memoirs and other projects as editor, while serving as an adviser for the paper that had been his home for nearly his entire career. In 1948, he briefly returned to the political scene, covering the presidential election in which President [[Harry S. Truman]] faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Thomas Dewey]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]]. His later work consisted of humorous, anecdotal, and nostalgic essays, first published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', then collected in the books ''Happy Days'', ''Newspaper Days'', and ''Heathen Days''.\n\n===Last days===\nOn November 23, 1948, Mencken suffered a [[stroke]], which left him aware and fully conscious but nearly unable to read or write and able to speak only with difficulty. After his stroke, Mencken enjoyed listening to [[classical music]] and, after some recovery of his ability to speak, talking with friends, but he sometimes referred to himself in the past tense, as if he were already dead. During the last year of his life, his friend and biographer [[William Manchester]] read to him daily.<ref>{{Citation |last=Filkins |first=Dexter | author-link = Dexter Filkins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/14/arts/14MANC.html |title=Ailing Churchill Biographer Says He Can't Finish Trilogy |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}}.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nMencken died in his sleep on January 29, 1956.<ref>{{cite news |title=HL Mencken, 75, Dies in Baltimore |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F14FF3C58157B93C2AA178AD85F428585F9 |quote=HL Mencken was found dead in bed early today.

After his death, these materials were made available to scholars in stages in 1971, 1981, and 1991, and include hundreds of thousands of letters sent and received; the only omissions were strictly personal letters received from women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Beliefs==\nIn his capacity as editor, Mencken became close friends with the leading literary figures of his time, including [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[F.&nbsp;Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Joseph Hergesheimer]], [[Anita Loos]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[James Branch Cabell]], and [[Alfred A. Knopf Sr.|Alfred Knopf]], as well as a mentor to several young reporters, including [[Alistair Cooke]]. He also championed artists whose works he considered worthy. For example, he asserted that books such as ''Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street'' (1929), by [[Eddie Cantor]] (ghost-written by [[David Freedman]]) did more to pull America out of the [[Great Depression]] than all government measures combined. He also mentored [[John Fante]]. [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] illustrated an edition of Mencken's book ''Europe After 8:15''.\n\nMencken also published many works under various pseudonyms, including [[Owen Hatteras]], John H Brownell, William Drayham, WLD Bell, and [[Charles Angoff]].<ref>{{Citation |first=SL |last=Harrison |title=AKA HL Mencken: Selected Pseudonymous Writings |publisher=Wolf Den Books |year=2005}}</ref> As a ghostwriter for the physician [[Leonard K. Hirshberg]], he wrote a series of articles and (in 1910) most of a book about the care of babies.\n\nMencken admired German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (he was the first writer to provide a scholarly analysis in English of Nietzsche's views and writings) and [[Joseph Conrad]]. His humor and satire owe much to [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Mark Twain]]. He did much to defend Dreiser despite freely admitting his faults, including stating forthrightly that Dreiser often wrote badly and was a gullible man. Mencken also expressed his appreciation for [[William Graham Sumner]] in a 1941 collection of Sumner's essays, and regretted never having known Sumner personally. In contrast, Mencken was scathing in his criticism of the German philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]], whom he described as \"an extremely dull author\" and whose famous book ''Philosophy of 'As If''' he dismissed as an unimportant \"foot-note to all existing systems.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=October 1924 |title=Philosophers as Liars |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=III |number=10 |pages=253\u201355}}</ref>\n\nMencken recommended for publication philosopher and author [[Ayn Rand]]'s first novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', calling it \"a really excellent piece of work.\" Shortly afterward, Rand addressed him in correspondence as \"the greatest representative of a philosophy\" to which she wanted to dedicate her life, \"individualism,\" and later listed him as her favorite columnist.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Berliner | editor-first = Michael |title=Letters |first=Ayn |last=Rand |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |pages=10 (Mencken's opinion of the novel), 13\u201314 (Rand's praise of Mencken)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Inherit333-1.JPG|thumb|Mencken is fictionalized in the play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (a fictionalized version of the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]] of 1925) as the cynical sarcastic atheist E.&nbsp;K.

On the left is Henry Drummond, based on [[Clarence Darrow]] and portrayed by [[Spencer Tracy]].]]\n\nFor Mencken, ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' was the finest work of [[American literature]]. He particularly relished Mark Twain's depiction of a succession of gullible and ignorant townspeople\u2014\"boobs,\" as Mencken referred to them\u2014who are repeatedly gulled by a pair of colorful [[con men]]: the (deliberately) pathetic [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn#The Duke and the Dauphin|\"Duke\" and \"Dauphin]],\" with whom [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck]] and [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]] travel down the [[Mississippi River]].

In the end the townsfolk wise up, and the scoundrels are ridden out on a rail.

Mencken was a keen cheerleader of scientific progress but skeptical of economic theories and strongly opposed to [[osteopathic]]/[[chiropractic]] medicine. He also debunked the idea of objective news reporting since \"truth is a commodity that the masses of undifferentiated men cannot be induced to buy,\" adding a humorous description of how \"Homo Boobus,\" like \"higher mammalia,\" is moved by \"whatever gratifies his prevailing yearnings.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=A gang of pecksniffs: And other comments on newspaper publishers, editors and reporters|last=Mencken|first=H.

The play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' is a fictionalized version of the trial, and, as noted above, the cynical reporter E.K. Hornbeck is based on Mencken. In 1926, he deliberately had himself arrested for selling an issue of ''The American Mercury'' that was [[banned in Boston]] under the [[Comstock laws]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=104 |publisher=Mass Moments |title=HL Mencken Arrested in Boston}}</ref> Mencken heaped scorn not only on the public officials he disliked, but also on the contemporary state of American elective politics itself.\n\nIn the summer of 1926, Mencken followed with great interest the [[Los Angeles]] grand jury inquiry into the famous Canadian-American evangelist [[Aimee Semple McPherson]]. She was accused of faking her reported [[kidnapping]] and the case attracted national attention. There was every expectation Mencken would continue his previous pattern of anti-fundamentalist articles, this time with a searing critique of McPherson. Unexpectedly, he came to her defense, identifying various local religious and civic groups which were using the case as an opportunity to pursue their respective ideological agendas against the embattled [[Pentecostal]] minister.<ref>{{Citation |first=Matthew Avery |last=Sutton |title=Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America |place=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2007 |pages=119\u201320}}</ref> He spent several weeks in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], and wrote many scathing and satirical columns on the movie industry and the southern California culture. After all charges had been dropped against McPherson, Mencken revisited the case in 1930 with a sarcastically biting and observant article. He wrote that since many of that town's residents acquired their ideas \"of the true, the good and the beautiful\" from the movies and newspapers, \"Los Angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |title=The American Mercury |year=1930}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931 the [[Arkansas]] legislature passed a motion to pray for Mencken's soul after he had called the state the \"apex of moronia.\"<ref>''Manchester'', p. 252</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1930s Mencken feared [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal liberalism]] as a powerful force. Mencken, says Charles A. Fecher, was, \"deeply conservative, resentful of change, looking back upon the 'happy days' of a bygone time, wanted no part of the world that the New Deal promised to bring in.\"<ref>{{cite book| editor-first =Charles A | editor-last = Fecher |title=Diary |first=HL |last=Mencken |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMsufJS6uu0C&pg=PT28 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday]] |location=New York City|page=28| isbn = 9780307808868 }}</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===Race and elitism===\nIn addition to his identification of races with castes, Mencken had views about the superior individual within communities. He believed that every community produced a few people of clear superiority. He considered groupings on a par with hierarchies, which led to a kind of natural [[elitism]] and natural [[aristocracy]]. \"Superior\" individuals, in Mencken's view, were those wrongly oppressed and disdained by their own communities, but nevertheless distinguished by their will and personal achievement, not by race or birth.\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?10797-1/diary-hl-mencken ''Booknotes'' interview with Charles Fecher on ''The Diary of H.L. Mencken'', January 28, 1990], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nIn 1989, per his instructions, Alfred A. Knopf published Mencken's \"secret diary\" as ''The Diary of H.&nbsp;L. Mencken''. According to an Associated Press story, Mencken's views shocked even the \"sympathetic scholar who edited it,\" [[Charles A. Fecher]] of Baltimore.<ref name=\"latimes1989\"/> There is a club in Baltimore called the [[Maryland Club]] which had one [[Jewish]] member, and that member died. Mencken said, \"There is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable,\" according to the article. The diary also quoted him as saying of blacks, in September 1943, that \"it is impossible to talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything.\"\n\nMencken opposed [[lynching]]. For example, he had this to say about a Maryland incident:\n\n{{quote|Not a single bigwig came forward in the emergency, though the whole town knew what was afoot. Any one of a score of such bigwigs might have halted the crime, if only by threatening to denounce its perpetrators, but none spoke. So Williams was duly hanged, burned and mutilated.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}}}\n\nMencken also wrote:\n\n{{quote|I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American Negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the Negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated Negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a Negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Robert Rives|last1=La Monte|authorlink1=Robert Rives La Monte|first2=HL|last2=Mencken|title=Men versus the Man: A Correspondence between Robert Rives La Monte, Socialist, and H.

As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence.

That said, Bufe still wrote that some of Mencken's statements were \"odious\", such as his claim in his 1918 introduction to Nietzsche's [[The Antichrist (book)|''The Anti-Christ'']] that \"The case against the Jews is long and damning; it would justify ten thousand times as many [[pogrom]]s as now go on in the world.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |author-link=Friedrich Nietzsche |date=1918 (Mencken) / 1999 (edition w/ Bufe's introduction) |title=The Anti-Christ |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm |location=Tucson, Arizona |publisher=See Sharp Press  |isbn=1-884365-20-5}}  Note: URL goes to Gutenberg version of just Mencken's text, but does not include Chaz Bufe's introduction or slight changes.</ref>\n\nAuthor [[Gore Vidal]] later deflected claims of anti-Semitism against Mencken:\n\n{{quote|Far from being an anti-Semite, Mencken was one of the first journalists to denounce the persecution of the Jews in Germany at a time when ''[[The New York Times]]'', say, was notoriously reticent. On November 27, 1938, Mencken writes (''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''), \"It is to be hoped that the poor Jews now being robbed and mauled in Germany will not take too seriously the plans of various politicians to rescue them.\" He then reviews the various schemes to \"rescue\" the Jews from the Nazis, who had not yet announced their own [[Holocaust|final solution]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Gore|last1=Vidal|authorlink=Gore Vidal|first2=Marion Elizabeth|last2=Rodgers|title=The Impossible H.L.

Why shouldn't the United States take in a couple hundred thousand of them, or even all of them?<ref>Gore Vidal, \"Foreword,\" In H.L. Mencken, ''The Impossible H.L. Mencken'' (New York, NY: Doubleday, 1991) p. xxxi.</ref>}}\n\n===Democracy===\n{{quote|Democracy gives [the beatification of mediocrity] a certain appearance of objective and demonstrable truth. The mob man, functioning as citizen, gets a feeling that he is really important to the world\u2014that he is genuinely running things. Out of his maudlin herding after rogues and [[Charlatan|mountebanks]] there comes to him a sense of vast and mysterious power\u2014which is what makes archbishops, police sergeants, the grand [[goblin]]s of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other such magnificoes happy. And out of it there comes, too, a conviction that he is somehow wise, that his views are taken seriously by his betters\u2014which is what makes United States Senators, fortune tellers and Young Intellectuals happy. Finally, there comes out of it a glowing consciousness of a high duty triumphantly done which is what makes hangmen and husbands happy.}}\n\nThis sentiment is fairly consistent with Mencken's distaste for common notions and the philosophical outlook he unabashedly set down throughout his life as a writer (drawing on Friedrich Nietzsche and [[Herbert Spencer]], among others).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigeye.com/mencken.htm |title=Last Words by H. L. Mencken |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMencken wrote as follows about the difficulties of good men reaching national office when such campaigns must necessarily be conducted remotely:<blockquote>The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even the mob with him by force of his personality. But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second and third hand, and the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre\u2014the man who can most easily adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.\n\nThe Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Bayard vs. Lionheart|work=Baltimore Evening Sun|last=Mencken|first=H. L.|date=July 26, 1920|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Science and mathematics===\nMencken defended the evolutionary views of [[Charles Darwin]] but spoke unfavorably of many prominent physicists and had little regard for pure mathematics. Regarding Charles Angoff, Mencken said:\n\n{{quote|[Isaac Newton] was a mathematician, which is mostly hogwash, too. Imagine measuring infinity! That's a laugh.<ref name=\"Angoff, Charles 1961 pp. 141\">Angoff, Charles. ''H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory''. A. S. Barnes (New York, 1961), p. 141</ref>}}\n\nIn response, Angoff said: \"Well, without mathematics there wouldn't be any engineering, no chemistry, no physics.\" Mencken responded: \"That's true, but it's reasonable mathematics. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, division, that's what real mathematics is. The rest is baloney. Astrology. Religion. All of our sciences still suffer from their former attachment to religion, and that is why there is so much metaphysics and astrology, the two are the same, in science.\"<ref name=\"Angoff, Charles 1961 pp. 141\"/>\n\nElsewhere, he spoke of the nonsense of higher mathematics and \"probability\" theory, after he read Angoff's article for [[Charles S. Peirce]] in the ''American Mercury''. \"So you believe in that garbage, too\u2014theories of knowledge, infinity, laws of probability. I can make no sense of it, and I don't believe you can either, and I don't think your god Peirce knew what he was talking about.\"<ref>Angoff, Charles. ''H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory''. A. S. Barnes (New York, 1961), p. 194</ref>\n\nMencken also repeated these opinions multiple times in articles for the ''American Mercury''. He said mathematics is simply a fiction, compared with individual facts that make up science. In a review for Vaihinger's ''The Philosophy of \"As If'',\" he said:\n\n{{quote|The human mind, at its present stage of development, cannot function without the aid of fictions, but neither can it function without the aid of facts\u2014save, perhaps, when it is housed in the skull of a university professor of philosophy. Of the two, the facts are enormously the more important. In certain metaphysical fields, e.g. those of mathematics, law, theology, osteopathy and ethics\u2014the fiction will probably hold out for many years, but elsewhere the fact slowly ousts it, and that ousting is what is called intellectual progress. Very few fictions remain in use in anatomy, or in plumbing and gas-fitting; they have even begun to disappear from economics.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=October 1924 |title=Philosophers as Liars |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=III |number=10 |pages=253\u201355 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1924oct-00253}}</ref>}}\n\nMencken repeatedly identified mathematics with metaphysics and theology. According to Mencken, mathematics is necessarily infected with metaphysics because of the tendency of many mathematical people to engage in metaphysical speculation. In a review for A. N. Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education'', Mencken remarked that despite his agreement with Whitehead's thesis and approval of his writing style, \"now and then he falls into mathematical jargon and pollutes his discourse with equations,\" and \"[t]here are moments when he seems to be following some of his mathematical colleagues into the gaudy metaphysics which now entertains them.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=June 1929 |title=What Is It All About? |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XVII |number=66 |pages=251\u201352 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1929jun-00251}}</ref> For Mencken, theology is characterized by the fact that it uses correct reasoning from false premises. Mencken also uses the term \"theology\" more generally, to refer to the use of logic in science or any other field of knowledge. In a review for both A. S. Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and Joseph Needham's ''Man a Machine'', Mencken forcefully ridiculed the use of reasoning to establish any fact in science, because theologians happen to be masters of \"logic\" and yet are mental defectives:\n\n{{quote|Is there anything in the general thinking of theologians which makes their opinion on the point of any interest or value? What have they ever done in other fields to match the fact-finding of the biologists? I can find nothing in the record. Their processes of thought, taking one day with another, are so defective as to be preposterous. True enough, they are masters of logic, but they always start out from palpably false premises.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=April 1929 |title=The Riddle of the Universe |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XVI |number=64 |pages=509\u201310 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1929apr-00509}}</ref>}}\n\nMencken also wrote a review for Sir James Jeans's book, ''The Mysterious Universe'', in which he said that mathematics is not necessary for physics. Instead of mathematical \"speculation\" (such as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]), Mencken believed physicists should just directly look at individual facts in the laboratory like chemists:\n\n{{quote|If chemists were similarly given to fanciful and mystical guessing, they would have hatched a quantum theory forty years ago to account for the variations that they observed in atomic weights. But they kept on plugging away in their laboratories without calling in either mathematicians or theologians to aid them, and eventually they discovered the isotopes, and what had been chaos was reduced to the most exact sort of order.<ref name=\"Mencken 252\u201354\">{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=February 1931 |title=The Eternal Conundrum |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XXII |number=86 |pages=252\u201354 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1931feb-00252}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the same article which he later re-printed in the ''Mencken Chrestomathy'', Mencken primarily contrasts what real scientists do, which is to simply directly look at the existence of \"shapes and forces\" confronting them instead of (such as in statistics) attempting to speculate and use mathematical models. Physicists and especially astronomers are consequently not real scientists, because when looking at shapes or forces, they do not simply \"patiently wait for further light,\" but resort to mathematical theory. There is no need for statistics in scientific physics, since one should simply look at the facts while statistics attempts to construct mathematical models. On the other hand, the really competent physicists do not bother with the \"theology\" or reasoning of mathematical theories (such as in quantum mechanics):\n\n{{quote|[Physicists] have, in late years, made a great deal of progress, though it has been accompanied by a considerable quackery. Some of the notions which they now try to foist upon the world, especially in the astronomical realm and about the atom, are obviously nonsensical, and will soon go the way of all unsupported speculations. But there is nothing intrinsically insoluble about the problems they mainly struggle with, and soon or late really competent physicists will arise to solve them. These really competent physicists, I predict, will be too busy in their laboratories to give any time to either metaphysics or theology.

The City of Baltimore acquired the property in 1983, and the [[H. L. Mencken House]] became part of the City Life Museums. It has been closed to general admission since 1997, but is opened for special events and group visits by arrangement.\n\n===Papers===\nShortly after [[World War&nbsp;II]], Mencken expressed his intention of bequeathing his books and papers to Baltimore's [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]]. At his death, it was in possession of most of the present large collection. As a result, his papers as well as much of his personal library, which includes many books inscribed by major authors, are held in the Library's Central Branch on Cathedral Street in Baltimore. The original third floor ''H.&nbsp;L. Mencken Room and Collection'' housing this collection was dedicated on April 17, 1956. The new Mencken Room, on the first floor of the Library's Annex, was opened in November 2003.\n\nThe collection contains Mencken's typescripts, newspaper and magazine contributions, published books, family documents and memorabilia, clipping books, large collection of presentation volumes, file of correspondence with prominent Marylanders, and the extensive material he collected while he was preparing ''[[The American Language]]''.\n\nOther Mencken related collections of note are at [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], and [[Yale University]]. In 2007, Johns Hopkins acquired \"nearly 6,000 books, photographs and letters by and about Mencken\" from \"the estate of an Ohio accountant.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A2-8a283eaa-146f-4b2f-852d-6e61f2d0fe05.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910044830/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A2-8a283eaa-146f-4b2f-852d-6e61f2d0fe05.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 10, 2016 |title=BOOKS MENCKEN COLLECTION |last=Staff |year=2009 |agency=Associated Press |url-access=subscription |access-date=July 8, 2016 |via=HighBeam Research}}</ref>\n\nThe Sara Haardt Mencken collection at [[Goucher College]] includes letters exchanged between Haardt and Mencken and condolences written after her death.

As an admirer of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], he was an outspoken opponent of [[organized religion]], [[theism]], [[populism]], and [[representative democracy]], the latter of which he viewed as systems in which inferior men dominated their superiors.<ref name=\"Democracy\"/> Mencken was a supporter of scientific progress, and was critical of [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]].

Apart from five years of married life, Mencken was to live in that house for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.menckenhouse.org/about/about_house.htm |title=Detailed description |publisher=Mencken's home |place=Baltimore |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027092318/http://www.menckenhouse.org/about/about_house.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2005 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn his best-selling memoir ''[[Happy Days, 1880\u20131892|Happy Days]]'', he described his childhood in Baltimore as \"placid, secure, uneventful and happy.\"<ref>''Happy Days'', p. vii</ref>\n\nWhen he was nine years old, he read [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'', which he later described as \"the most stupendous event in my life.\"<ref>St. Petersburg Times&nbsp;\u2013 September 23, 1987</ref> He became determined to become a writer and read voraciously. In one winter while in high school he read [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and then \"proceeded backward to [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Richard Steele|Steele]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]] and the other magnificos of the Eighteenth century.\" He read the entire canon of [[Shakespeare]] and became an ardent fan of [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Thomas Huxley]].{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | pp = 90\u201393}} As a boy, Mencken also had practical interests, photography and chemistry in particular, and eventually had a home chemistry laboratory in which he performed experiments of his own devising, some of them inadvertently dangerous.<ref>''Newspaper Days, 1899\u20131906'', p. 58.</ref>\n\nHe began his primary education in the mid-1880s at Professor Knapp's School on the east side of Holliday Street between East Lexington and Fayette Streets, next to the [[Holliday Street Theatre]] and across from the newly constructed [[Baltimore City Hall]]. The site today is the [[War Memorial Plaza|War Memorial and City Hall Plaza]] laid out in 1926 in memory of World War I dead. At 15, in June 1896, he graduated as valedictorian from the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]], at the time a males-only mathematics, technical and science-oriented public high school.\n\nHe worked for three years in his father's cigar factory. He disliked the work, especially the sales aspect of it, and resolved to leave, with or without his father's blessing. In early 1898 he took a writing class at the Cosmopolitan University.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | p = 93}} This was to be the entirety of Mencken's formal education in journalism, or in any other subject. Upon his father's death a few days after Christmas in the same year, the business passed to his uncle, and Mencken was free to pursue his career in journalism. He applied in February 1899 to the ''Morning Herald'' newspaper (which became the ''[[Baltimore Morning Herald]]'' in 1900) and was hired part-time, but still kept his position at the factory for a few months. In June he was hired as a full-time reporter.\n\n==Career==\nMencken served as a reporter at the ''Herald'' for six years. Less than two-and-a-half years after the [[Great Baltimore Fire]], the paper was purchased in June 1906 by [[Charles H. Grasty]], the owner and editor of ''[[Baltimore News-American|The News]]'' since 1892, and competing owner and publisher Gen. [[Felix Agnus]], of the town's oldest (since 1773) and largest daily, ''[[Baltimore News-American|The Baltimore American]].'' They proceeded to divide the staff, assets and resources of ''The Herald'' between them. Mencken then moved to ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', where he worked for Charles H. Grasty. He continued to contribute to ''The Sun,'' ''The Evening Sun'' (founded 1910) and ''The Sunday Sun'' full-time until 1948, when he stopped writing after suffering a [[stroke]].\n\nMencken began writing the editorials and opinion pieces that made his name at ''The Sun.'' On the side, he wrote short stories, a novel, and even poetry, which he later revealed. In 1908, he became a literary critic for ''[[The Smart Set]]'' magazine, and in 1924 he and [[George Jean Nathan]] founded and edited ''[[The American Mercury]]'', published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. It soon developed a national circulation and became highly influential on college campuses across America. In 1933, Mencken resigned as editor.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:Sara Haardt.jpg|thumb|right|Sara (Haardt) Mencken]]\nIn 1930, Mencken married [[Sara Haardt]], a [[German-American]] professor of English at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior. Haardt had led an unsuccessful effort in [[Alabama]] to ratify the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.al.com/south/literary3.html |type=short biographical sketch |publisher=AL |title=Sara Haardt}}</ref><ref>Alabama rejected the Nineteenth Amendment on September 22, 1919, though it later ratified it as a symbolic gesture on September 8, 1953.</ref> The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued. The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage \"the end of hope\" and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, had gone to the altar. \"The [[Holy Spirit]] informed and inspired me,\" Mencken said. \"Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this one seemed to be a superb one.\"<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.menckenhouse.org/txt/about/about_hlm.htm |title=Mencken |type=bio |publisher=Mencken house}}</ref> Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the [[American South]]. Haardt was in poor health from [[tuberculosis]] throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of [[meningitis]], leaving Mencken grief-stricken.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.al.com/south/literary3.html |title=The Real South: Famous People |publisher=AL |contribution=Literary Figures: Sally Haardt}}</ref> He had always championed her writing and, after her death, had a collection of her short stories published under the title ''Southern Album''.\n\n===Great Depression, war and after===\n[[File:H L Mencken Carl Van Vechten.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Mencken photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1932]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], Mencken did not support the [[New Deal]]. This cost him popularity, as did his strong reservations regarding U.S. participation in [[World War II]], and his overt contempt for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He ceased writing for ''The Baltimore Sun'' for several years, focusing on his memoirs and other projects as editor, while serving as an adviser for the paper that had been his home for nearly his entire career. In 1948, he briefly returned to the political scene, covering the presidential election in which President [[Harry S. Truman]] faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Thomas Dewey]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]]. His later work consisted of humorous, anecdotal, and nostalgic essays, first published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', then collected in the books ''Happy Days'', ''Newspaper Days'', and ''Heathen Days''.\n\n===Last days===\nOn November 23, 1948, Mencken suffered a [[stroke]], which left him aware and fully conscious but nearly unable to read or write and able to speak only with difficulty. After his stroke, Mencken enjoyed listening to [[classical music]] and, after some recovery of his ability to speak, talking with friends, but he sometimes referred to himself in the past tense, as if he were already dead. During the last year of his life, his friend and biographer [[William Manchester]] read to him daily.<ref>{{Citation |last=Filkins |first=Dexter | author-link = Dexter Filkins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/14/arts/14MANC.html |title=Ailing Churchill Biographer Says He Can't Finish Trilogy |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}}.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nMencken died in his sleep on January 29, 1956.<ref>{{cite news |title=HL Mencken, 75, Dies in Baltimore |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F14FF3C58157B93C2AA178AD85F428585F9 |quote=HL Mencken was found dead in bed early today.

After his death, these materials were made available to scholars in stages in 1971, 1981, and 1991, and include hundreds of thousands of letters sent and received; the only omissions were strictly personal letters received from women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Beliefs==\nIn his capacity as editor, Mencken became close friends with the leading literary figures of his time, including [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[F.&nbsp;Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Joseph Hergesheimer]], [[Anita Loos]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[James Branch Cabell]], and [[Alfred A. Knopf Sr.|Alfred Knopf]], as well as a mentor to several young reporters, including [[Alistair Cooke]]. He also championed artists whose works he considered worthy. For example, he asserted that books such as ''Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street'' (1929), by [[Eddie Cantor]] (ghost-written by [[David Freedman]]) did more to pull America out of the [[Great Depression]] than all government measures combined. He also mentored [[John Fante]]. [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] illustrated an edition of Mencken's book ''Europe After 8:15''.\n\nMencken also published many works under various pseudonyms, including [[Owen Hatteras]], John H Brownell, William Drayham, WLD Bell, and [[Charles Angoff]].<ref>{{Citation |first=SL |last=Harrison |title=AKA HL Mencken: Selected Pseudonymous Writings |publisher=Wolf Den Books |year=2005}}</ref> As a ghostwriter for the physician [[Leonard K. Hirshberg]], he wrote a series of articles and (in 1910) most of a book about the care of babies.\n\nMencken admired German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (he was the first writer to provide a scholarly analysis in English of Nietzsche's views and writings) and [[Joseph Conrad]]. His humor and satire owe much to [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Mark Twain]]. He did much to defend Dreiser despite freely admitting his faults, including stating forthrightly that Dreiser often wrote badly and was a gullible man. Mencken also expressed his appreciation for [[William Graham Sumner]] in a 1941 collection of Sumner's essays, and regretted never having known Sumner personally. In contrast, Mencken was scathing in his criticism of the German philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]], whom he described as \"an extremely dull author\" and whose famous book ''Philosophy of 'As If''' he dismissed as an unimportant \"foot-note to all existing systems.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=October 1924 |title=Philosophers as Liars |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=III |number=10 |pages=253\u201355}}</ref>\n\nMencken recommended for publication philosopher and author [[Ayn Rand]]'s first novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', calling it \"a really excellent piece of work.\" Shortly afterward, Rand addressed him in correspondence as \"the greatest representative of a philosophy\" to which she wanted to dedicate her life, \"individualism,\" and later listed him as her favorite columnist.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Berliner | editor-first = Michael |title=Letters |first=Ayn |last=Rand |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |pages=10 (Mencken's opinion of the novel), 13\u201314 (Rand's praise of Mencken)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Inherit333-1.JPG|thumb|Mencken is fictionalized in the play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (a fictionalized version of the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]] of 1925) as the cynical sarcastic atheist E.&nbsp;K.

On the left is Henry Drummond, based on [[Clarence Darrow]] and portrayed by [[Spencer Tracy]].]]\n\nFor Mencken, ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' was the finest work of [[American literature]]. He particularly relished Mark Twain's depiction of a succession of gullible and ignorant townspeople\u2014\"boobs,\" as Mencken referred to them\u2014who are repeatedly gulled by a pair of colorful [[con men]]: the (deliberately) pathetic [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn#The Duke and the Dauphin|\"Duke\" and \"Dauphin]],\" with whom [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck]] and [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]] travel down the [[Mississippi River]].

In the end the townsfolk wise up, and the scoundrels are ridden out on a rail.

Mencken was a keen cheerleader of scientific progress but skeptical of economic theories and strongly opposed to [[osteopathic]]/[[chiropractic]] medicine. He also debunked the idea of objective news reporting since \"truth is a commodity that the masses of undifferentiated men cannot be induced to buy,\" adding a humorous description of how \"Homo Boobus,\" like \"higher mammalia,\" is moved by \"whatever gratifies his prevailing yearnings.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=A gang of pecksniffs: And other comments on newspaper publishers, editors and reporters|last=Mencken|first=H.

The play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' is a fictionalized version of the trial, and, as noted above, the cynical reporter E.K. Hornbeck is based on Mencken. In 1926, he deliberately had himself arrested for selling an issue of ''The American Mercury'' that was [[banned in Boston]] under the [[Comstock laws]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=104 |publisher=Mass Moments |title=HL Mencken Arrested in Boston}}</ref> Mencken heaped scorn not only on the public officials he disliked, but also on the contemporary state of American elective politics itself.\n\nIn the summer of 1926, Mencken followed with great interest the [[Los Angeles]] grand jury inquiry into the famous Canadian-American evangelist [[Aimee Semple McPherson]]. She was accused of faking her reported [[kidnapping]] and the case attracted national attention. There was every expectation Mencken would continue his previous pattern of anti-fundamentalist articles, this time with a searing critique of McPherson. Unexpectedly, he came to her defense, identifying various local religious and civic groups which were using the case as an opportunity to pursue their respective ideological agendas against the embattled [[Pentecostal]] minister.<ref>{{Citation |first=Matthew Avery |last=Sutton |title=Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America |place=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2007 |pages=119\u201320}}</ref> He spent several weeks in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], and wrote many scathing and satirical columns on the movie industry and the southern California culture. After all charges had been dropped against McPherson, Mencken revisited the case in 1930 with a sarcastically biting and observant article. He wrote that since many of that town's residents acquired their ideas \"of the true, the good and the beautiful\" from the movies and newspapers, \"Los Angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |title=The American Mercury |year=1930}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931 the [[Arkansas]] legislature passed a motion to pray for Mencken's soul after he had called the state the \"apex of moronia.\"<ref>''Manchester'', p. 252</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1930s Mencken feared [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal liberalism]] as a powerful force. Mencken, says Charles A. Fecher, was, \"deeply conservative, resentful of change, looking back upon the 'happy days' of a bygone time, wanted no part of the world that the New Deal promised to bring in.\"<ref>{{cite book| editor-first =Charles A | editor-last = Fecher |title=Diary |first=HL |last=Mencken |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMsufJS6uu0C&pg=PT28 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday]] |location=New York City|page=28| isbn = 9780307808868 }}</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===Race and elitism===\nIn addition to his identification of races with castes, Mencken had views about the superior individual within communities. He believed that every community produced a few people of clear superiority. He considered groupings on a par with hierarchies, which led to a kind of natural [[elitism]] and natural [[aristocracy]]. \"Superior\" individuals, in Mencken's view, were those wrongly oppressed and disdained by their own communities, but nevertheless distinguished by their will and personal achievement, not by race or birth.\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?10797-1/diary-hl-mencken ''Booknotes'' interview with Charles Fecher on ''The Diary of H.L. Mencken'', January 28, 1990], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nIn 1989, per his instructions, Alfred A. Knopf published Mencken's \"secret diary\" as ''The Diary of H.&nbsp;L. Mencken''. According to an Associated Press story, Mencken's views shocked even the \"sympathetic scholar who edited it,\" [[Charles A. Fecher]] of Baltimore.<ref name=\"latimes1989\"/> There is a club in Baltimore called the [[Maryland Club]] which had one [[Jewish]] member, and that member died. Mencken said, \"There is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable,\" according to the article. The diary also quoted him as saying of blacks, in September 1943, that \"it is impossible to talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything.\"\n\nMencken opposed [[lynching]]. For example, he had this to say about a Maryland incident:\n\n{{quote|Not a single bigwig came forward in the emergency, though the whole town knew what was afoot. Any one of a score of such bigwigs might have halted the crime, if only by threatening to denounce its perpetrators, but none spoke. So Williams was duly hanged, burned and mutilated.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}}}\n\nMencken also wrote:\n\n{{quote|I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American Negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the Negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated Negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a Negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Robert Rives|last1=La Monte|authorlink1=Robert Rives La Monte|first2=HL|last2=Mencken|title=Men versus the Man: A Correspondence between Robert Rives La Monte, Socialist, and H.

As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence.

That said, Bufe still wrote that some of Mencken's statements were \"odious\", such as his claim in his 1918 introduction to Nietzsche's [[The Antichrist (book)|''The Anti-Christ'']] that \"The case against the Jews is long and damning; it would justify ten thousand times as many [[pogrom]]s as now go on in the world.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |author-link=Friedrich Nietzsche |date=1918 (Mencken) / 1999 (edition w/ Bufe's introduction) |title=The Anti-Christ |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm |location=Tucson, Arizona |publisher=See Sharp Press  |isbn=1-884365-20-5}}  Note: URL goes to Gutenberg version of just Mencken's text, but does not include Chaz Bufe's introduction or slight changes.</ref>\n\nAuthor [[Gore Vidal]] later deflected claims of anti-Semitism against Mencken:\n\n{{quote|Far from being an anti-Semite, Mencken was one of the first journalists to denounce the persecution of the Jews in Germany at a time when ''[[The New York Times]]'', say, was notoriously reticent. On November 27, 1938, Mencken writes (''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''), \"It is to be hoped that the poor Jews now being robbed and mauled in Germany will not take too seriously the plans of various politicians to rescue them.\" He then reviews the various schemes to \"rescue\" the Jews from the Nazis, who had not yet announced their own [[Holocaust|final solution]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Gore|last1=Vidal|authorlink=Gore Vidal|first2=Marion Elizabeth|last2=Rodgers|title=The Impossible H.L.

Why shouldn't the United States take in a couple hundred thousand of them, or even all of them?<ref>Gore Vidal, \"Foreword,\" In H.L. Mencken, ''The Impossible H.L. Mencken'' (New York, NY: Doubleday, 1991) p. xxxi.</ref>}}\n\n===Democracy===\n{{quote|Democracy gives [the beatification of mediocrity] a certain appearance of objective and demonstrable truth. The mob man, functioning as citizen, gets a feeling that he is really important to the world\u2014that he is genuinely running things. Out of his maudlin herding after rogues and [[Charlatan|mountebanks]] there comes to him a sense of vast and mysterious power\u2014which is what makes archbishops, police sergeants, the grand [[goblin]]s of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other such magnificoes happy. And out of it there comes, too, a conviction that he is somehow wise, that his views are taken seriously by his betters\u2014which is what makes United States Senators, fortune tellers and Young Intellectuals happy. Finally, there comes out of it a glowing consciousness of a high duty triumphantly done which is what makes hangmen and husbands happy.}}\n\nThis sentiment is fairly consistent with Mencken's distaste for common notions and the philosophical outlook he unabashedly set down throughout his life as a writer (drawing on Friedrich Nietzsche and [[Herbert Spencer]], among others).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigeye.com/mencken.htm |title=Last Words by H. L. Mencken |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMencken wrote as follows about the difficulties of good men reaching national office when such campaigns must necessarily be conducted remotely:<blockquote>The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even the mob with him by force of his personality. But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second and third hand, and the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre\u2014the man who can most easily adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.\n\nThe Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Bayard vs. Lionheart|work=Baltimore Evening Sun|last=Mencken|first=H. L.|date=July 26, 1920|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Science and mathematics===\nMencken defended the evolutionary views of [[Charles Darwin]] but spoke unfavorably of many prominent physicists and had little regard for pure mathematics. Regarding Charles Angoff, Mencken said:\n\n{{quote|[Isaac Newton] was a mathematician, which is mostly hogwash, too. Imagine measuring infinity! That's a laugh.<ref name=\"Angoff, Charles 1961 pp. 141\">Angoff, Charles. ''H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory''. A. S. Barnes (New York, 1961), p. 141</ref>}}\n\nIn response, Angoff said: \"Well, without mathematics there wouldn't be any engineering, no chemistry, no physics.\" Mencken responded: \"That's true, but it's reasonable mathematics. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, division, that's what real mathematics is. The rest is baloney. Astrology. Religion. All of our sciences still suffer from their former attachment to religion, and that is why there is so much metaphysics and astrology, the two are the same, in science.\"<ref name=\"Angoff, Charles 1961 pp. 141\"/>\n\nElsewhere, he spoke of the nonsense of higher mathematics and \"probability\" theory, after he read Angoff's article for [[Charles S. Peirce]] in the ''American Mercury''. \"So you believe in that garbage, too\u2014theories of knowledge, infinity, laws of probability. I can make no sense of it, and I don't believe you can either, and I don't think your god Peirce knew what he was talking about.\"<ref>Angoff, Charles. ''H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory''. A. S. Barnes (New York, 1961), p. 194</ref>\n\nMencken also repeated these opinions multiple times in articles for the ''American Mercury''. He said mathematics is simply a fiction, compared with individual facts that make up science. In a review for Vaihinger's ''The Philosophy of \"As If'',\" he said:\n\n{{quote|The human mind, at its present stage of development, cannot function without the aid of fictions, but neither can it function without the aid of facts\u2014save, perhaps, when it is housed in the skull of a university professor of philosophy. Of the two, the facts are enormously the more important. In certain metaphysical fields, e.g. those of mathematics, law, theology, osteopathy and ethics\u2014the fiction will probably hold out for many years, but elsewhere the fact slowly ousts it, and that ousting is what is called intellectual progress. Very few fictions remain in use in anatomy, or in plumbing and gas-fitting; they have even begun to disappear from economics.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=October 1924 |title=Philosophers as Liars |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=III |number=10 |pages=253\u201355 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1924oct-00253}}</ref>}}\n\nMencken repeatedly identified mathematics with metaphysics and theology. According to Mencken, mathematics is necessarily infected with metaphysics because of the tendency of many mathematical people to engage in metaphysical speculation. In a review for A. N. Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education'', Mencken remarked that despite his agreement with Whitehead's thesis and approval of his writing style, \"now and then he falls into mathematical jargon and pollutes his discourse with equations,\" and \"[t]here are moments when he seems to be following some of his mathematical colleagues into the gaudy metaphysics which now entertains them.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=June 1929 |title=What Is It All About? |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XVII |number=66 |pages=251\u201352 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1929jun-00251}}</ref> For Mencken, theology is characterized by the fact that it uses correct reasoning from false premises. Mencken also uses the term \"theology\" more generally, to refer to the use of logic in science or any other field of knowledge. In a review for both A. S. Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and Joseph Needham's ''Man a Machine'', Mencken forcefully ridiculed the use of reasoning to establish any fact in science, because theologians happen to be masters of \"logic\" and yet are mental defectives:\n\n{{quote|Is there anything in the general thinking of theologians which makes their opinion on the point of any interest or value? What have they ever done in other fields to match the fact-finding of the biologists? I can find nothing in the record. Their processes of thought, taking one day with another, are so defective as to be preposterous. True enough, they are masters of logic, but they always start out from palpably false premises.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=April 1929 |title=The Riddle of the Universe |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XVI |number=64 |pages=509\u201310 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1929apr-00509}}</ref>}}\n\nMencken also wrote a review for Sir James Jeans's book, ''The Mysterious Universe'', in which he said that mathematics is not necessary for physics. Instead of mathematical \"speculation\" (such as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]), Mencken believed physicists should just directly look at individual facts in the laboratory like chemists:\n\n{{quote|If chemists were similarly given to fanciful and mystical guessing, they would have hatched a quantum theory forty years ago to account for the variations that they observed in atomic weights. But they kept on plugging away in their laboratories without calling in either mathematicians or theologians to aid them, and eventually they discovered the isotopes, and what had been chaos was reduced to the most exact sort of order.<ref name=\"Mencken 252\u201354\">{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=February 1931 |title=The Eternal Conundrum |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XXII |number=86 |pages=252\u201354 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1931feb-00252}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the same article which he later re-printed in the ''Mencken Chrestomathy'', Mencken primarily contrasts what real scientists do, which is to simply directly look at the existence of \"shapes and forces\" confronting them instead of (such as in statistics) attempting to speculate and use mathematical models. Physicists and especially astronomers are consequently not real scientists, because when looking at shapes or forces, they do not simply \"patiently wait for further light,\" but resort to mathematical theory. There is no need for statistics in scientific physics, since one should simply look at the facts while statistics attempts to construct mathematical models. On the other hand, the really competent physicists do not bother with the \"theology\" or reasoning of mathematical theories (such as in quantum mechanics):\n\n{{quote|[Physicists] have, in late years, made a great deal of progress, though it has been accompanied by a considerable quackery. Some of the notions which they now try to foist upon the world, especially in the astronomical realm and about the atom, are obviously nonsensical, and will soon go the way of all unsupported speculations. But there is nothing intrinsically insoluble about the problems they mainly struggle with, and soon or late really competent physicists will arise to solve them. These really competent physicists, I predict, will be too busy in their laboratories to give any time to either metaphysics or theology. Both are eternal enemies of every variety of sound thinking, and no man can traffic with them without losing something of his good judgment.<ref name=\"Mencken 252\u201354\"/>}}\n\nMencken ridiculed [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], believing that \"in the long run his curved space may be classed with the psychosomatic bumps of Gall and Spurzheim.\"<ref>Mencken, Henry Louis.
