{"title_page": "Battle of Maguelone", "text_new": "The '''Battle of Maguelone''' was a minor naval action that occurred in late October 1809, during the [[Peninsular War]], between the escort of a French convoy, comprising three ships of the line and two frigates, and a 6-ship strong squadron of the Royal Navy. In a running battle, the French covered the retreat of the convoy and attempted to escape by sailing in shallow waters close to the shore of Maguelone. After two of the ships of the line ran aground, their crew evacuated them and scuttled them by fire after removing valuable equipment, including the artillery. The remaining ship and frigates made good their escape.\n\n== Context ==\nOn 21 October 1809, a squadron of the French Navy under Rear-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Baudin]] left Toulon, escorting a convoy bound for [[Barcelona]]. On 23, off [[Cape Saint Sebastian]], the squadron detected five sails in the West. With a light wind from the East, Baudin ordered the convoy to seek shelter in [[Baie des Roses]], and had his forces sail to the open sea. By noon, 14 British ships were in sight. In the night, the weather deteriorated and the ships had to reduce sail, an operation made difficult and longer than usual by the lack of training of the crew. In the morning of 24, the squadron found itself near the coast, and by 7:30, Baudin ordered his ships to anchor. With 16 metres under keel, he signaled his intention to set sail soon and seek refuge off [[S\u00e8te]].<ref group=note>\"S\u00e8te\" was then written \"Cette\".</ref><ref name=Troude56>Troude, p.56</ref>\n\nCollingwood, having had word of the French attempt to resupply their forces in Barcelona, had left [[Cape Sici\u00e9]] with 15 ships of the line and 5 frigates and was ambushing the convoy off Cape Saint Sebastian. Tow frigates were also posted off Toulon to watch the movements of the French ships.<ref name=Troude56 />\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 25 October 1809, the French squadron left their anchorage of Baie des Roses and sailed to the West, close to shore, with light winds from the East. The British resumed their chase, catching up on the French, as the wind was stronger further off at sea. Baudin ordered ''Pauline'' to run to S\u00e8te to warn of the incoming British squadron and have coastal defences manned and ready. At 11:30, the French ships started to touch bottom, and Baudin gave freedom of manoeuver to his captains. ''Bor\u00e9e'' managed to reach deeped waters, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' ran aground.<ref name=Troude57>Troude, p.57</ref>\n\n''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' rested on a bed of rock and hard sand, ''Lion'' east of ''Robuste'', both ships out of range of the British. Meanwhile, ''Pauline'' and ''Bor\u00e9e'' came in range and exchanged a few shots with HMS ''Tigre'' and ''Leviathan''. Senez, the captaing of ''Bor\u00e9e'', planned to anchor off S\u00e8te, but Ensign Vallat, captain of the aviso ''Proven\u00e7ale'' that was patrolling the area, offered to pilot ''Bor\u00e9e'' into the harbour. The man\u0153uver succeeded, putting ''Bor\u00e9e'' out of reach of the British squadron. ''Pauline'' mirrored the actions of ''Bor\u00e9e'' and also entered the port.<ref name=Troude57 />\n\nWith the sea growing heavier, the British stayed off Baudin's ships, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' were sustaining increasing damage and leaking water.<ref name=Troude57 /> It soon became obvious that the ships could not be raised, and had to be evacuated and scuttled.<ref name=Troude58>Troude, p.58</ref> In the morning of 26, Baudin ordered his crew to abandon ship and set them afire.

Important biologics include:\n\n* [[Whole blood]] and other blood components\n* [[organ transplantation|Organs]] and [[tissue transplant]]s\n* [[Stem cell therapy]]\n* [[Antibodies]] for [[passive immunization]] (e.g., to treat a [[virus]] infection)\n* [[Breast milk|Human breast milk]]\n* [[Fecal microbiota transplant|Fecal microbiota]]\n* [[Human fertilization|Human reproductive cells]]\n\nSome biologics that were previously extracted from animals, such as insulin, are now more commonly produced by [[recombinant DNA]].\n\n===Produced by recombinant DNA===\n{{see also|Biologics for immunosuppression}}\n\nAs indicated the term \"biologics\" can be used to refer to a wide range of biological products in medicine. However, in most cases, the term \"biologics\" is used more restrictively for a class of therapeutics (either approved or in development) that are produced by means of biological processes involving [[recombinant DNA]] technology. These medications are usually one of three types:\n# Substances that are (nearly) identical to the body's own key signalling proteins. Examples are the blood-production stimulating protein [[erythropoetin]], or the growth-stimulating hormone named (simply) \"[[growth hormone]]\" or biosynthetic human [[insulin]] and its analogues.\n# [[Monoclonal antibodies]]. These are similar to the antibodies that the human immune system uses to fight off bacteria and viruses, but they are \"custom-designed\" (using [[hybridoma]] technology or other methods) and can therefore be made specifically to counteract or block any given substance in the body, or to target any specific cell type; examples of such monoclonal antibodies for use in various diseases are given in the table below.\n# Receptor constructs ([[fusion protein]]s), usually based on a naturally occurring receptor linked to the [[immunoglobulin]] frame. In this case, the receptor provides the construct with detailed specificity, whereas the immunoglobulin-structure imparts stability and other useful features in terms of [[pharmacology]]. Some examples are listed in the table below.\n\nBiologics as a class of medications in this narrower sense have had a profound impact on many medical fields, primarily [[rheumatology]] and [[oncology]], but also [[cardiology]], [[dermatology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[neurology]], and others. In most of these disciplines, biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which no effective therapies were available, and others where previously existing therapies were clearly inadequate. However, the advent of biologic therapeutics has also raised complex regulatory issues (see below), and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns, because the cost for biologic therapies has been dramatically higher than for conventional (pharmacological) medications. This factor has been particularly relevant since many biological medications are used for the treatment of [[chronic diseases]], such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of otherwise untreatable cancer during the remainder of life. The cost of treatment with a typical monoclonal antibody therapy for relatively common indications is generally in the range of \u20ac7,000\u201314,000 per patient per year.\n\nOlder patients who receive biologic therapy for diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], or [[ankylosing spondylitis]] are at increased risk for life-threatening infection, adverse cardiovascular events, and [[malignancy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr LD | title = The use of biologic agents in the geriatric population | journal = J Musculoskel Med | volume = 27 | pages = 175\u2013180 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/arthritis/content/article/1145622/1562177}}</ref>\n\nThe first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic \"human\" [[insulin]] made via [[recombinant DNA]].

However, in most cases, the term \"biologics\" is used more restrictively for a class of therapeutics (either approved or in development) that are produced by means of biological processes involving [[recombinant DNA]] technology. These medications are usually one of three types:\n# Substances that are (nearly) identical to the body's own key signalling proteins. Examples are the blood-production stimulating protein [[erythropoetin]], or the growth-stimulating hormone named (simply) \"[[growth hormone]]\" or biosynthetic human [[insulin]] and its analogues.\n# [[Monoclonal antibodies]]. These are similar to the antibodies that the human immune system uses to fight off bacteria and viruses, but they are \"custom-designed\" (using [[hybridoma]] technology or other methods) and can therefore be made specifically to counteract or block any given substance in the body, or to target any specific cell type; examples of such monoclonal antibodies for use in various diseases are given in the table below.\n# Receptor constructs ([[fusion protein]]s), usually based on a naturally occurring receptor linked to the [[immunoglobulin]] frame. In this case, the receptor provides the construct with detailed specificity, whereas the immunoglobulin-structure imparts stability and other useful features in terms of [[pharmacology]]. Some examples are listed in the table below.\n\nBiologics as a class of medications in this narrower sense have had a profound impact on many medical fields, primarily [[rheumatology]] and [[oncology]], but also [[cardiology]], [[dermatology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[neurology]], and others. In most of these disciplines, biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which no effective therapies were available, and others where previously existing therapies were clearly inadequate. However, the advent of biologic therapeutics has also raised complex regulatory issues (see below), and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns, because the cost for biologic therapies has been dramatically higher than for conventional (pharmacological) medications.

Bose spent a year at [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium]] in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]]; and a year as a Fulbright research student in [[New Delhi, India]], where he met his future first wife. He completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering from MIT, writing a thesis on [[non-linear system]]s under the supervision of [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Yuk-Wing Lee]].\n\n==Career==\nFollowing graduation, Amar Bose became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During his early years as a professor, Bose bought a high-end stereo speaker system in 1956 and he was disappointed to find that speakers with impressive technical specifications failed to reproduce the realism of a live performance. This would eventually motivate his extensive [[Loudspeaker|speaker technology]] research, concentrating on key weaknesses in the high-end speaker systems available at the time. His research on [[acoustics]] led him to develop a stereo loudspeaker that would reproduce, in a domestic setting, the dominantly reflected sound field that characterizes the listening space of the audience in a concert hall. His focus on [[psychoacoustic]]s  later became a hallmark of his company's audio products.\n\nFor initial capital to fund his company in 1964, Bose turned to [[angel investors]], including his MIT thesis advisor and professor, Y. W. Lee. Bose was awarded significant [[patent]]s in two fields that continue to be important to the Bose Corporation. These patents were in the area of loudspeaker design and non-linear, two-state modulated, [[Class D Amplifier|Class-D]] power processing.\n\nThe company Bose founded employed 11,700 people worldwide {{asof|2016|lc=y}} and produces products for home, car, and professional audio, as well as conducting basic research in acoustics and other fields. Bose never took his company public, and since the company was privately held Bose was able to pursue risky long-term research.

Bose spent a year at [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium]] in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]]; and a year as a Fulbright research student in [[New Delhi, India]], where he met his future first wife. He completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering from MIT, writing a thesis on [[non-linear system]]s under the supervision of [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Yuk-Wing Lee]].\n\n==Career==\nFollowing graduation, Amar Bose became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During his early years as a professor, Bose bought a high-end stereo speaker system in 1956 and he was disappointed to find that speakers with impressive technical specifications failed to reproduce the realism of a live performance. This would eventually motivate his extensive [[Loudspeaker|speaker technology]] research, concentrating on key weaknesses in the high-end speaker systems available at the time. His research on [[acoustics]] led him to develop a stereo loudspeaker that would reproduce, in a domestic setting, the dominantly reflected sound field that characterizes the listening space of the audience in a concert hall. His focus on [[psychoacoustic]]s  later became a hallmark of his company's audio products.\n\nFor initial capital to fund his company in 1964, Bose turned to [[angel investors]], including his MIT thesis advisor and professor, Y. W. Lee. Bose was awarded significant [[patent]]s in two fields that continue to be important to the Bose Corporation. These patents were in the area of loudspeaker design and non-linear, two-state modulated, [[Class D Amplifier|Class-D]] power processing.\n\nThe company Bose founded employed 11,700 people worldwide {{asof|2016|lc=y}} and produces products for home, car, and professional audio, as well as conducting basic research in acoustics and other fields. Bose never took his company public, and since the company was privately held Bose was able to pursue risky long-term research. In a 2004 interview in ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine, he said: \"I would have been fired a hundred times at a company run by [[Master of Business Administration|MBAs]].
