He was elected councilor in the 2nd District of [[Quezon City]] in 2010. In the year 2013, he was overwhelmingly elected for a Congressional Seat representing the newly created [[Legislative districts of Quezon City|Fifth District of Quezon City]]. He will seek a re-election in the 2019 elections for the same position.\n\n==Biography and Career==\nVargas was born on October 24, 1981, in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]]. He is the son of Alfredo Vargas, Jr. and Atty. Susana Dumlao Vargas.\n\nHe graduated in A.B. Management Economics in [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. For his graduate studies, he went to the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] to pursue a master's degree in public administration. He is currently the Representative of the newly formed District 5 of Quezon City. He has passed 17 Republic Acts including RA 10931 [[Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act]], RA 10645 mandating PhilHealth coverage for all senior citizens, RA 10747 Rare Diseases Act of the Philippines. He constantly campaigns for vulnerable sector such as Persons With Disabilities and cancer patients.<ref>http://www.glamourmoments.net/alfred-vargas-crusade-helping-persons-with-disabilities-pwd/</ref> Likewise, he is known to push for traffic alleviation through Point-to-Point or P2P methods.<ref>http://www.philstar.com/bansa/2017/11/20/1760568/paggamit-ng-zipper-lane-sa-edsa-mungkahi</ref>\n\nAs an actor, he started his career as a member of [[ABS-CBN]] [[Star Magic]] (formerly Star Circle) acting workshop Batch 10. From there, he had his TV role in the drama soap opera, Pangako Sa'yo, from the same network. But this Ateneo de Manila graduate was acting in theatre long before the talent scouts lured him into television.\n\nHis breakthrough role came in the film ''Bridal Shower''. After this, Vargas moved to the [[GMA Network]] where he featured in three shows in Philippine television: the daytime drama series, ''Daisy Siete'', the fantasy series, ''[[Encantadia]]'' (as Aquil), and its prequel series ''[[Etheria]]'' (as Amarro, Aquil's father).\n\nHe played the leading role on the GMA daytime series ''[[Muli (TV series)|Muli]]'', opposite the Malaysian actress Carrie Lee and [[Marian Rivera]] as well as being part of the cast of ''[[Impostora]]'' in 2007.  In 2008, he worked again with [[Marian Rivera]] in ''[[Dyesebel (TV series)|Dyesebel]]''.  He is also part of the upcoming installment of ''[[Una Kang Naging Akin]]'' co-starring [[Angelika dela Cruz]], in which he plays \"Ronnie\".\n\nHis most recent movie projects include ''Status: Single'' and ''[[When I Met U]]''. He is set to do an indie film, ''Amamanhig''. In 2009, he appeared in ''[[All About Eve (Philippine TV Series)|All About Eve]]'' where he is reunited with his [[Impostora]] castmates [[Sunshine Dizon]], [[Iza Calzado]], and [[Mark Anthony Fernandez]]. He then made a villainous turn when he played the pirate captain Lima Wong in ''[[Zorro (Philippine TV series)|Zorro]]''. He went on to play \"Gabriel\" in ''[[Darna (2009 TV series)|Darna]]'' but had to leave the series as he applied for candidacy for councilor.\n\nIn 2010 Alfred Vargas was reappearing in \"Darna\", becoming a successful reporter. In December 2010 he returned to ABS-CBN and did projects for the network, without contract as he is a public servant and cannot be exclusive. In January 2017 he returned to his home network [[GMA Network]] and it will serve as Vargas comeback project after being on a hiatus for 2 years. This led to a familiar role as \"Amarro\", the father of Aquil in Encantadia's remake.\n\nCurrently, he is working on a GMA soap opera, which turned out to be [[Kambal, Karibal]] <ref>http://bandera.inquirer.net/167655/miguel-bianca-bibida-sa-seryeng-santa-santita-ng-gma</ref> while still balancing his congressional work.\n\n==Politics==\n\nIn [[2010 Quezon City local elections#District 2|Quezon City local elections for District 2]] on May 11, 2010, he was elected city councilor, with the second-highest number of votes in the district.<ref name=\"Public Service\" />\n\nVargas won for the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congress]] in [[Philippine House of Representatives elections in Metro Manila, 2013#Quezon City#5th District|2013]], due to reapportioning from [[Legislative districts of Quezon City|2nd district to newly created 5th district]] of [[Quezon City]] which consist parts of [[Novaliches]] area, under the [[LP-Akbayan-NPC-NP-LDP Coalition|administration]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|LP]]/[[Nacionalista Party|NP]]/[[Nationalist Peoples Coalition|NPC]]/[[National Unity Party (Philippines)|NUP]]) coalition. His opponent is former old 2nd district Representatives Annie Rosa Susano (of [[Lakas\u2013CMD (2009)|Lakas]]) and Dante Liban (of the [[United Nationalist Alliance]]).\n\nIn 2016, Vargas ran for another term and was '''unopposed'''. He garnered 85% of the votes, a very high statistic considering he was an unopposed candidate.\n\nHe left the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in 2017.<ref name=\"flipflop\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/169400-liberal-party-lawmakers-jump-ship-pdp-laban|title=Yellow no more: Roman, 3 other LP lawmakers jumping ship to PDP-Laban|work=[[Rappler]]|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}</ref> Afterwards joining the PDP-Laban, the current ruling party under President Rodrigo R.

He was elected councilor in the 2nd District of [[Quezon City]] in 2010. In the year 2013, he was overwhelmingly elected for a Congressional Seat representing the newly created [[Legislative districts of Quezon City|Fifth District of Quezon City]]. He will seek a re-election in the 2019 elections for the same position.\n\n==Biography and Career==\nVargas was born on October 24, 1981, in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]]. He is the son of Alfredo Vargas, Jr. and Atty. Susana Dumlao Vargas.\n\nHe graduated in A.B. Management Economics in [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. For his graduate studies, he went to the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] to pursue a master's degree in public administration. He is currently the Representative of the newly formed District 5 of Quezon City. He has passed 17 Republic Acts including RA 10931 [[Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act]], RA 10645 mandating PhilHealth coverage for all senior citizens, RA 10747 Rare Diseases Act of the Philippines. He constantly campaigns for vulnerable sector such as Persons With Disabilities and cancer patients.<ref>http://www.glamourmoments.net/alfred-vargas-crusade-helping-persons-with-disabilities-pwd/</ref> Likewise, he is known to push for traffic alleviation through Point-to-Point or P2P methods.<ref>http://www.philstar.com/bansa/2017/11/20/1760568/paggamit-ng-zipper-lane-sa-edsa-mungkahi</ref>\n\nAs an actor, he started his career as a member of [[ABS-CBN]] [[Star Magic]] (formerly Star Circle) acting workshop Batch 10. From there, he had his TV role in the drama soap opera, Pangako Sa'yo, from the same network. But this Ateneo de Manila graduate was acting in theatre long before the talent scouts lured him into television.\n\nHis breakthrough role came in the film ''Bridal Shower''. After this, Vargas moved to the [[GMA Network]] where he featured in three shows in Philippine television: the daytime drama series, ''Daisy Siete'', the fantasy series, ''[[Encantadia]]'' (as Aquil), and its prequel series ''[[Etheria]]'' (as Amarro, Aquil's father).\n\nHe played the leading role on the GMA daytime series ''[[Muli (TV series)|Muli]]'', opposite the Malaysian actress Carrie Lee and [[Marian Rivera]] as well as being part of the cast of ''[[Impostora]]'' in 2007.  In 2008, he worked again with [[Marian Rivera]] in ''[[Dyesebel (TV series)|Dyesebel]]''.  He is also part of the upcoming installment of ''[[Una Kang Naging Akin]]'' co-starring [[Angelika dela Cruz]], in which he plays \"Ronnie\".\n\nHis most recent movie projects include ''Status: Single'' and ''[[When I Met U]]''. He is set to do an indie film, ''Amamanhig''. In 2009, he appeared in ''[[All About Eve (Philippine TV Series)|All About Eve]]'' where he is reunited with his [[Impostora]] castmates [[Sunshine Dizon]], [[Iza Calzado]], and [[Mark Anthony Fernandez]]. He then made a villainous turn when he played the pirate captain Lima Wong in ''[[Zorro (Philippine TV series)|Zorro]]''. He went on to play \"Gabriel\" in ''[[Darna (2009 TV series)|Darna]]'' but had to leave the series as he applied for candidacy for councilor.\n\nIn 2010 Alfred Vargas was reappearing in \"Darna\", becoming a successful reporter. In December 2010 he returned to ABS-CBN and did projects for the network, without contract as he is a public servant and cannot be exclusive. In January 2017 he returned to his home network [[GMA Network]] and it will serve as Vargas comeback project after being on a hiatus for 2 years. This led to a familiar role as \"Amarro\", the father of Aquil in Encantadia's remake.\n\nCurrently, he is working on a GMA soap opera, which turned out to be [[Kambal, Karibal]] <ref>http://bandera.inquirer.net/167655/miguel-bianca-bibida-sa-seryeng-santa-santita-ng-gma</ref> while still balancing his congressional work.\n\n==Politics==\n\nIn [[2010 Quezon City local elections#District 2|Quezon City local elections for District 2]] on May 11, 2010, he was elected city councilor, with the second-highest number of votes in the district.<ref name=\"Public Service\" />\n\nVargas won for the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congress]] in [[Philippine House of Representatives elections in Metro Manila, 2013#Quezon City#5th District|2013]], due to reapportioning from [[Legislative districts of Quezon City|2nd district to newly created 5th district]] of [[Quezon City]] which consist parts of [[Novaliches]] area, under the [[LP-Akbayan-NPC-NP-LDP Coalition|administration]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|LP]]/[[Nacionalista Party|NP]]/[[Nationalist Peoples Coalition|NPC]]/[[National Unity Party (Philippines)|NUP]]) coalition. His opponent is former old 2nd district Representatives Annie Rosa Susano (of [[Lakas\u2013CMD (2009)|Lakas]]) and Dante Liban (of the [[United Nationalist Alliance]]).\n\nIn 2016, Vargas ran for another term and was '''unopposed'''. He garnered 85% of the votes, a very high statistic considering he was an unopposed candidate.\n\nHe left the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in 2017.<ref name=\"flipflop\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/169400-liberal-party-lawmakers-jump-ship-pdp-laban|title=Yellow no more: Roman, 3 other LP lawmakers jumping ship to PDP-Laban|work=[[Rappler]]|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}</ref> Afterwards joining the PDP-Laban, the current ruling party under President Rodrigo R.

Fern\u00e1ndez''' (born January 18, 1979) is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor. He is the son of [[Rudy \"Daboy\" Fernandez|Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Alma Moreno]].\n\n==Career==\nHe first rose to prominence when he was once a former member of one of the famous showbiz teen group, \"Gwapings\" alongside [[Jomari Yllana]], [[Eric Fructuoso]] and later with [[Jao Mapa]].\n\nHis breakout roles in the movies includes ''Pare Ko'', ''Mangarap Ka'' and ''Matimbang Pa sa Dugo'' which featured him as a lead star. In 1996, he received Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nominations for the 3 aforementioned movies he did. However, the year 1998 started a downward spiral in Fernandez's career and personal life following an assault case that was filed against him by an American socialite and the break-up with his then-girlfriend [[Claudine Barretto]]. His home studio [[Regal Films]] attempted to launch him as an action star in the movies ''Sonny Segovia: Lumakad Ka Sa Apoy'' and ''Walang Katumbas Ang Dugo'' but both movies flopped at the box-office.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus from a [[drug rehabilitation]] which follows his acquittal in the assault case, Fernandez returned in the movie scene via ''Biyaheng Langit'' and ''Dos Ekis'' opposite sexy actresses [[Joyce Jimenez]] and [[Rica Peralejo]], respectively. He also made a TV comeback via [[GMA Network|GMA]] drama series ''[[Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin]]'' opposite [[Angelika dela Cruz]].<ref>[http://www.philstar.com/ArticlePrinterFriendly.aspx?articleId=165102 ]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, he had disappeared once again from the industry and underwent rehabilitation for drug dependence for the second time. In 2005, he was released from rehab and made his comeback in show business. After his release in rehab, he said in his words, ''\"I hope the moviegoers will welcome me back. Now, I realize more than ever that I'm made for showbiz and I'll always be in showbiz.\"''\n\nHe has been one of [[GMA Network|GMA]]'s leading actors with his critically acclaimed performances on TV series such as [[Impostora]] (2007), [[Carlo J. Caparas' Kamandag|Kamandag]] (2007\u201308), [[Ako si Kim Samsoon]] (2008), [[Luna Mystika]] (2008\u201309), [[All About Eve (Philippine TV series)|All About Eve]] (2009) and [[Munting Heredera]]. He also portrayed [[Manny Pacquiao]] in ''Magpakailanman'' in 2003 before his second drug rehab.\n\nHis role as Nicolas Cayetano is the drama series ''[[Impostora]]'' became his most notable role in TV & the said drama also relaunched his career making him one of the sought-after leading men in GMA-7 & because of the fruitful projects given to him by GMA, he decided to sign an exclusive contract with the network that rebuilt his career. He was paired off with [[Sunshine Dizon]] (''[[Impostora]]''), [[Heart Evangelista]] (''[[Luna Mystika]]''), [[Iza Calzado]] (''All About Eve''), [[Marian Rivera]] (''[[Darna (2009 TV series)|Darna]]'') and [[Regine Velasquez]] (''[[Ako si Kim Sam Soon]]'' and recently in ''[[Diva (TV series)|Diva]]'', 2010).\n\nHe also hosted a kids documentary reality show [[Kap's Amazing Stories|Kap's Amazing Stories Kids Edition]] last April 2010 on [[GMA Network]].\n\nIn January 2018, Fernandez returned to showbiz after legal issues.
