R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He is a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]], one of the ''Istari'' order, and the leader of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. Tolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the [[Old Norse]] [[Dvergatal|\"Catalogue of Dwarves\" (''Dvergatal'')]] in the ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1''. \n\nAs a wizard and the bearer of a [[Rings of Power|Ring of Power]], Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge, and travelling continually, always focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. He is associated with fire, his ring being [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, and he both delights in [[fireworks]] to entertain the [[hobbit]]s of [[the Shire]], and in great need uses fire as a weapon. As one of the [[Maiar]] he is an immortal spirit, but being in a physical body on Middle-earth, he can be killed in battle, as he is by the [[Balrog]] from [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. He is sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission, now as Gandalf the White and leader of the Istari.\n\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an [[angel]] incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] who assisted [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[The Aeneid]]'', or to Virgil himself in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; and as a [[Christ]]-figure, a [[prophet]].\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Emblema Gandalf.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Cirth|Certh]] [[rune]] no. 19 \"G\", used by Gandalf as a personal [[sign]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]]]]\n\n===Etymology===\n\nTolkien derived the name ''Gandalf'' from ''[[Gandalf (mythology)|Gand\u00e1lfr]]'', a [[Norse dwarf|dwarf]] in the [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'s ''Dvergatal'', a list of dwarf-names.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D.

This is reflected in his name ''Thark\u00fbn'', which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man' \" in [[Khuzdul]], one of [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's invented languages]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===In-universe names===\n\nGandalf is given several names and nicknames in Tolkien's writings. Gandalf himself says, \"Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir{{efn|Meaning \"Grey Pilgrim\"}} among the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], Thark\u00fbn to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], [[#Valinor|Ol\u00f3rin I was in my youth in the West]] that is forgotten, in the South Inc\u00e1nus, in the North ''Gandalf''; to [[Rh\u00fbn|the East]] I go not.\"<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 5, \"The Window on the West\"</ref> In an early manuscript version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', he is called Bladorthin.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D.

For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf ''the Grey'', and Grey[[wikt:hame|hame]]. ''Mithrandir'' is a name in [[Sindarin]] meaning \"the Grey Pilgrim\" or \"the Grey Wanderer\". Midway through ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed [[#Gandalf the White|Gandalf the White]]. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as ''Mithrandir''. At times in ''The Lord of the Rings'', other characters address Gandalf by disparaging nicknames:Stormcrow, ''L\u00e1thspell'' (\"Ill-news\" in [[Old English]]), and \"Grey Fool\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in [[Middle-earth]], one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a [[Magic (Middle-earth)#Magic items|staff]]\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> Yet the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[C\u00edrdan]] who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven [[Three Rings|Ring of Power]] called [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] later in the same essay:<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n{{blockquote|Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of [[Sauron]], opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of the North Gandalf 'the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>}}\n\n==Fictional biography==\n\n===Valinor===\n\nIn [[Valinor]], Gandalf was called ''Ol\u00f3rin''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala [[Manw\u00eb]]; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and [[Nienna]], the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards (Istari)]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed [[Sauron]], Ol\u00f3rin was proposed by Manw\u00eb. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 4, ch. 2, \"The Istari\"</ref>\n\nAs one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol\u00f3rin was in service to the Creator ([[Eru Il\u00favatar]]) and the Creator's '[[Secret Fire]]'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===Middle-earth===\n\nThe Istari arrived in [[Middle-earth]] separately, early in the [[Third Age]]; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but [[C\u00edrdan]] the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Saruman]], the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other [[ring-bearers]] at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C\u00edrdan, was the holder of the third of the [[Three Rings|Elven-rings]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate them\u2014an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The White Council====\n\nGandalf suspected early on that the [[Sauron#The Necromancer of Dol Guldur|Necromancer of Dol Guldur]] was not a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] but Sauron himself. He went to [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix B.</ref> to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force,<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> and the White Council was formed in response.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> [[Galadriel]] had hoped Gandalf would lead the Council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the [[One Ring]] would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river [[Anduin]] to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the [[Gladden Fields]] where [[Isildur]] had been killed.<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T/><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\n\"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' elaborates upon the story behind ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and [[Thorin Oakenshield]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-king in exile, in the inn of the ''Prancing Pony'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with [[Sauron]], and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If [[Rivendell]] were to be attacked, the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of [[Erebor]] from Smaug, and so the quest was born.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, 3, \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\"</ref>\n\n===''The Hobbit''===\n\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of ''The Hobbit''. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative. To the quest, Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 1, \"An Unexpected Party\"</ref> On this quest Gandalf finds his sword, ''[[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]]'', in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll's]] treasure hoard.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 2, \"Roast Mutton\"</ref> Elrond informs them this sword was made in [[Gondolin]], a city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 3, \"A Short Rest\"</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from the [[Misty Mountains]] pursued by goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|warg]]s, the party is carried to safety by the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 6, \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\"</ref> Gandalf then persuades [[Beorn]] to house and provision the company for the trip through [[Mirkwood]]. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 7, \"Queer Lodgings\"</ref>\n\nHe turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of [[Esgaroth]] and the [[Mirkwood Elves]] will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 17, \"The Clouds Burst\"</ref> After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the [[One Ring]] to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 19, \"The Last Stage\"</ref> Then the Council \"put forth its power\" and drives Sauron from [[Dol Guldur]]. Sauron, however, has anticipated this and withdraws as a feint, only to reappear in [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\n====Gandalf the Grey====\n\nAs explained in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gandalf spends the years between ''The Hobbit'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' traveling [[Middle-earth]] in search of information on [[Sauron]]'s resurgence and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s mysterious [[One Ring|ring]], spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from [[Gollum]]. During this period, he befriends [[Aragorn]] and first becomes suspicious of [[Saruman]]. He spends as much time as he can in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many [[fireworks]] for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears, Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for [[Rivendell]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He find some answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also wants to question Gollum, who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nReturning to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing [[One Ring|the Ring]] into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and urges him to take it to [[Rivendell]], for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of [[Sauron]] will be searching for him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters [[Radagast the Brown]], another wizard, who brings the news that the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] have ridden forth out of Mordor\u2014and a request from [[Saruman]] that Gandalf come to [[Isengard]]. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGwaihir sets Gandalf down in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], where Gandalf appeals to King [[Th\u00e9oden]] for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the evil influence of [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]], Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the ''mearas'', who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf then rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it until Frodo has already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with [[Aragorn]]. He faces the Nazg\u00fbl at [[Weathertop]] but escapes after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northward.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/> Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights later.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 11, \"A Knife in the Dark\"</ref> Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nIn Rivendell, Gandalf helps [[Elrond]] drive off the Nazg\u00fbl pursuing Frodo<!--eh?--> and plays a great part in the following [[Council of Elrond|council]] as the only person who knows the full history of the Ring. He also reveals that Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo\u2014now the Ring-bearer\u2014in his quest. He also persuades Elrond to let Frodo's cousins [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] join the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\n{{Quote box|\n |quote  = The Balrog reached the bridge.

The name ''[[Gandalf (Norse mythology)|Gandalf]]'' is found in at least one more place in Norse myth, in the semi-historical [[Heimskringla]], which briefly describes [[Gandalf Alfgeirsson]], a legendary Norse king from eastern Norway and rival of [[Halfdan the Black]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/ |title=Halfdan the Black Saga (Ch. 1.

In English literature, Nelson notes, [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' has the wizard Merlin teaching and directing [[King Arthur|Arthur]] to begin his journeys.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He is a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]], one of the ''Istari'' order, and the leader of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. Tolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the [[Old Norse]] [[Dvergatal|\"Catalogue of Dwarves\" (''Dvergatal'')]] in the ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1''. \n\nAs a wizard and the bearer of a [[Rings of Power|Ring of Power]], Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge, and travelling continually, always focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. He is associated with fire, his ring being [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, and he both delights in [[fireworks]] to entertain the [[hobbit]]s of [[the Shire]], and in great need uses fire as a weapon. As one of the [[Maiar]] he is an immortal spirit, but being in a physical body on Middle-earth, he can be killed in battle, as he is by the [[Balrog]] from [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. He is sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission, now as Gandalf the White and leader of the Istari.\n\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an [[angel]] incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] who assisted [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[The Aeneid]]'', or to Virgil himself in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; and as a [[Christ]]-figure, a [[prophet]].\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Emblema Gandalf.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Cirth|Certh]] [[rune]] no. 19 \"G\", used by Gandalf as a personal [[sign]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]]]]\n\n===Etymology===\n\nTolkien derived the name ''Gandalf'' from ''[[Gandalf (mythology)|Gand\u00e1lfr]]'', a [[Norse dwarf|dwarf]] in the [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'s ''Dvergatal'', a list of dwarf-names.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D. Rateliff |series=[[The History of The Hobbit]] |volume=2 |title=Return to Bag-End |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |date=2007 |page=Appendix III |nopp=true |isbn=0-00-725066-5}}</ref> In [[Old Norse]], the name means ''staff-elf''. This is reflected in his name ''Thark\u00fbn'', which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man' \" in [[Khuzdul]], one of [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's invented languages]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===In-universe names===\n\nGandalf is given several names and nicknames in Tolkien's writings. Gandalf himself says, \"Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir{{efn|Meaning \"Grey Pilgrim\"}} among the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], Thark\u00fbn to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], [[#Valinor|Ol\u00f3rin I was in my youth in the West]] that is forgotten, in the South Inc\u00e1nus, in the North ''Gandalf''; to [[Rh\u00fbn|the East]] I go not.\"<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 5, \"The Window on the West\"</ref> In an early manuscript version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', he is called Bladorthin.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D. Rateliff |series=[[The History of The Hobbit]] |volume=1 |title=Mr. Baggins |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |date=2007 |page=Chapter I(b) |nopp=true |isbn=0-00-725066-5}}</ref>\n\nEach [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizard]] is distinguished by the colour of his cloak. For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf ''the Grey'', and Grey[[wikt:hame|hame]]. ''Mithrandir'' is a name in [[Sindarin]] meaning \"the Grey Pilgrim\" or \"the Grey Wanderer\". Midway through ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed [[#Gandalf the White|Gandalf the White]]. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as ''Mithrandir''. At times in ''The Lord of the Rings'', other characters address Gandalf by disparaging nicknames:Stormcrow, ''L\u00e1thspell'' (\"Ill-news\" in [[Old English]]), and \"Grey Fool\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in [[Middle-earth]], one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a [[Magic (Middle-earth)#Magic items|staff]]\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> Yet the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[C\u00edrdan]] who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven [[Three Rings|Ring of Power]] called [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] later in the same essay:<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n{{blockquote|Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of [[Sauron]], opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of the North Gandalf 'the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>}}\n\n==Fictional biography==\n\n===Valinor===\n\nIn [[Valinor]], Gandalf was called ''Ol\u00f3rin''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala [[Manw\u00eb]]; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and [[Nienna]], the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards (Istari)]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed [[Sauron]], Ol\u00f3rin was proposed by Manw\u00eb. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 4, ch. 2, \"The Istari\"</ref>\n\nAs one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol\u00f3rin was in service to the Creator ([[Eru Il\u00favatar]]) and the Creator's '[[Secret Fire]]'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===Middle-earth===\n\nThe Istari arrived in [[Middle-earth]] separately, early in the [[Third Age]]; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but [[C\u00edrdan]] the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Saruman]], the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other [[ring-bearers]] at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C\u00edrdan, was the holder of the third of the [[Three Rings|Elven-rings]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate them\u2014an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The White Council====\n\nGandalf suspected early on that the [[Sauron#The Necromancer of Dol Guldur|Necromancer of Dol Guldur]] was not a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] but Sauron himself. He went to [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix B.</ref> to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force,<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> and the White Council was formed in response.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> [[Galadriel]] had hoped Gandalf would lead the Council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the [[One Ring]] would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river [[Anduin]] to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the [[Gladden Fields]] where [[Isildur]] had been killed.<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T/><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\n\"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' elaborates upon the story behind ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and [[Thorin Oakenshield]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-king in exile, in the inn of the ''Prancing Pony'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with [[Sauron]], and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If [[Rivendell]] were to be attacked, the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of [[Erebor]] from Smaug, and so the quest was born.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, 3, \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\"</ref>\n\n===''The Hobbit''===\n\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of ''The Hobbit''. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative. To the quest, Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 1, \"An Unexpected Party\"</ref> On this quest Gandalf finds his sword, ''[[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]]'', in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll's]] treasure hoard.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 2, \"Roast Mutton\"</ref> Elrond informs them this sword was made in [[Gondolin]], a city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 3, \"A Short Rest\"</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from the [[Misty Mountains]] pursued by goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|warg]]s, the party is carried to safety by the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 6, \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\"</ref> Gandalf then persuades [[Beorn]] to house and provision the company for the trip through [[Mirkwood]]. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 7, \"Queer Lodgings\"</ref>\n\nHe turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of [[Esgaroth]] and the [[Mirkwood Elves]] will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 17, \"The Clouds Burst\"</ref> After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the [[One Ring]] to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 19, \"The Last Stage\"</ref> Then the Council \"put forth its power\" and drives Sauron from [[Dol Guldur]]. Sauron, however, has anticipated this and withdraws as a feint, only to reappear in [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\n====Gandalf the Grey====\n\nAs explained in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gandalf spends the years between ''The Hobbit'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' traveling [[Middle-earth]] in search of information on [[Sauron]]'s resurgence and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s mysterious [[One Ring|ring]], spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from [[Gollum]]. During this period, he befriends [[Aragorn]] and first becomes suspicious of [[Saruman]]. He spends as much time as he can in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many [[fireworks]] for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears, Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for [[Rivendell]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He find some answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also wants to question Gollum, who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nReturning to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing [[One Ring|the Ring]] into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and urges him to take it to [[Rivendell]], for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of [[Sauron]] will be searching for him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters [[Radagast the Brown]], another wizard, who brings the news that the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] have ridden forth out of Mordor\u2014and a request from [[Saruman]] that Gandalf come to [[Isengard]]. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGwaihir sets Gandalf down in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], where Gandalf appeals to King [[Th\u00e9oden]] for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the evil influence of [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]], Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the ''mearas'', who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf then rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it until Frodo has already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with [[Aragorn]]. He faces the Nazg\u00fbl at [[Weathertop]] but escapes after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northward.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/> Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights later.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 11, \"A Knife in the Dark\"</ref> Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nIn Rivendell, Gandalf helps [[Elrond]] drive off the Nazg\u00fbl pursuing Frodo<!--eh?--> and plays a great part in the following [[Council of Elrond|council]] as the only person who knows the full history of the Ring. He also reveals that Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo\u2014now the Ring-bearer\u2014in his quest. He also persuades Elrond to let Frodo's cousins [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] join the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\n{{Quote box|\n |quote  = The Balrog reached the bridge.

It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier. Somers had deliberately driven the ship onto the reefs to prevent its foundering, thereby saving all aboard.<ref>Woodward, Hobson. ''A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest''. Viking (2009) pp. 32\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company. Major-General Sir [[John Henry Lefroy]], Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:<ref>J.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor).

It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier. Somers had deliberately driven the ship onto the reefs to prevent its foundering, thereby saving all aboard.<ref>Woodward, Hobson. ''A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest''. Viking (2009) pp. 32\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company. Major-General Sir [[John Henry Lefroy]], Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:<ref>J.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

The party won the following elections, and Japan's first conservative government with a majority was formed by 1955. It would hold majority government until 1993.\n\nThe LDP began with reforming [[Foreign relations of Japan|Japan's international relations]], ranging from entry into the [[United Nations]], to establishing diplomatic ties with the [[Soviet Union]]. Its leaders in the 1950s also made the LDP the main government party, and in all the elections of the 1950s, the LDP won the majority vote, with the only other opposition coming from [[left-wing politics]], made up of the Japan Socialist Party and the [[Japanese Communist Party]].\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1970s, the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] spent millions of dollars attempting to influence elections in Japan to favor the LDP against more leftist parties such as the Socialists and the Communists,<ref>{{cite news|title=C.I.A.

By the end of the 1970s, the LDP went into its decline, where even though it held the reins of government many scandals plagued the party, while the opposition (now joined with the [[K\u014dmeit\u014d (1962\u201398)|Komeito (Former)]]) gained momentum.\n\nIn 1976, in the wake of the [[Lockheed bribery scandals]], a handful of younger LDP Diet members broke away and established their own party, the [[New Liberal Club]] (Shin Jiyu Kurabu). A decade later, however, it was reabsorbed by the LDP.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japanese Communist Party, and the Komeito along with the international community used major pressure to have Japan switch diplomatic ties from the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] to the [[China|People's Republic of China]].\n\n[[File:Jimin Honbu at Tokyo in 2018.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the LDP in Tokyo.]]\nBy the early 1990s, the LDP's nearly four decades in power allowed it to establish a highly stable process of policy formation. This process would not have been possible if other parties had secured parliamentary majorities. LDP strength was based on an enduring, although not unchallenged, coalition of big business, small business, agriculture, professional groups, and other interests. [[Civil service of Japan|Elite bureaucrats]] collaborated closely with the party and interest groups in drafting and implementing policy. In a sense, the party's success was a result not of its internal strength but of its weakness. It lacked a strong, nationwide organization or consistent ideology with which to attract voters. Its leaders were rarely decisive, charismatic, or popular. But it functioned efficiently as a locus for matching interest group money and votes with bureaucratic power and expertise. This arrangement resulted in corruption, but the party could claim credit for helping to create economic growth and a stable, middle-class Japan.\n\n===Out of power===\nBut by 1993, the end of the miracle economy and other reasons (e.g. [[Recruit scandal]]) led to the LDP losing its majority in [[1993 Japanese general election|that year's general election]].\n\nSeven opposition parties\u2014including several formed by LDP dissidents\u2014formed a government headed by LDP dissident [[Morihiro Hosokawa]] of the [[Japan New Party]].  However, the LDP was still far and away the largest party in the House of Representatives, with well over 200 seats; no other party crossed the 80-seat mark.\n\nIn 1994, the Socialist Party and [[New Party Sakigake]] left the ruling coalition, joining the LDP in the opposition. The remaining members of the coalition tried to stay in power as a makeshift minority government, but this failed when the LDP and the Socialists, bitter rivals for 40 years, formed a majority coalition.  The new government was dominated by the LDP, but it allowed a Socialist to occupy the Prime Minister's chair until 1996, when the LDP's [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]] took over.\n\n===1996\u20132009===\nIn the [[1996 Japanese general election|1996 election]], the LDP made some gains, but was still 12 seats short of a majority.  However, no other party could possibly form a government, and Hashimoto formed a solidly LDP minority government.  Through a series of floor-crossings, the LDP regained its majority within a year.\n\nThe party was practically unopposed until 1998, when the opposition [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|Democratic Party of Japan]] was formed. This marked the beginning of the opposing parties' gains in momentum, especially in the 2003 and 2004 Parliamentary Elections, that wouldn't slow for another 12 years.\n\nIn the dramatically paced 2003 House of Representatives elections, the LDP won 237 seats, while the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|DPJ]] won 177 seats. In the 2004 [[House of Councillors]] elections, in the seats up for grabs, the LDP won 49 seats and the DPJ 50, though in all seats (including those uncontested) the LDP still had a total of 114. Because of this electoral loss, former Secretary General [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] turned in his resignation, but Party President Koizumi merely demoted him in rank, and he was replaced by [[Tsutomu Takebe]].\n\nOn 10 November 2003, the [[New Conservative Party (Japan)|New Conservative Party]] (''Hoshu Shint\u014d'') was absorbed into the LDP, a move which was largely because of the New Conservative Party's poor showing in the 2003 general election.  The LDP formed a coalition with the conservative [[Buddhist]] [[New Komeito]].\n\nAfter a victory in the [[2005 Japan general election]], the LDP held an absolute majority in the Japanese [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] and formed a coalition government with the [[New Komeito Party]]. Abe succeeded then-Prime Minister [[Junichir\u014d Koizumi]] as the president of the party on 20 September 2006. The party suffered a major defeat in the election of 2007, however, and lost its majority in the [[House of Councillors|upper house]] for the first time in its history.\n\nThe LDP remained the largest party in both houses of the Diet, until 29 July 2007, when the LDP [[2007 Japanese House of Councillors election|lost its majority in the upper house]].<ref>{{cite news|author=[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/norimitsu_onishi/index.html Norimitsu Onishi] |author2=Yasuko Kamiizumi |author3=Makiko Inoue |title=Premier's Party Suffers Big Defeat in Japan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/world/asia/29cnd-japan.html?ex=1343361600&en=7b98d2dcaceb08e5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |newspaper=The New York Times |date=29 July 2007 |accessdate=29 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[2007 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|party leadership election]] held on 23 September 2007, the LDP elected [[Yasuo Fukuda]] as its president.

Its members hold a variety of positions that could be broadly defined as being to the right of the opposition parties. The LDP is usually considered politically inclined based on [[conservatism]] and [[Japanese nationalism]]. The LDP traditionally identified itself with a number of general goals: rapid, export-based economic growth; close [[United States-Japan relations|cooperation with the United States]] in foreign and defense policies; and several newer issues, such as administrative reform. Administrative reform encompassed several themes: simplification and streamlining of government bureaucracy; [[privatization]] of [[Japanese public corporations|state-owned enterprises]]; and adoption of measures, including [[tax reform]], in preparation for the expected strain on the economy posed by an aging society. Other priorities in the early 1990s included the promotion of a more active and positive role for Japan in the rapidly developing Asia-Pacific region, the internationalization of Japan's economy by the [[liberalization]] and promotion of domestic demand (expected to lead to the creation of a [[High tech|high-technology]] [[information society]]) and the promotion of scientific research. A business-inspired commitment to [[free enterprise]] was tempered by the insistence of important small business and [[Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan|agricultural constituencies]] on some form of [[protectionism]] and [[Subsidy|subsidies]].<ref>The Liberal Democratic Party \u2013 {{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/japan/122.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103011921/http://countrystudies.us/japan/122.htm |archivedate=3 November 2016  }}</ref> In addition, the LDP opposes the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]].<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\"/>\n\n===Historical===\nLDP is conservative party, however in the case of the LDP administration under the [[1955 System]] in Japan, their degree of economic control was stronger than that of the western conservative government and in a position close to [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"Yuhikaku\">{{cite book |last1=Kume |first1=Ikuo |author-link1=:ja:\u4e45\u7c73\u90c1\u7537 |last2=Kawade |first2=Yoshie |author-link2=:ja:\u5ddd\u51fa\u826f\u679d |last3=Kojo |first3=Yoshiko |author-link3=:ja:\u53e4\u57ce\u4f73\u5b50 |last4=Tanaka |first4=Aiji |author-link4=:ja:\u7530\u4e2d\u611b\u6cbb |last5=Mabuchi |first5=Masaru |author-link5=:ja:\u771f\u6e15\u52dd |year=2011 |title=Political Science: Scope and Theory, revised ed. |series=New Liberal Arts Selection |language=ja |publisher=[[Yuhikaku Publishing]] |page=26 |isbn=978-4-641-05377-9 |quote={{lang|ja|\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u306e55\u5e74\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u306e\u81ea\u6c11\u515a\u653f\u6a29\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306f\u6b27\u7c73\u306e\u4fdd\u5b88\u653f\u6a29\u306b\u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3068\u304b\u306a\u308a\u7d4c\u6e08\u7684\u7d71\u5236\u306e\u5ea6\u5408\u3044\u304c\u5f37\u304f\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u6c11\u4e3b\u4e3b\u7fa9\u306b\u3088\u308a\u8fd1\u3044\u5834\u6240\u306b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3057\u305f\u3002}} }}</ref> Since the 1970s, the oil crisis has slowed economic growth and increased the resistance of urban citizens to policies that favor farmers.<ref name=\"Iio\">{{cite book |last1=Iio |first1=Jun |author-link1=:ja:\u98ef\u5c3e\u6f64 |year=2019 |title=Gendai nihon no seiji |series=H\u014ds\u014d daigaku ky\u014dzai |language=ja |publisher=[[:ja:\u653e\u9001\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u632f\u8208\u4f1a|H\u014ds\u014d daigaku ky\u014diku shink\u014dkai]] |page=104 |isbn=978-4-595-31946-4 }}</ref> To maintain its dominant position, the LDP sought to expand party supporters by incorporating social security policies and pollution measures advocated by opposition parties.<ref name=\"Iio\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Populism sidebar}}\n{{Conservatism sidebar}}\nAt the apex of the LDP's formal organization is the {{Nihongo|[[#Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party|president]]|\u7dcf\u88c1|s\u014dsai}}, who can serve three<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/new-rules-give-japans-abe-chance-to-lead-until-2021|title=New rules give Japan's Shinzo Abe chance to lead until 2021|last=seokhwai@st|date=5 March 2017|website=The Straits Times}}</ref> three-year terms (The presidential term was increased from two years to three years in 2002, and from two to three terms in 2017). When the party has a parliamentary majority, the party president is the [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]]. The choice of party president is formally that of a party convention composed of [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] members and local LDP figures, but in most cases, they merely approved the joint decision of the most powerful party leaders. To make the system more democratic, Prime Minister [[Takeo Fukuda]] introduced a \"primary\" system in 1978, which opened the balloting to some 1.5 million LDP members. The process was so costly and acrimonious, however, that it was subsequently abandoned in favor of the old \"smoke-filled room\" method&nbsp;\u2014 so-called in allusion to the notion of closed discussions held in small rooms filled with [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]].\n\nAfter the party president, the most important LDP officials are the Secretary-General (''kanjicho''), and the chairmen of the LDP Executive Council (''somukaicho'') and of the {{Nihongo|Policy Affairs Research Council or \"PARC\"|\u653f\u52d9\u8abf\u67fb\u4f1a|seimu ch\u014dsakai}}.\n\nThe LDP is the most \"traditionally Japanese\" of the political parties because it relies on a complex network of patron-client (''oyabun-kobun'') relationships on both national and local levels. Nationally, a system of factions in both the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] and the [[House of Councillors]] ties individual Diet members to powerful party leaders. Locally, Diet members have to maintain ''[[koenkai]]'' (local support groups) to keep in touch with public opinion and gain votes and financial backing. The importance and pervasiveness of personal ties between Diet members and faction leaders and between citizens and Diet members gives the party a pragmatic \"you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours\" character. Its success depends less on generalized mass appeal than on the so-called ''sanban'' (three \"ban\"): ''jiban'' (a strong, well-organized constituency), ''kaban'' (a briefcase full of money), and ''kanban'' (prestigious appointment, particularly on the cabinet level).\n\n===Leadership===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"|Position\n! scope=\"col\"|Name\n! scope=\"col\"|Faction\n|-\n!|[[#Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party|President]]\n|[[Shinz\u014d Abe]]\n|[[Hiroyuki Hosoda|Hosoda]] (Seiwa Seisaku Kenky\u016b-kai)\n|-\n!|Deputy leader\n|[[Masahiko K\u014dmura]]\n|[[Tar\u014d As\u014d|As\u014d]] (Shik\u014d-kai)\n|-\n!|Secretary-General\n|[[Toshihiro Nikai]]\n|Nikai (Shisui-kai)\n|-\n!|Vice Secretary-General\n|[[K\u014dichi Hagiuda]]\n|Hosoda\n|-\n!rowspan=3 |Deputy Secretary-General\n|[[Motoo Hayashi]]\n|As\u014d\n|-\n|[[Katsutoshi Kaneda]]\n|[[Wataru Takeshita|Takeshita]] (Heisei Kenky\u016b-kai)\n|-\n|[[Naoki Okada]]\n|Hosoda\n|-\n!|Policy Affairs Research Council chief\n|[[Fumio Kishida]]\n|Kishida (K\u014dchi-kai)\n|-\n!|Financial Affairs Committee chief\n|[[Y\u016bji Yamamoto]]\n|Ishiba (Suigetsu-kai)\n|-\n!|Election Campaign Committee chief\n|[[Ry\u016b Shionoya]]\n|Hosoda\n|-\n!|Party Organization general manager\n|[[Taimei Yamaguchi]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|Public Relations general manager\n|[[Takuya Hirai]]\n|Kishida\n|-\n!|Diet Affairs Committee chief\n|[[Hiroshi Moriyama]]\n|[[Nobuteru Ishihara|Ishihara]] (Kinmirai Seiji Kenky\u016b-kai)\n|-\n!|Chief Party Whip\n|[[Akiko Sant\u014d]]\n|As\u014d\n|-\n!|[[House of Representatives (Japan)|Representatives]] General Council chief\n|[[Hajime Funada]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|General Affairs Council chief\n|[[Wataru Takeshita]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|Joint House General Council chief\n|[[Hidehisa Otsuji]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|[[House of Councillors (Japan)|Councillors]] General Council chief\n|[[Seiko Hashimoto]]\n|Hosoda\n|-\n!|Councillors General Council Secretary-General\n|[[Hiromi Yoshida]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|Councillors Policy Affairs Council chief\n|[[Keiz\u014d Takemi]]\n|As\u014d\n|-\n!|Councillors Diet Affairs Committee chief\n|[[Masakazu Sekiguchi]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|[[:ja:\u81ea\u7531\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a\u4e2d\u592e\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b66\u9662|Central Political Graduate School]] director\n|[[Takeshi Iwaya]]\n|As\u014d\n|}\n\n==Factions==\n{{Main|Factions in the Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)}}\n\n==Membership==\n\nThe LDP had over five million party members in 1990. By December 2017 membership had dropped to approximately one million members.<ref name=\"jimin1\"/>\n\n==Performance in national elections until 1993==\n{{See also|Elections in Japan}}\nElection statistics show that, while the LDP had been able to secure a majority in the twelve House of Representatives elections from May 1958 to February 1990, with only three exceptions (December 1976, October 1979, and December 1983), its share of the popular vote had declined from a high of 57.8 percent in May 1958 to a low of 41.8 percent in December 1976, when voters expressed their disgust with the party's involvement in the [[Lockheed bribery scandals#Japan|Lockheed scandal]]. The LDP vote rose again between 1979 and 1990. Although the LDP won an unprecedented 300 seats in the July 1986 balloting, its share of the popular vote remained just under 50 percent. The figure was 46.2 percent in February 1990. Following the three occasions when the LDP found itself a handful of seats shy of a majority, it was obliged to form alliances with conservative independents and the breakaway New Liberal Club. In a cabinet appointment after the October 1983 balloting, a non-LDP minister, a member of the New Liberal Club, was appointed for the first time. On 18 July 1993, lower house elections, the LDP fell so far short of a majority that it was unable to form a government.\n\nIn the upper house, the July 1989 election represented the first time that the LDP was forced into a minority position. In previous elections, it had either secured a majority on its own or recruited non-LDP conservatives to make up the difference of a few seats.\n\nThe political crisis of 1988\u201389 was testimony to both the party's strength and its weakness. In the wake of a succession of issues\u2014the pushing of a highly unpopular [[Consumption tax|consumer tax]] through the Diet in late 1988, the [[Recruit scandal|Recruit insider trading scandal]], which tainted virtually all top LDP leaders and forced the resignation of Prime Minister [[Takeshita Noboru]] in April (a successor did not appear until June), the resignation in July of his successor, [[Uno S\u014dsuke]], because of a sex scandal, and the poor showing in the upper house election\u2014the media provided the Japanese with a detailed and embarrassing dissection of the political system. By March 1989, popular support for the Takeshita cabinet as expressed in public opinion polls had fallen to 9 percent. Uno's scandal, covered in magazine interviews of a \"kiss and tell\" [[geisha]], aroused the fury of female voters.\n\nUno's successor, the eloquent if obscure [[Kaifu Toshiki]], was successful in repairing the party's battered image. By January 1990, talk of the waning of conservative power and a possible socialist government had given way to the realization that, like the Lockheed affair of the mid-1970s, the Recruit scandal did not signal a significant change in who ruled Japan. The February 1990 general election gave the LDP, including affiliated independents, a comfortable, if not spectacular, majority: 275 of 512 total representatives.\n\nIn October 1991, Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki failed to attain passage of a political reform bill and was rejected by the LDP, despite his popularity with the electorate. He was replaced as prime minister by [[Miyazawa Kiichi]], a long-time LDP stalwart. Defections from the LDP began in the spring of 1992, when [[Hosokawa Morihiro]] left the LDP to form the [[Japan New Party]]. Later, in the summer of 1993, when the Miyazawa government also failed to pass political reform legislation, thirty-nine LDP members joined the opposition in a no-confidence vote. In the ensuing lower house election, more than fifty LDP members formed the [[Shinseit\u014d]] and the [[New Party Sakigake|Sakigake]] parties, denying the LDP the majority needed to form a government.\n\n==Leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party==\nWith the exception of Yohei Kono and Sadakazu Tanigaki, every {{nihongo|'''Leader of the

The party won the following elections, and Japan's first conservative government with a majority was formed by 1955. It would hold majority government until 1993.\n\nThe LDP began with reforming [[Foreign relations of Japan|Japan's international relations]], ranging from entry into the [[United Nations]], to establishing diplomatic ties with the [[Soviet Union]]. Its leaders in the 1950s also made the LDP the main government party, and in all the elections of the 1950s, the LDP won the majority vote, with the only other opposition coming from [[left-wing politics]], made up of the Japan Socialist Party and the [[Japanese Communist Party]].\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1970s, the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] spent millions of dollars attempting to influence elections in Japan to favor the LDP against more leftist parties such as the Socialists and the Communists,<ref>{{cite news|title=C.I.A.

By the end of the 1970s, the LDP went into its decline, where even though it held the reins of government many scandals plagued the party, while the opposition (now joined with the [[K\u014dmeit\u014d (1962\u201398)|Komeito (Former)]]) gained momentum.\n\nIn 1976, in the wake of the [[Lockheed bribery scandals]], a handful of younger LDP Diet members broke away and established their own party, the [[New Liberal Club]] (Shin Jiyu Kurabu). A decade later, however, it was reabsorbed by the LDP.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japanese Communist Party, and the Komeito along with the international community used major pressure to have Japan switch diplomatic ties from the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] to the [[China|People's Republic of China]].\n\n[[File:Jimin Honbu at Tokyo in 2018.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the LDP in Tokyo.]]\nBy the early 1990s, the LDP's nearly four decades in power allowed it to establish a highly stable process of policy formation. This process would not have been possible if other parties had secured parliamentary majorities. LDP strength was based on an enduring, although not unchallenged, coalition of big business, small business, agriculture, professional groups, and other interests. [[Civil service of Japan|Elite bureaucrats]] collaborated closely with the party and interest groups in drafting and implementing policy. In a sense, the party's success was a result not of its internal strength but of its weakness. It lacked a strong, nationwide organization or consistent ideology with which to attract voters. Its leaders were rarely decisive, charismatic, or popular. But it functioned efficiently as a locus for matching interest group money and votes with bureaucratic power and expertise. This arrangement resulted in corruption, but the party could claim credit for helping to create economic growth and a stable, middle-class Japan.\n\n===Out of power===\nBut by 1993, the end of the miracle economy and other reasons (e.g. [[Recruit scandal]]) led to the LDP losing its majority in [[1993 Japanese general election|that year's general election]].\n\nSeven opposition parties\u2014including several formed by LDP dissidents\u2014formed a government headed by LDP dissident [[Morihiro Hosokawa]] of the [[Japan New Party]].  However, the LDP was still far and away the largest party in the House of Representatives, with well over 200 seats; no other party crossed the 80-seat mark.\n\nIn 1994, the Socialist Party and [[New Party Sakigake]] left the ruling coalition, joining the LDP in the opposition. The remaining members of the coalition tried to stay in power as a makeshift minority government, but this failed when the LDP and the Socialists, bitter rivals for 40 years, formed a majority coalition.  The new government was dominated by the LDP, but it allowed a Socialist to occupy the Prime Minister's chair until 1996, when the LDP's [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]] took over.\n\n===1996\u20132009===\nIn the [[1996 Japanese general election|1996 election]], the LDP made some gains, but was still 12 seats short of a majority.  However, no other party could possibly form a government, and Hashimoto formed a solidly LDP minority government.  Through a series of floor-crossings, the LDP regained its majority within a year.\n\nThe party was practically unopposed until 1998, when the opposition [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|Democratic Party of Japan]] was formed. This marked the beginning of the opposing parties' gains in momentum, especially in the 2003 and 2004 Parliamentary Elections, that wouldn't slow for another 12 years.\n\nIn the dramatically paced 2003 House of Representatives elections, the LDP won 237 seats, while the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|DPJ]] won 177 seats. In the 2004 [[House of Councillors]] elections, in the seats up for grabs, the LDP won 49 seats and the DPJ 50, though in all seats (including those uncontested) the LDP still had a total of 114. Because of this electoral loss, former Secretary General [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] turned in his resignation, but Party President Koizumi merely demoted him in rank, and he was replaced by [[Tsutomu Takebe]].\n\nOn 10 November 2003, the [[New Conservative Party (Japan)|New Conservative Party]] (''Hoshu Shint\u014d'') was absorbed into the LDP, a move which was largely because of the New Conservative Party's poor showing in the 2003 general election.  The LDP formed a coalition with the conservative [[Buddhist]] [[New Komeito]].\n\nAfter a victory in the [[2005 Japan general election]], the LDP held an absolute majority in the Japanese [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] and formed a coalition government with the [[New Komeito Party]]. Abe succeeded then-Prime Minister [[Junichir\u014d Koizumi]] as the president of the party on 20 September 2006. The party suffered a major defeat in the election of 2007, however, and lost its majority in the [[House of Councillors|upper house]] for the first time in its history.\n\nThe LDP remained the largest party in both houses of the Diet, until 29 July 2007, when the LDP [[2007 Japanese House of Councillors election|lost its majority in the upper house]].<ref>{{cite news|author=[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/norimitsu_onishi/index.html Norimitsu Onishi] |author2=Yasuko Kamiizumi |author3=Makiko Inoue |title=Premier's Party Suffers Big Defeat in Japan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/world/asia/29cnd-japan.html?ex=1343361600&en=7b98d2dcaceb08e5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |newspaper=The New York Times |date=29 July 2007 |accessdate=29 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[2007 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|party leadership election]] held on 23 September 2007, the LDP elected [[Yasuo Fukuda]] as its president.

Its members hold a variety of positions that could be broadly defined as being to the right of the opposition parties. The LDP is usually considered politically inclined based on [[conservatism]] and [[Japanese nationalism]]. The LDP traditionally identified itself with a number of general goals: rapid, export-based economic growth; close [[United States-Japan relations|cooperation with the United States]] in foreign and defense policies; and several newer issues, such as administrative reform. Administrative reform encompassed several themes: simplification and streamlining of government bureaucracy; [[privatization]] of [[Japanese public corporations|state-owned enterprises]]; and adoption of measures, including [[tax reform]], in preparation for the expected strain on the economy posed by an aging society. Other priorities in the early 1990s included the promotion of a more active and positive role for Japan in the rapidly developing Asia-Pacific region, the internationalization of Japan's economy by the [[liberalization]] and promotion of domestic demand (expected to lead to the creation of a [[High tech|high-technology]] [[information society]]) and the promotion of scientific research. A business-inspired commitment to [[free enterprise]] was tempered by the insistence of important small business and [[Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan|agricultural constituencies]] on some form of [[protectionism]] and [[Subsidy|subsidies]].<ref>The Liberal Democratic Party \u2013 {{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/japan/122.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103011921/http://countrystudies.us/japan/122.htm |archivedate=3 November 2016  }}</ref> In addition, the LDP opposes the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]].<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\"/>\n\n===Historical===\nLDP is conservative party, however in the case of the LDP administration under the [[1955 System]] in Japan, their degree of economic control was stronger than that of the western conservative government and in a position close to [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"Yuhikaku\">{{cite book |last1=Kume |first1=Ikuo |author-link1=:ja:\u4e45\u7c73\u90c1\u7537 |last2=Kawade |first2=Yoshie |author-link2=:ja:\u5ddd\u51fa\u826f\u679d |last3=Kojo |first3=Yoshiko |author-link3=:ja:\u53e4\u57ce\u4f73\u5b50 |last4=Tanaka |first4=Aiji |author-link4=:ja:\u7530\u4e2d\u611b\u6cbb |last5=Mabuchi |first5=Masaru |author-link5=:ja:\u771f\u6e15\u52dd |year=2011 |title=Political Science: Scope and Theory, revised ed. |series=New Liberal Arts Selection |language=ja |publisher=[[Yuhikaku Publishing]] |page=26 |isbn=978-4-641-05377-9 |quote={{lang|ja|\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u306e55\u5e74\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u306e\u81ea\u6c11\u515a\u653f\u6a29\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306f\u6b27\u7c73\u306e\u4fdd\u5b88\u653f\u6a29\u306b\u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3068\u304b\u306a\u308a\u7d4c\u6e08\u7684\u7d71\u5236\u306e\u5ea6\u5408\u3044\u304c\u5f37\u304f\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u6c11\u4e3b\u4e3b\u7fa9\u306b\u3088\u308a\u8fd1\u3044\u5834\u6240\u306b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3057\u305f\u3002}} }}</ref> Since the 1970s, the oil crisis has slowed economic growth and increased the resistance of urban citizens to policies that favor farmers.<ref name=\"Iio\">{{cite book |last1=Iio |first1=Jun |author-link1=:ja:\u98ef\u5c3e\u6f64 |year=2019 |title=Gendai nihon no seiji |series=H\u014ds\u014d daigaku ky\u014dzai |language=ja |publisher=[[:ja:\u653e\u9001\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u632f\u8208\u4f1a|H\u014ds\u014d daigaku ky\u014diku shink\u014dkai]] |page=104 |isbn=978-4-595-31946-4 }}</ref> To maintain its dominant position, the LDP sought to expand party supporters by incorporating social security policies and pollution measures advocated by opposition parties.<ref name=\"Iio\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Populism sidebar}}\n{{Conservatism sidebar}}\nAt the apex of the LDP's formal organization is the {{Nihongo|[[#Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party|president]]|\u7dcf\u88c1|s\u014dsai}}, who can serve three<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/new-rules-give-japans-abe-chance-to-lead-until-2021|title=New rules give Japan's Shinzo Abe chance to lead until 2021|last=seokhwai@st|date=5 March 2017|website=The Straits Times}}</ref> three-year terms (The presidential term was increased from two years to three years in 2002, and from two to three terms in 2017). When the party has a parliamentary majority, the party president is the [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]]. The choice of party president is formally that of a party convention composed of [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] members and local LDP figures, but in most cases, they merely approved the joint decision of the most powerful party leaders. To make the system more democratic, Prime Minister [[Takeo Fukuda]] introduced a \"primary\" system in 1978, which opened the balloting to some 1.5 million LDP members. The process was so costly and acrimonious, however, that it was subsequently abandoned in favor of the old \"smoke-filled room\" method&nbsp;\u2014 so-called in allusion to the notion of closed discussions held in small rooms filled with [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]].\n\nAfter the party president, the most important LDP officials are the Secretary-General (''kanjicho''), and the chairmen of the LDP Executive Council (''somukaicho'') and of the {{Nihongo|Policy Affairs Research Council or \"PARC\"|\u653f\u52d9\u8abf\u67fb\u4f1a|seimu ch\u014dsakai}}.\n\nThe LDP is the most \"traditionally Japanese\" of the political parties because it relies on a complex network of patron-client (''oyabun-kobun'') relationships on both national and local levels. Nationally, a system of factions in both the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] and the [[House of Councillors]] ties individual Diet members to powerful party leaders. Locally, Diet members have to maintain ''[[koenkai]]'' (local support groups) to keep in touch with public opinion and gain votes and financial backing. The importance and pervasiveness of personal ties between Diet members and faction leaders and between citizens and Diet members gives the party a pragmatic \"you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours\" character. Its success depends less on generalized mass appeal than on the so-called ''sanban'' (three \"ban\"): ''jiban'' (a strong, well-organized constituency), ''kaban'' (a briefcase full of money), and ''kanban'' (prestigious appointment, particularly on the cabinet level).\n\n===Leadership===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"|Position\n! scope=\"col\"|Name\n! scope=\"col\"|Faction\n|-\n!|[[#Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party|President]]\n|[[Shinz\u014d Abe]]\n|[[Hiroyuki Hosoda|Hosoda]] (Seiwa Seisaku Kenky\u016b-kai)\n|-\n!|Deputy leader\n|[[Masahiko K\u014dmura]]\n|[[Tar\u014d As\u014d|As\u014d]] (Shik\u014d-kai)\n|-\n!|Secretary-General\n|[[Toshihiro Nikai]]\n|Nikai (Shisui-kai)\n|-\n!|Vice Secretary-General\n|[[K\u014dichi Hagiuda]]\n|Hosoda\n|-\n!rowspan=3 |Deputy Secretary-General\n|[[Motoo Hayashi]]\n|As\u014d\n|-\n|[[Katsutoshi Kaneda]]\n|[[Wataru Takeshita|Takeshita]] (Heisei Kenky\u016b-kai)\n|-\n|[[Naoki Okada]]\n|Hosoda\n|-\n!|Policy Affairs Research Council chief\n|[[Fumio Kishida]]\n|Kishida (K\u014dchi-kai)\n|-\n!|Financial Affairs Committee chief\n|[[Y\u016bji Yamamoto]]\n|Ishiba (Suigetsu-kai)\n|-\n!|Election Campaign Committee chief\n|[[Ry\u016b Shionoya]]\n|Hosoda\n|-\n!|Party Organization general manager\n|[[Taimei Yamaguchi]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|Public Relations general manager\n|[[Takuya Hirai]]\n|Kishida\n|-\n!|Diet Affairs Committee chief\n|[[Hiroshi Moriyama]]\n|[[Nobuteru Ishihara|Ishihara]] (Kinmirai Seiji Kenky\u016b-kai)\n|-\n!|Chief Party Whip\n|[[Akiko Sant\u014d]]\n|As\u014d\n|-\n!|[[House of Representatives (Japan)|Representatives]] General Council chief\n|[[Hajime Funada]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|General Affairs Council chief\n|[[Wataru Takeshita]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|Joint House General Council chief\n|[[Hidehisa Otsuji]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|[[House of Councillors (Japan)|Councillors]] General Council chief\n|[[Seiko Hashimoto]]\n|Hosoda\n|-\n!|Councillors General Council Secretary-General\n|[[Hiromi Yoshida]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|Councillors Policy Affairs Council chief\n|[[Keiz\u014d Takemi]]\n|As\u014d\n|-\n!|Councillors Diet Affairs Committee chief\n|[[Masakazu Sekiguchi]]\n|Takeshita\n|-\n!|[[:ja:\u81ea\u7531\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a\u4e2d\u592e\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b66\u9662|Central Political Graduate School]] director\n|[[Takeshi Iwaya]]\n|As\u014d\n|}\n\n==Factions==\n{{Main|Factions in the Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)}}\n\n==Membership==\n\nThe LDP had over five million party members in 1990. By December 2017 membership had dropped to approximately one million members.<ref name=\"jimin1\"/>\n\n==Performance in national elections until 1993==\n{{See also|Elections in Japan}}\nElection statistics show that, while the LDP had been able to secure a majority in the twelve House of Representatives elections from May 1958 to February 1990, with only three exceptions (December 1976, October 1979, and December 1983), its share of the popular vote had declined from a high of 57.8 percent in May 1958 to a low of 41.8 percent in December 1976, when voters expressed their disgust with the party's involvement in the [[Lockheed bribery scandals#Japan|Lockheed scandal]]. The LDP vote rose again between 1979 and 1990. Although the LDP won an unprecedented 300 seats in the July 1986 balloting, its share of the popular vote remained just under 50 percent. The figure was 46.2 percent in February 1990. Following the three occasions when the LDP found itself a handful of seats shy of a majority, it was obliged to form alliances with conservative independents and the breakaway New Liberal Club. In a cabinet appointment after the October 1983 balloting, a non-LDP minister, a member of the New Liberal Club, was appointed for the first time. On 18 July 1993, lower house elections, the LDP fell so far short of a majority that it was unable to form a government.\n\nIn the upper house, the July 1989 election represented the first time that the LDP was forced into a minority position. In previous elections, it had either secured a majority on its own or recruited non-LDP conservatives to make up the difference of a few seats.\n\nThe political crisis of 1988\u201389 was testimony to both the party's strength and its weakness. In the wake of a succession of issues\u2014the pushing of a highly unpopular [[Consumption tax|consumer tax]] through the Diet in late 1988, the [[Recruit scandal|Recruit insider trading scandal]], which tainted virtually all top LDP leaders and forced the resignation of Prime Minister [[Takeshita Noboru]] in April (a successor did not appear until June), the resignation in July of his successor, [[Uno S\u014dsuke]], because of a sex scandal, and the poor showing in the upper house election\u2014the media provided the Japanese with a detailed and embarrassing dissection of the political system. By March 1989, popular support for the Takeshita cabinet as expressed in public opinion polls had fallen to 9 percent. Uno's scandal, covered in magazine interviews of a \"kiss and tell\" [[geisha]], aroused the fury of female voters.\n\nUno's successor, the eloquent if obscure [[Kaifu Toshiki]], was successful in repairing the party's battered image. By January 1990, talk of the waning of conservative power and a possible socialist government had given way to the realization that, like the Lockheed affair of the mid-1970s, the Recruit scandal did not signal a significant change in who ruled Japan. The February 1990 general election gave the LDP, including affiliated independents, a comfortable, if not spectacular, majority: 275 of 512 total representatives.\n\nIn October 1991, Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki failed to attain passage of a political reform bill and was rejected by the LDP, despite his popularity with the electorate. He was replaced as prime minister by [[Miyazawa Kiichi]], a long-time LDP stalwart. Defections from the LDP began in the spring of 1992, when [[Hosokawa Morihiro]] left the LDP to form the [[Japan New Party]]. Later, in the summer of 1993, when the Miyazawa government also failed to pass political reform legislation, thirty-nine LDP members joined the opposition in a no-confidence vote. In the ensuing lower house election, more than fifty LDP members formed the [[Shinseit\u014d]] and the [[New Party Sakigake|Sakigake]] parties, denying the LDP the majority needed to form a government.\n\n==Leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party==\nWith the exception of Yohei Kono and Sadakazu Tanigaki, every {{nihongo|'''Leader of the

Taking place every February since 2000, LIMUN has established itself as Europe's largest such conference at university-level,<ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/company/london-international-model-united-nations LIMUN's Linkedin page].</ref> bringing together over 1500 students \u2013 with some high school students and recent graduates \u2013 to deliberate on issues of global concern.

Other notable committees include the Bandung Conference, the UN Security Council, and Council of Marvel.

Model UN has an essential message to convey: all men, women and children, regardless of where they live or where they come from, are deserving of [[equality before the law|equal]] [[egalitarianism|concern and respect]]; all human beings, anywhere and everywhere, form part of one single grand community, indivisible. Nations may be of importance for one's self-conception and identification, but are of no concern to [[morality|moral deliberation]] \u2013 states even less so, which are considered naught but imaginary lines drawn arbitrarily. As such, each is a [[global citizenship|citizen of the world]].<ref>Dal\u00ed ten Hove. [https://drive.google.com/?tab=wo&authuser=0#my-drive \"The purposes and benefits of Model United Nations and LIMUN\"].</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Trustees, secretariat and logistics staff===\n\nThe London International Model United Nations annual conference is organised by the [[trustee]]s, the [[secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], and the Logistics Staff.\n\nAs LIMUN is a [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|registered charity]], it must be run by a Board of Trustees which bears  responsibility for the charity. These trustees are, in essence, the governors of LIMUN, who ensure that the organisation attains its goals and adheres to Charity Law.<ref>[http://limun.org.uk/search?term=trustees \"Meet the Trustees\"].</ref>\n\nThese trustees delegate the task of organising the conference to the Organising Committee, known as the Secretariat. The Secretariat is a group of students from the various colleges of the [[University of London]] and other London-based universities, who give their time freely to organise the annual Model United Nations conference. Under the leadership of the Secretary-General, who supervises the Secretariat, they deal with tasks such as: advertising the conference and coordinating applications, managing the [[outreach]] programme, selecting Directors. The next Secretary-General is elected by the Board of Trustees and the previous Secretariat soon after the previous conference, and is then left to select the rest of the new Secretariat. Positions and roles may differ from year to year.\n\nIn addition to the trustees and the Secretariat, LIMUN recruits volunteers, called the Logistics Staff, who help with a great variety of tasks to ensure the smooth running of the conference, including: preparation of the conference venue, the social programme venue, and assisting directors with the operation of the committee sessions.<ref>[http://limun.org.uk/about.html#volunteering-opportunities \"Volunteering Opportunities\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731163939/http://limun.org.uk/about.html#volunteering-opportunities#volunteering-opportunities |date=31 July 2013 }}.</ref>\n\n===Committees, directors and delegates===\n\nAt a MUN conference, the bulk of a participant's time is spent during committee sessions, which is when debate takes place. Committees, at LIMUN, are classified into three levels of difficulty: beginner, intermediate and advanced. Committees differ from year to year depending on the whims of the Secretariat and the number of attending delegates; yet, certain core ones are retained, such as the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] committees (namely DISEC, ECOFIN, SOCHUM and SPECPOL), the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]], some [[Model United Nations#Simulations|Crisis Committees]], and the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ).\n\nEach of these committees is then headed by two or three chairpersons which together form the Dais. One serves as the director, and the others as assistant directors, whom are selected by the Under-Secretary-General for Chairs. The director is a highly experienced member of the Model UN community who have attended many conferences as delegate, but also has previous Dais experience; the assistant directors are also experienced as delegates, and have most likely served as chair before at other conferences.\n\nThese directors submit a number of potential topics of discussion to the Secretariat, who then reviews and selects two or three for debate during the conference. Once the topics are chosen, the Directors write a Study Guide/Research Report for each topic so that delegates may have an effective source from which to commence their research. Delegates are then asked to submit a [[Model United Nations#position papers|Position Paper]] \u2013 a document that outlines the views of their state on each of the topics \u2013 to the committee Director.\n\nIn February, when the LIMUN conference takes place, directors and delegates of a specific committee convene to let debate take its course. The sizes of committees differ very much from, for instance, the 15 members of the Security Council to about 70 in DISEC, but the rules are broadly the same, except for special agencies like the ICJ. Delegates, who each represent a country, are the speakers of the committee and give course to debate: by collective vote they determine in what order of topics the agenda is set, what to discuss, when and for how long, and ultimately which proposed resolutions are to be accepted and which are not. Directors, for their part, regulate the debate by choosing which speakers to entertain and at times suggesting potential courses of action. They also review Working Papers (delegates\u2019 very rough drafts of resolutions to be presented to the committee), Draft Resolutions (proposed resolutions) and Amendments (suggested modifications to draft resolutions) upon their submission. Below follows a general outline of a committee-sessions\u2019 flow of debate:\n[[File:LIMUN delegates in committee 2011.jpg|thumb|Delegates voting in committee-session at LIMUN 2011.|175x175px]]\n*Setting the agenda;\n*Entertaining delegates on the General Speaker's List;\n*Holding moderated and unmoderated caucuses on:\n**General ideas,\n**Working papers,\n**Draft resolutions,\n**Amendments on draft resolutions;\n*Adopting or rejecting draft resolutions.\n\n===Press===\n\nEach year, LIMUN also has a press team that roams around the committees, observing what occurs. Their work includes the production of interviews with keynote speakers, Secretariat members, delegates and chairs, the production of videos and photographs of the conference, and written pieces on the development of events both in committee sessions and the conference as a whole.<ref>[http://limunlive.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/limun-eye/ LIMUN Press 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111060714/http://limunlive.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/limun-eye/ |date=11 January 2014 }}.</ref>\n<!-- commenting out -- Wikipedia Style does not permit all-caps: \n===Awards===\n\nSuccess at an MUN conference is far from determined by the receiving or not receiving of awards, yet LIMUN does issue award certificates in recognition of the outstanding effort, skill and active partaking of some as a symbol of accomplishment. Currently, the distribution of LIMUN awards is as follows:\n\n*CRISIS COMMITTEES, SECURITY COUNCIL\n**Diplomacy Awards [[File:Best Delegation prize.jpg|thumb|500px|Secretary-General Anmol Arora handing out the Best Delegation Prize at LIMUN 2012.]]\n*INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE \n**Best Advocate\n**Best Judge\n*COMMITTEES BETWEEN 20-60 DELEGATES\n**Diplomacy Awards (x2)\n*COMMITTEES WITH MORE THAN 60 DELEGATES\n**Diplomacy Awards (x3)\n*DELEGATIONS\n**Best Delegation (More than 20 Delegates)\n**Best Delegation (Between 10 and 19 Delegates)\n**Best Delegation (Less than 10 Delegates)\n''This varies at the discretion of the Conference Secretariat''\n-->\n\n===Outreach===\nLIMUN is committed to extending knowledge of international affairs, and other benefits of practising Model United Nations, to all young people; hence the Charity includes an outreach programme, working with inner-London youth groups to extend access to those whom would not otherwise have the opportunity of experiencing MUN.<ref>[http://limun.org.uk/about.html#outreach \"Outreach\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731163939/http://limun.org.uk/about.html#outreach#outreach |date=31 July 2013 }}.</ref> LIMUN works with several secondary school MUN programmes, assisting with workshops, conference management and development. During LIMUN's annual conference itself, LIMUN offers scholarships to secondary school students. In 2014, LIMUN offered two expenses-paid scholarships in collaboration with [[United Nations Association \u2013 UK]], recipients of which won an essay competition laid on by LIMUN. These delegates not only represent intelligent, internationally minded youths, but also the cornerstone of a younger generation of LIMUN attendees. Their essays are published on the LIMUN website in record of their achievement and dedication to MUN.\n\nAdditionally, each year, LIMUN welcomes a number of high school students from [[Pestalozzi International Village]], a charitable organisation based in [[Surrey]] that provides education to bright youths of less economically developed countries. In addition to providing for a group of these students each year, LIMUN sends secretariat members to the school to run various MUN training workshops in preparation for their attendance at LIMUN.\n\n===Venues===\nSince 2011, LIMUN's committee sessions and closing ceremony have taken place at [[Imperial College London]] and, since its 2013 edition, registration and the opening ceremony at [[Central Hall Westminster]]. The venues for the social event are susceptible to change every year.\n\nCentral Hall Westminster, where the first session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] was held in 1946, is a conference centre in [[Central London]], built between 1905 and 1911 as a [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church but also as \"a meeting place for all people, regardless of religious persuasion\u2026 for conferences on religious, educational, scientific, philanthropic and social questions\".<ref name=background/> As such, the Hall has housed meetings of historical significance: there, British [[Suffragette]]s campaigned for women's rights in 1914, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] founded the [[Free French Forces]] following the initial [[Battle of France|defeat of France]], and [[Winston Churchill]] addressed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1945. There, also, during the first meeting of the UN General Assembly, the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and [[International Court of Justice]] were founded, and [[Trygve Lie]] was elected the first [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]]. It continues serving as a centre for political conferences.<ref name=background/>\n\nImperial College London, is a world-class university specialising in medicine, engineering, business and the natural sciences; it used to be a college of the University of London and is located in the [[South Kensington]] area of London.\n\n===Funding===\nThe overwhelming majority of LIMUN's funds for the conference stem from the revenue acquired by delegate fees, but the charity also benefits from the generous support of sponsors. Most recently, these have included: [[Linklaters]], [[Aviva]], [[Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner]], the French and Saudi Arabian embassies, [[United Nations Association \u2013 UK|UNA-UK]], [[SOAS University of London|SOAS]], the [[Hult International Business School]] and others.<ref>[http://limun.org.uk/other.php#support \"Support\"]. ''LIMUN 2013''.</ref>\n\n==Sample schedule==\nThe majority of a delegate's time at LIMUN is spent in committee-sessions, punctuated by pre-determined breaks, social events, and other such activities.

Taking place every February since 2000, LIMUN has established itself as Europe's largest such conference at university-level,<ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/company/london-international-model-united-nations LIMUN's Linkedin page].</ref> bringing together over 1500 students \u2013 with some high school students and recent graduates \u2013 to deliberate on issues of global concern.

Model UN has an essential message to convey: all men, women and children, regardless of where they live or where they come from, are deserving of [[equality before the law|equal]] [[egalitarianism|concern and respect]]; all human beings, anywhere and everywhere, form part of one single grand community, indivisible. Nations may be of importance for one's self-conception and identification, but are of no concern to [[morality|moral deliberation]] \u2013 states even less so, which are considered naught but imaginary lines drawn arbitrarily. As such, each is a [[global citizenship|citizen of the world]].<ref>Dal\u00ed ten Hove. [https://drive.google.com/?tab=wo&authuser=0#my-drive \"The purposes and benefits of Model United Nations and LIMUN\"].</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Trustees, secretariat and logistics staff===\n\nThe London International Model United Nations annual conference is organised by the [[trustee]]s, the [[secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], and the Logistics Staff.\n\nAs LIMUN is a [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|registered charity]], it must be run by a Board of Trustees which bears  responsibility for the charity. These trustees are, in essence, the governors of LIMUN, who ensure that the organisation attains its goals and adheres to Charity Law.<ref>[http://limun.org.uk/search?term=trustees \"Meet the Trustees\"].</ref>\n\nThese trustees delegate the task of organising the conference to the Organising Committee, known as the Secretariat. The Secretariat is a group of students from the various colleges of the [[University of London]] and other London-based universities, who give their time freely to organise the annual Model United Nations conference. Under the leadership of the Secretary-General, who supervises the Secretariat, they deal with tasks such as: advertising the conference and coordinating applications, managing the [[outreach]] programme, selecting Directors. The next Secretary-General is elected by the Board of Trustees and the previous Secretariat soon after the previous conference, and is then left to select the rest of the new Secretariat. Positions and roles may differ from year to year.\n\nIn addition to the trustees and the Secretariat, LIMUN recruits volunteers, called the Logistics Staff, who help with a great variety of tasks to ensure the smooth running of the conference, including: preparation of the conference venue, the social programme venue, and assisting directors with the operation of the committee sessions.<ref>[http://limun.org.uk/about.html#volunteering-opportunities \"Volunteering Opportunities\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731163939/http://limun.org.uk/about.html#volunteering-opportunities#volunteering-opportunities |date=31 July 2013 }}.</ref>\n\n===Committees, directors and delegates===\n\nAt a MUN conference, the bulk of a participant's time is spent during committee sessions, which is when debate takes place. Committees, at LIMUN, are classified into three levels of difficulty: beginner, intermediate and advanced. Committees differ from year to year depending on the whims of the Secretariat and the number of attending delegates; yet, certain core ones are retained, such as the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] committees (namely DISEC, ECOFIN, SOCHUM and SPECPOL), the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]], some [[Model United Nations#Simulations|Crisis Committees]], and the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ).\n\nEach of these committees is then headed by two or three chairpersons which together form the Dais. One serves as the director, and the others as assistant directors, whom are selected by the Under-Secretary-General for Chairs. The director is a highly experienced member of the Model UN community who have attended many conferences as delegate, but also has previous Dais experience; the assistant directors are also experienced as delegates, and have most likely served as chair before at other conferences.\n\nThese directors submit a number of potential topics of discussion to the Secretariat, who then reviews and selects two or three for debate during the conference. Once the topics are chosen, the Directors write a Study Guide/Research Report for each topic so that delegates may have an effective source from which to commence their research. Delegates are then asked to submit a [[Model United Nations#position papers|Position Paper]] \u2013 a document that outlines the views of their state on each of the topics \u2013 to the committee Director.\n\nIn February, when the LIMUN conference takes place, directors and delegates of a specific committee convene to let debate take its course. The sizes of committees differ very much from, for instance, the 15 members of the Security Council to about 70 in DISEC, but the rules are broadly the same, except for special agencies like the ICJ. Delegates, who each represent a country, are the speakers of the committee and give course to debate: by collective vote they determine in what order of topics the agenda is set, what to discuss, when and for how long, and ultimately which proposed resolutions are to be accepted and which are not. Directors, for their part, regulate the debate by choosing which speakers to entertain and at times suggesting potential courses of action. They also review Working Papers (delegates\u2019 very rough drafts of resolutions to be presented to the committee), Draft Resolutions (proposed resolutions) and Amendments (suggested modifications to draft resolutions) upon their submission. Below follows a general outline of a committee-sessions\u2019 flow of debate:\n[[File:LIMUN delegates in committee 2011.jpg|thumb|Delegates voting in committee-session at LIMUN 2011.|175x175px]]\n*Setting the agenda;\n*Entertaining delegates on the General Speaker's List;\n*Holding moderated and unmoderated caucuses on:\n**General ideas,\n**Working papers,\n**Draft resolutions,\n**Amendments on draft resolutions;\n*Adopting or rejecting draft resolutions.\n\n===Press===\n\nEach year, LIMUN also has a press team that roams around the committees, observing what occurs. Their work includes the production of interviews with keynote speakers, Secretariat members, delegates and chairs, the production of videos and photographs of the conference, and written pieces on the development of events both in committee sessions and the conference as a whole.<ref>[http://limunlive.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/limun-eye/ LIMUN Press 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111060714/http://limunlive.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/limun-eye/ |date=11 January 2014 }}.</ref>\n<!-- commenting out -- Wikipedia Style does not permit all-caps: \n===Awards===\n\nSuccess at an MUN conference is far from determined by the receiving or not receiving of awards, yet LIMUN does issue award certificates in recognition of the outstanding effort, skill and active partaking of some as a symbol of accomplishment. Currently, the distribution of LIMUN awards is as follows:\n\n*CRISIS COMMITTEES, SECURITY COUNCIL\n**Diplomacy Awards [[File:Best Delegation prize.jpg|thumb|500px|Secretary-General Anmol Arora handing out the Best Delegation Prize at LIMUN 2012.]]\n*INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE \n**Best Advocate\n**Best Judge\n*COMMITTEES BETWEEN 20-60 DELEGATES\n**Diplomacy Awards (x2)\n*COMMITTEES WITH MORE THAN 60 DELEGATES\n**Diplomacy Awards (x3)\n*DELEGATIONS\n**Best Delegation (More than 20 Delegates)\n**Best Delegation (Between 10 and 19 Delegates)\n**Best Delegation (Less than 10 Delegates)\n''This varies at the discretion of the Conference Secretariat''\n-->\n\n===Outreach===\nLIMUN is committed to extending knowledge of international affairs, and other benefits of practising Model United Nations, to all young people; hence the Charity includes an outreach programme, working with inner-London youth groups to extend access to those whom would not otherwise have the opportunity of experiencing MUN.<ref>[http://limun.org.uk/about.html#outreach \"Outreach\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731163939/http://limun.org.uk/about.html#outreach#outreach |date=31 July 2013 }}.</ref> LIMUN works with several secondary school MUN programmes, assisting with workshops, conference management and development. During LIMUN's annual conference itself, LIMUN offers scholarships to secondary school students. In 2014, LIMUN offered two expenses-paid scholarships in collaboration with [[United Nations Association \u2013 UK]], recipients of which won an essay competition laid on by LIMUN. These delegates not only represent intelligent, internationally minded youths, but also the cornerstone of a younger generation of LIMUN attendees. Their essays are published on the LIMUN website in record of their achievement and dedication to MUN.\n\nAdditionally, each year, LIMUN welcomes a number of high school students from [[Pestalozzi International Village]], a charitable organisation based in [[Surrey]] that provides education to bright youths of less economically developed countries. In addition to providing for a group of these students each year, LIMUN sends secretariat members to the school to run various MUN training workshops in preparation for their attendance at LIMUN.\n\n===Venues===\nSince 2011, LIMUN's committee sessions and closing ceremony have taken place at [[Imperial College London]] and, since its 2013 edition, registration and the opening ceremony at [[Central Hall Westminster]]. The venues for the social event are susceptible to change every year.\n\nCentral Hall Westminster, where the first session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] was held in 1946, is a conference centre in [[Central London]], built between 1905 and 1911 as a [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church but also as \"a meeting place for all people, regardless of religious persuasion\u2026 for conferences on religious, educational, scientific, philanthropic and social questions\".<ref name=background/> As such, the Hall has housed meetings of historical significance: there, British [[Suffragette]]s campaigned for women's rights in 1914, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] founded the [[Free French Forces]] following the initial [[Battle of France|defeat of France]], and [[Winston Churchill]] addressed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1945. There, also, during the first meeting of the UN General Assembly, the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and [[International Court of Justice]] were founded, and [[Trygve Lie]] was elected the first [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]]. It continues serving as a centre for political conferences.<ref name=background/>\n\nImperial College London, is a world-class university specialising in medicine, engineering, business and the natural sciences; it used to be a college of the University of London and is located in the [[South Kensington]] area of London.\n\n===Funding===\nThe overwhelming majority of LIMUN's funds for the conference stem from the revenue acquired by delegate fees, but the charity also benefits from the generous support of sponsors. Most recently, these have included: [[Linklaters]], [[Aviva]], [[Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner]], the French and Saudi Arabian embassies, [[United Nations Association \u2013 UK|UNA-UK]], [[SOAS University of London|SOAS]], the [[Hult International Business School]] and others.<ref>[http://limun.org.uk/other.php#support \"Support\"]. ''LIMUN 2013''.</ref>\n\n==Sample schedule==\nThe majority of a delegate's time at LIMUN is spent in committee-sessions, punctuated by pre-determined breaks, social events, and other such activities. The three-day schedule at LIMUN generally follows the format below:<ref>LIMUN 2011 Secretariat.
