It was signed by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Spain]], with [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] in agreement.  Preferring to keep [[Guadeloupe]], France gave up [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] and all of its claims to territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain.  With France out of North America this dramatically changed the European political scene on the continent.\n\nAt first only the imperial powers of Europe had the resources to support and expand settlements in North America.  As time went on the colonies became more powerful and sought independence from the Old World. These demands for more autonomy sparked several wars, including the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) and the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810\u20131821). The last major colonial power on the continent, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], granted [[dominion]] status to [[Canadian Confederation|Canada]] in 1867 and slowly [[Territorial evolution of Canada|turned over its remaining land]] to that country over the next 100 years, with the last land transfer being the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] in 1949. Throughout this period, France maintained the small North American territory of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] off the coast of the island of Newfoundland.<ref name=\"cia.gov.france\">{{cite web |year= 2009 |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sb.html|title = Saint Pierre and Miquelon|work =[[USA.gov]] |publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]]| accessdate = November 14, 2009 | last= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nFrom independence, the United States [[Territorial evolution of the United States|expanded rapidly to the west]], [[Louisiana Purchase|acquiring the massive Louisiana territory]] in 1803 and fighting [[Mexican\u2013American War|a war with Mexico]] to push west to the [[Pacific]].  At the same time, British settlement in Canada increased.  US expansion was complicated by the division between \"free\" and \"slave\" states, which led to the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820.  Likewise, Canada faced tensions between settlers, including [[French Canadian|French]] and [[English Canadian|English]] communities, and the colonial administration that led to the outbreak of [[Rebellions of 1837|civil strife in 1837]].  Mexico faced constant political tensions between liberals and conservatives, as well as the rebellion of the English-speaking region of Texas, which declared itself the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1836.  In 1845, Texas joined the United States and in 1867 the United States acquired Alaska from Russia.  The last major territorial change occurred when [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] joined Canada in 1949,<ref name=\"heritage.nf.ca\"/> but there have been a number of small adjustments like the [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] where the city of [[Rio Rico, Texas]], was ceded to Mexico.<ref name=\"Miller pp. 13-21\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Territorial evolution of the United States]]\n*[[Territorial evolution of Canada]]\n*[[Territorial evolution of Mexico]]\n*[[Territorial evolution of the Caribbean]]\n*[[:File:Non-Native American Nations Control over N America 1750-2008.gif|Animated map of North America]]\n*[[:File:Canada provinces evolution.gif|Animated map of the Canada provinces evolution version 1]]\n*[[:File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|Animated map of the Canada provinces evolution version 2]]\n*[[:File:US states by date of statehood.gif|Animated map of US states by date of statehood]]\n*[[:File:Mexico states evolution.gif|Animated map of Mexico]]\n\n==Notes==\n*France is still listed as a nation in North America throughout its history because of their possession of the small islands [[:en:Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] off the Canadian coast of Newfoundland (the island).<ref name=\"cia.gov.france\"/>\n*[[Republic of Indian Stream]] (1832\u20131835) is represented on the map as the disputed territory between [[Maine]] and [[New Hampshire]] of the U.S. and [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]] of Canada.\n*[[Republic of Madawaska]] (1827\u20131842) is represented on the map as the disputed territory between Maine (U.S.) and Canada; the area was known as Madawaska Valley.

Preferring to keep [[Guadeloupe]], France gave up [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] and all of its claims to territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain.  With France out of North America this dramatically changed the European political scene on the continent.\n\nAt first only the imperial powers of Europe had the resources to support and expand settlements in North America.  As time went on the colonies became more powerful and sought independence from the Old World. These demands for more autonomy sparked several wars, including the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) and the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810\u20131821). The last major colonial power on the continent, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], granted [[dominion]] status to [[Canadian Confederation|Canada]] in 1867 and slowly [[Territorial evolution of Canada|turned over its remaining land]] to that country over the next 100 years, with the last land transfer being the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] in 1949.

At the same time, British settlement in Canada increased.  US expansion was complicated by the division between \"free\" and \"slave\" states, which led to the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820.  Likewise, Canada faced tensions between settlers, including [[French Canadian|French]] and [[English Canadian|English]] communities, and the colonial administration that led to the outbreak of [[Rebellions of 1837|civil strife in 1837]].  Mexico faced constant political tensions between liberals and conservatives, as well as the rebellion of the English-speaking region of Texas, which declared itself the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1836.  In 1845, Texas joined the United States and in 1867 the United States acquired Alaska from Russia.

These vessels were used primarily for training and for coastal patrol duties. The 3rd Fleet came under the aegis of the [[Combined Fleet]] for the duration of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] from March 1904. Although initially derided as a \"dinosaur fleet\",<ref>Jukes, ''The Russo-Japanese War''</ref> the 3rd fleet proved invaluable at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] and the Invasion of [[Sakhalin]]. It was disbanded on 20 December 1905.\n\n==South China Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was revived on 24 December 1908 as an expeditionary force during the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese Republican Revolution]], to safeguard Japanese interests (civilians and property) on the [[China|Chinese mainland]] and (if necessary) to conduct emergency evacuation. It was nicknamed the \"[[South China Fleet]]\" after its chief area of envisioned activity was the South China Sea. Its [[cruiser]]s patrolled the [[Yangtze River]] and other large rivers in China, and its headquarters was in the Japanese concession in [[Shanghai]]. It was disbanded on 25 December 1915.\n\n==World War I==\nThe 3rd Fleet was reconstituted on the same day as the dissolution of the \"South China Fleet\", initially to act as a training force to supplement Japan's contribution to the World War I under the terms of the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]. When the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] was proclaimed by the [[communist]] forces in Russia, the mission of the 3rd Fleet was changed to that of patrols of the Russian sea coast for the [[Siberian Intervention]] by Japanese ground forces in support of anti-[[Bolshevik]] forces. The 3rd Fleet was disbanded on 1 December 1922, and many of its vessels were scrapped almost immediately under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].\n\n==First China Expeditionary Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was again raised on 2 February 1938 as part of Japan's emergency buildup of forces after the [[January 28 Incident|Shanghai Incident]]. The buildup took the form of three separate expeditionary fleets, consisting primarily of cruisers and gunboats to patrol the Chinese coast and major riverways and to support the landings of Japanese ground forces. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, the 3rd Fleet came under the aegis of the [[China Area Fleet]]. It was disbanded on 15 November 1939; however, some of the organizational and command structures for ground forces under the [[First China Expeditionary Fleet]] remained in place until August 1943.\n\n==Southern Expeditionary Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was recreated once again on 10 April 1941 with the additional designation \"Southern Expeditionary Fleet\" for the specific task of invading the [[Philippine islands]]. At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], its headquarters was in [[Palau]] and its mission expanded to include the invasions of [[Java]], [[Borneo]] and other islands of the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. It was superseded by the [[Southern Expeditionary Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet|2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet]] under the aegis of the [[Southwest Area Fleet]] on 10 March 1942.\n\n===Order of Battle at time of Pearl Harbor===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n:Based at Takao, Formosa<ref>{{Cite web|first1=Leo  |last1=Niehorster |first2=Al |last2=Alsleben |first3=Tadashi  |last3=Yoda  |title= Administrative Order of Battle -

It was centered on the new aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}. It played an important role during the [[Pyrrhic victory]] at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Battle of Santa Cruz]], in which the American aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} was sunk, but at the cost of many of the best air crews in the Japanese Navy.\n\nAfter March 1944, the 3rd Fleet was basically merged with the [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|2nd Fleet]], and suffered through the disastrous [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], losing 3 of its aircraft carriers, including the newly commissioned {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taih\u014d||2}} and over 350 carrier planes.\n\nIn October 1944, the 3rd Fleet was designated the \"Northern Force\" in a three-force plan to defeat the [[Battle of Leyte|Allied invasion]] of the Japanese-held Philippines. The 3rd Fleet carriers were divested of all but 108 aircraft and sent to lure the American-led fleet away from protecting the troop landing ships.

(IJN), which was created, and subsequently disbanded on six separate occasions and revived on five separate occasions.\n\n=History=\n==Russo-Japanese War==\nFirst established on 28 December 1903, the 3rd Fleet was created by the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] as an administrative unit to manage vessels considered obsolete for front-line combat service. These vessels were used primarily for training and for coastal patrol duties. The 3rd Fleet came under the aegis of the [[Combined Fleet]] for the duration of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] from March 1904. Although initially derided as a \"[[dinosaur fleet]]\",<ref>Jukes, ''The Russo-Japanese War''</ref> the 3rd fleet proved invaluable at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] and the Invasion of [[Sakhalin]]. It was disbanded on 20 December 1905.\n\n==South China Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was revived on 24 December 1908 as an expeditionary force during the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese Republican Revolution]], to safeguard Japanese interests (civilians and property) on the [[China|Chinese mainland]] and (if necessary) to conduct emergency evacuation. It was nicknamed the \"[[South China Fleet]]\" after its chief area of envisioned activity was the South China Sea. Its [[cruiser]]s patrolled the [[Yangtze River]] and other large rivers in China, and its headquarters was in the Japanese concession in [[Shanghai]]. It was disbanded on 25 December 1915.\n\n==World War I==\nThe 3rd Fleet was reconstituted on the same day as the dissolution of the \"South China Fleet\", initially to act as a training force to supplement Japan's contribution to the World War I under the terms of the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]. When the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] was proclaimed by the [[communist]] forces in Russia, the mission of the 3rd Fleet was changed to that of patrols of the Russian sea coast for the [[Siberian Intervention]] by Japanese ground forces in support of anti-[[Bolshevik]] forces. The 3rd Fleet was disbanded on 1 December 1922, and many of its vessels were scrapped almost immediately under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].\n\n==First China Expeditionary Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was again raised on 2 February 1938 as part of Japan's emergency buildup of forces after the [[January 28 Incident|Shanghai Incident]]. The buildup took the form of three separate expeditionary fleets, consisting primarily of cruisers and gunboats to patrol the Chinese coast and major riverways and to support the landings of Japanese ground forces. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, the 3rd Fleet came under the aegis of the [[China Area Fleet]]. It was disbanded on 15 November 1939; however, some of the organizational and command structures for ground forces under the [[First China Expeditionary Fleet]] remained in place until August 1943.\n\n==Southern Expeditionary Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was recreated once again on 10 April 1941 with the additional designation \"Southern Expeditionary Fleet\" for the specific task of invading the [[Philippine islands]]. At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], its headquarters was in [[Palau]] and its mission expanded to include the invasions of [[Java]], [[Borneo]] and other islands of the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. It was superseded by the [[Southern Expeditionary Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet|2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet]] under the aegis of the [[Southwest Area Fleet]] on 10 March 1942.\n\n===Order of Battle at time of Pearl Harbor===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n:Based at Takao, Formosa<ref>{{Cite web|first1=Leo  |last1=Niehorster |first2=Al |last2=Alsleben |first3=Tadashi  |last3=Yoda  |title= Administrative Order of Battle -

It was centered on the new aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}.
