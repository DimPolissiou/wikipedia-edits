Spofford]] hired Peakall as a research associate in the Department of [[Anatomy]] of the [[Upstate Medical Center]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], New York, where he used [[egg albumen]] protein [[electrophoresis]] to determine [[phylogenetic]] relationships in the [[Falconiformes]]. In 1962, he was appointed assistant professor of [[Pharmacology]]. In 1968, he went to [[Cornell University]] as a research affiliate at the Laboratory of [[Ornithology]] and a senior research associate in the Section of Ecology and [[Systematics]] in the [[Biological Sciences]] Division. He initially worked on making the Laboratory of Ornithology's Nest Record Card Program accessible to researchers. He also worked to emphasise the importance of spatial and temporal data on bird nesting.<ref>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3793/is_200207/ai_n9137483/</ref>\n\nThis led to Peakall working full-time on [[Bird of prey|raptor]] [[pesticide]] problems, combining his passion for birds with his skills as a chemist. He measured [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] levels in [[peregrine falcon|peregrine]] eggs collected in [[Alaska]] from 1969 to 1973, and showed a strong inverse relationship between DDE content and eggshell thickness. The chemical industry claimed that shell thinning occurred too rapidly after the introduction of [[DDT]] in 1946 for DDT to be the cause. Peakall filled blown peregrine eggs collected from the critical period with solvent and measured DDE in the extracted lipids. DDE was present in sufficient concentrations to account for significant eggshell thinning in 1946 in Great Britain and as early as 1948 in California. Later, he would apply similar methods to [[California condor]] eggshell fragments as evidence that this species was extremely sensitive to DDE. His testimony at US congressional hearings contributed to the banning of DDT use in the United States. While at Cornell, Peakall also conducted studies on the ability of pesticides to induce breakdown of [[steroids]], to alter [[vitamin D]] [[metabolism]] and [[calcium]] up-take, and on the role of [[carbonic anhydrase]] and [[calcium ATPase]] in eggshell thinning. He also pioneered research on the effects of [[PCBs]] on birds.\n\nIn 1975, Peakall went to [[Ottawa]] to become a research scientist and Chief of the [[Toxic Chemicals]] Division in the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]] (CWS) of [[Environment Canada]]. During his leadership, the contributions of the Division increased in magnitude and scope. To the existing strengths in [[analytical chemistry]], [[field biology]], [[pesticide registration]] and [[tissue banking]], he added specialists in [[cytogenetics]], [[heavy metals]] and [[biochemical toxicology]], and a team to focus on the problems of fish-eating birds of the [[Great Lakes]]. He established an aviary and techniques to uncover the physiological mechanisms of pollutant effects observed in the field. He became an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[University of Ottawa]].\n\nPeakall's major contribution to the Great Lakes gull work was an egg swap programme between \"clean\" and \"dirty\" colonies, to isolate the effect of parental behaviour from that of embryo toxicity. He also participated in analysing the effects on songbirds of spraying [[New Brunswick]] forests, fostered the long-term monitoring of contaminant residues in seabird eggs, and for many years was key to the success of the Research Advisory Board of the WWF-CWS Wildlife Toxicology Fund. Peakall guided his scientific team in their collaborative investigations with CWS regional biologists on such problems as reproductive declines in falcons, effects of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[acid precipitation]] on [[loons]] and other waterfowl, and the effects of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]] in pulp mill effluent on [[great blue heron]] reproduction. From 1979 to 1985, he conducted his own extensive collaborative research program on the sub-lethal effects of oil on seabirds, working at the [[Mount Desert Island]] Biological Lab in [[Maine]] and [[Memorial University]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. He retired from CWS in 1991, moving to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], England, a few miles from his childhood home.\n\n==Retirement==\n\nIn retirement, Peakall remained very active in the fields of toxicology and ornithology. For several years he was a visiting fellow at the [[University of Reading]] where he lectured in ecotoxicology, co-authored the textbook ''Principles of Ecotoxicology'', and in 1992 became a founding coeditor of the journal ''Ecotoxicology''. In 1996, he co-authored ''[[Beyond Silent Spring]]'',<ref>https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780412728006</ref> and helped to organise a US Department of Energy-funded international workshop on \"Nondestructive Biomarkers in Vertebrates.\" He organised at least two [[NATO]]-funded advanced workshops.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nPeakall's interests included the study of [[spiders]], cooking, literature, travel and art, and a love of [[cricket]]. He enjoyed [[birding]] and attending cricket matches; he was a lifelong [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] supporter.\n\n==Death==\n\nPeakall became ill in early August 2001.

She released her debut album, ''[[Yours Truly (Ariana Grande album)|Yours Truly]]'' (2013). A 1950s [[doo-wop]]-influenced [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] album, it debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned her first US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten single, \"[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]\".\n\nGrande's second studio album, ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014), continued the pop-R&B sound of its predecessor and incorporated [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] elements.

She released her debut album, ''[[Yours Truly (Ariana Grande album)|Yours Truly]]'' (2013). A 1950s [[doo-wop]]-influenced [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] album, it debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned her first US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten single, \"[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]\".\n\nGrande's second studio album, ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014), continued the pop-R&B sound of its predecessor and incorporated [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] elements. It topped the ''Billboard'' 200 and featured four US top-ten singles: \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\", \"[[Break Free (song)|Break Free]]\", \"[[Bang Bang (Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj song)|Bang Bang]]\", and \"[[Love Me Harder]]\", the most of any artist that year. Grande's third studio album, ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' (2016) became her first of three consecutive number-one albums in the UK, and included the top-five single \"[[Side to Side]]\". Grande began experimenting with [[trap music|trap]] on her next albums, ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]'' (2018) and ''[[Thank U, Next]]'' (2019), while maintaining her characteristic pop-R&B tones. Both debuted at number one in several countries and were acclaimed by music critics. The former won a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]] and spawned the international top-three single \"[[No Tears Left to Cry]]\", while the latter was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and Best Pop Vocal Album at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] and broke several streaming records upon release. With the release of the singles \"[[Thank U, Next (song)|Thank U, Next]]\", \"[[7 Rings]]\" and \"[[Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored]]\", Grande became the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] simultaneously and the first female artist to succeed herself at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Additionally, she is the only artist to have the lead singles from each of their first five studio albums debut within the top ten in the US.\n\nGrande has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Ariana Grande|various accolades]], including one [[Grammy Award]], one [[Brit Award]], two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and eight [[Guinness World Records]]. All five of Grande's full-length albums have been certified Platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].
