He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019. He won medals in all but one of these championships, as well as playing in multiple positions \u2013 as skip (silver, [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship|2014]]), third (gold, [[2015 World Men's Curling Championship|2015]], [[2018 World Men's Curling Championship|2018]], [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|2019]] and silver, [[2017 World Men's Curling Championship|2017]]) second (bronze, [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship|2012]]), and as an alternate (gold, [[2013 World Men's Curling Championship|2013]] and bronze, [[2011 World Men's Curling Championship|2011]]). As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old. He followed his older brothers [[Anders Eriksson (Karlstad curler)|Anders Eriksson]] and [[Markus_Eriksson_(curler)|Marcus Eriksson]] into the sport, but his skill level advanced more rapidly.<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> He was part of a curling team at age seven,<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> debuting in Sweden's Elite Series at the age of thirteen.<ref>https://www.nwt.se/2009/12/30/framtiden-osaker-for-lag-eriksson/</ref> He won his first Swedish Men's Curling Championship title in his junior career and has gone on to win six more championship titles since then.<ref>[[Swedish Men%27s Curling Championship]]</ref>. As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nWhen Eriksson was sixteen, he skipped his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and\tNils Karlsson, to a silver medal at the [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]], losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]]. In 2008, Eriksson moved to H\u00e4rnosand to join other promising curlers at H\u00e4rnosands gymnasium. He also joined Team Lindstr\u00f6m, formed by brothers [[Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m]] and [[Alexander Lindstr\u00f6m]] along with [[Christoffer Sundgren]] and [[Henrik Leek]]. The team had immediate success on the junior tour and also scored wins in the senior division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ltz.se/artikel/lag-lindstrom-bast-i-norska-elitserien |title=Oskar kom hem \u2013 och vann|publisher=Nya Wermalands Tidningen |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/01/06/oskar-kom-hem-och-vann/|title=Lag Lindstr\u00f6m b\u00e4st i norden|publisher=L\u00e4nstidningen \u00d6stersund |date= 12 October 2008|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> With this team, Eriksson made his second run for the gold medal at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]], but reached only a fourth-place finish, losing in the bronze-medal game to the US team that was again skipped by Plys. Though the team did not qualify to compete at the championships in 2010, Eriksson and his teammates finally won a gold medal at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]], defeating Team Switzerland, skipped by [[Peter de Cruz]], by a score of 6\u20135 in the final. In 2012, his teammates were no longer eligible for junior competition, so Eriksson skipped a team with Ludwig Grann, Erik \u00d6lund and Magnus Rudstr\u00f6m at the Swedish Junior Curling Championship undefeated until the finals, coming second place to the team from Sundyberg, skipped by his future teammate Rasmus Wran\u00e5, who qualified for the World Junior Curling Championships instead.<ref>https://www.cuponline.se/teamView.aspx?cupid=1570&id=17105</ref>\n\n=== Seniors I (2009-2014): Team Lindstr\u00f6m/Eriksson and Team Edin ===\n\nShortly after joining Team Lindstr\u00f6m, Eriksson played simultaneously with two teams. His primary team during this period was with his team from Lit, which he skipped first as part of Team Lindstr\u00f6m and then as Team Eriksson.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>. From 2009 to the end of 2013, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, his primary team became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship Gold medal (2013) and two bronze (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played all games except three because Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played in the second position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won a bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2013) European Masters (2013) as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Eliter Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and his first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]]. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]], as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Team Eriksson reached the final and won the silver medal in their World Curling Championship debut.\n\n=== Seniors II (2014-present): Team Edin ===\n\nIn May 2014, Edin and Team Eriksson came to an agreement to form a new Team Edin, with Edin skipping the team in the fourth position and Oskar Eriksson playing third along with Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m playing second and Christoffer Sundgren in the lead position.<ref name=nwt2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2014/05/13/edin-och-eriksson-bildar-supercurlinglag/ |title=Edin och Eriksson bilder supercurlinglag|publisher=Nya Wermlands-Tidningen |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}.</ref> When Lindstr\u00f6m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran\u00e5 took over as second. From the start, however, Edin and Eriksson's team immediately saw the potential for the new team and aimed to become the number one team in the world.<ref name=nwt2014 /> Indeed, after finishing in the top ten on the Order of Merit and prize money mist in their first two seasons as a new team, Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the [[2016\u201317 curling season]] on both lists and in first place on the prize money list in the [[2017-18 curling season]]. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured reached the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017).\n\nAs part of Team Edin, Eriksson and his teammates have been ranked in the top 10 since they formed on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit, ranking first in 2017 and first on the money list in 2017 and 2018. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In 2016, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players\u2019 Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup), securing the Pinty\u2019s Cup. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> Team Edin has also won the [[Swedish Men's Curling Championships]] six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.\n\n=== Career Achievements  ===\n\nCurrently, Eriksson is the only Swedish curler to have taken part in nine consecutive [[World Curling Championships]] in the men's division (2011-2019). Eriksson has also competed in eleven consecutive [[European Curling Championships]], winning a record seven gold medals, a record that he shares only with Niklas Edin. With Team Edin, Eriksson has won four World Curling Championship gold medals (in 2015, 2018 and 2019), placing him in an elite group of curlers to hold four World Championship titles.<ref>[[List of men%27s World Curling champions]]</ref> In 2019, Eriksson became the first curler in history to hold three key gold medals in a single calendar year: the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|World Curling Championship]], the [[2019 European Curling Championships|European Curling Championship]], and the [[2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship|World Mixed Doubles Championship]] (with Anna Hasselborg).<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/?auth=true</ref> As part of Team Edin, Eriksson, Niklas Edin, and Christoffer Sundgren also became the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold the World Curling Championship and European Curling Championship titles in two separate calendar years (2015 and 2019).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref> Eriksson and Edin had previously become the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold those same titles in three separate competition seasons (2012-2013, 2014\u20132015, and 2017-2018).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Eriksson was inducted into the [[Swedish Curling Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Grand Slam record==\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

for the [[Niklas Edin]] rink. He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019. He won medals in all but one of these championships, as well as playing in multiple positions \u2013 as skip (silver, [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship|2014]]), third (gold, [[2015 World Men's Curling Championship|2015]], [[2018 World Men's Curling Championship|2018]], [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|2019]] and silver, [[2017 World Men's Curling Championship|2017]]) second (bronze, [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship|2012]]), and as an alternate (gold, [[2013 World Men's Curling Championship|2013]] and bronze, [[2011 World Men's Curling Championship|2011]]). As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old. He followed his older brothers [[Anders Eriksson (Karlstad curler)|Anders Eriksson]] and [[Markus_Eriksson_(curler)|Marcus Eriksson]] into the sport, but his skill level advanced more rapidly.<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> He was part of a curling team at age seven,<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> debuting in Sweden's Elite Series at the age of thirteen.<ref>https://www.nwt.se/2009/12/30/framtiden-osaker-for-lag-eriksson/</ref> He won his first Swedish Men's Curling Championship titles in his junior career and has gone on to win six more championship titles since then.<ref>[[Swedish Men%27s Curling Championship]]</ref>. As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nWhen Eriksson was sixteen, he skipped his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and\tNils Karlsson, to a silver medal at the [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]], losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]]. In 2008, Eriksson moved to H\u00e4rnosand to join other promising curlers at H\u00e4rnosands gymnasium. He also joined Team Lindstr\u00f6m, formed by brothers [[Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m]] and [[Alexander Lindstr\u00f6m]] along with [[Christoffer Sundgren]] and [[Henrik Leek]]. The team had immediate success on the junior tour and also scored wins in the senior division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ltz.se/artikel/lag-lindstrom-bast-i-norska-elitserien |title=Oskar kom hem \u2013 och vann|publisher=Nya Wermalands Tidningen |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/01/06/oskar-kom-hem-och-vann/|title=Lag Lindstr\u00f6m b\u00e4st i norden|publisher=L\u00e4nstidningen \u00d6stersund |date= 12 October 2008|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> With this team, Eriksson made his second run for the gold medal at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]], but reached only a fourth-place finish, losing in the bronze-medal game to the US team that was again skipped by Plys. Though the team did not qualify to compete at the championships in 2010, Eriksson and his teammates finally won a gold medal at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]], defeating Team Switzerland, skipped by [[Peter de Cruz]], by a score of 6\u20135 in the final. In 2012, his teammates were no longer eligible for junior competition, so Eriksson skipped a team with Ludwig Grann, Erik \u00d6lund and Magnus Rudstr\u00f6m at the Swedish Junior Curling Championship undefeated until the finals, coming second place to the team from Sundyberg, skipped by his future teammate Rasmus Wran\u00e5, who qualified for the World Junior Curling Championships instead.<ref>https://www.cuponline.se/teamView.aspx?cupid=1570&id=17105</ref>\n\n=== Seniors I (2009-2014): Team Lindstr\u00f6m/Eriksson and Team Edin ===\n\nShortly after joining Team Lindstr\u00f6m, Eriksson played simultaneously with two teams. His primary team during this period was with his team from Lit, which he skipped first as part of Team Lindstr\u00f6m and then as Team Eriksson.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>. From 2009 to the end of 2013, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, his primary team became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship Gold medal (2013) and two bronze (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played all games except three because Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played in the second position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won a bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2013) European Masters (2013) as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Eliter Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and his first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]]. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]], as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Team Eriksson reached the final and won the silver medal in their World Curling Championship debut.\n\n=== Seniors II (2014-present): Team Edin ===\n\nIn May 2014, Edin and Team Eriksson came to an agreement to form a new Team Edin, with Edin skipping the team in the fourth position and Oskar Eriksson playing third along with Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m playing second and Christoffer Sundgren in the lead position.<ref name=nwt2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2014/05/13/edin-och-eriksson-bildar-supercurlinglag/ |title=Edin och Eriksson bilder supercurlinglag|publisher=Nya Wermlands-Tidningen |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}.</ref> When Lindstr\u00f6m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran\u00e5 took over as second. From the start, however, Edin and Eriksson's team immediately saw the potential for the new team and aimed to become the number one team in the world.<ref name=nwt2014 /> Indeed, after finishing in the top ten on the Order of Merit and prize money mist in their first two seasons as a new team, Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the [[2016\u201317 curling season]] on both lists and in first place on the prize money list in the [[2017-18 curling season]]. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured reached the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017).\n\nAs part of Team Edin, Eriksson and his teammates have been ranked in the top 10 since they formed on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit, ranking first in 2017 and first on the money list in 2017 and 2018. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In 2016, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players\u2019 Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup), securing the Pinty\u2019s Cup. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> Team Edin has also won the [[Swedish Men's Curling Championships]] six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.\n\n=== Career Achievements  ===\n\nCurrently, Eriksson is the only Swedish curler to have taken part in nine consecutive [[World Curling Championships]] in the men's division (2011-2019). Eriksson has also competed in eleven consecutive [[European Curling Championships]], winning a record seven gold medals, a record that he shares only with Niklas Edin. With Team Edin, Eriksson has won four World Curling Championship gold medals (in 2015, 2018 and 2019), placing him in an elite group of curlers to hold four World Championship titles.<ref>[[List of men%27s World Curling champions]]</ref> In 2019, Eriksson became the first curler in history to hold three key gold medals in a single calendar year: the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|World Curling Championship]], the [[2019 European Curling Championships|European Curling Championship]], and the [[2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship|World Mixed Doubles Championship]] (with Anna Hasselborg).<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/?auth=true</ref> As part of Team Edin, Eriksson, Niklas Edin, and Christoffer Sundgren also became the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold the World Curling Championship and European Curling Championship titles in two separate calendar years (2015 and 2019).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref> Eriksson and Edin had previously become the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold those same titles in three separate competition seasons (2012-2013, 2014\u20132015, and 2017-2018).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Eriksson was inducted into the [[Swedish Curling Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Grand Slam record==\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velikiy kniaz'\"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Vladimir I (grand prince of Kiev) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Like Vladimir, Yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of Europe, especially the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kiev|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'.

The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trading trading routes to Asia and the Near East.

In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev.

In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.\n\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.\n\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271).

By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velikiy kniaz'\"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Vladimir I (grand prince of Kiev) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Like Vladimir, Yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of Europe, especially the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kiev|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'.

The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trading trading routes to Asia and the Near East.

In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev.

In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.\n\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.\n\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271).

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, \"[the old man] never wronged\", the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nCritics argue that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/> It is difficult to fully understand the narrator's true emotions about the blue eyed man because of this contradiction. It is said that \"At the same time he disclosed a deep psychological confusion\", referring to the narrator and his comment that \"Object there was none.

Even though the old man was dead, the body and heart of the dead man still seemed to haunt the narrator and convict him of his ungodly deeds. \"Since such processes of reasoning tend to convict the speaker of madness, it does not seem out of keeping that he is driven to confession...\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=E.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing deathwatch beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, \"[the old man] never wronged\", the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nCritics argue that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E.

It is said that \"At the same time he disclosed a deep psychological confusion\", referring to the narrator and his comment that \"Object there was none.

Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\"; which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. The guilt in the narrator can be seen when the narrator confessed to the police that the body of the old man was under the floor boards. Even though the old man was dead, the body and heart of the dead man still seemed to haunt the narrator and convict him of his ungodly deeds. \"Since such processes of reasoning tend to convict the speaker of madness, it does not seem out of keeping that he is driven to confession...\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=E.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing deathwatch beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

The beams have [[soffit]]s which are parallel with the deck over most of their length, but curve down to the piers. The piers consist of two columns each supported by timber piles with pilecaps. The pier columns have a square core cross section with large chamfers, giving an octagonal appearance, with four tapered thickenings or buttresses. The deep headstock connecting the columns supports the four deck beams. The deck is continuous from one abutment to the other.

The [[concrete]] [[beam bridge]] is located  {{convert|9|km}} northwest of the [[Sydney central business district]] and connects [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]] to [[North Ryde, New South Wales|North Ryde]] as part of the [[A38 (Sydney)|A38]].\n\nThe main entrance to [[Lane Cove National Park]] is located adjacent to the western end of Fullers Bridge.\n\n==Description==\nCompleted in 1918, Fullers Bridge is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]] structure, with four longitudinal deck beams on an over-vertical curve or camber. The beams have [[soffit]]s which are parallel with the deck over most of their length, but curve down to the piers. The piers consist of two columns each supported by timber piles with pilecaps. The pier columns have a square core cross section with large chamfers, giving an octagonal appearance, with four tapered thickenings or buttresses. The deep headstock connecting the columns supports the four deck beams. The deck is continuous from one abutment to the other. On the upstream side of the deck a timber walkway has been installed, supported by steel cantilever beams connected under the edge of the deck. The original pipe handrails have been replaced by guardrailing. The bridge also supports utility pipes on its downstream side.<ref name=rmsheritage/>\n\n==History==\nFullers Bridge is named after the Fuller family which operated a farm on the small area of agriculturally usable land which existed on the river banks at that location, in the late 19th century.\n\nUp until the early 1980s a kiosk and general store existed on the northern side of the bridge, and was accessible from both sides of the river by the northern pedestrian footbridge.\n\nFullers Bridge played a part in a famous Australian mystery, with the bodies of [[Bogle-Chandler case|Dr Gilbert Bogle and Mrs Margaret Chandler]] discovered on the banks of the Lane Cove River on 1 January 1963, {{convert|70|m}} south of the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Russell|title=Bogle & Chandler: The Discovery of the Bodies|work=boglechandler.com/|publisher=Russell Brown|date=1998-07-07|url=http://www.boglechandler.com/bcFBDiscoveryOfTheBodies.html|accessdate=2007-08-21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118102119/http://www.boglechandler.com/bcFBDiscoveryOfTheBodies.html|archive-date=18 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Heritage significance==\n{{quotation|''Fullers Bridge has local historic significance as a long anticipated element of public infrastructure shaping the history of the Willoughby and Lane Cove areas by providing permanent access across the Lane Cove River when road routes linking these areas were few and far between.
