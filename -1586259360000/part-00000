Some families consist mostly of parasitic representatives such as [[Balanophoraceae]], while other families have only a few representatives. One example is the North American ''[[Monotropa uniflora]]'' (Indian pipe or corpse plant) which is a member of the heath family, [[Ericaceae]], better known for its members blueberries, cranberries, and [[rhododendrons]].\n\nParasitic plants are characterized as follows:<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/><!--pages needed-->\n\n*1a. [[Obligate parasite]] \u2013 a parasite that cannot complete its life cycle without a host.\n*1b. [[Facultative parasite]] \u2013 a parasite that can complete its life cycle independent of a host.\n*2a. Stem parasite \u2013 a parasite that attaches to the host stem.\n*2b. Root parasite \u2013 a parasite that attaches to the host root.\n*3a. Hemiparasite \u2013 a plant parasitic under natural conditions, but [[photosynthetic]] to some degree. Hemiparasites may obtain only water and mineral nutrients from the host plant; many obtain at least part of their organic nutrients from the host as well.\n*3b. Holoparasite - a parasitic plant that derives all of its fixed carbon from the host plant. Commonly lacking chlorophyll, holoparasites are often colors other than green.\n\n[[File:Mistletoe, coming soon to a market near you - geograph.org.uk - 1585249.jpg|thumb|[[Mistletoe]], an obligate stem hemiparasite]]\n\nFor hemiparasites, one from each of the three sets of terms can be applied to the same species, e.g. \n*''[[Nuytsia floribunda]]'' (Western Australian Christmas tree) is an obligate root hemiparasite.\n*''[[Rhinanthus]]'' (e.g. [[Yellow rattle]]) is a facultative root hemiparasite.\n*[[Mistletoe]] is an obligate stem hemiparasite.\n\nHoloparasites are always obligate so only two terms are needed, e.g. \n*[[Cuscuta europaea|Dodder]] is a stem holoparasite.\n*''[[Hydnora]]'' spp. are root holoparasites.\n\nPlants usually considered holoparasites include [[Orobanche|broomrape]], [[Cuscuta|dodder]], ''[[Rafflesia]]'', and the [[Hydnoraceae]].  Plants usually considered hemiparasites include ''[[Castilleja]]'', [[mistletoe]], [[Western Australian Christmas tree]], and [[yellow rattle]].\n\n==Evolution of parasitism==\n[[File:Striga root connections.jpg|thumb|''[[Striga]]'' witchweeds (white, centre, attached to roots of host) are economically important pests of the crop plants that they parasitise.]]\n\nParasitic behavior evolved in angiosperms roughly 12-13 times independently, a classic example of [[convergent evolution]]. Roughly 1% of all angiosperm species are parasitic, with a large degree of host dependence. The taxonomic family ''[[Orobanchaceae]]'' (encompassing the genera ''Tryphysaria'', ''[[Striga]]'', and ''[[Orobanche]]'') is the only family that contains both holoparasitic and hemiparasitic species, making it a model group for studying the evolutionary rise of [[parasitism]]. The remaining groups contain only hemiparasites or holoparasites.<ref name=Westwood>Westwood, James H., John I. Yoder, Michael P. Timko and Claude W. Depamphilis. \"The Evolution of Parasitism in Plants.\" ''Trends in Plant Science'' 15.4 (2010) 227-35. Web.</ref>\n\nThe evolutionary event which gave rise to parasitism in plants was the development of haustoria. The first, most ancestral, haustoria are thought to be similar to that of the facultative hemiparasites within ''Tryphysaria'', lateral haustoria develop along the surface of the roots in these species. Later evolution led to the development of terminal or primary haustoria at the tip of the juvenile [[radicle]], seen in obligate hemiparasitic species within ''[[Striga]]''. Lastly, holoparasitic plants, always forms of obligate parasites, evolved over the loss of photosynthetis, seen in the genus ''[[Orobanche]]''.<ref name=Westwood/>\n\nTo maximize resources, many parasitic plants have evolved 'self-incompatibility', to avoid parasitizing themselves. Others such as ''[[Triphysaria]]'' usually avoid parasitizing other members of their species, but some parasitic plants have no such limits.<ref name=Westwood/> The [[albino redwood]] is a mutant ''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]'' that produces no chlorophyll; they live on sugars from neighbouring trees, usually the parent tree from which they have grown (via a somatic mutation).<ref name = \"Stienstra\">{{cite news |last = Stienstra | first = T. | title = It's no snow job - handful of redwoods are rare albinos | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = 11 October 2007 |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/11/SPK4SI0PM.DTL |accessdate = December 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref name = \"Krieger\">{{cite web | last = Krieger | first = L.

These can either be chemical or mechanical and the means used by seeds often depends on whether or not the parasites are root parasites or stem parasites. Most parasitic plants need to germinate in close proximity to their host plants because their seeds are limited in the amount of resources necessary to survive without nutrients from their host plants. Resources are limited due in part to the fact that most parasitic plants are not able to use [[autotrophic]] nutrition to establish the early stages of seeding.<ref name=Scott>Scott, P. 2008. Physiology and behavior of plants: parasitic plants. John Wiley & sons pp. 103\u2013112.</ref><ref name=Runyon>Runyon, J. Tooker, J. Mescher, M. De Moraes, C.  2009.  Parasitic plants in agriculture: Chemical ecology of germination and host-plant location as targets for sustainable control: A review. Sustainable Agriculture Reviews 1. pp. 123-136.</ref>\n\nRoot parasitic plant seeds tend to use chemical cues for germination. For germination to occur, seeds need to be quite close to the host plant.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Runyon/> For example, the seeds of witchweed (''[[Striga asiatica]]'') need to be within 3 to 4 millimeters (mm) of its host to receive chemical signals in the soil to trigger germination.  This range is important because ''Striga asiatica'' will only grow about 4&nbsp;mm after germination.<ref name=Scott/>  Chemical compound cues sensed by parasitic plant seeds are from host plant root exudates that are leached in close proximity from the host\u2019s [[root|root system]] into the surrounding soil.  These chemical cues are a variety of compounds that are unstable and rapidly degraded in soil and are present within a radius of a few meters of the plant exuding them. Parasitic plants germinate and follow a concentration gradient of these compounds in the soil toward the host plants if close enough. These compounds are called [[strigolactone]]s. Strigolactone stimulates [[Ethylene (plant hormone)|ethylene biosynthesis]] in seeds causing them to germinate.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Runyon/>\n\nThere are a variety of chemical germination stimulants. [[Strigol]] was the first of the germination stimulants to be isolated.  It was isolated from a non-host cotton plant and has been found in true host plants such as corn and millets. The stimulants are usually plant specific, examples of other germination stimulants include [[sorgolactone]] from sorghum, orobanchol and alectrol from red clover, and [[5-deoxystrigol]] from ''[[Lotus japonicus]]''. Strigolactones are apocarotenoids that are produced via the carotenoid pathway of plants. Strigolactones and mycorrhizal fungi have a relationship in which Strigolactone also cues the growth of mycorrhizal fungus.<ref name=Runyon/><ref>Schneeweiss, G. 2007.

European  Society for Evolutionary Biology. 20 471-478.</ref>\n\nStem parasitic plants, unlike most root parasites, germinate using the resources inside their endosperms and are able to survive for some time. For example, [[Cuscuta|the dodders (''Cuscuta'' spp.)]] drop their seeds to the ground. These may remain [[dormancy|dormant]] for up to five years before they find a host plant. Using the resources in the seed [[endosperm]], dodder is able to germinate. Once germinated, the plant has 6 days to find and establish a connection with its host plant before its resources exhaust.<ref name=Scott/> Dodder seeds germinate above ground, then the plant sends out stems in search of its host plant reaching up to 6&nbsp;cm before it dies. It is believed that the plant uses two methods of finding a host.  The stem detects its host plant's scent and orients itself in that direction. Scientists used volatiles from [[tomato]] plants ([[\u03b1-pinene]], [[\u03b2-myrcene]], and [[phellandrene|\u03b2-phellandrene]]) to test the reaction of ''[[Cuscuta pentagona|C. pentagona]]'' and found that the stem orients itself in the direction of the odor.<ref name=Runyon/> Some studies suggest that by using light reflecting from nearby plants dodders are able to select host with higher sugar because of the levels of [[chlorophyll]] in the leaves.<ref name=Lesica>Lesica, P. 2010. Dodder: Hardly Doddering. Kelseya Newsletter of Montana Native Plant Society. Vol 23. 2, 6</ref> Once the dodder finds its host, it wraps itself around the host plant's stem. Using adventitious roots, the dodder taps into the host plant's stem with a [[haustorium]], an absorptive organ within the host plant [[vascular tissue]]. Dodder makes several of these connections with the host as it moves up the plant.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Runyon/><ref name=Lesica/>\n\n=== Seed dispersal ===\n\nThere are several methods of seed dispersal, but all the strategies aim to put the seed in direct contact with, or within a critical distance of, the host.\n\n# The [[Cuscuta|''Cuscuta'' seedling]] can live for 3\u20137 days and extend out 35&nbsp;cm in search of the host before it dies. This is because the ''Cuscuta'' seed is large and has stored nutrients to sustain its life. This is also useful for seeds that get digested by animals and are excreted.<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/>\n# [[Mistletoe]] use a sticky seed for dispersal. The seed sticks to nearby animals and birds and then comes into direct contact with the host.<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/>\n# ''[[Arceuthobium]]'' seeds have a similarly sticky seed as the mistletoe but they do not rely on animals and birds, they mainly disperse by fruit [[Explosion|explosiveness]]. Once the seed makes contact with the host, rain water can help position the seed into a suitable position.<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/>\n# Some seeds detect and respond to [[Chemical substance|chemical stimulations]] produced in the host\u2019s roots and start to grow towards the host.<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/>\n\n== Obstacles of attaching to a host ==\nA parasitic plant has many obstacles to overcome to attach to a host. Distance from the host and stored nutrients are some of the problems, and the host's defenses are an obstacle to overcome. The first hurdle is penetrating the host, since the host has systems to reinforce the cell wall by [[Cross-link|protein cross-linking]] so that it stops the parasitic progress at the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] of the host's roots. The second hurdle is the host's ability to [[Secretion|secrete]] germination inhibitors. This prevents [[germination]] of the parasitic seed. The third hurdle is the host's ability to create a [[Toxicity|toxic]] environment at the location where the parasitic plant attaches. The host secretes [[phenols|phenolic]] compounds into the [[apoplast]]. This creates a toxic environment for the parasitic plant, eventually killing it. The fourth hurdle is the host's ability to ruin the [[tubercle]] using gums and gels or injecting toxins into the [[tubercle]].<ref>Walters, D. (2010). Plant Defense Warding off attack by pathogens, herbivores and parasitic plants. Hoboken: Wiley.</ref>\n\n==Host range==\nSome parasitic plants are generalists and parasitize many different species, even several different species at once. Dodder (''[[Cassytha]]'' spp., ''[[Cuscuta]]'' spp.) and red rattle (''[[Odontites vernus]]'') are generalist parasites. Other parasitic plants are specialists that parasitize a few or just one species. Beech drops (''[[Epifagus virginiana]]'') is a root holoparasite only on American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''). ''[[Rafflesia]]'' is a holoparasite on the vine ''Tetrastigma''. Plants such as ''[[Pterospora]]'' become parasites of [[mycorrhizal]] fungi. There is evidence that parasites also practice self-discrimination, species of ''Tryphysaria'' experience reduced haustorium development in the presence of other ''Tryphysaria''. The mechanism for self-discrimination in parasites is not yet known.<ref name=Westwood/>\n\n==Aquatic parasitic plants==\nParasitism also evolved within aquatic species of plants and algae. Parasitic marine plants are described as [[benthos|benthic]], meaning that they are sedentary or attached to another structure. Plants and algae that grow on the host plant, using it as an attachment point are given the designation [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] ([[lithophyte|epilithic]] is the name given to plants/algae that use rocks or boulders for attachment), while not necessarily parasitic, some species occur in high correlation with a certain host species, suggesting that they rely on the host plant in some way or another. In contrast, [[endophyte|endophytic]] plants and algae grow inside their host plant, these have a wide range of host dependence from obligate holoparasites to facultative hemiparasites.<ref name=Dring>Dring, M. J. ''The Biology of Marine Plants''. London: E. Arnold, 1982. Print.</ref>\n\nMarine parasites occur as a higher proportion of marine flora in temperate rather than tropical waters. While no full explanation for this is available, many of the potential host plants such as [[kelp]] and other macroscopic [[brown algae]] are generally restricted to temperate areas. Roughly 75% of parasitic [[red algae]] infect hosts in the same taxonomic family as themselves, these are given the designation adelphoparasites. Other marine parasites, deemed endozoic, are parasites of marine invertebrates ([[mollusca|molluscs]], [[flatworm]]s, [[sponge]]s) and can be either holoparasitic or hemiparasitic, some retaining the ability to photosynthesize after infection.<ref name=Dring/>\n\n==Importance==\nSpecies within ''[[Orobanchaceae]]'' are some of the most economically destructive species on Earth. Species of ''[[Striga]]'' alone are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop yield loss annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within [[sub-Saharan Africa]] alone. ''[[Striga]]'' can infest both grasses and grains, including [[Zea mays|corn]], [[Oryza sativa|rice]] and [[Sorghum]], undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. ''[[Orobanche]]'' also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, [[Cicer arietinum|chickpeas]], [[Solanum lycopersicum|tomatoes]], [[carrot]]s, [[lettuce]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landa|first=B.

Some families consist mostly of parasitic representatives such as [[Balanophoraceae]], while other families have only a few representatives. One example is the North American ''[[Monotropa uniflora]]'' (Indian pipe or corpse plant) which is a member of the heath family, [[Ericaceae]], better known for its members blueberries, cranberries, and [[rhododendrons]].\n\nParasitic plants are characterized as follows:<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/><!--pages needed-->\n\n*1a. [[Obligate parasite]] \u2013 a parasite that cannot complete its life cycle without a host.\n*1b. [[Facultative parasite]] \u2013 a parasite that can complete its life cycle independent of a host.\n*2a. Stem parasite \u2013 a parasite that attaches to the host stem.\n*2b. Root parasite \u2013 a parasite that attaches to the host root.\n*3a. Hemiparasite \u2013 a plant parasitic under natural conditions, but [[photosynthetic]] to some degree. Hemiparasites may obtain only water and mineral nutrients from the host plant; many obtain at least part of their organic nutrients from the host as well.\n*3b. Holoparasite - a parasitic plant that derives all of its fixed carbon from the host plant. Commonly lacking chlorophyll, holoparasites are often colors other than green.\n\n[[File:Mistletoe, coming soon to a market near you - geograph.org.uk - 1585249.jpg|thumb|[[Mistletoe]], an obligate stem hemiparasite]]\n\nFor hemiparasites, one from each of the three sets of terms can be applied to the same species, e.g. \n*''[[Nuytsia floribunda]]'' (Western Australian Christmas tree) is an obligate root hemiparasite.\n*''[[Rhinanthus]]'' (e.g. [[Yellow rattle]]) is a facultative root hemiparasite.\n*[[Mistletoe]] is an obligate stem hemiparasite.\n\nHoloparasites are always obligate so only two terms are needed, e.g. \n*[[Cuscuta europaea|Dodder]] is a stem holoparasite.\n*''[[Hydnora]]'' spp. are root holoparasites.\n\nPlants usually considered holoparasites include [[Orobanche|broomrape]], [[Cuscuta|dodder]], ''[[Rafflesia]]'', and the [[Hydnoraceae]].  Plants usually considered hemiparasites include ''[[Castilleja]]'', [[mistletoe]], [[Western Australian Christmas tree]], and [[yellow rattle]].\n\n==Evolution of parasitic behavior==\n[[File:Striga root connections.jpg|thumb|''[[Striga]]'' witchweeds (white, centre, attached to roots of host) are economically important pests of the crop plants that they parasitise.]]\n\nParasitic behavior evolved in angiosperms roughly 12-13 times independently, a classic example of [[convergent evolution]]. Roughly 1% of all angiosperm species are parasitic, with a large degree of host dependence. The taxonomic family ''[[Orobanchaceae]]'' (encompassing the genera ''Tryphysaria'', ''[[Striga]]'', and ''[[Orobanche]]'') is the only family that contains both holoparasitic and hemiparasitic species, making it a model group for studying the evolutionary rise of [[parasitism]]. The remaining groups contain only hemiparasites or holoparasites.<ref name=Westwood>Westwood, James H., John I. Yoder, Michael P. Timko and Claude W. Depamphilis. \"The Evolution of Parasitism in Plants.\" ''Trends in Plant Science'' 15.4 (2010) 227-35. Web.</ref>\n\nThe evolutionary event which gave rise to parasitism in plants was the development of haustoria. The first, most ancestral, haustoria are thought to be similar to that of the facultative hemiparasites within ''Tryphysaria'', lateral haustoria develop along the surface of the roots in these species. Later evolution led to the development of terminal or primary haustoria at the tip of the juvenile [[radicle]], seen in obligate hemiparasitic species within ''[[Striga]]''. Lastly, obligate holoparasitic behavior originated with the loss of the photosynthetic process, seen in the genus ''[[Orobanche]]''.<ref name=Westwood/>\n\nTo maximize resources, many parasitic plants have evolved 'self-incompatibility', to avoid parasitizing themselves. Others such as ''[[Triphysaria]]'' usually avoid parasitizing other members of their species, but some parasitic plants have no such limits.<ref name=Westwood/> The [[albino redwood]] is a mutant ''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]'' that produces no chlorophyll; they live on sugars from neighbouring trees, usually the parent tree from which they have grown (via a somatic mutation).<ref name = \"Stienstra\">{{cite news |last = Stienstra | first = T. | title = It's no snow job - handful of redwoods are rare albinos | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = 11 October 2007 |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/11/SPK4SI0PM.DTL |accessdate = December 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref name = \"Krieger\">{{cite web | last = Krieger | first = L.

These can either be chemical or mechanical and the means used by seeds often depends on whether or not the parasites are root parasites or stem parasites. Most parasitic plants need to germinate in close proximity to their host plants because their seeds are limited in the amount of resources necessary to survive without nutrients from their host plants. Resources are limited due in part to the fact that most parasitic plants are not able to use [[autotrophic]] nutrition to establish the early stages of seeding.<ref name=Scott>Scott, P. 2008. Physiology and behavior of plants: parasitic plants. John Wiley & sons pp. 103\u2013112.</ref><ref name=Runyon>Runyon, J. Tooker, J. Mescher, M. De Moraes, C.  2009.  Parasitic plants in agriculture: Chemical ecology of germination and host-plant location as targets for sustainable control: A review. Sustainable Agriculture Reviews 1. pp. 123-136.</ref>\n\nRoot parasitic plant seeds tend to use chemical cues for germination. For germination to occur, seeds need to be quite close to the host plant.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Runyon/> For example, the seeds of witchweed (''[[Striga asiatica]]'') need to be within 3 to 4 millimeters (mm) of its host to receive chemical signals in the soil to trigger germination.  This range is important because ''Striga asiatica'' will only grow about 4&nbsp;mm after germination.<ref name=Scott/>  Chemical compound cues sensed by parasitic plant seeds are from host plant root exudates that are leached in close proximity from the host\u2019s [[root|root system]] into the surrounding soil.  These chemical cues are a variety of compounds that are unstable and rapidly degraded in soil and are present within a radius of a few meters of the plant exuding them. Parasitic plants germinate and follow a concentration gradient of these compounds in the soil toward the host plants if close enough. These compounds are called [[strigolactone]]s. Strigolactone stimulates [[Ethylene (plant hormone)|ethylene biosynthesis]] in seeds causing them to germinate.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Runyon/>\n\nThere are a variety of chemical germination stimulants. [[Strigol]] was the first of the germination stimulants to be isolated.  It was isolated from a non-host cotton plant and has been found in true host plants such as corn and millets. The stimulants are usually plant specific, examples of other germination stimulants include [[sorgolactone]] from sorghum, orobanchol and alectrol from red clover, and [[5-deoxystrigol]] from ''[[Lotus japonicus]]''. Strigolactones are apocarotenoids that are produced via the carotenoid pathway of plants. Strigolactones and mycorrhizal fungi have a relationship in which Strigolactone also cues the growth of mycorrhizal fungus.<ref name=Runyon/><ref>Schneeweiss, G. 2007.  Correlated evolution of life history and host range  in the nonphotosynthetic parasitic flowering plants Orobanche and Phelipanche (Orobanchaceae). Journal Compilation. European  Society for Evolutionary Biology. 20 471-478.</ref>\n\nStem parasitic plants, unlike most root parasites, germinate using the resources inside their endosperms and are able to survive for some time. For example, [[Cuscuta|the dodders (''Cuscuta'' spp.)]] drop their seeds to the ground. These may remain [[dormancy|dormant]] for up to five years before they find a host plant. Using the resources in the seed [[endosperm]], dodder is able to germinate. Once germinated, the plant has 6 days to find and establish a connection with its host plant before its resources exhaust.<ref name=Scott/> Dodder seeds germinate above ground, then the plant sends out stems in search of its host plant reaching up to 6&nbsp;cm before it dies. It is believed that the plant uses two methods of finding a host.  The stem detects its host plant's scent and orients itself in that direction. Scientists used volatiles from [[tomato]] plants ([[\u03b1-pinene]], [[\u03b2-myrcene]], and [[phellandrene|\u03b2-phellandrene]]) to test the reaction of ''[[Cuscuta pentagona|C. pentagona]]'' and found that the stem orients itself in the direction of the odor.<ref name=Runyon/> Some studies suggest that by using light reflecting from nearby plants dodders are able to select host with higher sugar because of the levels of [[chlorophyll]] in the leaves.<ref name=Lesica>Lesica, P. 2010. Dodder: Hardly Doddering. Kelseya Newsletter of Montana Native Plant Society. Vol 23. 2, 6</ref> Once the dodder finds its host, it wraps itself around the host plant's stem. Using adventitious roots, the dodder taps into the host plant's stem with a [[haustorium]], an absorptive organ within the host plant [[vascular tissue]]. Dodder makes several of these connections with the host as it moves up the plant.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Runyon/><ref name=Lesica/>\n\n=== Seed dispersal ===\n\nThere are several methods of seed dispersal, but all the strategies aim to put the seed in direct contact with, or within a critical distance of, the host.\n\n# The [[Cuscuta|''Cuscuta'' seedling]] can live for 3\u20137 days and extend out 35&nbsp;cm in search of the host before it dies. This is because the ''Cuscuta'' seed is large and has stored nutrients to sustain its life. This is also useful for seeds that get digested by animals and are excreted.<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/>\n# [[Mistletoe]] use a sticky seed for dispersal. The seed sticks to nearby animals and birds and then comes into direct contact with the host.<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/>\n# ''[[Arceuthobium]]'' seeds have a similarly sticky seed as the mistletoe but they do not rely on animals and birds, they mainly disperse by fruit [[Explosion|explosiveness]]. Once the seed makes contact with the host, rain water can help position the seed into a suitable position.<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/>\n# Some seeds detect and respond to [[Chemical substance|chemical stimulations]] produced in the host\u2019s roots and start to grow towards the host.<ref name=\"Heide-J\u00f8rgensen2008\"/>\n\n== Obstacles of attaching to a host ==\nA parasitic plant has many obstacles to overcome to attach to a host. Distance from the host and stored nutrients are some of the problems, and the host's defenses are an obstacle to overcome. The first hurdle is penetrating the host, since the host has systems to reinforce the cell wall by [[Cross-link|protein cross-linking]] so that it stops the parasitic progress at the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] of the host's roots. The second hurdle is the host's ability to [[Secretion|secrete]] germination inhibitors. This prevents [[germination]] of the parasitic seed. The third hurdle is the host's ability to create a [[Toxicity|toxic]] environment at the location where the parasitic plant attaches. The host secretes [[phenols|phenolic]] compounds into the [[apoplast]]. This creates a toxic environment for the parasitic plant, eventually killing it. The fourth hurdle is the host's ability to ruin the [[tubercle]] using gums and gels or injecting toxins into the [[tubercle]].<ref>Walters, D. (2010). Plant Defense Warding off attack by pathogens, herbivores and parasitic plants. Hoboken: Wiley.</ref>\n\n==Host range==\nSome parasitic plants are generalists and parasitize many different species, even several different species at once. Dodder (''[[Cassytha]]'' spp., ''[[Cuscuta]]'' spp.) and red rattle (''[[Odontites vernus]]'') are generalist parasites. Other parasitic plants are specialists that parasitize a few or just one species. Beech drops (''[[Epifagus virginiana]]'') is a root holoparasite only on American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''). ''[[Rafflesia]]'' is a holoparasite on the vine ''Tetrastigma''. Plants such as ''[[Pterospora]]'' become parasites of [[mycorrhizal]] fungi. There is evidence that parasites also practice self-discrimination, species of ''Tryphysaria'' experience reduced haustorium development in the presence of other ''Tryphysaria''. The mechanism for self-discrimination in parasites is not yet known.<ref name=Westwood/>\n\n==Aquatic parasitic plants==\nParasitism also evolved within aquatic species of plants and algae. Parasitic marine plants are described as [[benthos|benthic]], meaning that they are sedentary or attached to another structure. Plants and algae that grow on the host plant, using it as an attachment point are given the designation [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] ([[lithophyte|epilithic]] is the name given to plants/algae that use rocks or boulders for attachment), while not necessarily parasitic, some species occur in high correlation with a certain host species, suggesting that they rely on the host plant in some way or another. In contrast, [[endophyte|endophytic]] plants and algae grow inside their host plant, these have a wide range of host dependence from obligate holoparasites to facultative hemiparasites.<ref name=Dring>Dring, M. J. ''The Biology of Marine Plants''. London: E. Arnold, 1982. Print.</ref>\n\nMarine parasites occur as a higher proportion of marine flora in temperate rather than tropical waters. While no full explanation for this is available, many of the potential host plants such as [[kelp]] and other macroscopic [[brown algae]] are generally restricted to temperate areas. Roughly 75% of parasitic [[red algae]] infect hosts in the same taxonomic family as themselves, these are given the designation adelphoparasites. Other marine parasites, deemed endozoic, are parasites of marine invertebrates ([[mollusca|molluscs]], [[flatworm]]s, [[sponge]]s) and can be either holoparasitic or hemiparasitic, some retaining the ability to photosynthesize after infection.<ref name=Dring/>\n\n==Importance==\nSpecies within ''[[Orobanchaceae]]'' are some of the most economically destructive species on Earth. Species of ''[[Striga]]'' alone are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop yield loss annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within [[sub-Saharan Africa]] alone. ''[[Striga]]'' can infest both grasses and grains, including [[Zea mays|corn]], [[Oryza sativa|rice]] and [[Sorghum]], undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. ''[[Orobanche]]'' also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, [[Cicer arietinum|chickpeas]], [[Solanum lycopersicum|tomatoes]], [[carrot]]s, [[lettuce]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landa|first=B.
