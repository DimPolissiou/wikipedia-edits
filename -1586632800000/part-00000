It operates in conjunction with the EU's [[Operation Atalanta]] and NATO's [[Operation Ocean Shield]].\n\nAs of February 2020, the commander of CTF-151 is Rear Admiral Yoshiyasu Ishimaki of the JMSDF.<ref>http://www.gdnonline.com/Details/771414/New-commander-takes-over-Combined-Task-Force</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe CTF 151 was established on 12 January 2009 as a response to piracy attacks in Somalia, \"with a specific piracy mission-based mandate under the authority of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|UNSCRs]] 1816, 1838, 1846, 1851 and 1897\".<ref name=CMTF>{{cite web|title=CTF-151: Counter-piracy |publisher=Combined Maritime Forces |url=http://combinedmaritimeforces.com/ctf-151-counter-piracy/ |accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref> The CTF 150 mainly dealt with maritime security and counter terrorism. Piracy was considered more of a law enforcement mission.<ref name=CMTF/> They were established as a mission-based Task Force. Upon their establishment in 2009, they operated under a UNSCR counter-piracy mandate. They are not geographically constrained.<ref name=CMF-3>{{cite book|title=Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)  Operations Counter Piracy Operations, Challenges,  Shortfalls and Lessons Learned|year=2009|publisher=NATO|page=3|url=http://www.nato.int/structur/AC/141/pdf/PS-M/Combined%20Maritime%20Forces%20Ops.pdf}}</ref> Their mandate has been \"based upon the range of counter-piracy UNSCRs\".<ref name=CMF-3/> In February 2011, a group of pirates hijacked a Panamanian-flagged ship.

They gave the pirates food and water, finally turning them loose. The Somalis did not realize that a helicopter from the [[USS Mobile Bay (CG-53)|USS ''Mobile Bay'']] was keeping track of their movements. They headed back to the Iranian dhow.<ref name=\"Mcknight\"/> The [[USS Kidd (DDG-100)|USS ''Kidd'']] was able to track the ''Al Mulahi'' and noticed some Middle Easterners were aboard.

The [[Valeyard]] presents the transgressions on a video screen, depicting the Doctor\u2019s past adventures with companion [[Peri Brown]]. The Doctor becomes suspicious about evidence being censored. In the first flashback, the Doctor and Peri arrive on the tribal planet Ravalox, located two light years from Earth's known location. The Doctor notes a similarity between Ravalox and Earth, with objects from Earth\u2014notably [[Marble Arch tube station]] and the novel ''[[Moby Dick]]''\u2014present on Ravalox. The only apparent astronomical difference between the two is Ravalox's position in the galaxy. Rogue [[Sabalom Glitz]] attempts to obtain secrets and technology that are guarded by a robot. The Doctor is forced to deactivate the robot\u2019s unstable power supply to avoid a chain reaction, but in the process the secrets are destroyed.

The flashback shows the Doctor investigating arms sales, where he sees his old adversary [[Sil (Doctor Who)|Sil]]. Sil's race, the Mentors, are revealed to have been supplying Yrcanos, the local king of a Viking-like primitive culture, with advanced weaponry. Meanwhile, a scientist, Crozier, is preparing for surgery on Kiv, an influential Mentor whose brain is expanding. The Doctor is portrayed as self-serving and unconcerned with Peri's welfare during the flashback, as he appears to help Crozier and the Mentors by abandoning and betraying Peri and Yrcanos. This uncharacteristic behaviour convinces the Doctor that the evidence has been altered. When the Doctor learns that Peri has been chosen as the new host for Kiv's brain, he allies with Yrcanos to kill the Mentors.

A number of storylines were submitted, with six eventually being commissioned between September 1984 and February 1985. However, in February 1985, the BBC announced that, as a cost-cutting measure owing to the costs of several large projects (not least of which was the launch of ''[[EastEnders]]''), Season 23 was being put back from its planned transmission in January 1986 to the following September, which would be a different [[financial year]].\n\n====Planned serials====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c0849e; color:#fff;\"| Story number\n! style=\"background:#c0849e; color:#fff;\"| No of Episodes\n! style=\"background:#c0849e; color:#fff;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#c0849e; color:#fff;\"| Written by\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |RTitle = ''[[The Nightmare Fair]]''\n |WrittenBy = [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]]\n |ShortSummary = Written by former producer Graham Williams, this two-part story was commissioned on 25 September 1984 as ''Arcade''<ref name = \"dwmse3d19\">{{harvnb|Pixley|2003b|p=19}}</ref> and was planned to open the original 23rd series.<ref name = \"eighties83\">{{harvnb|Howe|Stammers|Walker|1996|p=83}}.</ref> Nathan-Turner hoped to have [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] direct the adventure.<ref name = \"dwmse3g\">{{harvnb|Pixley|2003|p=20}}.</ref> Williams wrote a [[novelisation]] of the script which was published by [[Target Books]] in May 1989.

John Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward eventually came up with the idea of having the various serials linked with an overarching narrative\u2014this led to the conception of a trial story with a ''[[Christmas Carol]]''-inspired \"past, present, and future\" storyline,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> thereby stretching the length of the season. The planned 14-part serial was intended to be divided into a pair of 4-part stories followed by a 6-part one.

His draft of the first chapter, ''The Mysterious Planet'', was criticised by BBC Head of Series and Serials [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]] for its comedic content, contradicting the BBC controller's request for a more humorous series \u2013 which took away confidence from Holmes.\n\nThe second chapter, ''Mindwarp'', was written by [[Philip Martin (screenwriter)|Philip Martin]].

The season marks [[Colin Baker]]'s final regular appearance as the [[Sixth Doctor]].\n\nThe idea for the serial stemmed from several production changes to ''Doctor Who'', such as reduced screen time for the season and an instruction from [[BBC One |BBC1]] controller [[Michael Grade]] that the series needed to contain less violence and more humour.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/season23.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide - Season 23 |publisher=BBC |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2019-07-18}}</ref> Several problems occurred during production, including the death of scriptwriter [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]] and the resignation of script editor [[Eric Saward]].

A mysterious character called the [[Valeyard]] acts as prosecutor. In the first two chapters (''The Mysterious Planet'' and ''Mindwarp'') events from the Doctor's past and present are submitted as evidence of his guilt. The third chapter (''Terror of the Vervoids'') presents future events in the Doctor's defence. In the concluding chapter (''The Ultimate Foe'') the Doctor's trial is halted, and the Doctor confronts the Valeyard and his old rival, the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]], in order to clear his name and to save the High Council.\n\n==Casting==\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who cast members}}\n\n=== Main cast ===\n* [[Colin Baker]] as the [[Sixth Doctor]]\n* [[Nicola Bryant]] as [[Peri Brown]]\n* [[Bonnie Langford]] as [[Melanie Bush]]\n\n[[Colin Baker]] makes his final appearance as the [[Sixth Doctor|Doctor]] in this longest-running serial before being fired by the [[BBC]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n[[Nicola Bryant]] departs as [[Peri Brown]] in ''[[Mindwarp]]''.\n[[Bonnie Langford]] makes her debut as the Doctor's future companion [[Melanie Bush]] in ''[[Terror of the Vervoids]]''.\n\n===Recurring stars ===\n* [[Michael Jayston]] as the [[Valeyard]]\n* [[Lynda Bellingham]] as the Inquisitor\n* [[Anthony Ainley]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]]\n* [[Tony Selby]] as [[Sabalom Glitz]]\n\n[[Michael Jayston]] and [[Lynda Bellingham]] both appeared throughout the whole serial, the former as the [[Valeyard]] and the latter as the Inquisitor.

All episodes were 25 minutes long, with the exception of Part 14, which ran for 28 minutes.  This unique running time was the result of a plea by John Nathan-Turner to his superiors at the BBC that the serial's final episode needed the additional three minutes to conclude the story properly. Although there were now 14 episodes in the season, the total running time was significantly reduced since the episodes were just over half as long.\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Episode table|main  |background=#C0849E |overall=5 |season=5 |title=15 |aux1=16 |director=12 |writer=13 |airdate=15 |prodcode=6 |viewers=10 |aux4=3 |country=UK |overallT=Story |seasonT=Serial |titleT=Serial title |aux1T=Episode titles\n|aux4T      = [[Appreciation Index|{{abbr|AI|Appreciation Index|style=color:white}}]]\n|aux4R      = <ref name=\"AllRatings\" />\n|viewersR   = <ref name=\"AllRatings\" />\n|episodes   =\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist |The Trial of a Time Lord\n| Serial            = yes\n| NumParts          = 4\n| EpisodeNumber     = 143a\n| EpisodeNumber2    = 1\n| RTitle            = ''[[The Mysterious Planet]]''\n| Aux1_1            = \"Part One\"\n| Aux1_2            = \"Part Two\"\n| Aux1_3            = \"Part Three\"\n| Aux1_4            = \"Part Four\"\n| DirectedBy        = [[Nicholas Mallett]]\n| WrittenBy         = [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]]\n| OriginalAirDate_1 = {{Start date|1986|9|6|df=y}}\n| OriginalAirDate_2 = {{Start date|1986|9|13|df=y}}\n| OriginalAirDate_3 = {{Start date|1986|9|20|df=y}}\n| OriginalAirDate_4 = {{Start date|1986|9|27|df=y}}\n| ProdCode          = 7A\n| Viewers_1         = 4.9\n| Viewers_2         = 4.9\n| Viewers_3         = 3.9\n| Viewers_4         = 3.7\n| Aux4_1            = 72\n| Aux4_2            = 69\n| Aux4_3            = 70\n| Aux4_4            = 72\n| ShortSummary      = The Doctor's [[TARDIS]] is plucked out of time and space.

The [[Valeyard]] presents the transgressions on a video screen, depicting the Doctor\u2019s past adventures with companion [[Peri Brown]]. The Doctor becomes suspicious about evidence being censored. In the first flashback, the Doctor and Peri arrive on the tribal planet Ravalox, located two light years from Earth's known location. The Doctor notes a similarity between Ravalox and Earth, with objects from Earth\u2014notably [[Marble Arch tube station]] and the novel ''[[Moby Dick]]''\u2014present on Ravalox. The only apparent astronomical difference between the two is Ravalox's position in the galaxy. Rogue [[Sabalom Glitz]] attempts to obtain secrets and technology that are guarded by a robot. The Doctor is forced to deactivate the robot\u2019s unstable power supply to avoid a chain reaction, but in the process the secrets are destroyed.

Sil's race, the Mentors, are revealed to have been supplying Yrcanos, the local king of a Viking-like primitive culture, with advanced weaponry. Meanwhile, a scientist, Crozier, is preparing for surgery on Kiv, an influential Mentor whose brain is expanding. The Doctor is portrayed as self-serving and unconcerned with Peri's welfare during the flashback, as he appears to help Crozier and the Mentors by abandoning and betraying Peri and Yrcanos. This uncharacteristic behaviour convinces the Doctor that the evidence has been altered. When the Doctor learns that Peri has been chosen as the new host for Kiv's brain, he allies with Yrcanos to kill the Mentors.

He chooses events from the future, in hopes that it will prove he has reformed after the Thoros-Beta incident.

In the year 2986, the Doctor and his new companion [[Melanie Bush|Mel]] answer a distress call from the interstellar ship ''Hyperion III''. The ship is sabotaged and people are dying at the hands of the Vervoids, plant-like humanoids who the Doctor learns were genetically engineered to be slaves. Although the Doctor and Mel are able to stop the Vervoids, he admits that none of the Vervoids survived the voyage.

The secrets Glitz sought had been stolen from the Time Lords, and Earth was ravaged and moved to preserve them. The Doctor was used as a scapegoat, and the Valeyard\u2014an amalgam of the Doctor's evil personalities from between his twelfth and final incarnation\u2014was offered the Doctor's remaining regenerations. To ensure a guilty verdict, the Valeyard distorted the evidence. The Doctor's attempts to prevent the Valeyard from killing the High Council are stopped by the Master, who wants to dispose of the Doctor. The Doctor defeats the Valeyard by destroying the Matrix archive. The Inquisitor clears the Doctor of all charges and offers him the presidency, which he declines, claiming she should stand instead. The Inquisitor informs The Doctor that Peri is not dead, but alive and well and has become the Warrior Queen Consort of King Yrcanos.

A number of storylines were submitted, with six eventually being commissioned between September 1984 and February 1985. However, in February 1985, the BBC announced that, as a cost-cutting measure owing to the costs of several large projects (not least of which was the launch of ''[[EastEnders]]''), Season 23 was being put back from its planned transmission in January 1986 to the following September, which would be a different [[financial year]].\n\n====Planned serials====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c0849e; color:#fff;\"| Story number\n! style=\"background:#c0849e; color:#fff;\"| No of Episodes\n! style=\"background:#c0849e; color:#fff;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#c0849e; color:#fff;\"| Written by\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |RTitle = ''[[The Nightmare Fair]]''\n |WrittenBy = [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]]\n |ShortSummary = Written by former producer Graham Williams, this two-part story was commissioned on 25 September 1984 as ''Arcade''<ref name = \"dwmse3d19\">{{harvnb|Pixley|2003b|p=19}}</ref> and was planned to open the original 23rd series.<ref name = \"eighties83\">{{harvnb|Howe|Stammers|Walker|1996|p=83}}.</ref> Nathan-Turner hoped to have [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] direct the adventure.<ref name = \"dwmse3g\">{{harvnb|Pixley|2003|p=20}}.</ref> Williams wrote a [[novelisation]] of the script which was published by [[Target Books]] in May 1989.

The planned 14-part serial was intended to be divided into a pair of 4-part stories followed by a 6-part one.
