The factory had transfer sidings connected to both the up and down lines. The ROF line which was never electrified ran on to the transfer sidings a few yards west from the Bishopton station. It crossed Ingleston Road via a gated level crossing entering the ROF site from the north. The link remained in-situ right up until closure of the factory but was little used after the early 1990s. The sidings were removed in 2011.\n\n==Accident==\nA passenger train from [[Glasgow]] to [[Greenock]] was leaving the station on the morning of 16 January 1855. A mineral train travelling on the other line in the opposite direction approached and as the trains passed each other, trucks at the rear of the mineral train left the rails. They fell on the up line as the passenger train was coming. This resulted in the passenger train stopping quickly.

The station is on the [[Inverclyde Line|Inverclyde line]], {{convert|13|mi|km}} west of {{stnlnk|Glasgow Central}}. It opened on 29 March 1841.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inbishopton.org.uk/history/documents/34.html |title=Bishopton History: It's been a while |publisher=Inbishopton.org.uk |accessdate=2014-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730020717/http://www.inbishopton.org.uk/history/documents/34.html |archive-date=30 July 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The station is managed by [[Abellio ScotRail]].\n\n==Services==\nBishopton is served by five services per hour (off-peak, Mon-Sat): four to/from {{stnlnk|Gourock}}, and one to/from {{stnlnk|Wemyss Bay}} with five per hour in the other direction to and from [[Glasgow Central station|Glasgow Central]] (three limited stop expresses and two all stops locals). Evenings see a halving of services to Gourock and a reduction to 3tph to Glasgow.<ref>{{NRtimes|May 2016|219}}</ref>\n\nOn Sundays there are two trains per hour to Glasgow Central and hourly services to both Wemyss Bay and Gourock. The rolling stock used is predominantly [[British Rail Class 380|Class 380 EMUs]] but there is the occasional [[British Rail Class 314|Class 314 EMU]].\n\n{{rail start}}\n{{rail line\n|previous = {{Stnlnk|Langbank}}\n|next     = {{Stnlnk|Paisley St James}}\n|route    = [[Abellio ScotRail]]<br/>{{small|[[Inverclyde Line]]}}\n|col      = {{ScotRail colour}}\n|lightcol = {{National Rail colour|ScotRail|branch=Inverclyde Line}}\n}}\n{{Historical Rail Insert}}\n{{rail line\n|previous = {{Stnlnk|Langbank}}\n|next     = {{rws|Georgetown|Scotland}}<br/>{{small|''Line open; station closed''}}\n|route    = [[Caledonian Railway]]<br/>{{small|[[Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway]]}}\n|col      = {{Caledonian colour}}\n|lightcol = {{Caledonian light}}\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==ROF Sidings==\nThere was a [[Standard gauge railway|standard gauge]] link from the [[ROF Bishopton|ROF]] railway line to the Inverclyde line. The factory had transfer sidings connected to both the up and down lines. The ROF line which was never electrified ran on to the transfer sidings a few yards west from the Bishopton station. It crossed Ingleston Road via a gated level crossing entering the ROF site from the north. The link remained in-situ right up until closure of the factory but was little used after the early 1990s. The sidings were removed in 2011.\n\n==Accident==\nA passenger train from [[Glasgow]] to [[Greenock]] was leaving the station on the morning of 16 January 1855. A mineral train travelling on the other line in the opposite direction approached and as the trains passed each other, trucks at the rear of the mineral train left the rails. They fell on the up line as the passenger train was coming. This resulted in the passenger train stopping quickly.
