When a small force of American [[cavalry]] was leaving the city of [[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]], in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], a superior force of Carrancista soldiers attacked which resulted in a bloody running engagement. Using a strategy of organized withdrawal, the Americans were able to repulse the Mexican attacks and safely escape to the fortified village of Santa Cruz de Villegas.<ref>Boot, pg. 201-203</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\nIn early April 1916, [[Major]] [[Frank Tompkins]], who fought in the [[Battle of Columbus (1916)|Battle of Columbus]], persuaded the expedition commander, [[General officer|General]] [[John J. Pershing]], to allow him to lead eight officers and 120 men of Troops K and M, [[13th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|13th Cavalry]], on a raid deep into Mexican territory. Tompkins' intentions were to chase and eventually engage the elusive rebels of [[Pancho Villa]]. After preparations were completed, Major Tompkins left camp on or about April 5. The Americans made a quick ride across the Mexican desert, traveling eighty-five miles in fifty hours. Following several days in the wilderness, Tompkins wrote; \"''We were ragged, shoes were gone and nearly everyone had a beard. We certainly presented a hard-boiled, savage appearance.''\" The Americans were hoping to rest at Parral for a day, and they were told they'd be welcome by a Carrancista officer along the way. However, when the column arrived at Parral in the early morning of April 12, the [[Constitutionalists in the Mexican Revolution|Constitutionalist]] commander of the city, General Ismael Lozano, informed Major Tompkins that coming to the city was a bad idea and that he must leave immediately. Tompkins agreed so the Americans left Parral not long after getting there.<ref>Boot, pg. 201</ref>\n\nOn the way out of town, a group of Mexicans began shouting \"''Viva Villa''\", and other phrases, so Tompkins shouted the same back. A few minutes later, as the column was just outside town, a mounted force of about 550 Carrancistas launched an attack on the American column. In the first few shots a [[sergeant]] standing next to Tompkins was killed and a second man seriously wounded. Heavily outnumbered, Tompkins had no choice but to keep going, and he dismounted a [[rear guard]] to take up positions on a small hill and delay the pursuing Mexicans. In this first skirmish, about twenty-five Mexicans were killed and the rest driven off. The rear guard then regrouped with the main force, where they soon withstood another attack. During this second skirmish, another forty-five Mexicans were killed. Tompkins continued his march to Santa Cruz de Villegas, a fortified town, eight miles from Parral, that the Americans could defend. Though by the time of their arrival the fighting had ceased. The Mexicans were not far away, Tompkins was facing the possibility of his 100-man force being besieged by hundreds of Carrancistas, so he sent out dispatch riders for reinforcements.<ref>Boot, pg. 202</ref>\n\nJust before 8:00 am, a force of [[Buffalo Soldiers]], from the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]], arrived. They had recently engaged about 150 [[Villistas]] at the Battle of Agua Caliente on April 1. Following the arrival of reinforcements, the Mexicans retreated back to Parral, there was no more fighting. Two Americans were killed in the battle and six others were wounded, including Tompkins. For the Mexicans, they suffered the loss of between fourteen and seventy killed or wounded, depending on varying accounts.<ref>Boot, pg. 202</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabq.gov/veterans/history/worldwari|title=History: World War I|accessdate=27 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727094137/http://cabq.gov/veterans/history/worldwari|archive-date=2012-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Battle of Parral was a turning point in the Mexican Expedition, it marked America's furthest penetration into Mexico during the operation, 516 miles from the border, and marked the beginning of a slow withdrawal from Mexico which ended in early 1917. General Pershing was encamped at [[San Francisco Javier de Satev\u00f3|Satevo]], eighty miles north of Parral, when he heard news of the engagement at Parral. According to the [[journalist]] Frank B. Elser, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Pershing was \"''mad as hell''\" so he demanded that the Carrancista government, which by then was in control of Mexico, to make a formal apology. It never came and it made General Pershing believe that instead of fighting just the rebels of Pancho Villa, he would now have to engage the \"''more numerous''\" Carrancista army. Pershing even requested permission from his commanding officer, General [[Frederick Funston]], to capture both the state and capital of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], but it was denied.<ref>Boot, pg. 202</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book\n  |authorlink=Max Boot |last=Boot |first=Max\n  |title=The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power\n  |location=[[New York City|New York]]\n  |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=046500721X |lccn=2004695066\n  |year= 2003 |page=}}\n{{coord missing|Chihuahua}}\n\n[[Category:History of Chihuahua (state)|Parral]]\n[[Category:20th-century military history of the United States|Parral]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Mexican Revolution involving the United States|Parral]]\n[[Category:1916 in the United States|Parral]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1916|Parral]]\n[[Category:Buffalo Soldiers|Parral]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Mexican Revolution|Parral]]\n[[Category:1916 in Mexico]]\n[[Category:April 1916 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict    =Battle of Parral\n|partof      =the [[Border War (1910-1918)|Border War]], [[Pancho Villa Expedition]]\n| image       = 13th Cavalry Columbus NM 1916.jpg\n| image_size  = 300\n|caption     =Men of the 13th Cavalry, in March of 1916, waiting to embark<br>a train in [[Columbus, New Mexico]] for operations during<br>the Pancho Villa Expedition.\n|date        =April 12, 1916\n|place       =near [[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]\n|coordinates =\n|map_type    =\n|latitude    =\n|longitude   =\n|map_size    =\n|map_marksize =\n|map_caption =\n|map_label   =\n|territory   =\n|result      =American tactical victory<ref>{{cite web|url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/battleswars1900s/p/mexican-punitive-expedition.htm|title=Mexican Revolution: US Punitive Expedition|author=Kennedy Hickman|work=About|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref>\n* Mexican attacks repulsed\n|status      =\n|combatant1  ={{flag|United States|1912}}\n|combatant2  ={{flag|Mexico|1916}}\n|commander1  ={{flagicon|United States|1912}} [[Frank Tompkins]]{{WIA}}\n|commander2  ={{flagicon|Mexico|1916}} [[Ismael Lozano]]<ref>Stout, Joseph A., pg. 67, \"Border  conflict: Villistas, Carrancistas, and the Punitive Expedition, 1915-1920\" (1999) TCU Press, {{ISBN|0-87565-200-X}}</ref>\n|units1      =\n|units2      =\n|units3      =\n|strength1   =~150 [[cavalry]]\n|strength2   =~70-120 cavalry\n|casualties1 =5 killed<br>6 wounded\n|casualties2 =7 killed or wounded<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabq.gov/veterans/history/worldwari|title=History: World War I|accessdate=27 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727094137/http://cabq.gov/veterans/history/worldwari|archive-date=2012-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Boot, pg. 202</ref>\n|notes       =\n|campaignbox ={{Campaignbox Battles of the Mexican Revolution involving the United States}}\n}}\nThe '''Battle of Parral''', on April 12, 1916, was the first battle between soldiers of [[Venustiano Carranza]], known as [[Carrancistas]], and the [[United States]] military during the [[Pancho Villa Expedition|Mexican Expedition]].

It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under Scottish law and is owned as The Dynamic Earth Charitable Trust. The centre was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1999.<ref>{{Scottish charity|SC020363}}</ref>\n\nThe project is located close to where renowned Scottish [[Geologist|geologist]] [[James Hutton]] lived and worked in the city in the 18th century. The Dynamic Earth Trust says its aim is: \"to consistently be the most fun place to play, learn and work.\u201d A permanent visitor attraction which presents the story of the planet - how it was created; how it continues to evolve, the prospects for mankind and the effect of hazards both natural and manmade.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Dynamic Earth Corporate Social Responsibility Report |url=https://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/media/1693/csr-at-our-dynamic-earth.pdf |website=www.dynamicearth.co.uk |publisher=Dynamic Earth |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\nThe new exhibition was funded by the [[Millennium Commission]] in association with [[National Lottery Heritage Fund|The Heritage Lottery Fund]] and the [[Scottish Government]] as part of an urban regeneration project for former industrial land in the Holyrood area. The location was previously on a site which was latterly a gas-works and part of the old Holyrood Brewery. The brewers [[Scottish & Newcastle]] donated the site for public use in 1988 however the brewery did not vacate the site until the mid 1990s.\n\nThe new exhibition cost around \u00a334 million to design and construct (out of a budget of \u00a3150 million for the entire area) and was the first major United Kingdom millennium attraction to open. Other exhibitions funded by the Millennium Commission include the [[Glasgow Science Centre]], the [[Falkirk Wheel]] and the [[Millennium Dome]] in London. The centre was officially opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dynamic Earth closes steps due to safety concerns |url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/dynamic-earth-closes-steps-due-safety-concerns-621817 |website=www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com |publisher=The Scotsman |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> Visitor numbers in the opening year of the project were reduced due to the construction of the controversial new [[Scottish Parliament Building]], located directly opposite of Dynamic Earth.

This feature operates with state-of-the-art Uniview software which transforms cinema into a fully interactive [[Planetarium]] and space experience. In an interview with the [[Press & Journal]], chief executive of Dynamic Earth John Simpson, said: \u201cThe new equipment will offer visitors an amazing experience within our ShowDome and will inspire even more children and families about Earth and space sciences with an in-house planetarium and a mobile planetarium to reach families all over Scotland.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=An out of this world experience at Dynamic Earth |url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/travel/1444018/travel-an-out-of-this-world-experience-at-dynamic-earth/ |website=www.pressandjournal.co.uk |publisher=Press and Journal |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nAs well as interactive exhibitions, the site also features the Food Chain Cafe for refreshments and the Natural Selection Gift Shop.

It is located in the [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] area, beside the [[Scottish Parliament building]] and at the foot of [[Holyrood Park#Salisbury Crags|Salisbury Crags]]. It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under Scottish law and is owned as The Dynamic Earth Charitable Trust. The centre was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1999.<ref>{{Scottish charity|SC020363}}</ref>\n\nThe project is located close to where renowned Scottish [[Geologist|geologist]] [[James Hutton]] lived and worked in the city in the 18th century. The Dynamic Earth Trust says its aim is: \"to consistently be the most fun place to play, learn and work.\u201d A permanent visitor attraction which presents the story of the planet - how it was created; how it continues to evolve, the prospects for mankind and the effect of hazards both natural and manmade.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Dynamic Earth Corporate Social Responsibility Report |url=https://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/media/1693/csr-at-our-dynamic-earth.pdf |website=www.dynamicearth.co.uk |publisher=Dynamic Earth |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\nThe new exhibition was funded by the [[Millennium Commission]] in association with [[National Lottery Heritage Fund|The Heritage Lottery Fund]] and the [[Scottish Government]] as part of an urban regeneration project for former industrial land in the Holyrood area. The location was previously on a site which was latterly a gas-works and part of the old Holyrood Brewery. The brewers [[Scottish & Newcastle]] donated the site for public use in 1988 however the brewery did not vacate the site until the mid 1990s.\n\nThe new exhibition cost around \u00a334 million to design and construct (out of a budget of \u00a3150 million for the entire area) and was the first major United Kingdom millennium attraction to open. Other exhibitions funded by the Millennium Commission include the [[Glasgow Science Centre]], the [[Falkirk Wheel]] and the [[Millennium Dome]] in London. The centre was officially opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dynamic Earth closes steps due to safety concerns |url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/dynamic-earth-closes-steps-due-safety-concerns-621817 |website=www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com |publisher=The Scotsman |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> Visitor numbers in the opening year of the project were reduced due to the construction of the controversial new [[Scottish Parliament Building]], located directly opposite of Dynamic Earth. This opened much later in October 2004 after planning difficulties and a cost increase of over \u00a3300 million.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Dynamic Earth from the Radical Road - geograph.org.uk - 925385.jpg|thumb|right|The museum from above, with the new [[Scottish Parliament Building]] in the background.]]\nThe building's structure consists of a steel mast-supported membrane stretched over a steel skeleton.

The large entrance area was designed to have the feel of an outdoor area whilst being completely enclosed. At the front of the museum there is a large [[amphitheatre]] which is used for outdoor events and gathering points for tours of the facility.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dynamic Earth |url=https://www.hopkins.co.uk/projects/1/75 |website=www.hopkins.co.uk |publisher=Hopkins Architects |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Our Dynamic Earth Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Undersea Tunnel at Dynamic Earth]]\nThe facility is designed as an immersive experience with a high level of interactivity. Permanent features of the museum include a real [[Iceberg]], an earthquake experience and the Deep Time Machine which allows visitors to travel through the creation of our planet through multimedia and [[4D film|4D techniques]].\n\nDynamic Earth claims that \u201cvisitors will be able to experience the evolution of our planet and view some of the awesome forces that have formed the environment over millions of years\u201d, courtesy of state-of-the-art interactive exhibits, wraparound imagery and other computer-generated special effects. Visitors will be treated to a 90-minute journey back through time, featuring erupting volcanoes, a life-sized [[Pterodactyl]] and a tropical rainforest complete with constantly changing wild animals.

This feature operates with state-of-the-art Uniview software which transforms cinema into a fully interactive [[Planetarium]] and space experience. In an interview with the [[Press & Journal]], chief executive of Dynamic Earth John Simpson, said: \u201cThe new equipment will offer visitors an amazing experience within our ShowDome and will inspire even more children and families about Earth and space sciences with an in-house planetarium and a mobile planetarium to reach families all over Scotland.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=An out of this world experience at Dynamic Earth |url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/travel/1444018/travel-an-out-of-this-world-experience-at-dynamic-earth/ |website=www.pressandjournal.co.uk |publisher=Press and Journal |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nAs well as interactive exhibitions, the site also features the Food Chain Cafe for refreshments and the Natural Selection Gift Shop.

He considered attending [[Killer Kowalski]]'s wrestling school in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] but decided against it due to the high tuition fees. He was instead trained by Jeff \"Bruiser\" Costa, Rip Morrison, Dan Petiglio, and Paul Zine among others.

He was also invited on [[WROR-FM|WROR]]'s \"Loren and Wally show\" in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]] where he performed \"Feats of Strength\" for guests and listeners. This led to further work in commercials which aired in Massachusetts and Central New England and later [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s [[Country Fried Home Videos]].<ref name=\"RTB-OCT2011\"/> He was also part of the 1999 strongmen documentary \"Beyond Pain\" by James W Kent.\n\nHis strongman demonstrations have been covered by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' (New Hampshire edition), ''[[The Daily Item (Lynn)|The Daily Item]]'', ''[[Revere Journal]]'', ''Silver City Bulletin'', and ''[[The Sun Chronicle]]''.

The show's host, legendary [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book writer]] [[Stan Lee]], nicknamed Ferraro the \"Human Anvil\"<ref name=\"SLSH\"/> which he has since adopted for his strongman performances.

It took place between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s attack on [[Moscow]], the capital and largest city of the [[Soviet Union]]. Moscow was one of the primary [[Strategic goal (military)|military]] and political objectives for [[Axis forces]] in their [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe German [[strategic offensive]], named '''Operation Typhoon''', called for two [[Pincer movement|pincer offensives]], one to the north of Moscow against the [[Kalinin Front]] by the [[3rd Panzer Army|3rd]] and [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer Armies]], simultaneously severing the [[Saint Petersburg\u2013Moscow Railway|Moscow\u2013Leningrad railway]], and another to the south of [[Moscow Oblast]] against the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] south of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], by the [[2nd Panzer Army]], while the 4th Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west.\n\nInitially, the Soviet forces conducted a [[strategic defence]] of the Moscow [[Oblast]] by constructing three [[Defence in depth|defensive belts]], deploying newly raised [[Military reserve force|reserve armies]], and bringing troops from the [[Siberian Military District|Siberian]] and [[Far Eastern Military District]]s. As the German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic [[counter-offensive]] and smaller-scale offensive operations forced the German armies back to the positions around the cities of [[Oryol]], [[Vyazma]] and [[Vitebsk]], and nearly surrounded three German armies.\nIt was a major setback for the Germans, the end of the idea of a fast German victory in the USSR.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shirer |first1=William L. |title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |pages=275\u201387 |chapter=24, Swedish (Book III)}}<!-- data re this cite were transferred from a mal-formed cite to Shirer's great work -- it needs double checking--></ref> As a result of the failed offensive, Field Marshal [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] was dismissed as supreme commander of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]], with Hitler replacing him in the position.\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Operation Barbarossa}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1941-06 to 1941-12.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The eastern front at the time of the Battle of Moscow: {{legend|#fff8d5|Initial Wehrmacht advance \u2013 to 9 July 1941|size=50%}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|Subsequent advances \u2013 to 1 September 1941|size=50%}}\n{{legend|#ebd7ff|Encirclement and battle of Kiev to 9 September 1941|size=50%}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|Final Wehrmacht advance \u2013 to 5 December 1941|size=50%}}]]\n[[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion plan, called for the capture of Moscow within four months. On 22 June 1941, Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union, destroyed most of the [[Soviet Air Force]] on the ground, and advanced deep into Soviet territory using ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' tactics to destroy entire Soviet armies. The German [[Army Group North]] moved towards Leningrad, [[Army Group South]] took control of [[Ukraine]], and [[Army Group Centre]] advanced towards Moscow. By July 1941, Army Group Centre crossed the [[Dnieper River]], on the path to Moscow.{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=243}}\n\nOn 15th of July 1941, German forces captured [[Smolensk]], an important stronghold on the road to Moscow.{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=240}}\nAt this stage, although Moscow was vulnerable, an offensive against the city would have exposed the German flanks. In part to address these risks, and to attempt to secure Ukraine's food and mineral resources, Hitler ordered the attack to turn north and south and eliminate Soviet forces at [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].<ref name=\"Wilt\">Alan F.

Up to two million German troops were committed to the operation, along with 1,000\u20132,470 tanks and assault guns and 14,000 guns. German aerial strength, however, had been severely reduced over the summer's campaign; the ''Luftwaffe'' had lost 1,603 aircraft destroyed and 1,028 damaged. ''Luftflotte'' 2&nbsp;had only 549 serviceable machines, including 158 medium and dive-bombers and 172 fighters, available for Operation Typhoon.<ref>Bergst\u00f6m 2007, p. 90.</ref> The attack relied on standard ''blitzkrieg'' tactics, using ''Panzer'' groups rushing deep into Soviet formations and executing double-pincer movements, pocketing Red Army divisions and destroying them.<ref>Guderian, pp. 307\u201309.</ref>\n\nFacing the [[Wehrmacht]] were three Soviet fronts forming a defensive line based on the cities of [[Vyazma]] and [[Bryansk]], which barred the way to Moscow. The armies comprising these fronts had also been involved in heavy fighting. Still, it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks and 7,600 guns. The [[Soviet Air Force]] ''(Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'', VVS) had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500<ref name=Hardesty61>Hardesty, 1991, p. 61.</ref> to 21,200<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m 2007, p. 118.</ref> aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace these, and at the outset of Typhoon the VVS could muster 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers.<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m 2007, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nOnce Soviet resistance along the Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, encircling Moscow by outflanking it from the north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, and logistical difficulties became more acute. General [[Guderian]], commander of the 2nd Panzer Army, wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages at the start of the operation.<ref>Guderian, p. 307</ref>\n\n===Battles of Vyazma and Bryansk===\n''Further information: [[Battle of Bryansk (1941)]]''<br>\n\nThe German attack went according to plan, with 4th Panzer Group pushing through the middle nearly unopposed and then splitting its mobile forces north to complete the encirclement of Vyazma with 3rd Panzer Group, and other units south to close the ring around Bryansk in conjunction with 2nd Panzer Group. The Soviet defenses, still under construction, were overrun, and spearheads of the 3rd and 4th Panzer Groups met at Vyazma on 10 October 1941.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark Chapter 8,\"The Start of the Moscow Offensive\", p.156 (diagram)</ref><ref name=\"GlantzVAB\">Glantz, chapter 6, sub-ch. \"Viaz'ma and Briansk\", pp. 74 ff.</ref> Four Soviet armies (the [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th]], [[20th Army (Soviet Union)|20th]], [[24th Army (Soviet Union)|24th]] and [[32nd Army (Soviet Union)|32nd]]) were encircled in a large pocket just west of the city.<ref name=\"Vasilevsky139\">Vasilevsky, p. 139.</ref>\n\n[[File:Map Operation Typhoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|German offensives during Operation Typhoon]]\n\nThe encircled Soviet forces continued to fight, and the Wehrmacht had to employ 28 divisions to eliminate them, using troops which could have supported the offensive towards Moscow. The remnants of the Soviet [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western]] and [[Reserve Front]]s retreated and manned new defensive lines around Mozhaisk.<ref name=\"Vasilevsky139\"/> Although losses were high, some of the encircled units escaped in small groups, ranging in size from platoons to full rifle divisions.<ref name=\"GlantzVAB\"/> Soviet resistance near Vyazma also provided time for the Soviet high command to reinforce the four armies defending Moscow (the [[5th Red Banner Army|5th]], [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th]], [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd]] and [[49th Army (Soviet Union)|49th]] Armies). Three rifle and two tank divisions were transferred from East Siberia with more to follow.<ref name=\"Vasilevsky139\"/>\n\nThe weather began to change, hampering the Germans. On 7&nbsp;October, the first snow fell and quickly melted, turning roads and open areas into muddy quagmires, a phenomenon known as ''[[rasputitsa]]'' in Russia. German armored groups were greatly slowed, allowing Soviet forces to fall back and regroup.<ref>Guderian, p. 316.</ref><ref>Clark, pp. 165\u201366.</ref>\n\nSoviet forces were able to counterattack in some cases. For example, the [[4th Panzer Division]] fell into an ambush set by [[Dmitri Leliushenko]]'s hastily formed [[1st Guards Special Rifle Corps]], including [[Mikhail Katukov]]'s 4th Tank Brigade, near the city of [[Mtsensk]]. Newly built [[T-34]] tanks were concealed in the woods as German armor rolled past them; as a [[scratch team]] of Soviet infantry contained their advance, Soviet armor attacked from both flanks and savaged the German [[Panzer IV]] tanks. For the Wehrmacht, the shock of this defeat was so great that a special investigation was ordered.<ref name=\"GlantzVAB\"/> Guderian and his troops discovered, to their dismay, that the Soviet T-34s were almost impervious to German tank guns. As the general wrote, \"Our Panzer IV tanks with their short 75&nbsp;mm guns could only explode a T-34 by hitting the engine from behind.\" Guderian also noted in his memoirs that \"the Russians already learned a few things.\"<ref>Guderian, p. 318.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=David M. Glantz|title=When Titans Clashed|pages=80, 81}}</ref> In 2012, Niklas Zetterling disputed the notion of a major German reversal at Mtsensk, noting that only a battlegroup from the 4th Panzer Division was engaged while most of the division was fighting elsewhere, that both sides withdrew from the battlefield after the fighting and that the Germans lost only six tanks destroyed and three damaged. For German commanders like [[Erich Hoepner|Hoepner]] and Bock, the action was inconsequential; their primary worry was resistance from within the pocket, not outside it.{{sfn|Zetterling|Frankson|2012|p=100}}\n\n[[File:Wojska niemieckie na froncie moskiewskim (2-882).jpg|thumb|left|German armored column advances on the Moscow front, October 1941]]\nOther counterattacks further slowed the German offensive.

According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and teenagers worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million cubic meters of earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory was turned into a [[submachine gun]] armory, a clock factory manufactured [[Land mine|mine]] detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles.<ref>Zhukov, tome 2, p. 22.</ref> Despite these preparations, the capital was within striking distance of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city.

At first, the German forces attempted to bypass Soviet defenses by pushing northeast towards the weakly protected city of Kalinin and south towards Kaluga and [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], capturing all except Tula by 14 October. Encouraged by these initial successes, the Germans launched a frontal assault against the fortified line, taking Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets on 18 October, [[Naro-Fominsk]] on 21 October, and Volokolamsk on 27 October after intense fighting.

Even Hitler seemed to surrender to the idea of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|capture of Warsaw]] in 1939.<ref name=\"GlantzTTG\">Glantz, chapter 6, sub-ch. \"To the Gates\", pp. 80ff.</ref>\n\n[[File:Yuon RedSquare Parade 1941.jpg|thumb|left|[[1941 October Revolution Parade|Parade]] by Soviet troops on [[Red Square]], Friday, 7 November 1941, depicted in 1949 painting by [[Konstantin Yuon]] vividly demonstrating the symbolic significance of the event<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|31}}]]\n\nTo stiffen the resolve of the Red Army and boost civilian morale, Stalin ordered the [[1941 October Revolution Parade|traditional military parade]] on 7&nbsp;November ([[October Revolution Day|Revolution Day]]) to be staged in [[Red Square]]. Soviet troops paraded past the Kremlin and then marched directly to the front. The parade carried a great symbolic significance by demonstrating the continued Soviet resolve, and was frequently invoked as such in the years to come. Despite this brave show, the Red Army's position remained precarious. Although 100,000 additional Soviet soldiers had reinforced [[Klin, Klinsky District, Moscow Oblast|Klin]] and [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], where renewed German offensives were expected, Soviet defenses remained relatively thin. Nevertheless, Stalin ordered several preemptive [[Counter-offensive|counteroffensives]] against German lines. These were launched despite protests from Zhukov, who pointed out the complete lack of reserves.<ref>Zhukov, tome 2, p. 27.</ref> The Wehrmacht repelled most of these counteroffensives, which squandered Soviet forces that could have been used for Moscow's defense. The only notable success of the offensive occurred west of Moscow near [[Aleksino]], where Soviet tanks inflicted heavy losses on the 4th Army because the Germans still lacked anti-tank weapons capable of damaging the new, well-armoured T-34 tanks.<ref name=\"GlantzTTG\"/>\n\n[[File:Poster Defend Moscow.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet poster proclaiming, \"Let's make a stand for Moscow!\"]]\n\nFrom 31 October to 13\u201315 November, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht high command]] stood down while preparing to launch a second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed considerable nominal strength, its fighting capabilities had thoroughly diminished because of wear and fatigue. While the Germans were aware of the continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east as well as the presence of large reserves, given the tremendous Soviet casualties, they did not expect the Soviets to be able to mount a determined defense.<ref>Klink, pp. 574, 590\u201392</ref> But in comparison to the situation in October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied a much stronger defensive position: a triple defensive ring surrounding the city and some remnants of the Mozhaisk line near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense, with at least two rifle divisions in second echelon positions. Artillery support and [[sapper]] teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also many Soviet troops still available in reserve armies behind the front. Finally, Soviet troops\u2014and especially officers\u2014were now more experienced and better prepared for the offensive.<ref name= \"GlantzTTG\"/>\n\nBy 15 November 1941, the ground had finally frozen, solving the mud problem. The armored Wehrmacht spearheads, consisting of 51 divisions, could now advance, with the goal of encircling Moscow and linking up near the city of [[Noginsk]], east of the capital. To achieve this objective, the German Third and Fourth Panzer Groups needed to concentrate their forces between the [[Ivankovo Reservoir|Volga Reservoir]] and Mozhaysk, then proceed past the Soviet 30th Army to Klin and [[Solnechnogorsk]], encircling the capital from the north. In the south, the Second Panzer Army intended to bypass Tula, still held by the Red Army, and advance to [[Kashira]] and [[Kolomna]], linking up with the northern pincer at Noginsk.

Initial German attacks split the front in two, separating the 16th Army from the 30th.<ref name=\"GlantzTTG\"/> Several days of intense combat followed.

Zhukov diverted more forces to the southern end of the bulge, to help Konev trap the [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]]. The Germans pulled their forces out in time. Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made to outflank Army Group Centre's northern forces, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until March 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the [[XXXV Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|German XXXV Corps]], protecting Guderian's Second Panzer Army's southern flank.<ref>Glantz and House 1995, pp. 88\u201390.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' was paralysed in the second half of December. The weather, recorded as \u221242&nbsp;\u00b0C (-44&nbsp;\u00b0F), was a meteorological record.<ref name=\"Bergstrom 2003, p. 297\">Bergstrom 2003, p. 297.</ref> Logistical difficulties and freezing temperatures created technical difficulties until January 1942. In the meantime, the ''Luftwaffe'' had virtually vanished from the skies over Moscow, while the [[Red Air Force]], operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger.<ref name=\"Bergstrom 2003, p. 297\"/> On 4&nbsp;January, the skies cleared. The ''Luftwaffe'' was quickly reinforced, as Hitler hoped it would save the situation. The ''Kampfgruppen'' (Bomber Groups) II./[[KG 4]] and II./[[KG 30]] arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four ''Transportgruppen'' (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports were deployed from ''[[Luftflotte 4]]'' (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. It was a last minute effort and it worked. The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets' best efforts, the ''Luftwaffe'' had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Centre. Between 17 and 22 December the ''Luftwaffe'' destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army's pursuit of the German Army.<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m 2007, pp. 112\u201313.</ref><ref>Bergstr\u00f6m 2003, p. 299.</ref>\n\nIn the centre, Soviet progress was much slower. Soviet troops liberated Naro-Fominsk only on 26 December, Kaluga on 28 December, and Maloyaroslavets on 2&nbsp;January, after ten days of violent action. Soviet reserves ran low, and the offensive halted on 7&nbsp;January 1942, after having pushed the exhausted and freezing German armies back {{convert|100|-|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Moscow. Stalin continued to order more offensives in order to trap and destroy Army Group Centre in front of Moscow, but the Red Army was exhausted and overstretched and they failed.<ref>Glantz and House 1995, pp. 91\u201397.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|Battles of Rzhev}}\n[[File:Medal Defense of Moscow.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5<!--size for long image-->|[[Medal \"For the Defence of Moscow\"]]: 1,028,600  were awarded from 1 May 1944.]]\n\nThe Red Army's winter counter-offensive drove the Wehrmacht from Moscow, but the city was still considered to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first appeared to be in shock due to the initial German success.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning for war: the Red Army and the catastrophe of 1941|last = Roberts|first = Cynthia A.|date = December 1995|journal = Europe-Asia Studies|doi = 10.1080/09668139508412322|pmid = |access-date = |quote = Marshal Georgii K.

Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the [[Battles of Rzhev]]) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole front was moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Centre was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper [[Dnieper]] at the end of the [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Second Battle of Smolensk]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Moscow Strikes Back 27-40 Germans Surrendering.jpg|thumb|left|German soldiers surrender: still from the documentary ''[[Moscow Strikes Back]]'', 1942]]\nFurious that his army had been unable to take Moscow, Hitler dismissed his commander-in-chief, [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], on 19 December 1941, and took personal charge of the Wehrmacht,<ref name=\"Guderian 359\"/> effectively taking control of all military decisions.

This resulted in Stalin becoming overconfident and deciding to further expand the offensive. On 5&nbsp;January 1942, during a meeting in the Kremlin, Stalin announced that he was planning a general spring offensive, which would be staged simultaneously near Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, and the Crimea. This plan was accepted over Zhukov's objections.<ref>Zhukov, tome 2, pp. 43\u201344.</ref> Low Red Army reserves and Wehrmacht tactical skill led to a bloody stalemate near Rzhev, known as the \"[[Battles of Rzhev|Rzhev meat grinder]]\", and to a string of Red Army defeats, such as the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]], the failed attempt at elimination of the [[Demyansk pocket]], and the encirclement of General [[Andrey Vlasov]]'s army in a [[Lyuban Offensive Operation|failed attempt]] to lift the [[siege of Leningrad]], and the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|destruction]] of Red Army forces in Crimea.

The parade includes troops of the [[Moscow Garrison]] and the [[Western Military District]], which usually numbers to close to 3,000 soldiers, cadets, and [[Red Army]] reenactors. The parade is presided by the [[Mayor of Moscow]] who delivers a speech during the event. Prior to the start of the parade, an historical reenactment of the Battle of Moscow is performed by young students, volunteers, and historical enthusiasts.<ref>For example {{cite news |title=Russia re-enacts historic WW2 parade in Moscow |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-50330568/russia-re-enacts-historic-ww2-parade-in-moscow |work=BBC News |date=7 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:4Samarin.jpg|thumb|Soldiers dressed in [[Red Army]] uniforms carrying the standards of the military fronts of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] on [[Red Square]], 7 November 2018.]]\n\nThe parade commands are always given by a high ranking veteran of the armed forces (usually with a billet of a Colonel) who gives the orders for the march past from the grandstand near the [[Lenin Mausoleum]].

Not all historians agree on what should be considered the \"Battle of Moscow\" in the timeline of World War II. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation Typhoon on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2&nbsp;October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive.{{cn|date=January 2020}} In particular, some sources (such as Erickson<ref name=\"Erickson\">John Erickson, ''Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies'', table 12.4</ref> and Glantz<ref name=\"GlantzB\">Glantz, Table B</ref>) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive \"stop\" on 7&nbsp;January 1942\u2014thus lowering the number of casualties.{{or|date=January 2020}}\n\nThere are also significant differences in figures from various sources. John Erickson, in his ''Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies'', gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942.<ref name=\"Erickson\"/> Glantz, in his book ''When Titans Clashed'', gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7&nbsp;January 1942.<ref name=\"GlantzB\"/> The official Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Centre between 1&nbsp;October 1941 and 10 January 1942.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heeresarzt 10-Day Casualty Reports per Army/Army Group, 1941|url=http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec41.html|accessdate=28 March 2012|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025022023/http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec41.html|archivedate=25 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, this official report does not match unofficial reports from individual battalion and divisional officers and commanders at the front, who record suffering far higher casualties than was officially reported.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Retreat|last = Jones|first = Michael|publisher = Thomas Dunne Books|year = 2009|isbn = 9780719569265|location = New York|pages = 107, 126\u201327, 292}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Georgy Zhukov]]\n* [[Ivan Panfilov]]\n* [[Panfilov's Twenty-Eight Guardsmen]]\n* [[German war crimes during the Battle of Moscow]]\n* [[8th Guards Motor Rifle Division]]\n* [[78th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book |last=Bellamy |first=Chris |title=Absolute War: Soviet Russia in the Second World War. |year=2007 |publisher=Vintage Books |place= New York |isbn=978-0-375-72471-8}}.\n* Braithwaite, Rodric.

It took place between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s attack on [[Moscow]], the capital and largest city of the [[Soviet Union]]. Moscow was one of the primary [[Strategic goal (military)|military]] and political objectives for [[Axis forces]] in their [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe German [[strategic offensive]], named '''Operation Typhoon''', called for two [[Pincer movement|pincer offensives]], one to the north of Moscow against the [[Kalinin Front]] by the [[3rd Panzer Army|3rd]] and [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer Armies]], simultaneously severing the [[Saint Petersburg\u2013Moscow Railway|Moscow\u2013Leningrad railway]], and another to the south of [[Moscow Oblast]] against the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] south of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], by the [[2nd Panzer Army]], while the 4th Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west.\n\nInitially, the Soviet forces conducted a [[strategic defence]] of the Moscow [[Oblast]] by constructing three [[Defence in depth|defensive belts]], deploying newly raised [[Military reserve force|reserve armies]], and bringing troops from the [[Siberian Military District|Siberian]] and [[Far Eastern Military District]]s. As the German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic [[counter-offensive]] and smaller-scale offensive operations forced the German armies back to the positions around the cities of [[Oryol]], [[Vyazma]] and [[Vitebsk]], and nearly surrounded three German armies.\nIt was a major setback for the Germans, the end of the idea of a fast German victory in the USSR.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shirer |first1=William L. |title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |pages=275\u201387 |chapter=24, Swedish (Book III)}}<!-- data re this cite were transferred from a mal-formed cite to Shirer's great work -- it needs double checking--></ref> As a result of the failed offensive, Field Marshal [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] was dismissed as supreme commander of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]], with Hitler replacing him in the position.\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Operation Barbarossa}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1941-06 to 1941-12.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The eastern front at the time of the Battle of Moscow: {{legend|#fff8d5|Initial Wehrmacht advance \u2013 to 9 July 1941|size=50%}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|Subsequent advances \u2013 to 1 September 1941|size=50%}}\n{{legend|#ebd7ff|Encirclement and battle of Kiev to 9 September 1941|size=50%}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|Final Wehrmacht advance \u2013 to 5 December 1941|size=50%}}]]\n[[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion plan, called for the capture of Moscow within four months. On 22 June 1941, Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union, destroyed most of the [[Soviet Air Force]] on the ground, and advanced deep into Soviet territory using ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' tactics to destroy entire Soviet armies. The German [[Army Group North]] moved towards Leningrad, [[Army Group South]] took control of [[Ukraine]], and [[Army Group Centre]] advanced towards Moscow. By July 1941, Army Group Centre crossed the [[Dnieper River]], on the path to Moscow.{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=243}}\n\nOn 15th of July 1941, German forces captured [[Smolensk]], an important stronghold on the road to Moscow.{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=240}}\nAt this stage, although Moscow was vulnerable, an offensive against the city would have exposed the German flanks. In part to address these risks, and to attempt to secure Ukraine's food and mineral resources, Hitler ordered the attack to turn north and south and eliminate Soviet forces at [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].<ref name=\"Wilt\">Alan F.

Up to two million German troops were committed to the operation, along with 1,000\u20132,470 tanks and assault guns and 14,000 guns. German aerial strength, however, had been severely reduced over the summer's campaign; the ''Luftwaffe'' had lost 1,603 aircraft destroyed and 1,028 damaged. ''Luftflotte'' 2&nbsp;had only 549 serviceable machines, including 158 medium and dive-bombers and 172 fighters, available for Operation Typhoon.<ref>Bergst\u00f6m 2007, p. 90.</ref> The attack relied on standard ''blitzkrieg'' tactics, using ''Panzer'' groups rushing deep into Soviet formations and executing double-pincer movements, pocketing Red Army divisions and destroying them.<ref>Guderian, pp. 307\u201309.</ref>\n\nFacing the [[Wehrmacht]] were three Soviet fronts forming a defensive line based on the cities of [[Vyazma]] and [[Bryansk]], which barred the way to Moscow. The armies comprising these fronts had also been involved in heavy fighting. Still, it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks and 7,600 guns. The [[Soviet Air Force]] ''(Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'', VVS) had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500<ref name=Hardesty61>Hardesty, 1991, p. 61.</ref> to 21,200<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m 2007, p. 118.</ref> aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace these, and at the outset of Typhoon the VVS could muster 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers.<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m 2007, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nOnce Soviet resistance along the Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, encircling Moscow by outflanking it from the north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, and logistical difficulties became more acute. General [[Guderian]], commander of the 2nd Panzer Army, wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages at the start of the operation.<ref>Guderian, p. 307</ref>\n\n===Battles of Vyazma and Bryansk===\n''Further information: [[Battle of Bryansk (1941)]]''<br>\n\nThe German attack went according to plan, with 4th Panzer Group pushing through the middle nearly unopposed and then splitting its mobile forces north to complete the encirclement of Vyazma with 3rd Panzer Group, and other units south to close the ring around Bryansk in conjunction with 2nd Panzer Group. The Soviet defenses, still under construction, were overrun, and spearheads of the 3rd and 4th Panzer Groups met at Vyazma on 10 October 1941.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark Chapter 8,\"The Start of the Moscow Offensive\", p.156 (diagram)</ref><ref name=\"GlantzVAB\">Glantz, chapter 6, sub-ch. \"Viaz'ma and Briansk\", pp. 74 ff.</ref> Four Soviet armies (the [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th]], [[20th Army (Soviet Union)|20th]], [[24th Army (Soviet Union)|24th]] and [[32nd Army (Soviet Union)|32nd]]) were encircled in a large pocket just west of the city.<ref name=\"Vasilevsky139\">Vasilevsky, p. 139.</ref>\n\n[[File:Map Operation Typhoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|German offensives during Operation Typhoon]]\n\nThe encircled Soviet forces continued to fight, and the Wehrmacht had to employ 28 divisions to eliminate them, using troops which could have supported the offensive towards Moscow. The remnants of the Soviet [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western]] and [[Reserve Front]]s retreated and manned new defensive lines around Mozhaisk.<ref name=\"Vasilevsky139\"/> Although losses were high, some of the encircled units escaped in small groups, ranging in size from platoons to full rifle divisions.<ref name=\"GlantzVAB\"/> Soviet resistance near Vyazma also provided time for the Soviet high command to reinforce the four armies defending Moscow (the [[5th Red Banner Army|5th]], [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th]], [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd]] and [[49th Army (Soviet Union)|49th]] Armies). Three rifle and two tank divisions were transferred from East Siberia with more to follow.<ref name=\"Vasilevsky139\"/>\n\nThe weather began to change, hampering the Germans. On 7&nbsp;October, the first snow fell and quickly melted, turning roads and open areas into muddy quagmires, a phenomenon known as ''[[rasputitsa]]'' in Russia. German armored groups were greatly slowed, allowing Soviet forces to fall back and regroup.<ref>Guderian, p. 316.</ref><ref>Clark, pp. 165\u201366.</ref>\n\nSoviet forces were able to counterattack in some cases. For example, the [[4th Panzer Division]] fell into an ambush set by [[Dmitri Leliushenko]]'s hastily formed [[1st Guards Special Rifle Corps]], including [[Mikhail Katukov]]'s 4th Tank Brigade, near the city of [[Mtsensk]]. Newly built [[T-34]] tanks were concealed in the woods as German armor rolled past them; as a [[scratch team]] of Soviet infantry contained their advance, Soviet armor attacked from both flanks and savaged the German [[Panzer IV]] tanks. For the Wehrmacht, the shock of this defeat was so great that a special investigation was ordered.<ref name=\"GlantzVAB\"/> Guderian and his troops discovered, to their dismay, that the Soviet T-34s were almost impervious to German tank guns. As the general wrote, \"Our Panzer IV tanks with their short 75&nbsp;mm guns could only explode a T-34 by hitting the engine from behind.\" Guderian also noted in his memoirs that \"the Russians already learned a few things.\"<ref>Guderian, p. 318.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=David M.

At first, the German forces attempted to bypass Soviet defenses by pushing northeast towards the weakly protected city of Kalinin and south towards Kaluga and [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], capturing all except Tula by 14 October. Encouraged by these initial successes, the Germans launched a frontal assault against the fortified line, taking Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets on 18 October, [[Naro-Fominsk]] on 21 October, and Volokolamsk on 27 October after intense fighting.

Soviet troops paraded past the Kremlin and then marched directly to the front. The parade carried a great symbolic significance by demonstrating the continued Soviet resolve, and was frequently invoked as such in the years to come. Despite this brave show, the Red Army's position remained precarious. Although 100,000 additional Soviet soldiers had reinforced [[Klin, Klinsky District, Moscow Oblast|Klin]] and [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], where renewed German offensives were expected, Soviet defenses remained relatively thin. Nevertheless, Stalin ordered several preemptive [[Counter-offensive|counteroffensives]] against German lines. These were launched despite protests from Zhukov, who pointed out the complete lack of reserves.<ref>Zhukov, tome 2, p. 27.</ref> The Wehrmacht repelled most of these counteroffensives, which squandered Soviet forces that could have been used for Moscow's defense. The only notable success of the offensive occurred west of Moscow near [[Aleksino]], where Soviet tanks inflicted heavy losses on the 4th Army because the Germans still lacked anti-tank weapons capable of damaging the new, well-armoured T-34 tanks.<ref name=\"GlantzTTG\"/>\n\n[[File:Poster Defend Moscow.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet poster proclaiming, \"Let's make a stand for Moscow!\"]]\n\nFrom 31 October to 13\u201315 November, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht high command]] stood down while preparing to launch a second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed considerable nominal strength, its fighting capabilities had thoroughly diminished because of wear and fatigue. While the Germans were aware of the continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east as well as the presence of large reserves, given the tremendous Soviet casualties, they did not expect the Soviets to be able to mount a determined defense.<ref>Klink, pp. 574, 590\u201392</ref> But in comparison to the situation in October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied a much stronger defensive position: a triple defensive ring surrounding the city and some remnants of the Mozhaisk line near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense, with at least two rifle divisions in second echelon positions. Artillery support and [[sapper]] teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also many Soviet troops still available in reserve armies behind the front. Finally, Soviet troops\u2014and especially officers\u2014were now more experienced and better prepared for the offensive.<ref name= \"GlantzTTG\"/>\n\nBy 15 November 1941, the ground had finally frozen, solving the mud problem. The armored Wehrmacht spearheads, consisting of 51 divisions, could now advance, with the goal of encircling Moscow and linking up near the city of [[Noginsk]], east of the capital. To achieve this objective, the German Third and Fourth Panzer Groups needed to concentrate their forces between the [[Ivankovo Reservoir|Volga Reservoir]] and Mozhaysk, then proceed past the Soviet 30th Army to Klin and [[Solnechnogorsk]], encircling the capital from the north. In the south, the Second Panzer Army intended to bypass Tula, still held by the Red Army, and advance to [[Kashira]] and [[Kolomna]], linking up with the northern pincer at Noginsk.

Guderian's army \"beat a hasty retreat towards Venev\" and then Sukhinichi. \"The threat overhanging Tula was removed.\"<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|44\u201346, 48\u201351}}\n\nOn 8&nbsp;December, Hitler had signed his [[F\u00fchrer Directives|directive]] No.39, ordering the Wehrmacht to assume a defensive stance on the whole front. German troops were unable to organize a solid defense at their present locations and were forced to pull back to consolidate their lines. Guderian wrote that discussions with [[Hans Schmidt (general of the infantry)|Hans Schmidt]] and [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]] took place the same day, and both commanders agreed the current front line could not be held.<ref>Guderian, pp. 353\u201355.</ref> On 14 December, [[Franz Halder]] and [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]] finally gave permission for a limited withdrawal to the west of the [[Oka river]], without Hitler's approval.<ref>Guderian, p. 354.</ref> On 20 December, during a meeting with German senior officers, Hitler cancelled the withdrawal and ordered his soldiers to defend every patch of ground, \"digging trenches with howitzer shells if needed.\"<ref>Guderian, pp. 360\u201361.</ref> Guderian protested, pointing out that losses from cold were actually greater than combat losses and that winter equipment was held by traffic ties in Poland.<ref>Guderian, pp. 363\u201364.</ref> Nevertheless, Hitler insisted on defending the existing lines, and Guderian was dismissed by 25 December, along with generals Hoepner and Strauss, commanders of the 4th Panzer and 9th Army, respectively.

The offensive liberated Kalinin and the Soviets reached Klin on 7&nbsp;December, overrunning the headquarters of the LVI ''Panzer'' Corps outside the city. As the Kalinin Front drove west, a bulge developed around Klin. The Soviet front commander, General [[Ivan Konev]], attempted to envelop any German forces remaining. Zhukov diverted more forces to the southern end of the bulge, to help Konev trap the [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]]. The Germans pulled their forces out in time. Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made to outflank Army Group Centre's northern forces, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until March 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the [[XXXV Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|German XXXV Corps]], protecting Guderian's Second Panzer Army's southern flank.<ref>Glantz and House 1995, pp. 88\u201390.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' was paralysed in the second half of December. The weather, recorded as \u221242&nbsp;\u00b0C (-44&nbsp;\u00b0F), was a meteorological record.<ref name=\"Bergstrom 2003, p. 297\">Bergstrom 2003, p. 297.</ref> Logistical difficulties and freezing temperatures created technical difficulties until January 1942. In the meantime, the ''Luftwaffe'' had virtually vanished from the skies over Moscow, while the [[Red Air Force]], operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger.<ref name=\"Bergstrom 2003, p. 297\"/> On 4&nbsp;January, the skies cleared. The ''Luftwaffe'' was quickly reinforced, as Hitler hoped it would save the situation. The ''Kampfgruppen'' (Bomber Groups) II./[[KG 4]] and II./[[KG 30]] arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four ''Transportgruppen'' (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports were deployed from ''[[Luftflotte 4]]'' (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. It was a last minute effort and it worked. The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets' best efforts, the ''Luftwaffe'' had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Centre. Between 17 and 22 December the ''Luftwaffe'' destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army's pursuit of the German Army.<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m 2007, pp. 112\u201313.</ref><ref>Bergstr\u00f6m 2003, p. 299.</ref>\n\nIn the centre, Soviet progress was much slower. Soviet troops liberated Naro-Fominsk only on 26 December, Kaluga on 28 December, and Maloyaroslavets on 2&nbsp;January, after ten days of violent action. Soviet reserves ran low, and the offensive halted on 7&nbsp;January 1942, after having pushed the exhausted and freezing German armies back {{convert|100|-|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Moscow. Stalin continued to order more offensives in order to trap and destroy Army Group Centre in front of Moscow, but the Red Army was exhausted and overstretched and they failed.<ref>Glantz and House 1995, pp. 91\u201397.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|Battles of Rzhev}}\n[[File:Medal Defense of Moscow.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5<!--size for long image-->|[[Medal \"For the Defence of Moscow\"]]: 1,028,600  were awarded from 1 May 1944.]]\n\nThe Red Army's winter counter-offensive drove the Wehrmacht from Moscow, but the city was still considered to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first appeared to be in shock due to the initial German success.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning for war: the Red Army and the catastrophe of 1941|last = Roberts|first = Cynthia A.|date = December 1995|journal = Europe-Asia Studies|doi = 10.1080/09668139508412322|pmid = |access-date = |quote = Marshal Georgii K.

Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the [[Battles of Rzhev]]) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole front was moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Centre was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper [[Dnieper]] at the end of the [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Second Battle of Smolensk]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Moscow Strikes Back 27-40 Germans Surrendering.jpg|thumb|left|German soldiers surrender: still from the documentary ''[[Moscow Strikes Back]]'', 1942]]\nFurious that his army had been unable to take Moscow, Hitler dismissed his commander-in-chief, [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], on 19 December 1941, and took personal charge of the Wehrmacht,<ref name=\"Guderian 359\"/> effectively taking control of all military decisions.

This resulted in Stalin becoming overconfident and deciding to further expand the offensive. On 5&nbsp;January 1942, during a meeting in the Kremlin, Stalin announced that he was planning a general spring offensive, which would be staged simultaneously near Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, and the Crimea. This plan was accepted over Zhukov's objections.<ref>Zhukov, tome 2, pp. 43\u201344.</ref> Low Red Army reserves and Wehrmacht tactical skill led to a bloody stalemate near Rzhev, known as the \"[[Battles of Rzhev|Rzhev meat grinder]]\", and to a string of Red Army defeats, such as the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]], the failed attempt at elimination of the [[Demyansk pocket]], and the encirclement of General [[Andrey Vlasov]]'s army in a [[Lyuban Offensive Operation|failed attempt]] to lift the [[siege of Leningrad]], and the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|destruction]] of Red Army forces in Crimea.

The parade is presided by the [[Mayor of Moscow]] who delivers a speech during the event.

Not all historians agree on what should be considered the \"Battle of Moscow\" in the timeline of World War II. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation Typhoon on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2&nbsp;October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive.{{cn|date=January 2020}} In particular, some sources (such as Erickson<ref name=\"Erickson\">John Erickson, ''Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies'', table 12.4</ref> and Glantz<ref name=\"GlantzB\">Glantz, Table B</ref>) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive \"stop\" on 7&nbsp;January 1942\u2014thus lowering the number of casualties.{{or|date=January 2020}}\n\nThere are also significant differences in figures from various sources.

Another 1,000 houses are planned as part of future Bingham, north of the railway line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futurebingham.co.uk/ |title=Future Bingham |website=Crown Estates |date= |accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe A46, to the west of the town, was upgraded and completed in 2013 as a grade-separated dual carriageway. The [[Widmerpool]]-Newark Improvement has been diverted to the west of the former Roman town to preserve archaeological remains. The A52 bypass to the south of the town opened in December 1986.\n\n==Education==\nThere are four schools in Bingham: Robert Miles [[Infant school]], Robert Miles [[Junior School]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertmiles.co.uk |title=Home |website=Robert Miles Junior School |date= |accessdate=5 November 2008}}</ref> Carnarvon [[Primary School]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carnarvon.notts.sch.uk |title=Home |website=Carnarvon Primary School |date= |accessdate=5 November 2008}}</ref> and the comprehensive [[Toot Hill School]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toothill.notts.sch.uk |title=Home |website=Toot Hill School, Bingham, Nottinghamshire |date= |accessdate=5 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Churches==\nThe Anglican parish [[Church of St. Mary and All Saints, Bingham]], occupies a Grade I listed medieval building restored in 1845\u20131846 and again in 1912. It has a peal of eight bells and a 19th-century organ. It belongs to the [[Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham]].\n\nA new Bingham Methodist Church and social centre, built by public subscription, opened on 1 April 2016 at Eaton Place, on the site of the earlier church.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/BinghamMC/ |title=Bingham Methodist Church |website=Facebook |accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref> It belongs to the Grantham and Vale of Belvoir Circuit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.binghammethodist.org.uk/aboutus.htm |title=About Us |website=Bingham Methodist |accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref> Archive documents for Bingham Methodist Circuit date back to 1843.<ref>Nottinghamshire Archives [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F93748 Retrieved 2 March 2018.]</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nAlthough Bingham is largely a [[dormitory town]] for Nottingham, it also has a number of thriving businesses and a busy centre. The town has a shop vacancy rate of just 2% against an East Midlands average of 16%.<ref>{{cite news |title=High street vacancy rates |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/sep/08/high-street-vacancy-rates-retail |accessdate=6 March 2013 |date=8 September 2011 |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Siraj |last=Datoo}}</ref>* There are 20 takeaways and places to eat, 11 hairdressers/salons, 5 estate agents and 39 other retail outlets.\n\nThere is an open-air food market in the central Market Place every Thursday, and a farmers' market there on the third Saturday of the month. Bingham also provides shopping, medical and other services to those in the surrounding villages. Planning permission has been obtained to build a large supermarket near the town centre, but construction has not yet commenced. In March 2015 planning permission was granted for two other chain supermarkets.<ref>{{cite news |title=Budget supermarkets Aldi and Lidl given green light in Bingham |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Budget-supermarkets-Aldi-Lidl-given-green-light/story-26202969-detail/story.html |newspaper=[[Nottingham Post]] |date=19 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721024050/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Budget-supermarkets-Aldi-Lidl-given-green-light/story-26202969-detail/story.html |archivedate=21 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo the north of the town is an industrial estate with about 40 businesses.

At the time it made Canterbury the quickest club (barring the founding clubs) to win a premiership after admission to the competition, a record which was only recently beaten in 1999 by the [[Melbourne Storm]]. It won a second premiership in 1942 but then had to wait another 38 years before breaking through for a third title in 1980. During the 80s, the Bulldogs were a dominant force in the competition appearing in five Grand Finals, winning four of them. In the 90s they featured in the 1995 and 1998 Grand Finals, winning the former. Their most recent success was in 2004 when they beat the [[Sydney Roosters]] 16 - 13. The tryscorers were [[Hazem El Masri]] and [[Matt Utai]], and the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] winner was [[Willie Mason]].\n\n==Players and statistics==\n''Correct as of round 2 the [[2020 NRL

At the time it made Canterbury the quickest club (barring the founding clubs) to win a premiership after admission to the competition, a record which was only recently beaten in 1999 by the [[Melbourne Storm]]. It won a second premiership in 1942 but then had to wait another 38 years before breaking through for a third title in 1980. During the 80s, the Bulldogs were a dominant force in the competition appearing in five Grand Finals, winning four of them. In the 90s they featured in the 1995 and 1998 Grand Finals, winning the former. Their most recent success was in 2004 when they beat the [[Sydney Roosters]] 16 - 13. The tryscorers were [[Hazem El Masri]] and [[Matt Utai]], and the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] winner was [[Willie Mason]].\n\n==Players and statistics==\n''Correct as of round 2 the [[2020 NRL

Note the distinctive Scotch tape spool at left.]]\n\n'''Reel-to-reel audio tape recording''', also called '''open-reel recording''', is the form of [[Magnetic tape#Audio recording|magnetic tape audio recording]] in which the recording medium is held on a [[reel]] that is not permanently mounted in an enclosed [[compact audio cassette|cassette]]. In use, the ''supply reel'' (''feed reel'') containing the tape is placed on a spindle or hub; the end of the tape is manually pulled out of the reel, threaded through mechanical guides and a [[tape head]] assembly, and attached by friction to the hub of the second, initially empty ''takeup reel''.\n\nReel-to-reel systems use tape that is {{convert|1/4|,|1/2|,|1|, or|2|in|mm|2}} wide, which normally moves at {{convert|3+3/4|,|7+1/2|,|15|or|30|in/s|cm/s}}. All standard tape speeds are derived as a binary submultiple of 30 inches per second. The tape in a [[compact cassette]] is {{convert|0.15|in|mm}} wide and normally moves at {{convert|1+7/8|in/s|cm/s}}. By writing the same audio signal across more tape, reel-to-reel systems give much greater [[High fidelity|fidelity]], at the cost of much larger tapes. In spite of the larger tapes, less convenience, and generally more expensive media, reel-to-reel systems, which first started in the early 1940s, remained popular in [[audiophile]] settings into the 1980s, and are filling a widening niche in the new millennium.\n\nReel-to-reel tape was used in early [[tape drive]]s for data storage on [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers and in [[video tape recorder]]s (VTRs). Magnetic tape was also used to record data signals for instrumentation purposes, beginning with the hydrogen bomb tests of the early 1950s. [[Studer]], [[Stellavox]], [[Tascam]], and [[Denon]] still produced reel to reel tape recorders in the 1990s, but {{as of|2017|lc=on}}, only Mechlabor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stm.hu/fomenu/angol/egesz1_angol.htm |title=STM Studiotechnic |publisher=Stm.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> continues to manufacture analog reel-to-reel recorders. Currently (2020), there are two companies that manufacture magnetic recording tape: ATR Services of York, Pennsylvania, and Recording the Masters in Paris, France.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ton S.b, tape unit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Magnetophon]] from a German radio station in World War II.]]\nThe reel-to-reel format was used in the earliest [[Sound recording#Magnetic recording|tape recorders]], including the pioneering German-British [[Ludwig Blattner|Blattnerphone]] (1928) machines of the late 1920s which used [[Tape recorder#Early steel tape recorders|steel tape]],<ref>[http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm \"Blattnerphone\"], Orbem.co.uk, retrieved 02 February 2014</ref> and the German [[Magnetophon]] machines of the 1930s. Originally, this format had no name, since all forms of magnetic [[tape recorder]]s used it. The name arose only with the need to distinguish it from the several kinds of tape [[8-track tape|cartridges]] or [[Audio cassette|cassette]]s such as the [[Fidelipac|endless loop cartridge]] developed for radio station commercials and spot announcements in 1954, the [[RCA tape cartridge|full size cassette]], developed by RCA in 1958 for home use, as well as the [[Audio cassette|compact cassette]] developed by [[Philips]] in 1962, originally for dictation.\n\nThe earliest machines produced distortion during the recording process which German engineers significantly reduced during the [[Nazi Germany]] era by applying a \"[[DC bias|bias]]\" signal to the tape. In 1939, one machine was found to make consistently better recordings than other ostensibly identical models, and when it was taken apart a minor flaw was noticed. Instead of DC, it was introducing an AC bias signal to the tape {{dubious|date=October 2015}}, and this was quickly adapted to new models using a high-frequency [[AC bias]] that has remained a part of audio tape recording to this day. The quality was so greatly improved that recordings surpassed the quality of most radio transmitters, and such recordings were used by [[Adolf Hitler]] to make broadcasts that appeared to be live while he was safely away in another city.\n\nAmerican audio engineer [[Jack Mullin]] was a member of the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] during [[World War II]]. His unit was assigned to investigate German radio and electronics activities, and in the course of his duties, a British Army counterpart mentioned the Magnetophons being used by the allied radio station in [[Bad Nauheim]] near [[Frankfurt]]. He acquired two Magnetophon recorders and 50 reels of [[I.G. Farben]] recording tape and shipped them home. Over the next two years, he worked to develop the machines for commercial use, hoping to interest the Hollywood film studios in using magnetic tape for movie soundtrack recording.\n[[File:Unitra ZK-147.jpg|thumb|right|[[Unitra]] ZK-147, a vintage [[Poland|Polish]]-made reel-to-reel tape recorder]]\n\nMullin gave a demonstration of his recorders at [[MGM Studios]] in [[Hollywood]] in 1947, which led to a meeting with [[Bing Crosby]], who immediately saw the potential of Mullin's recorders to pre-record his radio shows. Crosby invested $50,000 in a local electronics company, [[Ampex]], to enable Mullin to develop a commercial production model of the tape recorder. Using Mullin's tape recorders, and with Mullin as his chief engineer, Crosby became the first American performer to master commercial recordings on tape and the first to regularly pre-record his radio programs on the medium.\n\nAmpex and Mullin subsequently developed commercial stereo and [[Multitrack recording|multitrack audio recorders]], based on the system originally invented by Ross Snyder of Ampex Corporation for their high-speed scientific instrument data recorders. Les Paul had been given one of the first Ampex Model 200 tape decks by Crosby in 1948, and ten years later ordered one of the first Ampex eight track \"Sel Sync\" machines for multitracking, (although when it arrived, it was still set up as an instrument recorder running at 60 inches-per-second and had yet to be converted for audio use). Ampex engineers, who included [[Ray Dolby]] on their staff at the time, went on to develop the first practical [[videotape recorder]]s in the early 1950s to pre-record Crosby's TV shows.\n[[File:magtape1.jpg|thumb|left|7-inch reel of {{convert|1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} recording tape, typical of non-professional use in the 1950s\u201370s. Studios generally used 10{{frac|1|2}} inch reels on [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] backings.]]\n\nInexpensive reel-to-reel tape recorders were widely used for voice recording in the home and in schools, along with dedicated models expressly made for business dictation, before the [[Philips]] [[compact cassette]], introduced in 1963, gradually took over. Cassettes eventually displaced reel-to-reel recorders for consumer use. However, the narrow tracks and slow recording speeds used in cassettes compromised [[high fidelity|fidelity]].  Ampex produced pre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes for consumers of popular and classical music from the mid-1950s to the mid-'70s, as did Columbia House from 1960 to 1984.\n\nFollowing the example set by Bing Crosby, large reel-to-reel tape recorders rapidly became the main recording format used by [[audiophile]]s and professional recording studios until the late 1980s when [[digital audio]] recording techniques began to allow the use of other types of media (such as [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) cassettes and [[hard disk]]s).\n\nEven today, some artists of all genres prefer analog tape, claiming it is more \"musical\" or \"natural\" sounding than digital processes, despite its fidelity inaccuracies. Due to [[harmonic distortion]], bass can thicken up, creating a fuller-sounding mix. In addition, high end frequencies can be slightly [[Audio level compression|compressed]], which some claim is more natural to the human ear, though this claim is difficult to quantify due to the very personal aesthetics as to what is 'natural' sound. In this century, it is not uncommon for some artists to record directly onto digital equipment and then re-record the tracks to analog reel tape (or vice-versa) for this effect, which can sound pleasing or \"warmer\" due to the increase of even harmonics that can often enhance musicality, much in the way vacuum tube amplifiers are preferred over solid-state devices for the same reasons. In addition to all of these attributes, tape \"saturation\" is a unique form of distortion that many [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]] and [[funk]] artists find very satisfying, though with modern technology, these forms of distortion can be simulated digitally.\n\nThe great practical advantage of tape for studios was twofold&nbsp;\u2013 it allowed a performance to be recorded without the 30-minute time limitation of a phonograph disc, and it permitted a recorded performance to be edited or erased and re-recorded again and again on the same piece of media without any waste. For the first time, audio could be manipulated as a physical entity, and the recording process was greatly economized by eliminating the requirement for a highly trained disc-cutting engineer to be present at every recording session. Once a tape machine was installed and calibrated, there was no need for any attendant engineering, other than to spool or replace the tape being used on it. Daily maintenance only consisted of cleaning and occasionally demagnetizing the heads and guides. Tape editing is performed simply by cutting the tape at the required point, and rejoining it to another section of tape using [[adhesive tape]], or sometimes [[adhesive|glue]]. This is called a '''''splice'''''. The splicing tape has to be very thin to avoid impeding the tape's motion, and the adhesive is carefully formulated to avoid leaving a sticky residue on the tape or deck. \"Butt\" splices (cut at exactly 90 degrees to the tape travel) were used for fast edits from one sound to another, though preferably, the splice is made at a much lower angle across the tape so that any \"click\" or other noise introduced by the cut is spread across a few milliseconds of the recording. The low-angle splice would also help to glide the tape more smoothly through the machine and push any loose dirt or debris to the side of the tape path, instead of accumulating in the splice joint. The use of reels to supply and collect the tape made it very easy for editors to manually move the tape back and forth across the heads to find the exact point they wished to edit. Tape to be spliced was clamped in a special ''splicing block'' attached to the deck near the heads to hold the tape accurately while the edit was made. A skilled editor could make these edits very rapidly and accurately. A side-effect of cutting the tape at an angle is that on [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] tapes the edit occurs on one channel a split-second before the other. Long, angled splices can also be used to create a perceptible dissolve from one sound to the next; periodic segments can induce rhythmic or pulsing effects.<ref>Thom Holmes, Electronic and experimental music, 2nd ed., p. 79</ref>\n\n[[File:Reel-to-ReelTapeBigHub.agr.jpg|thumb|Professional-style tape reel designed to fit large NARTB hub.]]\n\nThe performance of tape recording is greatly affected by the width of the tracks used to record a signal, and the speed of the tape. The wider and faster the better, but of course this uses more tape. These factors lead directly to improved [[frequency response]], [[signal-to-noise ratio]], and high-frequency [[distortion]] figures. Tape can accommodate multiple parallel tracks, allowing not just stereo recordings, but multi-track recordings too. This gives the producer of the final edit much greater flexibility, allowing a performance to be remixed long after the performance was originally recorded. This innovation was a great driving force behind the explosion of [[popular music]] in the late 1950s and 1960s. The first multi-tracking recorders had two, three, or four tracks, then eight, sixteen, and twenty-four, and so on. It was discovered early on that new special effects were possible, such as [[phaser (effect)|phasing]] and [[flanging]], delays and echo by re-directing the signal through one or more additional tape machines, while recording the composite result to another. These innovations appeared on pop recordings shortly after multi-tracking recorders were introduced, although, Les Paul had been using tape echo and speed-manipulation effects on his single-track recordings from the 1940s and '50s.\n\n[[File:Sonora-r2r.jpg|thumb|left|A typical home reel-to-reel tape recorder, this one made by Sonora. It could play stereo quarter-track tapes, but record only in one quarter-track mono. Home equipment with missing features were fairly common in the 1950s and 1960s.]]\n\nFor home use, simpler reel-to-reel recorders were available, and a number of track formats and tape speeds were standardised to permit interoperability and prerecorded music.\n\nReel-to-reel [[tape editing]] also gained cult-status when many used this technique on hit-singles in the 1980s.\n\nThere has recently been a revival of reel-to-reel, with quite a few companies restoring vintage units and some manufacturing new tape. In 2018, the first new reel-to-reel tape player in over 20 years was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-08/the-ultimate-analog-music-is-back-ballfinger-reel-to-reel-tape|title=Bloomberg - The Ultimate Analog Music Is Back|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bloomberg.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>.\n\n==Pre-recorded reel tapes==\n[[File:UniversumUNAM47.JPG|thumb|Astrovox Polaris III reel-to-reel 1960 at [[Universum (UNAM)|Universum]] in Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City]]\nThe first prerecorded reel-to-reel tapes were introduced in the United States in 1949; the catalog contained fewer than ten titles with no popular artists. In 1952, EMI started selling pre-recorded tapes in Great Britain. The tapes were twin-sided and mono (2 tracks) and were duplicated in real time on modified EMI BTR2 recorders. [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] joined the reel-to-reel business in 1954. In 1955, EMI released 2-track \"stereosonic\" tapes, although the catalog took longer to be published. Since these EMI tapes were much more expensive than a vinyl LP record, sales were poor; still, EMI released over 300 \"stereosonic\" titles. Then they introduced their Twin Packs, which contained the equivalent of two LP albums but playing at 3.75ips.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe heyday of prerecorded reel tapes was the mid-1960s, but after the introduction of less complicated [[cassette tapes]] and [[8-track tape]]s, the number of albums released on prerecorded reel tape dropped dramatically despite their superior sound quality. By the latter 1960s, their retail prices were considerably higher than competing formats, and musical genres were limited to those most likely to appeal to well-heeled [[audiophile]]s willing to contend with the cumbersome threading of open-reel tape. The introduction of the [[Dolby noise-reduction system]] narrowed the performance gap between cassettes and open-reel, and by 1976 prerecorded open-reel offerings had almost completely disappeared, even from record stores and audio equipment shops. [[Columbia House]] advertisements in 1978 showed that only one-third of new titles were available on reel-to-reel; they continued to offer a select number of new releases in the format until 1984.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:HeavenlyJohnnyMathis.jpg|thumb|Heavenly by Johnny Mathis. Produced by Columbia Records (CQ 333). Circa 1959. Recorded for playback at 7.5 inches per second.]]\n\nSales were very low and specialized during the 1980s. Audiophile reel tapes were made under license by Barclay-Crocker between 1977 and 1986. Licensors included [[Philips Records|Philips]], [[Deutsche Grammophon]], [[Argo Records|Argo]], [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]], [[Musical Heritage Society]] and [[L'Oiseau Lyre]]. Barclay-Crocker tapes were all Dolby encoded and some titles were also available in the [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] format. The majority of the catalog contained classical recordings, with a few jazz and movie soundtrack albums. Barclay-Crocker tapes were duplicated on modified Ampex 440 machines at four times the playing speed, unlike popular reel tapes which were duplicated at 16 times the playback speed. All of the known pre-recorded reel-to-reels on the market are all documented at the Reel To Reel Index website which focuses on the last reels made during the 1980s and includes photographs of all of them. David Winter also released the complete list of 1950s EMI and Barclay-Crocker tapes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nPre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes are also available once again, albeit somewhat expensively as a very high-quality audiophile product, through \"The Tape Project\", as well as several other independent studios and record labels. Since 2007, The Tape Project has released their own albums, as well as previously-released albums under license from other labels, on open-reel tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tapeproject.com|title=The Tape Project|author=|date=|website=www.tapeproject.com}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2015}} The German label Analogue Audio Association (\"AAA\") has also re-released albums on open-reel tape to the high-end audiophile market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanalog.de/|title=Analogue Audio Association - Home|author=|date=|website=www.aaanalog.de}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Tape speeds==\nIn general, the faster the speed, the better the reproduction quality. Higher tape speeds spread the signal longitudinally over more tape area, reducing the effects of dropouts that can be audible from the medium, and noticeably improve high frequency response. Slower tape speeds conserve tape and are useful in applications where sound quality is not critical.\n\n* {{convert|15/16|in/s|cm/s|2}}: used for very long-duration recordings (e.g. recording a [[radio station]]'s entire output in case of complaints, aka \"logging\").\n* {{cvt|1+7/8|in/s|cm/s|2}}: usually the slowest domestic speed, best for long duration speech recordings. [[Compact Cassette|Compact Tape Cassettes]] typically operate at this speed.\n* {{cvt|3+3/4|in/s|cm/s|2}}: common domestic speed, used on most single-speed domestic machines, reasonable quality for speech and off-air radio recordings.\n* {{cvt|7+1/2|in/s|cm/s|2}}: highest domestic speed, also slowest professional; used by most radio stations for \"dubs\", copies of commercial announcements.

The need for a high linear tape speed was made unnecessary with the introduction of the now-obsolete professional [[Quadruplex videotape|Quadruplex]] system in 1956 by Ampex, which segmented the fields of a television image by recording (and reproducing) several tracks at a high-speed across the width of the tape per field of video by way of a vertically spinning headwheel with 4 separate video heads mounted on its edge (a technique called ''transverse scanning''), allowing for the linear tape speed to be much slower. Eventually, transverse scanning was accompanied by the later (and less-expensive) technology of [[helical scan]]ning, which could record one whole field of video per helically-recorded track, recorded at a much lower angle across the width of the tape by the head spinning in the near-horizontal plane, instead of vertically.\n\n===Quality aspects===\nEven though a recording on tape may have been made at studio quality, tape speed was the limiting factor, much like [[bit rate]] is today. Decreasing the speed of analog audio tape causes a uniform decrease in the linearity of the frequency response, increased background noise (hiss), more noticeable [[Dropout (electronics)|dropouts]] where there are flaws in the magnetic tape, and shifting of the (Gaussian) background noise spectrum toward lower frequencies (where it sounds more \"granular\",) ''regardless'' of the audio content. An MP3 of a noisy rock band at a low bit rate will have many more artifacts than a simple flute solo at the same bit rate, whereas either on low-speed tape will have the same uniform background noise profile and high frequency saturation (weakened high end response). A recording on magnetic audio tape is [[linear]]; unlike today's digital audio, not only was jumping from spot to spot to edit time-consuming, editing was destructive\u2014unless the recording was duplicated before edit, normally taking the same amount of time to copy, in order to preserve 75-90 percent of the quality of the original. Editing was done either with a razor blade\u2014by physically cutting and splicing the tape on a metal splicing block, in a manner similar to motion picture film editing\u2014or electronically by dubbing segments onto an edit tape. The former method preserved the full quality of the recording but not the intact original; the latter incurred the same quality loss involved in dubbing a complete copy of the source tape, but preserved the original.\n\nTape speed is not the only factor affecting the quality of the recording. Other factors affecting quality include track width, oxide formulation, and backing material and thickness. The design and quality of the recorder are also important factors, in many ways that are not applicable to digital recording systems. The machine's speed stability ([[wow (recording)|wow-and-flutter]]), head gap size, head quality, and general head design and technology, and the machine's alignment (mostly a maintenance issue, but also a matter of design\u2014how well and precisely it can be aligned) electro-mechanically affect the quality of the recording. The regulation of tape tension affects contact between the tape and the heads and has a very significant impact on the recording and reproduction of high frequencies. The track width of the machine, which is a question of format rather than individual machine design, is one of two major machine factors controlling signal-to-noise ratio (assuming the electronics have high enough S/N ratio not to be a factor), the other being tape speed. S/N ratio varies directly with track width, due to the Gaussian nature of tape noise; doubling the track width doubles the S/N ratio (hence, with good electronics and comparable heads, 8-track cartridges should have half the signal-to-noise ratio of quarter-track {{1/4}}\" tape at the same speed, {{frac|3|3|4}} IPS.)\n\nTape formulation affects the retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, [[print-through]], optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types ([[ferric oxide]] [Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>], [[chromium dioxide]] [CrO<sub>2</sub>], etc.) and also in the precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the [[tensile strength]] and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended [[pre-echo|pre-]] and [[post-echo]]es on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred. In professional half-track use, post-echo is considered less problematic than pre-echo (as the echo is largely masked by the signal itself) and therefore tapes stored for long periods are kept \"tails-out\", where the tape must be first wound \"backwards\" onto the take-up spool before playback.\n\nAnother quality aspect, not related to audio quality, is the backing material.  Typically acetate was used for cheaper tape, and Mylar for more expensive tape.  Acetate would tend to break under conditions that Mylar would survive, though possibly stretch.  The quality of the oxide's binder was also important, for it was common with old tape for the backing to wind on the reel, while the oxide falls off.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} \n\nIn the 1980s, several manufacturers produced certain tape formulations blending polyurethane and polyester as backing material which tended to absorb humidity over many years in storage and partially deteriorate. This problem would only be discovered after an archived tape was opened and required to be played again, after possibly a decade or less on the shelf. The deterioration resulted in a softening of the backing material, making it gooey and sticky which quickly clogged-up tape guides and heads of the reproducer. This phenomenon is known as \"Sticky-Shed Syndrome\" and can be temporarily reversed by baking the tape at a low temperature for several hours to dry it out and restore firmness. The restored tape may then be played normally for several days or weeks, but will eventually return to a deteriorated state again.\n\n===Noise reduction===\nElectronic [[Audio noise reduction#In audio|noise reduction]] techniques were also developed to increase the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and [[dynamic range]] of analog sound recordings. [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby noise reduction]] includes a suite of standards (designated A, B, C, S and SR) for both professional and consumer recording. The Dolby systems use frequency dependent compression/expansion ([[companding]]) during the recording/playback, respectively. Initially, Dolby was offered via a stand-alone box that would go between a recorder and amplifier.  Later audio devices often included Dolby.  [[Dbx (noise reduction)|DBX]] is another noise reduction system that uses a more aggressive companding technique to improve both dynamic range and noise level. However, DBX recordings do not sound acceptable when played on non-DBX equipment.\n\nIn the late 1970s there was also the German Telefunken-made [[High&thinsp;Com]] NR system, a broadband compander, which was technically very advanced. That was a gain in dynamics of roughly 25&nbsp;dB that outperformed the well-known Dolby B by far. High&thinsp;Com was included in more sophisticated cassette recorders, mostly alongside the various Dolby systems. Even though this applied to the consumer market, there was no tape hiss at all that an ear could realize. Another advantage was that recorded tapes could be exchanged amongst High&thinsp;Com recorders without any loss of quality in sound. The \"pumping effect\" mostly reported from critical sound material (e.g. drums or any percussive instrument) with advanced dbx NR did not show in properly calibrated High&thinsp;Com recordings. It did not penetrate the market, possibly due to the less aggressive marketing strategies typical for German companies at that time compared to the widely known Dolby systems.\n\nDolby B eventually became the most popular system for Compact Cassette noise reduction. Today [[Dolby SR]] is in widespread use for professional analog tape recording.\n\n==Multi-track recorders==\n{{main|Multitrack recording}}\nAs studio audio production progressed and became more and more advanced, it became desirable to record the individual instruments and human voices separately and mix them down to one, two, or more speaker channels later, rather than in real time in the studio before recording. In addition to allowing recording engineers and producers to experiment with different mixing arrangements, effects, etc. on the same performance and to produce multiple versions of a recording (without having multiple duplicates of all the studio control room equipment used for mixing), multi-tracking enables the use of non-real-time effects or effects that cannot be produced in the same studio where the musicians perform. Another huge benefit of multi-track production is that recording of individual tracks or certain instruments could be done at different locations at any later date, if required. This allowed a producer to record basic tracks at a given studio, then take that tape to any other studio in the world that used the same format, and record additional tracks as needed for the same piece of music. \n\nReel-to-reel recorders with eight, sixteen, twenty four, and even thirty two tracks were eventually built, with as many heads recording synchronized parallel linear tracks. Some of these machines were larger than a laundry washing machine and used tape as wide as {{convert|2|in|mm}}. A single new reel of 1\" or wider tape, could easily cost $200 to $400. Still, in professional studios, most tapes were recorded only once, and all recording was on new tape, to ensure the maximum quality, as studio time and the time of skilled musicians was much higher than the cost of tape, making it not worth the risk of a recording being lost or degraded due to using media that had been previously recorded upon.\n\nIf more than 24 tracks of recording were required, it was possible in the mid-1970s and onwards with advanced servo-controlled machines to synchronize two (or more) 24-track recorders to behave as a single 48-track recorder. Such precise synchronization was achieved by recording a time code on one of the tracks on each reel of tape: a computer system would keep the two time codes perfectly synchronized, and transparently as seen by the machine operator.\n\n==Digital reel-to-reel==\nAs professional audio evolved from analog magnetic tape to digital media, engineers adapted magnetic tape technology to digital recording, producing digital reel-to-reel magnetic tape machines. Before large hard disks became economical enough to make hard disk recorders viable, studio digital recording meant recording on digital tape. [[Mitsubishi]]'s [[ProDigi]] and [[Sony]]'s [[Digital Audio Stationary Head]] (DASH) were the primary digital reel-to-reel formats in use in recording studios from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. [[Nagra]] introduced digital reel-to-reel tape recorders for use in film sound recording. Digital reel-to-reel tape eliminated all the traditional quality limitations of analog tape, including background noise (hiss), high frequency [[roll-off]], wow and flutter, pitch error, nonlinearity, print-through, and degeneration with copying, but the tape media was even more expensive than professional analog open reel tape, and the linear nature of tape still placed restrictions on access, and winding time to find a particular spot was still a significant drawback. Also, while the quality of digital tape did not progressively degrade with use of the tape, the physical sliding of the tape over the heads and guides meant that the tape still did wear, and eventually that wear would lead to digital errors and permanent loss of quality if the tape was not copied before reaching that point. Still, digital reel-to-reel tape represented a significant advance in audio recording technology, and most who could afford to record using digital tape generally did.3M's 32-track recorder was priced at $115,000. 1978.\n\nBest known for its lines of tape media and professional analog recorders, with its M series of multitrack and 2-track machines, the Mincom division of 3M spent several years developing a digital recording system, including two years of joint research with the BBC. The result was the 3M Digital Audio Mastering System, which consisted of a 32-track deck (16-bit, 50 kHz audio) running 1-inch tape and a 4-track, 1/2-inch mastering recorder. \n\nThe extremely short wavelengths recorded by a digital tape recorded meant that tape and tape transport cleanliness was an important issue. Specks of dust or dirt were large enough in relation to the signal wavelengths that contamination by such dirt could render a recording unplayable. Advanced digital error correction systems - without which the system would have been unworkable - still failed to cope with poorly maintained tape or recorders, and for this reason a number of tapes made in the early years of digital reel-to-reel recorders are now useless.\n\n==As a musical instrument==\nEarly reel-to-reel users realized that segments of tape could be spliced together and otherwise manipulated by adjusting playback speed or direction of a given recording. In the same way as modern keyboards allow [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and playback at different speeds, a reel-to-reel could accomplish similar feats in the hands of a talented user.\n* In the late 1940s, Les Paul began experimenting in his sound studio with the idea of creating a virtual dance band or jazz ensemble by multiplying only himself playing guitar and his vocalist wife, Mary Ford, using a technique of \"bouncing\" or overdubbing from one tape machine to another as many times as needed, layering new vocal or instrument parts on top of the previously recorded tracks simultaneously each time. While this had been accomplished in the past using phonograph discs, that process was cumbersome and resulted in poor audio quality after only one or two overdubs. Additionally, a cut disc had to be discarded if there was any mistake, unlike tape which could simply be re-wound and started again. Magnetic tape recording also allowed Paul to create instruments that sounded in higher or lower octaves by manipulating the speed of the tape while recording his guitar. Additionally, tape echo was almost always used by him to either enhance ambience or create a special effect. He and Mary Ford produced many popular recordings over the next two decades using these techniques, one of their most famous being \"How High the Moon\".\n* In 1958, [[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.|Ross Bagdasarian]], aka David Seville, recorded his voice at one-half normal speed, raising its pitch a full octave when played back at normal speed, to create the early [[rock and roll]] novelty song ''[[Witch Doctor (song)|Witch Doctor]]''.  He later used the same technique, plus overdubbing his voice three times, to create [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]].  Numerous other creators of novelty, comedy, and children's records, such as [[Sheb Wooley]], [[Sascha Burland]], and [[Ray Stevens]] have since used this process.\n* The [[mellotron]] is an electro-mechanical, polyphonic tape replay keyboard that used a bank of parallel linear magnetic audio tape strips.  Playback heads underneath each key enable the playing of pre-recorded sounds. Each of the tape strips has a playing time of approximately eight seconds, after which the tape comes to a dead stop and rewinds to the start position.\n* The title track of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s album ''[[Are You Experienced (album)|Are You Experienced]]'', on which the guitar solo and much of the drum track was recorded, then played backwards on a reel-to-reel.\n* [[The Beatles]] recorded many songs using reel to reel tape as a part of the creative process. Examples include \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite]]\" and \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\" which used a technique where stock recordings were cut up and then randomly reassembled and overdubbed on to the songs (recordings of [[Calliope (music)|calliope organs]] on \"Mr. Kite\", and recordings of [[marching band]]s on \"Yellow Submarine\").<ref>Emrick, Geoff. ''Here, There and Everywhere'', p.168</ref> On \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\" multiple tape machines were used all interconnected patching tape loops that had been prepared by the band. The loops were played in a variety of ways such as backwards, sped up and slowed down. To record the song, the machines, which were located in separate studio rooms, were all manned by individual technicians and played at once to record on the fly.<ref>Emrick, p.113.</ref> \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" combined two different taped versions of the song. The versions were independently altered in speed to end up together miraculously both on pitch and tempo.<ref>Emrick, p.139.</ref> \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" used a radio tuner patched into the sound console to layer random live broadcast over an existing taped track.<ref>Emrick, p.215.</ref> \"[[Revolution 9]]\" also had many effects produced using a reel-to-reel and tape editing techniques.\n* The [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], notably [[Delia Derbyshire]] who \"performed\" (a more accurate term would be \"realised\") the [[Doctor Who theme|original theme tune]] to the BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', by recording various sounds including [[oscillators]] and then manually cutting together each individual note on a group of reel-to-reels.\n* The British rock band 10 CC created a 'human harmonium' of sorts on a 16-track tape recorder by overdubbing their own voices many dozens of times, singing only a single note each time. The cumulative result was a total of 630 voices spread evenly over an octave-and-a-half of proper musical scale notes, with each of the distinct notes assigned to an individual track of the tape. When played back, any track (or note) could then be faded in and out manually on a mixing console arranged like a piano keyboard, to simulate an immense virtual choir. This effect provided the atmospheric backing instrumentation for their song \"I'm not in Love\".\n* Blues guitarist [[Claudio Gabis]], faced with the need to amplify his electric guitar, used a homemade monochrome Geloso recorder as a distorter for his debut album ''[[Manal (album)|Manal]]'' of 1970. This was achieved by injecting a signal and letting it \"record under vacuum\" (without tape, recording infinitely), an amplified signal could be obtained and, considerably increasing the volume, could be distorted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144857/http://rollingstone.es/reportajes/las-biografias-mas-salvajes-del-rock-1/ Las biograf\u00edas m\u00e1s salvajes del rock] Rolling Stone (Argentina), (in Spanish).

Note the distinctive Scotch tape spool at left.]]\n\n'''Reel-to-reel audio tape recording''', also called '''open-reel recording''', is the form of [[Magnetic tape#Audio recording|magnetic tape audio recording]] in which the recording medium is held on a [[reel]] that is not permanently mounted in an enclosed [[compact audio cassette|cassette]]. In use, the ''supply reel'' (''feed reel'') containing the tape is placed on a spindle or hub; the end of the tape is manually pulled out of the reel, threaded through mechanical guides and a [[tape head]] assembly, and attached by friction to the hub of the second, initially empty ''takeup reel''.\n\nReel-to-reel systems use tape that is {{convert|1/4|,|1/2|,|1|, or|2|in|mm|2}} wide, which normally moves at {{convert|3+3/4|,|7+1/2|,|15|or|30|in/s|cm/s}}. All standard tape speeds are derived as a binary submultiple of 30 inches per second. The tape in a [[compact cassette]] is {{convert|0.15|in|mm}} wide and normally moves at {{convert|1+7/8|in/s|cm/s}}. By writing the same audio signal across more tape, reel-to-reel systems give much greater [[High fidelity|fidelity]], at the cost of much larger tapes. In spite of the larger tapes, less convenience, and generally more expensive media, reel-to-reel systems, which first started in the early 1940s, remained popular in [[audiophile]] settings into the 1980s, and are filling a widening niche in the new millenium.\n\nReel-to-reel tape was used in early [[tape drive]]s for data storage on [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers and in [[video tape recorder]]s (VTRs). Magnetic tape was also used to record data signals for instrumentation purposes, beginning with the hydrogen bomb tests of the early 1950s. [[Studer]], [[Stellavox]], [[Tascam]], and [[Denon]] still produced reel to reel tape recorders in the 1990s, but {{as of|2017|lc=on}}, only Mechlabor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stm.hu/fomenu/angol/egesz1_angol.htm |title=STM Studiotechnic |publisher=Stm.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> continues to manufacture analog reel-to-reel recorders. Currently (2020), there are two companies that manufacture magnetic recording tape: ATR Services of York, Pennsylvania, and Recording the Masters in Paris, France.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ton S.b, tape unit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Magnetophon]] from a German radio station in World War II.]]\nThe reel-to-reel format was used in the earliest [[Sound recording#Magnetic recording|tape recorders]], including the pioneering German-British [[Ludwig Blattner|Blattnerphone]] (1928) machines of the late 1920s which used [[Tape recorder#Early steel tape recorders|steel tape]],<ref>[http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm \"Blattnerphone\"], Orbem.co.uk, retrieved 02 February 2014</ref> and the German [[Magnetophon]] machines of the 1930s. Originally, this format had no name, since all forms of magnetic [[tape recorder]]s used it. The name arose only with the need to distinguish it from the several kinds of tape [[8-track tape|cartridges]] or [[Audio cassette|cassette]]s such as the [[Fidelipac|endless loop cartridge]] developed for radio station commercials and spot announcements in 1954, the [[RCA tape cartridge|full size cassette]], developed by RCA in 1958 for home use, as well as the [[Audio cassette|compact cassette]] developed by [[Philips]] in 1962, originally for dictation.\n\nThe earliest machines produced distortion during the recording process which German engineers significantly reduced during the [[Nazi Germany]] era by applying a \"[[DC bias|bias]]\" signal to the tape. In 1939, one machine was found to make consistently better recordings than other ostensibly identical models, and when it was taken apart a minor flaw was noticed. Instead of DC, it was introducing an AC bias signal to the tape {{dubious|date=October 2015}}, and this was quickly adapted to new models using a high-frequency [[AC bias]] that has remained a part of audio tape recording to this day. The quality was so greatly improved that recordings surpassed the quality of most radio transmitters, and such recordings were used by [[Adolf Hitler]] to make broadcasts that appeared to be live while he was safely away in another city.\n\nAmerican audio engineer [[Jack Mullin]] was a member of the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] during [[World War II]]. His unit was assigned to investigate German radio and electronics activities, and in the course of his duties, a British Army counterpart mentioned the Magnetophons being used by the allied radio station in [[Bad Nauheim]] near [[Frankfurt]]. He acquired two Magnetophon recorders and 50 reels of [[I.G. Farben]] recording tape and shipped them home. Over the next two years, he worked to develop the machines for commercial use, hoping to interest the Hollywood film studios in using magnetic tape for movie soundtrack recording.\n[[File:Unitra ZK-147.jpg|thumb|right|[[Unitra]] ZK-147, a vintage [[Poland|Polish]]-made reel-to-reel tape recorder]]\n\nMullin gave a demonstration of his recorders at [[MGM Studios]] in [[Hollywood]] in 1947, which led to a meeting with [[Bing Crosby]], who immediately saw the potential of Mullin's recorders to pre-record his radio shows. Crosby invested $50,000 in a local electronics company, [[Ampex]], to enable Mullin to develop a commercial production model of the tape recorder. Using Mullin's tape recorders, and with Mullin as his chief engineer, Crosby became the first American performer to master commercial recordings on tape and the first to regularly pre-record his radio programs on the medium.\n\nAmpex and Mullin subsequently developed commercial stereo and [[Multitrack recording|multitrack audio recorders]], based on the system originally invented by Ross Snyder of Ampex Corporation for their high-speed scientific instrument data recorders. Les Paul had been given one of the first Ampex Model 200 tape decks by Crosby in 1948, and ten years later ordered one of the first Ampex eight track \"Sel Sync\" machines for multitracking, (although when it arrived, it was still set up as an instrument recorder running at 60 inches-per-second and had yet to be converted for audio use). Ampex engineers, who included [[Ray Dolby]] on their staff at the time, went on to develop the first practical [[videotape recorder]]s in the early 1950s to pre-record Crosby's TV shows.\n[[File:magtape1.jpg|thumb|left|7-inch reel of {{convert|1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} recording tape, typical of non-professional use in the 1950s\u201370s. Studios generally used 10{{frac|1|2}} inch reels on [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] backings.]]\n\nInexpensive reel-to-reel tape recorders were widely used for voice recording in the home and in schools, along with dedicated models expressly made for business dictation, before the [[Philips]] [[compact cassette]], introduced in 1963, gradually took over. Cassettes eventually displaced reel-to-reel recorders for consumer use. However, the narrow tracks and slow recording speeds used in cassettes compromised [[high fidelity|fidelity]].  Ampex produced pre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes for consumers of popular and classical music from the mid-1950s to the mid-'70s, as did Columbia House from 1960 to 1984.\n\nFollowing the example set by Bing Crosby, large reel-to-reel tape recorders rapidly became the main recording format used by [[audiophile]]s and professional recording studios until the late 1980s when [[digital audio]] recording techniques began to allow the use of other types of media (such as [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) cassettes and [[hard disk]]s).\n\nEven today, some artists of all genres prefer analog tape, claiming it is more \"musical\" or \"natural\" sounding than digital processes, despite its fidelity inaccuracies. Due to [[harmonic distortion]], bass can thicken up, creating a fuller-sounding mix. In addition, high end frequencies can be slightly [[Audio level compression|compressed]], which some claim is more natural to the human ear, though this claim is difficult to quantify due to the very personal aesthetics as to what is 'natural' sound. In this century, it is not uncommon for some artists to record directly onto digital equipment and then re-record the tracks to analog reel tape (or vice-versa) for this effect, which can sound pleasing or \"warmer\" due to the increase of even harmonics that can often enhance musicality, much in the way vacuum tube amplifiers are preferred over solid-state devices for the same reasons. In addition to all of these attributes, tape \"saturation\" is a unique form of distortion that many [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]] and [[funk]] artists find very satisfying, though with modern technology, these forms of distortion can be simulated digitally.\n\nThe great practical advantage of tape for studios was twofold&nbsp;\u2013 it allowed a performance to be recorded without the 30-minute time limitation of a phonograph disc, and it permitted a recorded performance to be edited or erased and re-recorded again and again on the same piece of media without any waste. For the first time, audio could be manipulated as a physical entity, and the recording process was greatly economized by eliminating the requirement for a highly-trained disc-cutting engineer to be present at every recording session. Once a tape machine was installed and calibrated, there was no need for any attendant engineering, other than to spool or replace the tape being used on it. Daily maintenance only consisted of cleaning and occasionally demagnetizing the heads and guides. Tape editing is performed simply by cutting the tape at the required point, and rejoining it to another section of tape using [[adhesive tape]], or sometimes [[adhesive|glue]]. This is called a '''''splice'''''. The splicing tape has to be very thin to avoid impeding the tape's motion, and the adhesive is carefully formulated to avoid leaving a sticky residue on the tape or deck. \"Butt\" splices (cut at exactly 90 degrees to the tape travel) were used for fast edits from one sound to another, though preferably, the splice is made at a much lower angle across the tape so that any \"click\" or other noise introduced by the cut is spread across a few milliseconds of the recording. The low-angle splice would also help to glide the tape more smoothly through the machine and push any loose dirt or debris to the side of the tape path, instead of accumulating in the splice joint. The use of reels to supply and collect the tape made it very easy for editors to manually move the tape back and forth across the heads to find the exact point they wished to edit. Tape to be spliced was clamped in a special ''splicing block'' attached to the deck near the heads to hold the tape accurately while the edit was made. A skilled editor could make these edits very rapidly and accurately. A side-effect of cutting the tape at an angle is that on [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] tapes the edit occurs on one channel a split-second before the other. Long, angled splices can also be used to create a perceptible dissolve from one sound to the next; periodic segments can induce rhythmic or pulsing effects.<ref>Thom Holmes, Electronic and experimental music, 2nd ed., p. 79</ref>\n\n[[File:Reel-to-ReelTapeBigHub.agr.jpg|thumb|Professional-style tape reel designed to fit large NARTB hub.]]\n\nThe performance of tape recording is greatly affected by the width of the tracks used to record a signal, and the speed of the tape. The wider and faster the better, but of course this uses more tape. These factors lead directly to improved [[frequency response]], [[signal-to-noise ratio]], and high-frequency [[distortion]] figures. Tape can accommodate multiple parallel tracks, allowing not just stereo recordings, but multi-track recordings too. This gives the producer of the final edit much greater flexibility, allowing a performance to be remixed long after the performance was originally recorded. This innovation was a great driving force behind the explosion of [[popular music]] in the late 1950s and 1960s. The first multi-tracking recorders had two, three, or four tracks, then eight, sixteen, and twenty-four, and so on. It was discovered early on that new special effects were possible, such as [[phaser (effect)|phasing]] and [[flanging]], delays and echo by re-directing the signal through one or more additional tape machines, while recording the composite result to another. These innovations appeared on pop recordings shortly after multi-tracking recorders were introduced, although, Les Paul had been using tape echo and speed-manipulation effects on his single-track recordings from the 1940s and '50s.\n\n[[File:Sonora-r2r.jpg|thumb|left|A typical home reel-to-reel tape recorder, this one made by Sonora. It could play stereo quarter-track tapes, but record only in one quarter-track mono. Home equipment with missing features were fairly common in the 1950s and 1960s.]]\n\nFor home use, simpler reel-to-reel recorders were available, and a number of track formats and tape speeds were standardised to permit interoperability and prerecorded music.\n\nReel-to-reel [[tape editing]] also gained cult-status when many used this technique on hit-singles in the 1980s.\n\nThere has recently been a revival of reel-to-reel, with quite a few companies restoring vintage units and some manufacturing new tape. In 2018, the first new reel-to-reel tape player in over 20 years was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-08/the-ultimate-analog-music-is-back-ballfinger-reel-to-reel-tape|title=Bloomberg - The Ultimate Analog Music Is Back|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bloomberg.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>.\n\n==Pre-recorded reel tapes==\n[[File:UniversumUNAM47.JPG|thumb|Astrovox Polaris III reel-to-reel 1960 at [[Universum (UNAM)|Universum]] in Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City]]\nThe first prerecorded reel-to-reel tapes were introduced in the United States in 1949; the catalog contained fewer than ten titles with no popular artists. In 1952, EMI started selling pre-recorded tapes in Great Britain. The tapes were twin-sided and mono (2 tracks) and were duplicated in real time on modified EMI BTR2 recorders. [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] joined the reel-to-reel business in 1954. In 1955, EMI released 2-track \"stereosonic\" tapes, although the catalog took longer to be published. Since these EMI tapes were much more expensive than a vinyl LP record, sales were poor; still, EMI released over 300 \"stereosonic\" titles. Then they introduced their Twin Packs, which contained the equivalent of two LP albums but playing at 3.75ips.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe heyday of prerecorded reel tapes was the mid-1960s, but after the introduction of less complicated [[cassette tapes]] and [[8-track tape]]s, the number of albums released on prerecorded reel tape dropped dramatically despite their superior sound quality. By the latter 1960s, their retail prices were considerably higher than competing formats, and musical genres were limited to those most likely to appeal to well-heeled [[audiophile]]s willing to contend with the cumbersome threading of open-reel tape. The introduction of the [[Dolby noise-reduction system]] narrowed the performance gap between cassettes and open-reel, and by 1976 prerecorded open-reel offerings had almost completely disappeared, even from record stores and audio equipment shops. [[Columbia House]] advertisements in 1978 showed that only one-third of new titles were available on reel-to-reel; they continued to offer a select number of new releases in the format until 1984.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:HeavenlyJohnnyMathis.jpg|thumb|Heavenly by Johnny Mathis. Produced by Columbia Records (CQ 333). Circa 1959. Recorded for playback at 7.5 inches per second.]]\n\nSales were very low and specialized during the 1980s. Audiophile reel tapes were made under license by Barclay-Crocker between 1977 and 1986. Licensors included [[Philips Records|Philips]], [[Deutsche Grammophon]], [[Argo Records|Argo]], [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]], [[Musical Heritage Society]] and [[L'Oiseau Lyre]]. Barclay-Crocker tapes were all Dolby encoded and some titles were also available in the [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] format. The majority of the catalog contained classical recordings, with a few jazz and movie soundtrack albums. Barclay-Crocker tapes were duplicated on modified Ampex 440 machines at four times the playing speed, unlike popular reel tapes which were duplicated at 16 times the playback speed. All of the known pre-recorded reel-to-reels on the market are all documented at the Reel To Reel Index website which focuses on the last reels made during the 1980s and includes photographs of all of them. David Winter also released the complete list of 1950s EMI and Barclay-Crocker tapes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nPre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes are also available once again, albeit somewhat expensively as a very high-quality audiophile product, through \"The Tape Project\", as well as several other independent studios and record labels. Since 2007, The Tape Project has released their own albums, as well as previously-released albums under license from other labels, on open-reel tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tapeproject.com|title=The Tape Project|author=|date=|website=www.tapeproject.com}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2015}} The German label Analogue Audio Association (\"AAA\") has also re-released albums on open-reel tape to the high-end audiophile market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanalog.de/|title=Analogue Audio Association - Home|author=|date=|website=www.aaanalog.de}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Tape speeds==\nIn general, the faster the speed, the better the reproduction quality. Higher tape speeds spread the signal longitudinally over more tape area, reducing the effects of dropouts that can be audible from the medium, and noticeably improve high frequency response. Slower tape speeds conserve tape and are useful in applications where sound quality is not critical.\n\n* {{convert|15/16|in/s|cm/s|2}}: used for very long-duration recordings (e.g. recording a [[radio station]]'s entire output in case of complaints, aka \"logging\").\n* {{cvt|1+7/8|in/s|cm/s|2}}: usually the slowest domestic speed, best for long duration speech recordings. [[Compact Cassette|Compact Tape Cassettes]] typically operate at this speed.\n* {{cvt|3+3/4|in/s|cm/s|2}}: common domestic speed, used on most single-speed domestic machines, reasonable quality for speech and off-air radio recordings.\n* {{cvt|7+1/2|in/s|cm/s|2}}: highest domestic speed, also slowest professional; used by most radio stations for \"dubs\", copies of commercial announcements. Through the early to mid 1990s, many stations could not handle 15 IPS.\n* {{cvt|15|in/s|cm/s|1}}: professional music recording and radio programming.\n* {{cvt|30|in/s|cm/s|1}}: used where the best possible treble response and lowest noise-floor are demanded, though bass response might suffer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Endino |url=http://endino.com/graphs/index.html |title=Response Curves of Analog Recorders |publisher=Endino.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\nSpeed units of [[inches per second]] or in/s are also abbreviated IPS. {{frac|3|3|4}} in/s and {{frac|7|1|2}} in/s are the speeds that were used for (the vast majority of) consumer market releases of commercial recordings on reel-to-reel tape. {{frac|3|3|4}} in/s is also the speed used in 8-track cartridges. {{frac|1|7|8}} in/s is also the speed used in [[Compact cassette]]s.\n\nIn some early prototype linear [[video tape recording]] systems developed in the early 1950s from companies such as [[Bing Crosby Enterprises]], [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]], and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s [[Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus|VERA]], the tape speed was extremely high, over {{cvt|200|in/s|cm/s}}, to adequately capture the large amount of image information. The need for a high linear tape speed was made unnecessary with the introduction of the now-obsolete professional [[Quadruplex videotape|Quadruplex]] system in 1956 by Ampex, which segmented the fields of a television image by recording (and reproducing) several tracks at a high-speed across the width of the tape per field of video by way of a vertically spinning headwheel with 4 separate video heads mounted on its edge (a technique called ''transverse scanning''), allowing for the linear tape speed to be much slower. Eventually, transverse scanning was accompanied by the later (and less-expensive) technology of [[helical scan]]ning, which could record one whole field of video per helically-recorded track, recorded at a much lower angle across the width of the tape by the head spinning in the near-horizontal plane, instead of vertically.\n\n===Quality aspects===\nEven though a recording on tape may have been made at studio quality, tape speed was the limiting factor, much like [[bit rate]] is today. Decreasing the speed of analog audio tape causes a uniform decrease in the linearity of the frequency response, increased background noise (hiss), more noticeable [[Dropout (electronics)|dropouts]] where there are flaws in the magnetic tape, and shifting of the (Gaussian) background noise spectrum toward lower frequencies (where it sounds more \"granular\",) ''regardless'' of the audio content. An MP3 of a noisy rock band at a low bit rate will have many more artifacts than a simple flute solo at the same bit rate, whereas either on low-speed tape will have the same uniform background noise profile and high frequency saturation (weakened high end response). A recording on magnetic audio tape is [[linear]]; unlike today's digital audio, not only was jumping from spot to spot to edit time consuming, editing was destructive\u2014unless the recording was duplicated before edit, normally taking the same amount of time to copy, in order to preserve 75-90 percent of the quality of the original. Editing was done either with a razor blade\u2014by physically cutting and splicing the tape on a metal splicing block, in a manner similar to motion picture film editing\u2014or electronically by dubbing segments onto an edit tape. The former method preserved the full quality of the recording but not the intact original; the latter incurred the same quality loss involved in dubbing a complete copy of the source tape, but preserved the original.\n\nTape speed is not the only factor affecting the quality of the recording. Other factors affecting quality include track width, oxide formulation, and backing material and thickness. The design and quality of the recorder are also important factors, in many ways that are not applicable to digital recording systems. The machine's speed stability ([[wow (recording)|wow-and-flutter]]), head gap size, head quality, and general head design and technology, and the machine's alignment (mostly a maintenance issue, but also a matter of design\u2014how well and precisely it can be aligned) electro-mechanically affect the quality of the recording. The regulation of tape tension affects contact between the tape and the heads and has a very significant impact on the recording and reproduction of high frequencies. The track width of the machine, which is a question of format rather than individual machine design, is one of two major machine factors controlling signal-to-noise ratio (assuming the electronics have high enough S/N ratio not to be a factor), the other being tape speed. S/N ratio varies directly with track width, due to the Gaussian nature of tape noise; doubling the track width doubles the S/N ratio (hence, with good electronics and comparable heads, 8-track cartridges should have half the signal-to-noise ratio of quarter-track {{1/4}}\" tape at the same speed, {{frac|3|3|4}} IPS.)\n\nTape formulation affects the retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, [[print-through]], optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types ([[ferric oxide]] [Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>], [[chromium dioxide]] [CrO<sub>2</sub>], etc.) and also in the precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the [[tensile strength]] and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended [[pre-echo|pre-]] and [[post-echo]]es on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred. In professional half-track use, post-echo is considered less problematic than pre-echo (as the echo is largely masked by the signal itself) and therefore tapes stored for long periods are kept \"tails-out\", where the tape must be first wound \"backwards\" onto the take-up spool before playback.\n\nAnother quality aspect, not related to audio quality, is the backing material.  Typically acetate was used for cheaper tape, and Mylar for more expensive tape.  Acetate would tend to break under conditions that Mylar would survive, though possibly stretch.  The quality of the oxide's binder was also important, for it was common with old tape for the backing to wind on the reel, while the oxide falls off.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} \n\nIn the 1980s, several manufacturers produced certain tape formulations blending polyurethane and polyester as backing material which tended to absorb humidity over many years in storage and partially deteriorate. This problem would only be discovered after an archived tape was opened and required to be played again, after possibly a decade or less on the shelf. The deterioration resulted in a softening of the backing material, making it gooey and sticky which quickly clogged-up tape guides and heads of the reproducer. This phenomenon is known as \"Sticky-Shed Syndrome\" and can be temporarily reversed by baking the tape at a low temperature for several hours to dry it out and restore firmness. The restored tape may then be played normally for several days or weeks, but will eventually return to a deteriorated state again.\n\n===Noise reduction===\nElectronic [[Audio noise reduction#In audio|noise reduction]] techniques were also developed to increase the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and [[dynamic range]] of analog sound recordings. [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby noise reduction]] includes a suite of standards (designated A, B, C, S and SR) for both professional and consumer recording. The Dolby systems use frequency dependent compression/expansion ([[companding]]) during the recording/playback, respectively. Initially, Dolby was offered via a stand-alone box that would go between a recorder and amplifier.  Later audio devices often included Dolby.  [[Dbx (noise reduction)|DBX]] is another noise reduction system that uses a more aggressive companding technique to improve both dynamic range and noise level. However, DBX recordings do not sound acceptable when played on non-DBX equipment.\n\nIn the late 1970s there was also the German Telefunken-made [[High&thinsp;Com]] NR system, a broadband compander, which was technically very advanced. That was a gain in dynamics of roughly 25&nbsp;dB that outperformed the well-known Dolby B by far. High&thinsp;Com was included in more sophisticated cassette recorders, mostly alongside the various Dolby systems. Even though this applied to the consumer market, there was no tape hiss at all that an ear could realize. Another advantage was that recorded tapes could be exchanged amongst High&thinsp;Com recorders without any loss of quality in sound. The \"pumping effect\" mostly reported from critical sound material (e.g. drums or any percussive instrument) with advanced dbx NR did not show in properly calibrated High&thinsp;Com recordings. It did not penetrate the market, possibly due to the less aggressive marketing strategies typical for German companies at that time compared to the widely known Dolby systems.\n\nDolby B eventually became the most popular system for Compact Cassette noise reduction. Today [[Dolby SR]] is in widespread use for professional analog tape recording.\n\n==Multi-track recorders==\n{{main|Multitrack recording}}\nAs studio audio production progressed and became more and more advanced, it became desirable to record the individual instruments and human voices separately and mix them down to one, two, or more speaker channels later, rather than in real time in the studio before recording. In addition to allowing recording engineers and producers to experiment with different mixing arrangements, effects, etc. on the same performance and to produce multiple versions of a recording (without having multiple duplicates of all the studio control room equipment used for mixing), multi-tracking enables the use of non-real-time effects or effects that cannot be produced in the same studio where the musicians perform. Another huge benefit of multi-track production is that recording of individual tracks or certain instruments could be done at different locations at any later date, if required. This allowed a producer to record basic tracks at a given studio, then take that tape to any other studio in the world that used the same format, and record additional tracks as needed for the same piece of music. \n\nReel-to-reel recorders with eight, sixteen, twenty four, and even thirty two tracks were eventually built, with as many heads recording synchronized parallel linear tracks. Some of these machines were larger than a laundry washing machine and used tape as wide as {{convert|2|in|mm}}. A single new reel of 1\" or wider tape, could easily cost $200 to $400. Still, in professional studios, most tapes were recorded only once, and all recording was on new tape, to ensure the maximum quality, as studio time and the time of skilled musicians was much higher than the cost of tape, making it not worth the risk of a recording being lost or degraded due to using media that had been previously recorded upon.\n\nIf more than 24 tracks of recording were required, it was possible in the mid-1970s and onwards with advanced servo-controlled machines to synchronize two (or more) 24-track recorders to behave as a single 48-track recorder. Such precise synchronization was achieved by recording a time code on one of the tracks on each reel of tape: a computer system would keep the two time codes perfectly synchronized, and transparently as seen by the machine operator.\n\n==Digital reel-to-reel==\nAs professional audio evolved from analog magnetic tape to digital media, engineers adapted magnetic tape technology to digital recording, producing digital reel-to-reel magnetic tape machines. Before large hard disks became economical enough to make hard disk recorders viable, studio digital recording meant recording on digital tape. [[Mitsubishi]]'s [[ProDigi]] and [[Sony]]'s [[Digital Audio Stationary Head]] (DASH) were the primary digital reel-to-reel formats in use in recording studios from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. [[Nagra]] introduced digital reel-to-reel tape recorders for use in film sound recording. Digital reel-to-reel tape eliminated all the traditional quality limitations of analog tape, including background noise (hiss), high frequency [[roll-off]], wow and flutter, pitch error, nonlinearity, print-through, and degeneration with copying, but the tape media was even more expensive than professional analog open reel tape, and the linear nature of tape still placed restrictions on access, and winding time to find a particular spot was still a significant drawback. Also, while the quality of digital tape did not progressively degrade with use of the tape, the physical sliding of the tape over the heads and guides meant that the tape still did wear, and eventually that wear would lead to digital errors and permanent loss of quality if the tape was not copied before reaching that point. Still, digital reel-to-reel tape represented a significant advance in audio recording technology, and most who could afford to record using digital tape generally did.3M's 32-track recorder was priced at $115,000. 1978.\n\nBest known for its lines of tape media and professional analog recorders, with its M series of multitrack and 2-track machines, the Mincom division of 3M spent several years developing a digital recording system, including two years of joint research with the BBC. The result was the 3M Digital Audio Mastering System, which consisted of a 32-track deck (16-bit, 50 kHz audio) running 1-inch tape and a 4-track, 1/2-inch mastering recorder. \n\nThe extremely short wavelengths recorded by a digital tape recorded meant that tape and tape transport cleanliness was an important issue. Specks of dust or dirt were large enough in relation to the signal wavelengths that contamination by such dirt could render a recording unplayable. Advanced digital error correction systems - without which the system would have been unworkable - still failed to cope with poorly maintained tape or recorders, and for this reason a number of tapes made in the early years of digital reel-to-reel recorders are now useless.\n\n==As a musical instrument==\nEarly reel-to-reel users realized that segments of tape could be spliced together and otherwise manipulated by adjusting playback speed or direction of a given recording. In the same way as modern keyboards allow [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and playback at different speeds, a reel-to-reel could accomplish similar feats in the hands of a talented user.\n* In the late 1940s, Les Paul began experimenting in his sound studio with the idea of creating a virtual dance band or jazz ensemble by multiplying only himself playing guitar and his vocalist wife, Mary Ford, using a technique of \"bouncing\" or overdubbing from one tape machine to another as many times as needed, layering new vocal or instrument parts on top of the previously recorded tracks simultaneously each time. While this had been accomplished in the past using phonograph discs, that process was cumbersome and resulted in poor audio quality after only one or two overdubs. Additionally, a cut disc had to be discarded if there was any mistake, unlike tape which could simply be re-wound and started again. Magnetic tape recording also allowed Paul to create instruments that sounded in higher or lower octaves by manipulating the speed of the tape while recording his guitar. Additionally, tape echo was almost always used by him to either enhance ambience or create a special effect. He and Mary Ford produced many popular recordings over the next two decades using these techniques, one of their most famous being \"How High the Moon\".\n* In 1958, [[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.|Ross Bagdasarian]], aka David Seville, recorded his voice at one-half normal speed, raising its pitch a full octave when played back at normal speed, to create the early [[rock and roll]] novelty song ''[[Witch Doctor (song)|Witch Doctor]]''.  He later used the same technique, plus overdubbing his voice three times, to create [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]].  Numerous other creators of novelty, comedy, and children's records, such as [[Sheb Wooley]], [[Sascha Burland]], and [[Ray Stevens]] have since used this process.\n* The [[mellotron]] is an electro-mechanical, polyphonic tape replay keyboard that used a bank of parallel linear magnetic audio tape strips.  Playback heads underneath each key enable the playing of pre-recorded sounds. Each of the tape strips has a playing time of approximately eight seconds, after which the tape comes to a dead stop and rewinds to the start position.\n* The title track of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s album ''[[Are You Experienced (album)|Are You Experienced]]'', on which the guitar solo and much of the drum track was recorded, then played backwards on a reel-to-reel.\n* [[The Beatles]] recorded many songs using reel to reel tape as a part of the creative process. Examples include \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite]]\" and \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\" which used a technique where stock recordings were cut up and then randomly reassembled and overdubbed on to the songs (recordings of [[Calliope (music)|calliope organs]] on \"Mr. Kite\", and recordings of [[marching band]]s on \"Yellow Submarine\").<ref>Emrick, Geoff. ''Here, There and Everywhere'', p.168</ref> On \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\" multiple tape machines were used all interconnected patching tape loops that had been prepared by the band. The loops were played in a variety of ways such as backwards, sped up and slowed down. To record the song, the machines, which were located in separate studio rooms, were all manned by individual technicians and played at once to record on the fly.<ref>Emrick, p.113.</ref> \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" combined two different taped versions of the song. The versions were independently altered in speed to end up together miraculously both on pitch and tempo.<ref>Emrick, p.139.</ref> \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" used a radio tuner patched into the sound console to layer random live broadcast over an existing taped track.<ref>Emrick, p.215.</ref> \"[[Revolution 9]]\" also had many effects produced using a reel-to-reel and tape editing techniques.\n* The [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], notably [[Delia Derbyshire]] who \"performed\" (a more accurate term would be \"realised\") the [[Doctor Who theme|original theme tune]] to the BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', by recording various sounds including [[oscillators]] and then manually cutting together each individual note on a group of reel-to-reels.\n* The British rock band 10 CC created a 'human harmonium' of sorts on a 16-track tape recorder by overdubbing their own voices many dozens of times, singing only a single note each time. The cumulative result was a total of 630 voices spread evenly over an octave-and-a-half of proper musical scale notes, with each of the distinct notes assigned to an individual track of the tape. When played back, any track (or note) could then be faded in and out manually on a mixing console arranged like a piano keyboard, to simulate an immense virtual choir. This effect provided the atmospheric backing instrumentation for their song \"I'm not in Love\".\n* Blues guitarist [[Claudio Gabis]], faced with the need to amplify his electric guitar, used a homemade monochrome Geloso recorder as a distorter for his debut album ''[[Manal (album)|Manal]]'' of 1970. This was achieved by injecting a signal and letting it \"record under vacuum\" (without tape, recording infinitely), an amplified signal could be obtained and, considerably increasing the volume, could be distorted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144857/http://rollingstone.es/reportajes/las-biografias-mas-salvajes-del-rock-1/ Las biograf\u00edas m\u00e1s salvajes del rock] Rolling Stone (Argentina), (in Spanish).

But continuing his Olympic curse, Bubka came into the competition with a heel injury and did not make an attempt.  To add further injury, his brother [[Vasiliy Bubka]] was one of seven athletes unable to clear a height in qualifying.\n\nIn the final, the tie between returning silver medalist [[Igor Trandenkov]] and [[Jean Galfione]] was broke by counting the number of their misses, with Galfione having had one miss earlier in the competition, and Trandenkov having had two misses, meaning that Galfione won gold, while Tradenkov earned second straight silver.
