In this study participants received the DMT dosage intravenously via injection and the findings suggested that different psychedelic experiences can occur, depending on the level of dosage. Lower doses (0.01 and 0.05&nbsp;mg/kg) produced somaesthetic and emotional responses, but not hallucinogenic experiences (e.g., 0.05&nbsp;mg/kg had mild mood elevating and calming properties).<ref name=\"pmid8297216\" /> In contrast, responses produced by higher doses (0.2 and 0.4&nbsp;mg/kg) researchers labeled as \"hallucinogenic\" that elicited \"intensely colored, rapidly moving display of visual images, formed, abstract or both\". Comparing to other sensory modalities the most affected was the visual. Participants reported visual hallucinations, fewer auditory hallucinations and specific physical sensations progressing to a sense of bodily dissociation, as well as to experiences of euphoria, calm, fear, and anxiety.<ref name=\"pmid8297216\" />\n\nStrassman also stressed the importance of the context where the drug has been taken. He claimed that DMT has no beneficial effects of itself, rather the context when and where people take it plays an important role.<ref name=\"strassman\" /><ref name=\"pmid8297216\" />\n\nIt appears that DMT can produce a hallucinogenic experience. It can induce a state or feeling to a person that he or she is able to \"communicate with other intelligent-life forms\" (see [[#Reported encounters with external entities|\"Machine Elves\"]]). High doses of DMT produce a hallucinatory state that involves a sense of \"another intelligence\" that people sometimes describe as \"super-intelligent\", but \"emotionally detached\".<ref name=\"pmid8297216\" />\n\nIn 1995 Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter did a study where they found that DMT-induced altered state of consciousness (ASC) is strongly influenced by habitual, rather than situative factors.

In this study participants received the DMT dosage intravenously via injection and the findings suggested that different psychedelic experiences can occur, depending on the level of dosage. Lower doses (0.01 and 0.05&nbsp;mg/kg) produced somaesthetic and emotional responses, but not hallucinogenic experiences (e.g., 0.05&nbsp;mg/kg had mild mood elevating and calming properties).<ref name=\"pmid8297216\" /> In contrast, responses produced by higher doses (0.2 and 0.4&nbsp;mg/kg) researchers labeled as \"hallucinogenic\" that elicited \"intensely colored, rapidly moving display of visual images, formed, abstract or both\".

It is a subsidiary of [[20th Century Fox Animation]], a division of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]].\n\nThe studio was founded in 1987 by [[Chris Wedge]], Michael Ferraro, Carl Ludwig, Alison Brown, David Brown, and Eugene Troubetzkoy after their employer [[Mathematical Applications Group|MAGI]], one of the visual effects studios behind ''[[Tron]]'', shut down. Using its in-house rendering software, the studio had worked on visual effects for commercials and films before completely dedicating itself to animated film production. The studio's first feature, ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', was released on March 15, 2002 by [[20th Century Fox]]. In March 2019, the studio was acquired by Disney, upon their [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition]] of [[21st Century Fox]] assets.\n\nBlue Sky has produced [[List of Blue Sky Studios films|13 feature films]], with its latest release being ''[[Spies in Disguise]]'' on December 25, 2019, and their next release being ''[[Nimona#Adaptations|Nimona]]'' on January 14, 2022. ''[[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]]'' and ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' are the studio's most successful franchises, while ''[[Horton Hears a Who!

Using his background in character animation, Wedge helped MAGI produce animation for television commercials, which eventually led to an offer from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] to produce animation for the film ''[[Tron]]'' (1982). After ''Tron'', MAGI hired Carl Ludwig, an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]],<ref name=\"ArtOfBlueSky\" />{{rp|13}} and Mike Ferraro transferred to the film division from the [[Computer-aided design|Cad]] [[Computer-aided manufacturing|Cam]] division of MAGI.

It is a subsidiary of [[20th Century Fox Animation]], a division of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]].\n\nThe studio was founded in 1987 by [[Chris Wedge]], Michael Ferraro, Carl Ludwig, Alison Brown, David Brown, and Eugene Troubetzkoy after their employer [[Mathematical Applications Group|MAGI]], one of the visual effects studios behind ''[[Tron]]'', shut down. Using its in-house rendering software, the studio had worked on visual effects for commercials and films before completely dedicating itself to animated film production. The studio's first feature, ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', was released on March 15, 2002 by [[20th Century Fox]]. In March 2019, the studio was acquired by Disney, upon their [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition]] of [[21st Century Fox]] assets.\n\nBlue Sky has produced [[List of Blue Sky Studios films|13 feature films]], with its latest release being ''[[Spies in Disguise]]'' on December 25, 2019, and their next release being ''[[Nimona#Adaptations|Nimona]]'' on January 14, 2022. ''[[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]]'' and ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' are the studio's most successful franchises, while ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' and ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]'' are its most critically praised films.{{cn|date=December 2019}} As of 2013, [[Scrat]], a character from the ''Ice Age'' films, serves as the studio's mascot.\n\n==History==\n===1980\u20131989: Formation and early computer animation===\nIn the late 1970s, [[Chris Wedge]], then an undergraduate at [[Purchase College]] studying film, was employed by [[Mathematical Applications Group|Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.]] (MAGI). MAGI was an early computer technology company which produced SynthaVision, a software application that could replicate the laws of physics to measure [[nuclear radiation]] rays for [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] contracts.<ref name=\"ArtOfBlueSky\">{{cite book|title=The Art of Blue Sky Studios|date=2014|publisher=Insight Editions|isbn=9781608873173|location=San Rafael, California|last1=Friedman|first1=Jake S.}}</ref>{{Rp|12\u201313}} At MAGI, Wedge met Eugene Troubetzkoy, who held a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in [[theoretical physics]] and was one of the first [[Computer animation|computer animators]]. Using his background in character animation, Wedge helped MAGI produce animation for television commercials, which eventually led to an offer from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] to produce animation for the film ''[[Tron]]'' (1982). After ''Tron'', MAGI hired Carl Ludwig, an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]],<ref name=\"ArtOfBlueSky\" />{{rp|13}} and Mike Ferraro transferred to the film division from the [[Computer-aided design|Cad]] [[Computer-aided manufacturing|Cam]] division of MAGI.

It was not until 1996 when Nina Rappaport, a producer at Blue Sky Studios, assigned Wedge to complete the ''Bunny'' project, which required CGI Studio to render fur, glass, and metal from multiple light sources, such as a swinging light bulb and an \"ethereal cloudscape\". In the initial stages of the ''Bunny'' project, Carl Ludwig modified CGI Studio to simulate [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|radiosity]], which tracks light rays as they reflect off of multiple surfaces.

In this context, Pfister led a research group that gathered documentary data from all over Europe to reconstruct monthly weather charts for the period 1675\u20131715. In this context, he adapted the Climhist software package, developed for the documentation of the \"Climate History of Switzerland\" (1984), to create the European database Euro-Climhist. Since the 1990s, Pfister has gradually expanded and methodically refined the database. Today (2019), Euro-Climhist is the largest climate history database with over 200,000 records.<ref>Franz Mauelshagen: ''Klimageschichte der Neuzeit''. wbg, Darmstadt 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-534-21024-4}}, p. 1, 27 f., 55\u201358.</ref>\n\n=== Agricultural history ===\nAgricultural-historical topics occupy a large space in Pfister's writings, since they are closely linked to climate history and population history. He distinguishes four agricultural utilisation zones in [[Old Swiss Confederacy]]: the cereal-growing area in the Swiss Plateau, the pastoral area in mountainous areas, a zone of mixed field-grass cultivation in hilly areas, and areas of intensive viticulture. The main focus of his analysis and models is on cereal production. In this context Pfister has worked out the importance of the [[nitrogen cycle]] for productivity development.<ref>Christian Pfister: ''The early loss of ecological stability in an agrarian region. Nitrogen, energy and the take-off of \u00absolar\u00bb agriculture in the Canton of Bern'', in: Peter Brimblecombe and Christian Pfister (eds): ''The silent countdown. Essays in European Environmental History''. Springer, Berlin 1990, p. 37\u201355.</ref> 3\n\n=== Population history ===\nSince [[Erich Keyser]]\u2019s Population History of Germany (Leipzig, 1938) no synthesis had been written for German speaking areas in the Early Modern Period. At the beginning of the 1990s, Christian Pfister took on the task of collecting and compiling a hardly comprehensible number of small-scale, at best regional and heterogeneous studies worked out over half a century, and to press them into the framework of a small volume of the Encyclopaedia of German History.\n\n=== Regional history ===\nBoth Christian Pfister\u2019s dissertation (1974) and his habilitation thesis (1984) were committed to the ''histoire totale'' of the [[Annales school|Annales School]] in addition to climate history. His focus on the [[Canton of Bern]] opened up a field of regional history that continued to occupy him in the years that followed. Through the fine division of its landscape, the Canton of Bern offers a patchwork of zones which followed different paths in their development. Pfister\u2019s monograph \"Im Strom der Modernisierung\" (Bern, 1995) meets the methodological postulate of a ''histoire totale'' with extraordinary precision and spatial-temporal differentiation; and can be regarded as a material history in the best sense of the word, in which energy sources and food, agricultural production methods and their modernization appear just as much as the people who give birth, eat, work, argue, invent, try, age and die, and are not only processed into statistical series of numbers.<ref>Daniel Kr\u00e4mer and Stephanie Summermatter, Introduction to: ''Sustainable History.'' ''Festschrift for Christian Pfister''. Chronos, Z\u00fcrich 2009, p. 17.</ref>\n\nConcurrent to Climhist, Christian Pfister set up the BERNHIST regional history database from 1984. In 2009, the database contained around 1.5 million individual data from the fields of population, economy, environment and politics for the period from 1700 to the present. In 2019, a modernized version of BERNHIST was launched.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bernhist.ch|title=BERNHIST|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental history ===\nBased on its energy base (biomass, coal, oil, and gas), Pfister divides economic and environmental history into three fundamental social periods \u2013 agricultural society, industrial society and consumer society. His thesis is that the current urgency of the climate problem and the glut of plastic waste is due to the flooding of markets with cheap oil from the late 1950s onwards. The corresponding anthology (Pfister 1995b) experienced a second edition in 1996. An enlarged synthesis in English was published in 2010.<ref>Christian Pfister: ''The \u201c1950s Syndrome\u201d and the transition from a slow-going to a rapid loss of global sustainability'', in: Frank Uek\u00f6tter (ed.), ''Turning Points in Environmental History'', University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, p. 90\u2013117.</ref>\n\n=== History of nature induced disasters ===\nFrom 1882 to 1976, Switzerland was largely spared natural disasters. Pfister demonstrates that this \"disaster gap\" contributed to natural risks being underestimated until the late 1980s. It was not until this time that natural disasters were discovered as an attractive topic in historical research. In his \"Weather Hindcast\" (1999), Pfister links the climate variations of the last five hundred years in Switzerland with the description of severe natural disasters. He postulates that natural disasters can be regarded as pacemakers of modernization and, at least in Switzerland, were fundamental for the development of a nationwide solidarity between the poor mountain regions and the wealthy regions in the [[Swiss Plateau]]. With these theses he succeeded in giving a new depth to the primarily cultural-historical discussion about the interpretation and perception of disasters. He has written several articles on natural disasters and, together with [[Christof Mauch]], published an anthology on this topic in 2009.<ref>Christof Mauch and Christian Pfister: ''Natural disasters, cultural responses: case studies toward a global environmental history''.
