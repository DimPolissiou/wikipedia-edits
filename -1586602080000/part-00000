It was directed by [[Fred Walton (director)|Fred Walton]] with a [[screenplay]] by brothers [[Ken Wheat]] and Jim Wheat and starring [[Donna Mills]], [[Michael Ontkean]], [[Cindy Williams]], [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]] and [[Louise Fletcher]]. It is the third in a series of sequels inspired by the 1972 novel and the original 1975 film ''[[The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|The Stepford Wives]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the prologue, a docile man suddenly kills his wife in a violent method and then commits [[suicide]].\n\nSeveral months later, [[graphic artist]] Jodi and struggling [[author]] Mick Davison (Mills and Ontkean) move to Stepford, Connecticut, in the same house, hoping that life in the seemingly idyllic town will help rejuvenate their troubled marriage. Jodi reunites with old college friend Caroline (Williams) and meets the brilliant Dr. Borzage (Douglas) as well as the intimidating Miriam Benton (Fletcher), who heads a powerful women's group. Mick notices the docile men in the community, including Caroline's husband (who shows surprising moments of aggression), but befriends sloppy neighbor Gordon; both agree they are unnerved by the community. However, both Jodi and Mick are concerned when Gordon undergoes a radical behavior change after a stay at the Stepford Institute for Human Behavior, afterwards thinking only of his wife Lisa, but ignoring his son and other interests.\n\nCaroline subtly manipulates the Davisons and drugs Mick at a party.  When Mick reacts to the drug, Jodi is convinced that her husband has serious problems and commits him to the Stepford Institute for a cure. Mick is given mind-altering [[Behavior therapy|behavioral therapy]] and [[psychotropic drug]]s, altering him to behave docilely, but passionless. Jodi is concerned about the drugs Mick takes as part of the therapy; when she learns that the previous couple in her house (of the murder-suicide) was linked to heavy drugs, she replaces Mick's drugs with [[placebo]]s. The serious side effects of the treatment becomes clear, the men can become [[violent]], and Mick crashes and threatens to kill Jodi. They reconcile when he is convinced that she did not know of the Institute's motives or methods (in essence, Caroline had made the decision for Jodi). They plan to leave immediately.\n\nCaroline has learned of the Davisons' plan to leave town. With the other residents, Caroline captures them in their own house. Mick is returned to the Institute for reconditioning while Jodi is forced to escape to rescue Mick.  Benton allows Jodi to find Mick in the Institute but, with Dr. Borzage, plans to kill her. Borzage, however, is alarmed by the out-of-control [[ethics]] and kills Benton with a [[hypodermic needle]] meant for Jodi. Borzage then allows the Davisons to escape.\n\nIn the epilogue, the fate of the town is not revealed, but Jodi and Mick have returned to New York City. Mick has written a book about the experience and a movie will soon be made.\n\n==Production==\nThe film first aired on [[CBS]] on May 14, 1996. It was filmed in [[North Carolina]].\n\nIt is the third sequel in a string of stories based on the original concept of the novel. The first sequel, ''[[Revenge of the Stepford Wives]]'' (1980), starred [[Don Johnson]], [[Sharon Gless]], and [[Julie Kavner]] and suggested a similar drug-induced compliance. The second sequel, ''[[The Stepford Children]]'', (1987) starred [[Barbara Eden]] and hewed closer to the original. The third sequel basically reverses the roles, with the women being the oppressors. Louise Fletcher's role, in particular, recalls the role of Dale \"Diz\" Coba, the Men's Association president, in the original.\n\nThe executive producer for the film is [[Edgar J. Scherick]], who produced the first film.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said \"it's hard to care since this is about as shabbily done as you can get with a good-and-scary, tried-and-true idea.

It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

Dancer 3D''''' is a 2020 Indian [[Hindi]]-language [[Musical film|musical]] [[dance film|dance]] [[drama]] film directed by [[Remo D'Souza]]. It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

It has been amededed in [[74th Oregon Legislative Assembly|2007]] and [[76th Oregon Legislative Assembly|2011]]. It requires applicable beverages in applicable sizes in glass, plastic or metal cans or bottles sold in [[Oregon]] to be returnable with a minimum refund value. The refund value was initially 5 cents until April 1, 2017 when it increased to 10 cents. The Oregon legislature has given the [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]] the authority to administer and enforce the Bottle Bill. A private [[cooperative]] of deposit initiating distributors called the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative administers the collection and transportation of containers with deposit. Deposit that has been paid, but not redeemed by consumers are kept by the OBRC to fund their operations. The OBRC sells the commodity from collected containers and disburses the proceeds to cooperative members. This is not part of the BottleDrop operating budget. \n\nWhen passed in 1971, the bottle bill was viewed primarily as a litter control measure. In 1971 bottles made up about 40% of litter,  10.8% in 1973 and 6% in 1979. Oregon DEQ reports that the reduction is \"as a result of the law\" referring to the Bottle Bill.<ref>{{cite journal  | author = Department of Environmental Quality  | title = Fact Sheet: The Expanded Bottle Bill  | year = 2007  | url = http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/pubs/factsheets/sw/ExpandedBottleBill.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2011-04-20  | publisher = [[Oregon Department of Environmental Quality]]  | url-status = | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080910085315/http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/pubs/factsheets/sw/ExpandedBottleBill.pdf  | archivedate = 2008-09-10  }}</ref> In a 2006 publication it was reported that states without similar bills recycle on average 33% of their containers.<ref name = Gitlitz>Gitlitz, Jenny & Franklin, Pat.

Inspired by the early Vermont bottle return system before it was repealed, Oregon's limited system paid 1 cent for beer bottles and cans and 3 cents for soda bottles and cans, and was started in the mid-1950s, and lasted through the rest of the 50s, throughout the 1960s and into the early 70s until the more formal and expanded Bottle Bill was enacted.  The emphasis was on bottles, as bottlers were washed and re-used for fresh product sold to the public before health laws were enacted that stopped the re-wash system.  And because of the low payout for the return of bottles and cans, and in spite of various anti-litter PSA advertising campaigns on Oregon television, only a relatively small percentage of Oregonians participated in the return of bottles and cans, and thus many bottles and cans still littered Oregon's highways and scenic areas throughout this entire early bottle-can recycling period.\n\nRichard Chambers, a logging equipment salesman,<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/An+idea+worth+bottling.-a088205182\n | title = An idea worth bottling\n | date = June 30, 2002\n | work=The Register-Guard\n}}</ref> collected litter during his hiking, climbing, and kayaking throughout the state.  In 1968, he called [[Oregon House of Representatives|Oregon State Representative]] [[Paul Hanneman]], whom Chambers knew well, after he was inspired by a small newspaper article about British Columbia wanting to ban non-refundable bottles and cans. Chambers wanted a deposit on bottles and cans to encourage people to return them to the store.<ref name = \"Walth\">{{cite book\n | first =  | last = Walth | title = Fire at Eden's Gate: Tom McCall and the Oregon story | publisher = Oregon Historical Society Press | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-87595-247-X | pages=253\u2013263 }}</ref>\n\nChambers began a letter-writing campaign, using non-ordinary stationery and stamps to draw the attention of his intended audience.  Oregon House Bill 1157 was introduced and assigned to the House State and Federal Affairs Committee.  Chambers brought in people to testify for the bill, including a river guide to testify about the amount of beverage package litter in the water, and a farmer who lost four cows because of ingestion of glass and metal shards from beverage containers. Beverage container materials companies and bottling companies fought the bill. Hanneman offered the compromise of not banning non-returnables but instead requiring a five-cent deposit as an incentive for return. By a 5 to 4 vote, the bill was sent to the House floor, where it fell 3 votes short of passage, with 27 of 60 members voting for it. Governor [[Tom McCall]] had already offered his support for the bill, so Hanneman asked McCall to help sway the House's vote in favor of passage.  McCall refused, advising that he did not want a Bottle Bill in that legislative session.  McCall planned to endorse the anti-littering campaign espoused by the [[Keep America Beautiful]] non-profit in 1970 and wait until 1971 to support the Bottle Bill. It has been written that this delay was intentional on McCall's part to make the bill his. After its defeat, Chambers continued his letter writing campaign.<ref name=Walth />\n\nAfter McCall refused to back the Bottle Bill in 1969, he sponsored the formation of non-profit [[SOLV]]\u2014Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism.  In 1971, it was reported that 75% of SOLV's budget was derived from organizations opposing the bottle bill.  SOLV also received state funds.\n\nIn 1970, McCall initiated his own campaign for the Bottle Bill.

John Piacentini, the owner of [[Plaid Pantry]] convenience stores, challenged people to return soda and beer bottles to his stores for a half cent. Piacentini said he hoped to be buried in litter; within two weeks, 150,000 cans were returned and McCall ordered National Guard troops to take the bottles and cans away. This helped allay grocery stores' fears.\n\nThe new bill, House Bill 1036, banned non-returnables and placed a five-cent<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.govoregon.org/bottlebilltext.html\n | title = Original Bottle Bill Text\n | publisher = State of Oregon\n | accessdate = 2009-03-03\n}}</ref> deposit on bottles and cans containing beer, malt beverage, mineral and soda waters and carbonated soft drinks.

It has been amededed in [[74th Oregon Legislative Assembly|2007]] and [[76th Oregon Legislative Assembly|2011]]. It requires applicable beverages in applicable sizes in glass, plastic or metal cans or bottles sold in [[Oregon]] to be returnable with a minimum refund value. The refund value was initially 5 cents until April 1, 2017 when it increased to 10 cents. The Oregon legislature has given the [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]] the authority to administer and enforce the Bottle Bill. A private [[cooperative]] of deposit initiating distributors called the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative administers the collection and transportation of containers with deposit. Deposit that has been paid, but not redeemed by consumers are kept by the OBRC to fund their operations. The OBRC sells the commodity from collected containers and disburses the proceeds to cooperative members.

Inspired by the early Vermont bottle return system before it was repealed, Oregon's limited system paid 1 cent for beer bottles and cans and 3 cents for soda bottles and cans, and was started in the mid-1950s, and lasted through the rest of the 50s, throughout the 1960s and into the early 70s until the more formal and expanded Bottle Bill was enacted.  The emphasis was on bottles, as bottlers were washed and re-used for fresh product sold to the public before health laws were enacted that stopped the re-wash system.  And because of the low payout for the return of bottles and cans, and in spite of various anti-litter PSA advertising campaigns on Oregon television, only a relatively small percentage of Oregonians participated in the return of bottles and cans, and thus many bottles and cans still littered Oregon's highways and scenic areas throughout this entire early bottle-can recycling period.\n\nRichard Chambers, a logging equipment salesman,<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/An+idea+worth+bottling.-a088205182\n | title = An idea worth bottling\n | date = June 30, 2002\n | work=The Register-Guard\n}}</ref> collected litter during his hiking, climbing, and kayaking throughout the state.  In 1968, he called [[Oregon House of Representatives|Oregon State Representative]] [[Paul Hanneman]], whom Chambers knew well, after he was inspired by a small newspaper article about British Columbia wanting to ban non-refundable bottles and cans. Chambers wanted a deposit on bottles and cans to encourage people to return them to the store.<ref name = \"Walth\">{{cite book\n | first =  | last = Walth | title = Fire at Eden's Gate: Tom McCall and the Oregon story | publisher = Oregon Historical Society Press | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-87595-247-X | pages=253\u2013263 }}</ref>\n\nChambers began a letter-writing campaign, using non-ordinary stationery and stamps to draw the attention of his intended audience.  Oregon House Bill 1157 was introduced and assigned to the House State and Federal Affairs Committee.  Chambers brought in people to testify for the bill, including a river guide to testify about the amount of beverage package litter in the water, and a farmer who lost four cows because of ingestion of glass and metal shards from beverage containers. Beverage container materials companies and bottling companies fought the bill. Hanneman offered the compromise of not banning non-returnables but instead requiring a five-cent deposit as an incentive for return. By a 5 to 4 vote, the bill was sent to the House floor, where it fell 3 votes short of passage, with 27 of 60 members voting for it. Governor [[Tom McCall]] had already offered his support for the bill, so Hanneman asked McCall to help sway the House's vote in favor of passage.  McCall refused, advising that he did not want a Bottle Bill in that legislative session.  McCall planned to endorse the anti-littering campaign espoused by the [[Keep America Beautiful]] non-profit in 1970 and wait until 1971 to support the Bottle Bill. It has been written that this delay was intentional on McCall's part to make the bill his. After its defeat, Chambers continued his letter writing campaign.<ref name=Walth />\n\nAfter McCall refused to back the Bottle Bill in 1969, he sponsored the formation of non-profit [[SOLV]]\u2014Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism.  In 1971, it was reported that 75% of SOLV's budget was derived from organizations opposing the bottle bill.  SOLV also received state funds.\n\nIn 1970, McCall initiated his own campaign for the Bottle Bill.
