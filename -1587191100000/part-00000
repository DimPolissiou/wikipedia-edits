Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''.

The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''. March 28, 1998. p 3B.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015130/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Rookie Of The Year | date=22 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23-9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

He is approached by Yagharek, a member of a birdlike species known as [[garuda]], who has had his wings removed as a punishment for an undisclosed crime in his native land. He asks Isaac to help him to fly again. Isaac agrees and starts collecting flying creatures for research purposes with the aid of Lemuel Pigeon, a fence with links to the criminal underworld. One creature is a large and unusual caterpillar, stolen from a government research lab. The caterpillar sickens until Isaac accidentally discovers it feeds on a popular hallucinogenic drug. It grows and starts to pupate. After reaching maturity, it emerges as a monstrous flying beast known as a slakemoth, able to paralyse its victims using hypnotic patterns on its wings. It escapes after eating the mind of one of Isaac's colleagues, leaving him catatonic. Isaac, Yagharek and Lemuel resolve to re-capture or destroy it.\n\nIsaac's girlfriend Lin is a [[khepri]], an insect-like humanoid and an artist. She is commissioned by Mr Motley, a mob boss, to make a sculpture of him. Mr. Motley has four more of the slakemoths in captivity and harvests their milk to sell as drugs. After Isaac's slakemoth frees its siblings, Mr Motley discovers Isaac's connection to the slakemoths. Assuming Isaac to be a potential rival in the drug trade, he imprisons Lin, demanding that Isaac return his creatures. The slakemoths start to terrorise New Crobuzon, feeding on its inhabitants.\n\nWith the aid of Derkhan, a journalist and friend of Lin, Isaac discovers that Mr. Motley purchased his slakemoths from the government. The security forces become aware of the activities of the slakemoths and begin to suppress the various rebellious elements within the city. To re-capture the slakemoths, they attempt to enlist the help of demons and the Weaver, a spider-like creature who moves through dimensions, obsessed with patterns and its own peculiar view of beauty. The demons refuse to assist and the Weaver soon ends up aiding Isaac.\n\nIsaac and his friends kill one of the slakemoths with the aid of a sentient machine known as the Construct Council. They then destroy the eggs that the slakemoths have laid before laying a trap for the remainder of the creatures. The trap is mostly successful, but the last slakemoth escapes and returns 'home' to Mr. Motley's facility. The Weaver transports Isaac to the warehouse where they find Lin, who has been tortured but is still working on the sculpture. A confrontation occurs, during which Lin's mind is half eaten and the last slakemoth is killed by Mr. Motley's men. Isaac escapes with Lin and Yagharek and prepares to leave the city. Isaac learns of Yagharek's crime, a rape of one of his own species, and refuses to help him fly again. Lin never fully recovers and Yagharek is left alone in the city, pulling out his feathers and having to accept his new flightless identity.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin''', a human scientist, dabbling in all fields but obsessed with his pet theory of \"crisis energy\". Lover to Lin, and close friends with Derkhan Blueday.\n*'''Yagharek''', an exiled and de-winged garuda from the Cymek Desert, far south of New Crobuzon.

After Isaac's slakemoth frees its siblings, Mr Motley discovers Isaac's connection to the slakemoths. Assuming Isaac to be a potential rival in the drug trade, he imprisons Lin, demanding that Isaac return his creatures. The slakemoths start to terrorise New Crobuzon, feeding on its inhabitants.\n\nWith the aid of Derkhan, a journalist and friend of Lin, Isaac discovers that Mr. Motley purchased his slakemoths from the government. The security forces become aware of the activities of the slakemoths and begin to suppress the various rebellious elements within the city. To re-capture the slakemoths, they attempt to enlist the help of demons and the Weaver, a spider-like creature who moves through dimensions, obsessed with patterns and its own peculiar view of beauty. The demons refuse to assist and the Weaver soon ends up aiding Isaac.\n\nIsaac and his friends kill one of the slakemoths with the aid of a sentient machine known as the Construct Council. They then destroy the eggs that the slakemoths have laid before laying a trap for the remainder of the creatures. The trap is mostly successful, but the last slakemoth escapes and returns 'home' to Mr. Motley's facility. The Weaver transports Isaac to the warehouse where they find Lin, who has been tortured but is still working on the sculpture. A confrontation occurs, during which Lin's mind is half eaten and the last slakemoth is killed by Mr. Motley's men. Isaac escapes with Lin and Yagharek and prepares to leave the city. Isaac learns of Yagharek's crime, a rape of one of his own species, and refuses to help him fly again. Lin never fully recovers and Yagharek is left alone in the city, pulling out his feathers and having to accept his new flightless identity.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin''', a human scientist, dabbling in all fields but obsessed with his pet theory of \"crisis energy\".

With the exception of two or three months in summer, this flat island is swept day and night by heavy winds that are sustained in winter. In summer, it can suffer the onslaught of cyclones and tropical storms.\n\nThere is only grass and brush (low shrubs) present on the island. Veloutaries (Heliotropium foertherianum) and purslane (Portulaca oleracea), with growth shaped by a dominant east winds are present everywhere on the island.\n\nThe fauna consists mainly of hermit crabs (Paguroidea), seabirds and sea turtles for which the island is an important nesting place. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the freshwater turtle, is mainly encountered and, to a lesser extent, the tortoiseshell turtle, better known as the caret.\n\nThe waters are rich with fish. The French Coral Reef Initiative (IFRECOR) has identified 26 species of corals. Allochthonous species were introduced on the island during the various shipwrecks: rats, mice and rabbits. The latter were decimated in 1986 by cyclone Erinesta.\n\n===Important Bird Area===\nThe island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because of its significance as a [[bird colony|seabird breeding site]].  Both [[masked booby|masked]] (with up to 250 pairs) and [[red-footed booby|red-footed boobies]] (up to 180 pairs) nesting there.  [[Sulidae]] populations have seriously declined in the western Indian Ocean with those on Tromelin among the healthiest remaining.\n\nThe island's masked boobies are of the western Indian Ocean subspecies (''Sula dactylatra melanops''), of which Tromelin is a stronghold.<ref name=\"boobies\">{{cite book|title=African Wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-59LAQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Wildlife Society of Southern Africa.}}</ref> The red-footed boobies constitute the only polymorphic population in the region, indicating its biogeographical isolation.

A navigation error, due to the use of two conflicting charts, caused the vessel to wreck on the reefs of Tromelin Island (then known as the Isle of Sand). The ship was a frigate, not a slave ship, and thus was not equipped with the shackles and chains usually found on slave ships.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Tromelin, l'\u00eele aux esclaves oubli\u00e9s|last=Gu\u00e9rout, Romon|first=Max, Thomas|publisher=CNRS Editions|year=2015|isbn=|location=France|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the wreck, the crew and about 60 Malagasy people managed to reach the island, but the rest of the slaves, locked in the hold, drowned. The crew retrieved various equipment, food and wood from the wreckage. They dug a well, providing drinking water, and fed on salvaged food, turtles and seabirds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCaptain Jean de Lafargue, having lost his mind as a result of the wreck, was replaced by his first lieutenant, second-in-command, Barthelemy Castellan du Vernet who lost his brother Leon in the shipwreck.

When the crew of the ship reached Mauritius, they requested that colonial authorities send a ship to rescue the Malagasy slaves on the island. However, they met with a categorical refusal from the governor, with the justification that France was fighting the [[Seven Years' War]] and thus no ship could be spared, the island of Mauritius being itself under threat of attack from [[Company rule in India|British India]].<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/shipwrecked-and-abandoned-the-story-of-the-slave-crusoes-435092.html|title=Shipwrecked and abandoned: the story of the slave Crusoes|date=5 February 2007|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nCastellan left the Isle de France to return to France in 1762 and never gave up hope to one day return to the Isle of Sand to save the Malagasy people. The news of the castaway slaves got published and stirred the Parisian intellectual milieu; later, the episode was all but forgotten with the end of the Seven Years' War and the bankruptcy of the East India Company.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1773, a ship passing close to Tromelin Island located the slaves and reported them to the authorities of Isle de France. A boat was sent, but this first rescue failed, as the ship couldn't approach the island. A year later, a second ship, ''La Sauterelle'', also failed to reach the island. During this second failed rescue, a sailor managed to swim to the island, but he had to be abandoned by the ship due to bad weather. This sailor remained on Tromelin Island and, some time later, probably around 1775, built a raft on which he embarked with three men and three women, but which disappeared at sea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt was not until 29 November 1776, 15 years after the sinking, that the [[:fr:Bernard Boudin de Tromelin|Chevalier de Tromelin]], commander of the corvette ''La Dauphine'', reached Tromelin Island and rescued the survivors\u2014seven women and an eight-month-old child.<ref name=\"Marriner-2\">{{cite journal|last=Marriner |first=Nick |last2=Gu\u00e9rout|first2=Max |last3=Romon |first3=Thomas |year=2010 |title=The Forgotten Slaves of Tromelin (Indian Ocean): New Geoarchaeological Data|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1293\u20131304|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2009.12.032}}</ref><ref name=\"independent\" />  Upon arriving there, the Chevalier de Tromelin discovered that the survivors were dressed in plaited feather clothes and that they had managed, during all these years, to keep a fire lit (the island does not have a single tree). The Malagasy people, who had been left on the bleak little island, built a shed with coral stones, for most of the wood had been used in the construction of the raft for the crew. They also built a lookout on the highest point of the island in order not to miss the ship that would, they hoped, come to their rescue. They were all from the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] of Madagascar, and had no knowledge of how to produce food in the coastal environment. Most had died within the first few months on the island.<ref name=\"LRM\" /> The survivors remained with Jacques Maillart, governor of the Isle de France, who declared them free and offered to bring them back to Madagascar, which they refused.<ref name=\":0\" /> Maillart decided to baptize the child Jacques Moyse (Moses), on the day of his arrival in Port-Louis on 15 December 1776, and to rename his mother Eve (her Malagasy name was Semiavou) and to do the same with the child's grandmother, whom he called Dauphine after the name of the corvette that rescued them.<ref name=\":0\" /> The trio was welcomed in the house of the intendant of the Isle of France.

The results of the research were made public on January 17, 2007. The ten members of the expedition probed the wreck of L'Utile, and searched the island for traces of shipwreck, in order to better understand the living conditions of the Malagasy people during these fifteen years.<ref name=\":0\" />\nAccording to Max Gu\u00e9rout, head of the mission, \"In three days, a well 5 meters deep was dug.

They tried to survive with order and method.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn anonymous logbook, attributed to a writer of the crew, was found. Basements made of beach sandstone and coral were also found (the survivors thus transgressed a Malagasy custom according to which  stone constructions were reserved for tombs).

The fire was maintained for fifteen years, thanks to the wood from the wreck, the island being devoid of trees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA second expedition, organized in November 2008, did not reveal the burials observed in 1851 by an English naval officer.

With the exception of two or three months in summer, this flat island is swept day and night by heavy winds that are sustained in winter. In summer, it can suffer the onslaught of cyclones and tropical storms.\n\nThere is only grass and brush (low shrubs) present on the island. Veloutaries (Heliotropium foertherianum) and purslane (Portulaca oleracea), with growth shaped by a dominant east winds are present everywhere on the island.\n\nThe fauna consists mainly of hermit crabs (Paguroidea), seabirds and sea turtles for which the island is an important nesting place. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the freshwater turtle, is mainly encountered and, to a lesser extent, the tortoiseshell turtle, better known as the caret.\n\nThe waters are rich with fish. The French Coral Reef Initiative (IFRECOR) has identified 26 species of corals. Allochthonous species were introduced on the island during the various shipwrecks: rats, mice and rabbits. The latter were decimated in 1986 by cyclone Erinesta.\n\n===Important Bird Area===\nThe island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because of its significance as a [[bird colony|seabird breeding site]].  Both [[masked booby|masked]] (with up to 250 pairs) and [[red-footed booby|red-footed boobies]] (up to 180 pairs) nesting there.  [[Sulidae]] populations have seriously declined in the western Indian Ocean with those on Tromelin among the healthiest remaining.\n\nThe island's masked boobies are of the western Indian Ocean subspecies (''Sula dactylatra melanops''), of which Tromelin is a stronghold.<ref name=\"boobies\">{{cite book|title=African Wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-59LAQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Wildlife Society of Southern Africa.}}</ref> The red-footed boobies constitute the only polymorphic population in the region, indicating its biogeographical isolation.

A boat was sent, but this first rescue failed, as the ship couldn't approach the island. A year later, a second ship, ''La Sauterelle'', also failed to reach the island. During this second failed rescue, a sailor managed to swim to the island, but he had to be abandoned by the ship due to bad weather.

The Malagasy people, who had been left on the bleak little island, built a shed with coral stones, for most of the wood had been used in the construction of the raft for the crew.

The results of the research were made public on January 17, 2007.

They tried to survive with order and method.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn anonymous logbook, attributed to a writer of the crew, was found. Basements made of beach sandstone and coral were also found (the survivors thus transgressed a Malagasy custom according to which  stone constructions were reserved for tombs).

The fire was maintained for fifteen years, thanks to the wood from the wreck, the island being devoid of trees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA second expedition, organized in November 2008, did not reveal the burials observed in 1851 by an English naval officer. However, the remains of two bodies displaced during the digging of the foundations of a building of the weather station have been uncovered.
