Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhtaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanayeh Mazineyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by women. She translated several French books into [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate the girls, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying the student registration fee, this was done with one out of every two student and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) which were taught, and the condition of admission and degree was a test and test success that was held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (Carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nIn a time where reading and writing was uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]].

For example, at the same time, the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. Therefore, it came to a result that nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting with old traditions especially among women was one of the actions of Maryam.
