{"title_page": "Deaths in March 2020", "text_new": "{{short description|Notable deaths}}\n{{Deaths in month TOC}}\nThe following is a list of '''notable deaths in March 2020'''.\n\nEntries for each day are listed <u>alphabetically</u> by surname. A typical entry lists information in the following sequence:\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent country of citizenship (if applicable), reason for notability, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n<!--* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Please include a reference to a reliable source. If a Wikipedia article for the deceased does not yet exist, please reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, please consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the deceased \"notable\". If you report the death of a subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, please consider starting one, provided that the deceased is notable. Please include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid overlinking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, please include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article * * * * * * *-->\n\n==March 2020==\n===1===\n*[[Istv\u00e1n Balsai]], 72, Hungarian jurist and politician, [[Minister of Justice (Hungary)|Minister of Justice]] (1990\u20131994), [[National Assembly (Hungary)|MP]] (1990\u20132011).<ref>[https://www.origo.hu/itthon/20200301-meghalt-balsai-istvan.html Meghalt Balsai Istv\u00e1n alkotm\u00e1nyb\u00edr\u00f3] {{in lang|hu}}</ref>\n*[[Clara D.

Russian dissolution of the [[Livonian Confederation]] brought Poland\u2013Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. [[Swedish Estonia]] was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and [[Frederick II of Denmark]] bought the old [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek]], which he placed under the control of his brother [[Magnus of Holstein]]. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian [[vassal state]] [[Kingdom of Livonia]], which nominally existed until his defection in 1576.\n\nIn 1576, [[Stefan Batory]] became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish\u2013Polish\u2013Lithuanian offensive at the [[Battle of Wenden (1578)|Battle of Wenden]]. This was followed by an extended [[Livonian campaign of Stefan Batory|campaign through Russia]] culminating in the long and difficult [[siege of Pskov]]. Under the 1582 [[Truce of Jam Zapolski]], which ended the war between Russia and Poland\u2013Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland\u2013Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the [[Truce of Plussa]] with Sweden gaining most of [[Ingria]] and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Pre-war Livonia===\n[[File:Livonia in 1534 (English).png|thumb|300px|[[Old Livonia]], before the Livonian War:{{columns\n| col1 = {{legend|White|Livonian Order}}{{legend|purple|Bishopric of Courland}}{{legend|green|Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek}}\n| col2 = {{legend|#3388FF|Bishopric of Dorpat}}{{legend|teal|City of Riga}}{{legend|olive|Archbishopric of Riga}}\n}}]]\n\nBy the mid-16th century, economically prosperous [[Old Livonia]]<ref name=rabe306>{{harvnb|Rabe|1989|p=306}}</ref> had become a region organised into the decentralised and religiously divided [[Livonian Confederation]].<ref name=dybas193>{{harvnb|Dyba\u015b|2009|p=193}}</ref> Its territories consisted of the [[Livonian Order|Livonian branch]] of the [[Teutonic Order]], the [[prince-bishopric]]s [[Bishopric of Dorpat|of Dorpat]] (Tartu), [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek|\u00d6sel\u2013Wiek]], as well as [[Bishopric of Courland|Courland]], the [[Archbishopric of Riga]] and the city of [[Riga]].<ref name=rabe306/><ref name=buelow73/> Together with Riga, the cities of [[Dorpat|Dorpat (Tartu)]] and [[Reval]] (Tallinn), along with the knightly estates, enjoyed privileges enabling them to act almost independently.<ref name=buelow73>{{harvnb|B\u00fclow|2003|p=73}}</ref> The only common institutions of the Livonian estates were the regularly held common assemblies known as ''[[landtag]]s''.<ref name=rabe306/> As well as a divided political administration, there were also persistent rivalries between the archbishop of Riga and the ''landmeister'' of the Order for hegemony.<ref group=nb>The Order was led by a ''[[hochmeister]]'', an office that since 1525 had been executed by the ''deutschmeister'' responsible for the bailiwicks in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; the Order's organisation in Livonia was led by a circle of ''gebietigers'' headed by a ''landmeister'' elected from amongst the membership</ref><ref name=rabe306/><ref name=buelow73/> A schism had existed within the Order since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had spread to Livonia in the 1520s, although the transformation of the country into a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] region was a gradual process, resisted by part of the Order that to a varying degree remained sympathetic to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kreem|2006|pp=46, 51\u201353}}</ref> As war approached, Livonia had a weak administration subject to internal rivalries, lacked any powerful defences or outside support, and was surrounded by monarchies pursuing expansionist policies.

The conflict between Russia and the Western powers was exacerbated by Russia's isolation from sea trade. The new [[Ivangorod]] port built by Tsar Ivan on the eastern shore of the [[Narva River]] in 1550 was considered unsatisfactory on account of its shallow waters.<ref name=Madariaga124>{{harvnb|De Madariaga|2006|p=124}}</ref> Thereafter the tsar demanded that the Livonian Confederation pay about 6,000 [[mark (money)|marks]] to keep the [[Bishopric of Dorpat]], based on the claim that every adult male had paid Pskov one mark when it had been an independent state.<ref name=Madariaga124/> The Livonians eventually promised to pay this sum to [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan]] by 1557, but were sent from Moscow when they failed to do so, ending negotiations.<ref name=Madariaga124/> Ivan continued to point out that the existence of the Order required passive Russian support, and was quick to threaten use of military force if necessary.<ref name=Madariaga124/> He aimed to establish a corridor between the Baltic and the new territories on the [[Caspian Sea]], because if Russia were to engage in open conflict with major western powers, it would need imports of more sophisticated weaponry.<ref name=Madariaga124/>\n\nThe Polish King and Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Sigismund II Augustus]] was wary of Russian expansionist aspirations.

Russian dissolution of the [[Livonian Confederation]] brought Poland\u2013Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. [[Swedish Estonia]] was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and [[Frederick II of Denmark]] bought the old [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek]], which he placed under the control of his brother [[Magnus of Holstein]]. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian [[vassal state]] [[Kingdom of Livonia]], which nominally existed until his defection in 1576.\n\nIn 1576, [[Stefan Batory]] became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish\u2013Polish\u2013Lithuanian offensive at the [[Battle of Wenden (1578)|Battle of Wenden]]. This was followed by an extended [[Livonian campaign of Stefan Batory|campaign through Russia]] culminating in the long and difficult [[siege of Pskov]]. Under the 1582 [[Truce of Jam Zapolski]], which ended the war between Russia and Poland\u2013Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland\u2013Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the [[Truce of Plussa]] with Sweden gaining most of [[Ingria]] and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Pre-war Livonia===\n[[File:Livonia in 1534 (English).png|thumb|300px|[[Old Livonia]], before the Livonian War:{{columns\n| col1 = {{legend|White|Livonian Order}}{{legend|purple|Bishopric of Courland}}{{legend|green|Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek}}\n| col2 = {{legend|#3388FF|Bishopric of Dorpat}}{{legend|teal|City of Riga}}{{legend|olive|Archbishopric of Riga}}\n}}]]\n\nBy the mid-16th century, economically prosperous [[Old Livonia]]<ref name=rabe306>{{harvnb|Rabe|1989|p=306}}</ref> had become a region organised into the decentralised and religiously divided [[Livonian Confederation]].<ref name=dybas193>{{harvnb|Dyba\u015b|2009|p=193}}</ref> Its territories consisted of the [[Livonian Order|Livonian branch]] of the [[Teutonic Order]], the [[prince-bishopric]]s [[Bishopric of Dorpat|of Dorpat]], [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek|\u00d6sel\u2013Wiek]], as well as [[Bishopric of Courland|Courland]], the [[Archbishopric of Riga]] and the city of [[Riga]].<ref name=rabe306/><ref name=buelow73/> Together with Riga, the cities of [[Dorpat]] and [[Reval]] (Tallinn), along with the knightly estates, enjoyed privileges enabling them to act almost independently.<ref name=buelow73>{{harvnb|B\u00fclow|2003|p=73}}</ref> The only common institutions of the Livonian estates were the regularly held common assemblies known as ''[[landtag]]s''.<ref name=rabe306/> As well as a divided political administration, there were also persistent rivalries between the archbishop of Riga and the ''landmeister'' of the Order for hegemony.<ref group=nb>The Order was led by a ''[[hochmeister]]'', an office that since 1525 had been executed by the ''deutschmeister'' responsible for the bailiwicks in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; the Order's organisation in Livonia was led by a circle of ''gebietigers'' headed by a ''landmeister'' elected from amongst the membership</ref><ref name=rabe306/><ref name=buelow73/> A schism had existed within the Order since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had spread to Livonia in the 1520s, although the transformation of the country into a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] region was a gradual process, resisted by part of the Order that to a varying degree remained sympathetic to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kreem|2006|pp=46, 51\u201353}}</ref> As war approached, Livonia had a weak administration subject to internal rivalries, lacked any powerful defences or outside support, and was surrounded by monarchies pursuing expansionist policies.

The team is a successor of the [[Soviet Union men's national water polo team|Soviet water polo team]].\n\n==History==\n===In the Russian Empire===\nWater polo in Russia dates back to 1910, when the sport was included into the national water sports programme. The Shuvalov school was opened back then, featuring rules that differed from the international rules. In 1913, the first water polo tournament was played between the Shuvalov school and [[Moscow]], with the first winning 3\u20132. The new sport progressed in Russia, as all swimming organizations included this sport into their programme. P. Erofeev and A. Shemansky further populized water polo by publishing brochures with rules and hints.<ref>[http://www.waterpolo.ru/xml/t/History.xml?lang=ru&cmd=view&nic=history&mid=152&rid=0&m1id=25&pid=8#8 \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0418\u0415 \u0412\u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0419\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0418\u041c\u041f\u0415\u0420\u0418\u0418]</ref>\n\n===In the Soviet Union===\nAs previously, water polo was predominant in Moscow and [[Leningrad]] (formerly known as St. Petersburg). However, this changed when the water polo teams of the [[Black Sea Fleet]], [[Baltic Fleet]] and [[Caspian Flotilla]] further spread water polo in Russia. In the early history, water polo was popular especially among [[sailor]]s. The strongest teams were Delfin of Leningrad and the Moscow Life Saving Society and the Yacht-Club. Following the resolution by the organizing bureau of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1925, [[physical culture]] has been greatly propagated in Russia, stimulating water polo as well.<ref name=\"Soviet\">[http://www.waterpolo.ru/xml/t/History.xml?lang=ru&cmd=view&nic=history&mid=152&rid=0&m1id=25&pid=9#9 \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0418\u0415 \u0412\u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e \u0412 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]</ref>\n\nThe first championship took place in 1925. Apart from the teams of Leningrad, Moscow and [[Kiev]], the tournament featured teams from the [[Caucasus]], [[Crimea]], [[Ural Federal District|Ural]], as well as the aforementioned fleet teams. Three years later, water polo was included in the All-Union Spartakiade (sports festival). The team of Leningrad dominated in Russian water polo until 1933, as the city had winter water pools and so had more training opportunities. In 1946, the USSR Water Polo Cup was introduced. One year later, the Soviet Union was selected into the [[FINA]]. The national water polo then debuted at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in Helsinki.<ref name=\"Soviet\"/>\n\n==Results==\n===Olympic Games===\n{{div col}}\n*[[Water polo at the 1996 Summer

Polo Association of Russia]]\nThe '''Russia men's national water polo team''' is the representative for [[Russia]] in international men's [[water polo]]. The team is a successor of the [[Soviet Union men's national water polo team|Soviet water polo team]].\n\n==History==\n===In the Russian Empire===\nWater polo in Russia dates back to 1910, when the sport was included into the national water sports programme. The Shuvalov school was opened back then, featuring rules that differed from the international rules. In 1913, the first water polo tournament was played between the Shuvalov school and [[Moscow]], with the first winning 3\u20132. The new sport progressed in Russia, as all swimming organizations included this sport into their programme. P. Erofeev and A. Shemansky further populized water polo by publishing brochures with rules and hints.<ref>[http://www.waterpolo.ru/xml/t/History.xml?lang=ru&cmd=view&nic=history&mid=152&rid=0&m1id=25&pid=8#8 \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0418\u0415 \u0412\u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0419\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0418\u041c\u041f\u0415\u0420\u0418\u0418]</ref>\n\n===In the Soviet Union===\nAs previously, water polo was predominant in Moscow and [[Leningrad]] (formerly known as St. Petersburg). However, this changed when the water polo teams of the [[Black Sea Fleet]], [[Baltic Fleet]] and [[Caspian Flotilla]] further spread water polo in Russia. In the early history, water polo was popular especially among [[sailor]]s. The strongest teams were Delfin of Leningrad and the Moscow Life Saving Society and the Yacht-Club. Following the resolution by the organizing bureau of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1925, [[physical culture]] has been greatly propagated in Russia, stimulating water polo as well.<ref name=\"Soviet\">[http://www.waterpolo.ru/xml/t/History.xml?lang=ru&cmd=view&nic=history&mid=152&rid=0&m1id=25&pid=9#9 \u0420\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0418\u0422\u0418\u0415 \u0412\u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e \u0412 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]</ref>\n\nThe first championship took place in 1925. Apart from the teams of Leningrad, Moscow and [[Kiev]], the tournament featured teams from the [[Caucasus]], [[Crimea]], [[Ural Federal District|Ural]], as well as the aforementioned fleet teams. Three years later, water polo was included in the All-Union Spartakiade (sports festival). The team of Leningrad dominated in Russian water polo until 1933, as the city had winter water pools and so had more training opportunities. In 1946, the USSR Water Polo Cup was introduced. One year later, the Soviet Union was selected into the [[FINA]]. The national water polo then debuted at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in Helsinki.<ref name=\"Soviet\"/>\n\n==Results==\n===Olympic Games===\n{{div col}}\n*[[Water polo at the 1996 Summer

She obtained a 3-year [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Western Ontario]]. From 1941 onwards she worked for the [[British Security Coordination]] in [[New York City]]. After being posted to [[Panama]], she met and married John Wood, though the couple would divorce in 1951.\n\nOn her way to [[New York City]] in 1941, Maclean had met [[Sheena Govan]], and it was through her that she would later meet [[Peter Caddy]]. Living in [[England]] in the 1950s, Maclean became involved in the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practices of Govan and Caddy and eventually [[Eileen Caddy]]. When the Caddys were appointed to manage a hotel in [[Scotland]], Maclean joined them as the hotel's secretary.\n\nAfter the Caddys became unemployed in 1962, they moved into a [[caravan (towed trailer)|caravan]] near the village of [[Findhorn]]. In 1963, an annex was built so that Maclean could continue to work with them.

She obtained a 3-year [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Western Ontario]]. From 1941 onwards she worked for the [[British Security Coordination]] in [[New York City]]. After being posted to [[Panama]], she met and married John Wood, though the couple would divorce in 1951.\n\nOn her way to [[New York City]] in 1941, Maclean had met [[Sheena Govan]], and it was through her that she would later meet [[Peter Caddy]]. Living in [[England]] in the 1950s, Maclean became involved in the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practices of Govan and Caddy and eventually [[Eileen Caddy]]. When the Caddys were appointed to manage a hotel in [[Scotland]], Maclean joined them as the hotel's secretary.\n\nAfter the Caddys became unemployed in 1962, they moved into a [[caravan (towed trailer)|caravan]] near the village of [[Findhorn]]. In 1963, an annex was built so that Maclean could continue to work with them.
