The tale has been adapted to various media including opera, musical, and animated film. The tale is completely Andersen's invention and owes no debt to fairy tales or folklore.\n\n==Plot==\n\nWhen the story begins, a mother duck's eggs hatch. One of the little birds is perceived by the other birds and animals on the farm as an ugly little creature and suffers much verbal and physical abuse from them. He wanders sadly from the barnyard and lives with wild ducks and geese until hunters slaughter the flocks. He finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen tease and taunt him mercilessly and once again he sets off alone.\n\nThe duckling sees a flock of migrating wild swans. He is delighted and excited, but he cannot join them, for he is too young and cannot fly. Winter arrives. A farmer finds and carries the freezing little duckling home, but the foundling is frightened by the farmer\u2019s noisy children and flees the house. He spends a miserable winter alone in the outdoors, mostly hiding in a cave on the lake that partly freezes over. When spring arrives, a flock of swans descends on the lake.\n\nThe ugly duckling, now having fully grown and matured, is unable to endure a life of solitude and hardship any more and decides to throw himself at the flock of swans deciding that it is better to be killed by such beautiful birds than to live a life of ugliness and misery. He is shocked when the swans welcome and accept him, only to realize by looking at his reflection in the water that he had been, not a duckling, but a swan all this time. The flock takes to the air, and the now beautiful swan spreads his gorgeous large wings and takes flight with the rest of his new family.\n\n==Composition and publication history==\nAndersen first conceived the story in 1842 while enjoying the beauty of nature during his stay at the country estate of Bregentved, and lavished a year's worth of attention upon it. He initially considered \"The Young Swans\" as the tale's title but, not wanting to spoil the element of surprise in the protagonist\u2019s transformation, discarded it for \"The Ugly Duckling\". He later confessed that the story was \"a reflection of my own life\", and, when the critic Georg Brandes questioned Andersen about whether he would write his autobiography, the poet claimed that it had already been written \u2014 \"The Ugly Duckling\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Elias |last=Bredsdorff |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Story of his Life and Work 1805-75 |publisher=Phaidon |year=1975 |isbn=0-7148-1636-1}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark 11 November 1843 in ''[[New Fairy Tales (1844)|New Fairy Tales.

Things are simply fated and unfold accordingly, whether or not the hero takes some action.\u201d In conjunction with Bettelheim\u2019s assessment, [[Maria Tatar]] notes  in \u2019\u2019The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen\u2019\u2019 that Andersen suggests that the Ugly Duckling's superiority resides in the fact that he is of a breed different from the barnyard rabble, and that dignity and worth, moral and aesthetic superiority are determined by nature rather than accomplishment.<ref name=\"Tatar\" />\n\nAccording to Carole Rosen, the story was inspired in part by Andersen's friend [[Jenny Lind]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Carole |editor1-last=Matthew |editor1-first=H.

The tale was adapted to a variety of media. Films based on the tale include two ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' animated shorts produced by Walt Disney called ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''. The first was produced in 1931 in black and white, and a remake in 1939 in [[Technicolor]]. The latter film won the 1939 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intanibase.com/shorts.aspx?shortID=288&studioID=1 |title=The 1939 Silly Symphony |publisher=The Internet Animation Database}}</ref> and was the last Silly Symphony to be made. The main difference between the Andersen story and the Disney version is that, in the latter, the little bird's ordeal lasts for only a few minutes, not for months. In 1936, the Fleischer brothers adapted the story for their animated short \"The Little Stranger\", reversing the story by having an odd chick born into a family of ducks. In 1956 the Soviet animation studio [[Soyuzmultfilm]] produced its own 19 minutes version of The Ugly Duckling.<ref>''[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&p=show_film&fid=3072 The Ugly Duckling]'' at [[Animator.ru]]</ref> The anime ''[[Princess Tutu]]'' is about a duck that turns into a swan-like ballerina. In 2006, the Danish animation studio [[A. Film]] produced a spin-off CG feature called ''[[The Ugly Duckling and Me!]]'', and later produced a children's CG television series ''Ugly Duckling Junior'' which featured the same characters as the movie. The 1954 [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoon ''[[Downhearted Duckling]]'' is also based on the famous story.\n\nThe tale has seen various musical adaptations. In 1914, the Russian composer [[Sergei Prokofiev]] composed a work for voice and piano based on Nina Meshcherskaya's adaptation of the tale and, in 1932, arranged the work for voice and orchestra. This was transcribed by Lev Konov in 1996, and his opera was a great success in Russia. Other musical versions include the song \u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d composed by [[Frank Loesser]] and sung by [[Danny Kaye]] for the 1952 [[Charles Vidor]] [[musical film]] ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'', and  ''[[Honk!]]'', a musical based on the tale which was produced in Britain and won an [[Olivier Award]]. The tale was adapted to a musical by Gail Deschamps and Paul Hamilton with a planned United States tour 2002-2003. In 1998, the musical played the Piccolo Spoleto for seventeen days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmtproductions.com/p-duckling.htm |title=GMT: The Ugly Duckling}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Jerry Pinkney]] [[The Ugly Duckling (Pinkney book)|adapted the story]] as a children's picture book.<ref>{{cite book |title=The ugly duckling |publisher=Online Computer Library Center |oclc = 39051276}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the [[Dance Theatre]] of [[Bradenton, Florida]], presented the ballet version of the popular tale (Allison Norton: The Ugly Duckling).\n\nIn 2010, [[Garri Bardin]] directed a feature-length [[stop-motion]] [[musical film|musical]] of the story set to [[Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky#Ballets|Tchaikovsky's ballet music]].\n\nIn 2012, a musical adaptation of the story, with ten original songs, was released by JJ\u2019s Tunes & Tales.  The album, titled \u201cThe Ugly Duckling: Story with Songs\u201d contains both songs and spoken narration, and was released independently on [[CD Baby]] and [[iTunes]].  Examples of song titles include:  Hatching of the Eggs; A Better Place; Song of the Swans; What\u2019s the Matter with You; It\u2019s a Big, Big World; Pretty Good Place to Live.\n\n''GivingTales'' \u2013 in 2015 a storytelling app for children was created in aid of Unicef.

Things are simply fated and unfold accordingly, whether or not the hero takes some action.\u201d In conjunction with Bettelheim\u2019s assessment, [[Maria Tatar]] notes  in \u2019\u2019The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen\u2019\u2019 that Andersen suggests that the Ugly Duckling's superiority resides in the fact that he is of a breed different from the barnyard rabble, and that dignity and worth, moral and aesthetic superiority are determined by nature rather than accomplishment.<ref name=\"Tatar\" />\n\nAccording to Carole Rosen, the story was inspired in part by Andersen's friend [[Jenny Lind]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Carole |editor1-last=Matthew |editor1-first=H.

The tale was adapted to a variety of media. Films based on the tale include two ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' animated shorts produced by Walt Disney called ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''. The first was produced in 1931 in black and white, and a remake in 1939 in [[Technicolor]]. The latter film won the 1939 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intanibase.com/shorts.aspx?shortID=288&studioID=1 |title=The 1939 Silly Symphony |publisher=The Internet Animation Database}}</ref> and was the last Silly Symphony to be made. The main difference between the Andersen story and the Disney version is that, in the latter, the little bird's ordeal lasts for only a few minutes, not for months. In 1936, the Fleischer brothers adapted the story for their animated short \"The Little Stranger\", reversing the story by having an odd chick born into a family of ducks. In 1956 the Soviet animation studio [[Soyuzmultfilm]] produced its own 19 minutes version of The Ugly Duckling.<ref>''[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&p=show_film&fid=3072 The Ugly Duckling]'' at [[Animator.ru]]</ref> The anime ''[[Princess Tutu]]'' is about a duck that turns into a swan-like ballerina. In 2006, the Danish animation studio [[A. Film]] produced a spin-off CG feature called ''[[The Ugly Duckling and Me!]]'', and later produced a children's CG television series ''Ugly Duckling Junior'' which featured the same characters as the movie. The 1954 [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoon ''[[Downhearted Duckling]]'' is also based on the famous story.\n\nThe tale has seen various musical adaptations. In 1914, the Russian composer [[Sergei Prokofiev]] composed a work for voice and piano based on Nina Meshcherskaya's adaptation of the tale and, in 1932, arranged the work for voice and orchestra. This was transcribed by Lev Konov in 1996, and his opera was a great success in Russia. Other musical versions include the song \u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d composed by [[Frank Loesser]] and sung by [[Danny Kaye]] for the 1952 [[Charles Vidor]] [[musical film]] ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'', and  ''[[Honk!]]'', a musical based on the tale which was produced in Britain and won an [[Olivier Award]]. The tale was adapted to a musical by Gail Deschamps and Paul Hamilton with a planned United States tour 2002-2003. In 1998, the musical played the Piccolo Spoleto for seventeen days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmtproductions.com/p-duckling.htm |title=GMT: The Ugly Duckling}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Jerry Pinkney]] [[The Ugly Duckling (Pinkney book)|adapted the story]] as a children's picture book.<ref>{{cite book |title=The ugly duckling |publisher=Online Computer Library Center |oclc = 39051276}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the [[Dance Theatre]] of [[Bradenton, Florida]], presented the ballet version of the popular tale (Allison Norton: The Ugly Duckling).\n\nIn 2010, [[Garri Bardin]] directed a feature-length [[stop-motion]] [[musical film|musical]] of the story set to [[Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky#Ballets|Tchaikovsky's ballet music]].\n\nIn 2012, a musical adaptation of the story, with ten original songs, was released by JJ\u2019s Tunes & Tales.  The album, titled \u201cThe Ugly Duckling: Story with Songs\u201d contains both songs and spoken narration, and was released independently on [[CD Baby]] and [[iTunes]].  Examples of song titles include:  Hatching of the Eggs; A Better Place; Song of the Swans; What\u2019s the Matter with You; It\u2019s a Big, Big World; Pretty Good Place to Live.\n\n''GivingTales'' \u2013 in 2015 a storytelling app for children was created in aid of Unicef.

Available on the ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' Region 4 DVD, released by Umbrella Entertainment Pty Ltd in 2007.</ref>\n\n''New York Times'' writers Ben Brantley and Richard Servero analyzed the breadth and scope of Orbach's career:\n\n<blockquote>Whether singing \"Try to Remember\" as the dashing narrator of \"The Fantasticks\" in 1960 or trading barbs with fellow detectives and reluctant witnesses on television in recent years, Mr. Orbach exuded a wry, ragged masculinity that was all his own. As a star of musicals, he created a new kind of hero who was leagues away from suave, swaggering Adonises like [[John Raitt]], [[Howard Keel]], and [[Alfred Drake]]... And he flourished at a time when the Broadway musical hero was fast becoming an endangered species... His rough-edged individuality may account for his endurance on the Broadway stage in an era when other promising musical actors - including [[Larry Kert]], [[Robert Goulet]], and [[Robert Morse]] - proved unable to follow through on their breakthrough successes. Mr. Orbach may have been the last of a breed: no male star since has matched the breadth and continuity of his career in musicals... It wasn't until the 1990s, when he started appearing as Lennie Briscoe in \"Law & Order,\" that Mr. Orbach became a familiar name throughout the country. The rough edge that distinguished him on Broadway eased his transition to character roles like Briscoe, the recovered alcoholic who seemed to greet the discovery of each episode's crime with a world-weary shrug.<ref name=NYTobit/></blockquote>\n\n''Dirty Dancing'' co-star [[Patrick Swayze]] memorialized Orbach after his death:\n\n<blockquote>Jerry Orbach has been one of the most successful actors who ever lived to make that transition from musical theatre into real, organic, break-your-heart kinds of reality in his work as a film actor, but transition back and forth seamlessly... it was a very interesting time for me, when I was shooting ''Dirty Dancing'', I think probably the eyes I trusted if I was real, and it worked, and I had nailed it, [were] Jerry Orbach's eyes. I would go over to him and under my breath \"What did you think?\" and he goes \"No, go there further, I think there's more you can get.\" He would say little things like \"courage\", and it gives me goosebumps to say that. I really, really respected that man. I watched his career from the time I was little. I think it was a great loss when he passed.<ref>{{cite video|last=You Tube video|work=[[American Film Institute]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQlzKrqe6g|title=Patrick Swayze Talks About Working With Jerry Orbach}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Stage===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Prominent roles included tough, corrupt NYPD narcotics detective Gus Levy in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[Prince of the City (film)|Prince of the City]]''; he was the 1981 runner-up for the [[National Society of Film Critics|NSFC]] Best Supporting Actor award. He also portrayed gangsters in both the action-thriller ''[[F/X]]'' and the [[Woody Allen]] drama ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' (the latter of which also featured his future ''Law & Order'' co-star [[Sam Waterston]]). In 1985, Orbach became a regular guest star on ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' as private detective Harry McGraw, which led to him starring in the short-lived spin-off series ''[[The Law & Harry McGraw]]''. In 1987, he was featured in the hit film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' as Dr. Jake Houseman, the father of [[Jennifer Grey]]'s character \"Baby\".

I talked to him one time, and he's adorable.\"<ref>October 6, 2005. Kurt Vonnegut interviewed on ABC Radio National Audio by Phillip Adams. Available on the ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' Region 4 DVD, released by Umbrella Entertainment Pty Ltd in 2007.</ref>\n\n''New York Times'' writers Ben Brantley and Richard Servero analyzed the breadth and scope of Orbach's career:\n\n<blockquote>Whether singing \"Try to Remember\" as the dashing narrator of \"The Fantasticks\" in 1960 or trading barbs with fellow detectives and reluctant witnesses on television in recent years, Mr. Orbach exuded a wry, ragged masculinity that was all his own. As a star of musicals, he created a new kind of hero who was leagues away from suave, swaggering Adonises like [[John Raitt]], [[Howard Keel]], and [[Alfred Drake]]... And he flourished at a time when the Broadway musical hero was fast becoming an endangered species... His rough-edged individuality may account for his endurance on the Broadway stage in an era when other promising musical actors - including [[Larry Kert]], [[Robert Goulet]], and [[Robert Morse]] - proved unable to follow through on their breakthrough successes. Mr. Orbach may have been the last of a breed: no male star since has matched the breadth and continuity of his career in musicals... It wasn't until the 1990s, when he started appearing as Lennie Briscoe in \"Law & Order,\" that Mr. Orbach became a familiar name throughout the country. The rough edge that distinguished him on Broadway eased his transition to character roles like Briscoe, the recovered alcoholic who seemed to greet the discovery of each episode's crime with a world-weary shrug.<ref name=NYTobit/></blockquote>\n\n''Dirty Dancing'' co-star [[Patrick Swayze]] memorialized Orbach after his death:\n\n<blockquote>Jerry Orbach has been one of the most successful actors who ever lived to make that transition from musical theatre into real, organic, break-your-heart kinds of reality in his work as a film actor, but transition back and forth seamlessly... it was a very interesting time for me, when I was shooting ''Dirty Dancing'', I think probably the eyes I trusted if I was real, and it worked, and I had nailed it, [were] Jerry Orbach's eyes. I would go over to him and under my breath \"What did you think?\" and he goes \"No, go there further, I think there's more you can get.\" He would say little things like \"courage\", and it gives me goosebumps to say that. I really, really respected that man. I watched his career from the time I was little. I think it was a great loss when he passed.<ref>{{cite video|last=You Tube video|work=[[American Film Institute]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQlzKrqe6g|title=Patrick Swayze Talks About Working With Jerry Orbach}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Stage===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Triger'', Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9ologique de France, Tome 25 des bulletins, 1868</ref> ==\nTriger was born in Mamers, a town in the [[Sarthe]] French county, on 10 March 1801. He studied at La Fl\u00e8che and then in Paris, where he met [[Louis Cordier]] in 1825. Cordier was an eminent French geologist, who taught Triger his first lessons in geology. He was quickly interested in the technical challenges of this industrial sector. At 32 years old, together with skilled managers, he developed new industries in Sarthe and [[Mayenne]]. In this period he developed and launched three coal mines, a paper mill and a sawmill.\n\nIn 1833 he was left by the woman he intended to marry. This disappointment in his personal life plunged him deeply into work: production of gravel from dolomite rock, construction of public fountains in Mamers and detailed study of phreatic groundwater tables near Le Mans.\n\nAbout 1834 he started the study and geological investigation of his region - Sarthe and Mayenne, and never stopped working on them until his death. These investigations, and discussions with Louis Cordier, drove him to [[Anjou]] ([[Maine-et-Loire]]) where coal was craft mined. Thus, in 1839, Triger seriously began to look at the [[Loire]] river and the way to reach solid rock underneath about 20 meters of waterlogged soil. After reading many articles on compressed air, he was convinced that he could use it  to help dig through this layer of soil. His success does not lie on the idea of using compressed air, but in the invention of the airlock - to pass from the pressurised zone of the caisson to the zone of atmospheric air pressure, and especially in finding of a practical way to utilize the technique on an industrial scale. With the financial and administrative support of [[Emmanuel de Las Cases]], 5 steel shaft linings were drilled by this invention, which was subsequently adapted and applied to dig foundations, bridges and many tunnels.\n\nWhile focused on his industrial activities, he did not step away from his geological research work. Helped by a liking for travel, he gradually established the first geological map of the Sarthe county. After more than 20 years of research, the document was presented in 1853 at the Geological Society of France. The topographic background, support of the geological layers, was designed by Triger himself. To design this document, he had to study all the fossils in his county and deal with some of the mysteries at that time - such as the structure of the Cretaceous terrain of Maine, or the study of the Silurian-Devonian-Carboniferous lands in the West part of France.\n\nTriger wanted the designation of the geological strata to be borrowed from paleontology (fossils names). He saw in this new system \"the precious advantage of a universal language that one would understand everywhere, without comments and which would easily help the geologists from all regions of the globe to communicate\".\n\nHe was also a paleontologist, part of the first team to excavate the archaeological site of Roc-en Paille ([[Chalonnes-sur-Loire]], Maine-et-Loire). His very large collection of rocks, fossils and minerals is now displayed at the Museum of Natural History in [[Angers]].\n\nA last honorable task kept Triger busy until the end of his life: the constitution of regular geological cross-sections of the whole eastern part of France. This huge work was carried out by a team of geologists directed by Triger: geological sections from Paris to Brest, from Le Mans to Angers, from Paris to Rennes, Vend\u00f4me to Brest...\n\nOn 16 December 1867 Triger died from a heart attack after a meeting at the Geological Society of France, where he served for 35 years.\n\nTriger's name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].\n\n== Details of the Triger Process ==\nThe work is done inside a chamber (known as a [[caisson (engineering)|caisson]]) open at the bottom and in which compressed air is pumped to keep water out.<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=[[Robert Davis (inventor)|Davis, RH]] |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 }}</ref><ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref>  Originally developed for use in a coal mine (Mines de [[Chalonnes-sur-Loire]], 1839), it was later applied to bridge construction and civil applications as well.

Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins.\n\n====Team nickname====\nThe Washington franchise was known as both \"Senators\" and \"Nationals\" at various times, and sometimes at the same time.  In 1905, the team changed its official name to the \"Washington Nationals.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIN/ |title=Minnesota Twins Team History & Encyclopedia | work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 24, 2008}}</ref> The name \"Nationals\" appeared on uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to \"Nats.\" Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the \"Senators\" nickname, because of potential confusion caused by an American League team using the \"Nationals\" name. Over time, \"Nationals\" faded as a nickname, and \"Senators\" became dominant. Baseball guides listed the club's nickname as \"Nationals or Senators\", acknowledging the dual-nickname situation.\n\nThe team name was officially changed to Washington Senators around the time of [[Clark Griffith]]'s death. It was not until 1959 that the word \"Senators\" first appeared on team shirts. \"Nats,\" from the team name's middle syllable, continued to be used by space-saving headline writers, even for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|1961 expansion team]], which was never officially known as \"Nationals.\"\n\nThe current \"Nationals\" and \"Nats\" names were revived in 2005, when the [[Montreal Expos]] relocated to Washington to become the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]].\n\n===Minnesota Twins: 1961 to present===\nIn 1960, Major League Baseball granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team. Washington owner [[Calvin Griffith]], Clark's nephew and adopted son, requested that he be allowed to [[relocation of professional sports teams|move]] his team to [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] and instead give Washington the expansion team.

The \"TC\" remained on the Twins' caps until 1987, when they adopted new uniforms.

Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team (the Twins had been sharing tenancy in stadiums with the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Minnesota Vikings]] since 1961). The team was rumored to contemplate moving to such places as [[New Jersey]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Portland, Oregon]], the [[Piedmont Triad|Greensboro/Winston-Salem, North Carolina area]], and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]] franchise) for [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|elimination]] due to their financial weakness relative to other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to relocate, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.\n\n===Target Field===\n{{Main|Target Field}}\n[[Image:Target Field April 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Target Field]] in 2010.]]\nIn response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadium\u2014 a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] of [[Central, Minneapolis|downtown Minneapolis]]\u2014 owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2010/04/01/17066/target_field_the_house_that_jerry_bell_willed_to_completion |last=Weiner |first=Jay |title=Target Field: 'The House That Jerry Bell Willed to Completion' |publisher=MinnPost |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Target Field]] was constructed at a cost of $544.4&nbsp;million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a $392&nbsp;million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of $185&nbsp;million provided by the [[Carl Pohlad|Pohlad family]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/46497222.html |title=Editorial: Target Field built to exceed expectations |newspaper=Star Tribune |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Gordon |url=http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=/industriestrends/commercialrealestate/127061p1.aspx |title=The Coolest Ballpark in America |publisher=Twin Cities Business Magazine |date=March 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003105952/http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061p1.aspx |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for a long time to come.

The first regular season game in Target Field was played against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIN/MIN201004120.shtml |title=April 12, 2010 Boston Red Sox at Minnesota Twins Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2011, Target Field was named \"The Best Place To Shop\" by [[Street and Smith]]'s ''SportsBusiness Journal'' at the magazine's 2011 Sports Business Awards Ceremony in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/sports-business/2011/05/target-field-named-sports-facility-of.html |title=Target Field named Sports Facility of the Year |first=John |last=Vomhof, Jr. |publisher=Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> It was also named \"The Best Sports Stadium in North America\" by ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' in a ranking that included over 120 different stadiums, ballparks and arenas from around North America.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hart Van Denburg |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/07/espn_calls_trag.php |title=ESPN Magazine calls Target Field the best stadium in North America |newspaper=City Pages |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517133915/http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/07/espn_calls_trag.php |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2014, Target Field hosted the [[2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|85th Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] and the [[2014 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby|Home Run Derby]].\n\n==Roster==\n{{Minnesota Twins roster}}\n\n[[Minnesota Twins all-time roster]]: A complete list of players who played in at least one game for the Twins franchise.\n\n==Minor league affiliates==\n{{Main|List of Minnesota Twins minor league affiliates}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Level\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Team\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|League\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Location\n|-\n| ''AAA''\n| [[Rochester Red Wings]]\n| [[International League]]\n| [[Rochester, New York]]\n|-\n| ''AA''\n| [[Pensacola Blue Wahoos]]\n| [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]\n| [[Pensacola, Florida]]\n|-\n| ''Advanced A''\n| [[Fort Myers Mighty Mussels]]\n| [[Florida State League]]\n| [[Fort Myers, Florida]]\n|-\n| ''A''\n| [[Cedar Rapids Kernels]]\n| [[Midwest League]]\n| [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|''Rookie''\n| [[Elizabethton Twins]]\n| [[Appalachian League]]\n| [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]]\n|-\n| [[Gulf Coast League Twins|GCL Twins]]\n| [[Gulf Coast League]]\n| [[Fort Myers, Florida]]\n|-\n| Dominican Summer Twins|DSL Twins\n| [[Dominican Summer League]]\n| [[Dominican Republic]]\n|}\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Baseball Hall of Famers===\n{{Baseball hall of fame list\n|Current Team Name = Minnesota Twins\n| All Team Names = Twins or Senators\n| ColorA# = 002B5C\n| ColorB# = FFFFFF\n| ColorC# = D31145\n| ColorD# = FFFFFF\n| Team Name 1 = '''Washington Senators'''\n| List 1.1 = [[Stan Coveleski]]<br />[[Joe Cronin]]<br />[[Ed Delahanty]]\n| List 1.2 = [[Rick Ferrell]]<br />[[Lefty Gomez]]<br />'''[[Goose Goslin]]''' *\n| List 1.3 = [[Clark Griffith]] *<br />'''[[Bucky Harris]]''' *<br />[[Whitey Herzog]]<br />'''[[Walter Johnson]]''' *\n| List 1.4 = [[Heinie Manush]] *<br />'''[[Sam Rice]]''' *<br />[[Al Simmons]]\n| List 1.5 =[[George Sisler]]<br />[[Tris Speaker]]<br />[[Early Wynn]]\n| Team Name 2 = '''Minnesota Twins'''\n| List 2.1 = '''[[Bert Blyleven]]''' *\n| List 2.2 = '''[[Rod Carew]]''' *<br />[[Steve Carlton]]\n| List 2.3 = '''[[Harmon Killebrew]]''' *<br />[[Paul Molitor]]\n| List 2.4 = [[Jack Morris]]<br />'''[[Kirby Puckett]]''' *\n| List 2.5 = [[Jim Thome]]<br />[[Dave Winfield]]\n\n| Team Name 3 =\n| List 3.1 =\n| List 3.2 =\n| List 3.3 =\n| List 3.4 =\n| List 3.5 =\n| Team Name 4 =\n| List 4.1 =\n| List 4.2 =\n| List 4.3 =\n| List 4.4 =\n| List 4.5 =\n| Footnote1 = * Washington Senators or Minnesota Twins listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n| Footnote2 =\n| Footnote3 =\n| Footnote4 =\n|}}\nMolitor, Morris, and Winfield were all [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] natives who joined the Twins late in their careers and were warmly received as \"hometown heroes\", but were elected to the Hall primarily on the basis of their tenures with other teams.

Metrodome}}\n{{see also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\nThe Metrodome's upper deck in center and right fields was partly covered by a curtain containing banners of various titles won, and retired numbers. There was no acknowledgment of the Twins' prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. However Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961.\n\nPrior to the addition of the banners, the Twins acknowledged their retired numbers on the Metrodome's outfield fence. Harmon Killebrew's #3 was the first to be displayed, as it was the only one the team had retired when they moved in. It was joined by Rod Carew's #29 in 1987, Tony Oliva's #6 in 1991, Kent Hrbek's #14 in 1995, and Kirby Puckett's #34 in 1997 before the Twins began hanging the banners to reduce capacity. The championships, meanwhile were marked on the \"Baggie\" in right field.\n\n{{retired number list|\n{{retired number|image=HarmonKillebrewTwins.png|name=[[Harmon Killebrew|Harmon<br />Killebrew]]|pos=LF-1B-3B|date=<br />May 4, 1975}}\n{{retired number|image=TonyOilvaTwins.png|name=[[Tony Oliva|Tony<br />Oliva]]|pos=RF-DH-Coach|date=July 14, 1991}}\n{{retired number|image=JoeMauerTwins.png|name=[[Joe Mauer|Joe<br />Mauer]]|pos=C-1B|date=June 15, 2019}}\n{{retired number|image=TomKellyTwins.png|name=[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom<br />Kelly]]|pos=Manager|date=September 8, 2012}}\n{{retired number|image=KentHrbekTwins.png|name=[[Kent Hrbek|Kent<br />Hrbek]]|pos=1B|date=August 13, 1995}}\n{{retired number|image=BertBlylevenTwins.png|name=[[Bert Blyleven|Bert<br />Blyleven]]|pos=P|date=July 16, 2011}}\n{{retired number|image=RodCarewTwins.png|name=[[Rod Carew|Rod<br />Carew]]|pos=1B-2B|date=July 19, 1987}}\n{{retired number|image=KirbyPuckett_Twins.png||name=[[Kirby Puckett|Kirby<br />Puckett]]|pos=CF|date=May 25, 1997}}\n{{retired number|image=Minnesota_Twins_42.png|name=[[Jackie Robinson|Jackie<br />Robinson]]|pos=All MLB|honored=April 15, 1997}}\n}}\n[[File:Target Field 04.12.2010 059 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Target Field retired number signs in 2010.]] In the Metrodome, the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers in the future. The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring Killebrew, the left field gate is Gate No. 6, honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 14, for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29, in tribute to Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett.\n\nThe numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the tower that serves as the Twins' executive offices in left field foul territory. The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly on masts at the back of the left field upper deck. Those pennants, along with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed.\n\n[[Jackie Robinson]]'s number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997 and formally honored by the Twins on May 23, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXxe3Gi8Ca4C&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=minnesota+jackie+robinson+%22May+23+1997%22&source=bl&ots=8DH_7ly1u2&sig=BT_fjk1Y8B-_Waus6CLJ6sGMxBw&hl=en&ei=r9alTviRBsmftwftoeSwBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Minnesota Sports Almanac|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref> Robinson's number was positioned to the left of the Twins numbers in both venues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Player!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Jersey!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Position!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Date retired\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Harmon Killebrew]] || 3 || LF-1B-3B: 1954\u201360 (WAS)<br />LF-1B-3B: 1961\u201374 (MIN) || May 4, 1975\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Rod Carew]] || 29 || 1B-2B: 1967\u201378 (MIN) || July 19, 1987\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tony Oliva]] || 6 || RF-DH: 1962\u201376 (MIN)<br />Coach: 1976\u201378 (MIN)<br />Coach: 1985\u201391 (MIN) || July 14, 1991\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kent Hrbek]] || 14 || 1B: 1981\u201394 (MIN) || August 13, 1995\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Jackie Robinson]] || 42 || Retired by MLB || April 15, 1997\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kirby Puckett]] || 34 || CF: 1984\u201395 (MIN) || May 25, 1997\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Bert Blyleven]] || 28 || P: 1970\u201376 (MIN)<br />P: 1985\u201388 (MIN) || July 16, 2011\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom Kelly]] || 10 || Manager: 1986\u20132001 (MIN) || September 8, 2012\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Joe Mauer]] || 7 || C-1B-DH: 2004-2018 (MIN) || June 15, 2019\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats10.shtml|title=Retired Uniform Numbers in the American League by Baseball Almanac|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/retired_numbers.jsp|title=Retired Numbers|work=Minnesota Twins|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{main|Minnesota Twins award winners and league leaders}}\n\n==Team records==\n{{main|Minnesota Twins team records}}\n\n==Team seasons==\n{{main|List of Minnesota Twins seasons}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins.\n\n====Team nickname====\nThe Washington franchise was known as both \"Senators\" and \"Nationals\" at various times, and sometimes at the same time.  In 1905, the team changed its official name to the \"Washington Nationals.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIN/ |title=Minnesota Twins Team History & Encyclopedia | work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 24, 2008}}</ref> The name \"Nationals\" appeared on uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to \"Nats.\" Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the \"Senators\" nickname, because of potential confusion caused by an American League team using the \"Nationals\" name. Over time, \"Nationals\" faded as a nickname, and \"Senators\" became dominant. Baseball guides listed the club's nickname as \"Nationals or Senators\", acknowledging the dual-nickname situation.\n\nThe team name was officially changed to Washington Senators around the time of [[Clark Griffith]]'s death. It was not until 1959 that the word \"Senators\" first appeared on team shirts. \"Nats,\" from the team name's middle syllable, continued to be used by space-saving headline writers, even for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|1961 expansion team]], which was never officially known as \"Nationals.\"\n\nThe current \"Nationals\" and \"Nats\" names were revived in 2005, when the [[Montreal Expos]] relocated to Washington to become the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]].\n\n===Minnesota Twins: 1961 to present===\nIn 1960, Major League Baseball granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team. Washington owner [[Calvin Griffith]], Clark's nephew and adopted son, requested that he be allowed to [[relocation of professional sports teams|move]] his team to [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] and instead give Washington the expansion team. Upon league approval, the team moved to [[Minnesota]] after the 1960 season, setting up shop in [[Metropolitan Stadium]], while Washington fielded a brand new \"Washington Senators\" (which later became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] prior to the 1972 season).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/rang.shtml |title=Texas Rangers on Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSuccess came quickly to the team in Minnesota.

The \"TC\" remained on the Twins' caps until 1987, when they adopted new uniforms.

Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team (the Twins had been sharing tenancy in stadiums with the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Minnesota Vikings]] since 1961). The team was rumored to contemplate moving to such places as [[New Jersey]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Portland, Oregon]], the [[Piedmont Triad|Greensboro/Winston-Salem, North Carolina area]], and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]] franchise) for [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|elimination]] due to their financial weakness relative to other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to relocate, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.\n\n===Target Field===\n{{Main|Target Field}}\n[[Image:Target Field April 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Target Field]] in 2010.]]\nIn response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadium\u2014 a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] of [[Central, Minneapolis|downtown Minneapolis]]\u2014 owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2010/04/01/17066/target_field_the_house_that_jerry_bell_willed_to_completion |last=Weiner |first=Jay |title=Target Field: 'The House That Jerry Bell Willed to Completion' |publisher=MinnPost |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Target Field]] was constructed at a cost of $544.4&nbsp;million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a $392&nbsp;million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of $185&nbsp;million provided by the [[Carl Pohlad|Pohlad family]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/46497222.html |title=Editorial: Target Field built to exceed expectations |newspaper=Star Tribune |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Gordon |url=http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=/industriestrends/commercialrealestate/127061p1.aspx |title=The Coolest Ballpark in America |publisher=Twin Cities Business Magazine |date=March 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003105952/http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061p1.aspx |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for a long time to come.

The first regular season game in Target Field was played against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIN/MIN201004120.shtml |title=April 12, 2010 Boston Red Sox at Minnesota Twins Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2011, Target Field was named \"The Best Place To Shop\" by [[Street and Smith]]'s ''SportsBusiness Journal'' at the magazine's 2011 Sports Business Awards Ceremony in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/sports-business/2011/05/target-field-named-sports-facility-of.html |title=Target Field named Sports Facility of the Year |first=John |last=Vomhof, Jr. |publisher=Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> It was also named \"The Best Sports Stadium in North America\" by ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' in a ranking that included over 120 different stadiums, ballparks and arenas from around North America.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hart Van Denburg |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/07/espn_calls_trag.php |title=ESPN Magazine calls Target Field the best stadium in North America |newspaper=City Pages |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517133915/http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/07/espn_calls_trag.php |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2014, Target Field hosted the [[2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|85th Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] and the [[2014 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby|Home Run Derby]].\n\n==Roster==\n{{Minnesota Twins roster}}\n\n[[Minnesota Twins all-time roster]]: A complete list of players who played in at least one game for the Twins franchise.\n\n==Minor league affiliates==\n{{Main|List of Minnesota Twins minor league affiliates}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Level\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Team\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|League\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Location\n|-\n| ''AAA''\n| [[Rochester Red Wings]]\n| [[International League]]\n| [[Rochester, New York]]\n|-\n| ''AA''\n| [[Pensacola Blue Wahoos]]\n| [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]\n| [[Pensacola, Florida]]\n|-\n| ''Advanced A''\n| [[Fort Myers Mighty Mussels]]\n| [[Florida State League]]\n| [[Fort Myers, Florida]]\n|-\n| ''A''\n| [[Cedar Rapids Kernels]]\n| [[Midwest League]]\n| [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|''Rookie''\n| [[Elizabethton Twins]]\n| [[Appalachian League]]\n| [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]]\n|-\n| [[Gulf Coast League Twins|GCL Twins]]\n| [[Gulf Coast League]]\n| [[Fort Myers, Florida]]\n|-\n| Dominican Summer Twins|DSL Twins\n| [[Dominican Summer League]]\n| [[Dominican Republic]]\n|}\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Baseball Hall of Famers===\n{{Baseball hall of fame list\n|Current Team Name = Minnesota Twins\n| All Team Names = Twins or Senators\n| ColorA# = 002B5C\n| ColorB# = FFFFFF\n| ColorC# = D31145\n| ColorD# = FFFFFF\n| Team Name 1 = '''Washington Senators'''\n| List 1.1 = [[Stan Coveleski]]<br />[[Joe Cronin]]<br />[[Ed Delahanty]]\n| List 1.2 = [[Rick Ferrell]]<br />[[Lefty Gomez]]<br />'''[[Goose Goslin]]''' *\n| List 1.3 = [[Clark Griffith]] *<br />'''[[Bucky Harris]]''' *<br />[[Whitey Herzog]]<br />'''[[Walter Johnson]]''' *\n| List 1.4 = [[Heinie Manush]] *<br />'''[[Sam Rice]]''' *<br />[[Al Simmons]]\n| List 1.5 =[[George Sisler]]<br />[[Tris Speaker]]<br />[[Early Wynn]]\n| Team Name 2 = '''Minnesota Twins'''\n| List 2.1 = '''[[Bert Blyleven]]''' *\n| List 2.2 = '''[[Rod Carew]]''' *<br />[[Steve Carlton]]\n| List 2.3 = '''[[Harmon Killebrew]]''' *<br />[[Paul Molitor]]\n| List 2.4 = [[Jack Morris]]<br />'''[[Kirby Puckett]]''' *\n| List 2.5 = [[Jim Thome]]<br />[[Dave Winfield]]\n\n| Team Name 3 =\n| List 3.1 =\n| List 3.2 =\n| List 3.3 =\n| List 3.4 =\n| List 3.5 =\n| Team Name 4 =\n| List 4.1 =\n| List 4.2 =\n| List 4.3 =\n| List 4.4 =\n| List 4.5 =\n| Footnote1 = * Washington Senators or Minnesota Twins listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n| Footnote2 =\n| Footnote3 =\n| Footnote4 =\n|}}\nMolitor, Morris, and Winfield were all [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] natives who joined the Twins late in their careers and were warmly received as \"hometown heroes\", but were elected to the Hall primarily on the basis of their tenures with other teams.

Metrodome}}\n{{see also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\nThe Metrodome's upper deck in center and right fields was partly covered by a curtain containing banners of various titles won, and retired numbers. There was no acknowledgment of the Twins' prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. However Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961.\n\nPrior to the addition of the banners, the Twins acknowledged their retired numbers on the Metrodome's outfield fence. Harmon Killebrew's #3 was the first to be displayed, as it was the only one the team had retired when they moved in. It was joined by Rod Carew's #29 in 1987, Tony Oliva's #6 in 1991, Kent Hrbek's #14 in 1995, and Kirby Puckett's #34 in 1997 before the Twins began hanging the banners to reduce capacity. The championships, meanwhile were marked on the \"Baggie\" in right field.\n\n{{retired number list|\n{{retired number|image=HarmonKillebrewTwins.png|name=[[Harmon Killebrew|Harmon<br />Killebrew]]|pos=LF-1B-3B|date=<br />May 4, 1975}}\n{{retired number|image=TonyOilvaTwins.png|name=[[Tony Oliva|Tony<br />Oliva]]|pos=RF-DH-Coach|date=July 14, 1991}}\n{{retired number|image=JoeMauerTwins.png|name=[[Joe Mauer|Joe<br />Mauer]]|pos=C-1B|date=June 15, 2019}}\n{{retired number|image=TomKellyTwins.png|name=[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom<br />Kelly]]|pos=Manager|date=September 8, 2012}}\n{{retired number|image=KentHrbekTwins.png|name=[[Kent Hrbek|Kent<br />Hrbek]]|pos=1B|date=August 13, 1995}}\n{{retired number|image=BertBlylevenTwins.png|name=[[Bert Blyleven|Bert<br />Blyleven]]|pos=P|date=July 16, 2011}}\n{{retired number|image=RodCarewTwins.png|name=[[Rod Carew|Rod<br />Carew]]|pos=1B-2B|date=July 19, 1987}}\n{{retired number|image=KirbyPuckett_Twins.png||name=[[Kirby Puckett|Kirby<br />Puckett]]|pos=CF|date=May 25, 1997}}\n{{retired number|image=Minnesota_Twins_42.png|name=[[Jackie Robinson|Jackie<br />Robinson]]|pos=All MLB|honored=April 15, 1997}}\n}}\n[[File:Target Field 04.12.2010 059 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Target Field retired number signs in 2010.]] In the Metrodome, the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers in the future. The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring Killebrew, the left field gate is Gate No. 6, honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 14, for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29, in tribute to Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett.\n\nThe numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the tower that serves as the Twins' executive offices in left field foul territory. The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly on masts at the back of the left field upper deck. Those pennants, along with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed.\n\n[[Jackie Robinson]]'s number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997 and formally honored by the Twins on May 23, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXxe3Gi8Ca4C&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=minnesota+jackie+robinson+%22May+23+1997%22&source=bl&ots=8DH_7ly1u2&sig=BT_fjk1Y8B-_Waus6CLJ6sGMxBw&hl=en&ei=r9alTviRBsmftwftoeSwBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Minnesota Sports Almanac|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref> Robinson's number was positioned to the left of the Twins numbers in both venues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Player!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Jersey!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Position!!style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Minnesota Twins|border=2}};\"|Date retired\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Harmon Killebrew]] || 3 || LF-1B-3B: 1954\u201360 (WAS)<br />LF-1B-3B: 1961\u201374 (MIN) || May 4, 1975\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Rod Carew]] || 29 || 1B-2B: 1967\u201378 (MIN) || July 19, 1987\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tony Oliva]] || 6 || RF-DH: 1962\u201376 (MIN)<br />Coach: 1976\u201378 (MIN)<br />Coach: 1985\u201391 (MIN) || July 14, 1991\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kent Hrbek]] || 14 || 1B: 1981\u201394 (MIN) || August 13, 1995\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Jackie Robinson]] || 42 || Retired by MLB || April 15, 1997\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kirby Puckett]] || 34 || CF: 1984\u201395 (MIN) || May 25, 1997\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Bert Blyleven]] || 28 || P: 1970\u201376 (MIN)<br />P: 1985\u201388 (MIN) || July 16, 2011\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom Kelly]] || 10 || Manager: 1986\u20132001 (MIN) || September 8, 2012\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Joe Mauer]] || 7 || C-1B-DH: 2004-2018 (MIN) || June 15, 2019\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats10.shtml|title=Retired Uniform Numbers in the American League by Baseball Almanac|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/retired_numbers.jsp|title=Retired Numbers|work=Minnesota Twins|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{main|Minnesota Twins award winners and league leaders}}\n\n==Team records==\n{{main|Minnesota Twins team records}}\n\n==Team seasons==\n{{main|List of Minnesota Twins seasons}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

No two bridges in the park are alike.<ref name=\"Reed McGee Mipaas\">[[Henry Hope Reed Jr.|Henry Hope Reed]], Robert M. McGee and Esther Mipaas. [https://www.echonyc.com/~parks/books/bridges.html ''The Bridges of Central Park.''] (Greensward Foundation) 1990.</ref> There were three types of bridges and arches constructed in Central Park. The spans across the sunken \"transverse\" roads that carry crosstown traffic below the park were made of natural-looking [[schist]], and are generally not counted as arches or bridges. \"Ornamental Bridges or Archways\" were larger spans integrated into the greater landscape and were made of [[brick]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], or [[cast iron]]. The final category, \"rustic\" bridges, were smaller stone or [[Trunk (botany)|log]] bridges and usually spanned small walkways or streams. Central Park had 39 bridges at its peak.\n\nThe bridges were devised as part of the [[Greensward Plan]], [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]'s proposal for Central Park. Most of the spans were built in the 1860s. By 1872, there were thirty-three spans; six more spans were built before the end of the 19th century. Three of the original 39 bridges were removed in the 1930s.<ref name=\"Schneider 1999\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Annual_report_of_the_Board_of_Commissioners_of_the_Central_Park_(1858)_(18247746199).jpg|thumb|A sketch of a planned bridge from the Central Park commission's 1858 report]]\n\n===Development of Central Park===\nBy the 1840s, members of the city's elite were publicly calling for the construction of a new large park in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar p. 23\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=23, 25}}</ref> At the time, Manhattan's seventeen squares comprised a combined {{Convert|165|acre|ha|abbr=}} of land,<ref>{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=18\u201319}}</ref> constituting less than one percent of Manhattan's total area.<ref name=\"Kinkead pp. 11-12\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Kinkead|1990|pages=11&ndash;13}}</ref> An initial bill to acquire [[Jones's Wood]], a {{Convert|160|acre|ha|abbr=|adj=on}} tract of land on the [[Upper East Side]], was nullified in 1851,<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar p. 452\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|page=45}}</ref> and a subsequent bill to approve the purchase of Jones's Wood was also defeated in 1854.<ref name=\"Kinkead p. 162\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Kinkead|1990|page=16}}</ref><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 51-532\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=51\u201353}}</ref> The second possible site for a large public park was a {{convert|750|acre|ha|adj=on}} area labeled [[Central Park]], which was bounded by 59th and 106th Streets between Fifth and Eighth Avenues.<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar p. 452\"/><ref name=\"Heckscher pp. 12, 14\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Heckscher|2008|pages=12, 14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=1851|title=First Annual Report|work=Board of Commissioners of Central Park}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1853, the New York State Legislature passed the Central Park Act, authorizing the purchase of the present-day site of Central Park.<ref name=\"Kinkead p. 162\"/><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 51-532\"/> The initial plans for Central Park were devised by [[Egbert Ludovicus Viele]], who had devised unofficial plans for the park in 1853.<ref name=\"Kinkead p. 18\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Kinkead|1990|page=18}}</ref><ref name=\"Heckscher p. 18\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Heckscher|2008|page=18}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30200811/|title=The Central Park; The Work to be Commenced Immediately|date=June 5, 1856|work=New York Herald|access-date=March 30, 2019|page=1|via=Newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref> However, Viele's plan was disregarded by the Central Park commission,<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 102-103\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"Heckscher p. 202\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Heckscher|2008|page=20}}</ref>  who started a landscape design contest in April 1857 to find a suitable design for the park.<ref name=\"Heckscher p. 202\"/><ref name=\"Kinkead pp. 24-252\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Kinkead|1990|pages=24&ndash;25}}</ref><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar p. 110\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1850_compete.html|title=The Design Competition|work=CentralParkHistory.com|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance of Greensward Plan===\nCentral Park superintendent [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] worked with [[Calvert Vaux]] to create the \"[[Greensward Plan]]\", which was eventually decided as the winner of the contest.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1858/04/30/archives/the-central-park-plans.html|title=The Central Park Plans.|date=1858-04-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 117-120\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=117\u2013120}}</ref><ref name=\"Heckscher pp. 23-24\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Heckscher|2008|pages=23\u201324}}</ref> The Greensward Plan distinguished itself from many of the other designs in the contest by including four sunken \"transverse\" roadways, which carried crosstown traffic through Central Park and were not intended to be seen or heard from the rest of the park.<ref name=\"Kinkead pp. 24-252\"/><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 130-135\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=130\u2013135}}</ref><ref name=\"Heckscher p. 27\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Heckscher|2008|page=27}}</ref> The transverse roadways were the most difficult to construct, as they were to run below the rest of the park, but engineer J.

[https://www.echonyc.com/~parks/books/bridges.html ''The Bridges of Central Park.''] (Greensward Foundation) 1990.</ref> There were three types of bridges and arches constructed in Central Park. The spans across the sunken \"transverse\" roads that carry crosstown traffic below the park were made of natural-looking [[schist]], and are generally not counted as arches or bridges. \"Ornamental Bridges or Archways\" were larger spans integrated into the greater landscape and were made of [[brick]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], or [[cast iron]]. The final category, \"rustic\" bridges, were smaller stone or [[Trunk (botany)|log]] bridges and usually spanned small walkways or streams. Central Park had 39 bridges at its peak.\n\nThe bridges were devised as part of the [[Greensward Plan]], [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]'s proposal for Central Park. Most of the spans were built in the 1860s. By 1872, there were thirty-three spans; six more spans were built before the end of the 19th century. Three of the original 39 bridges were removed in the 1930s.<ref name=\"Schneider 1999\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Annual_report_of_the_Board_of_Commissioners_of_the_Central_Park_(1858)_(18247746199).jpg|thumb|A sketch of a planned bridge from the Central Park commission's 1858 report]]\n\n===Development of Central Park===\nBy the 1840s, members of the city's elite were publicly calling for the construction of a new large park in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar p. 23\">{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=23, 25}}</ref> At the time, Manhattan's seventeen squares comprised a combined {{Convert|165|acre|ha|abbr=}} of land,<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=18\u201319}}</ref> constituting less than one percent of Manhattan's total area.<ref name=\"Kinkead pp. 11-12\">{{harvnb|Kinkead|1990|pages=11&ndash;13}}</ref> An initial bill to acquire [[Jones's Wood]], a {{Convert|160|acre|ha|abbr=|adj=on}} tract of land on the [[Upper East Side]], was nullified in 1851,<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar p. 452\">{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|page=45}}</ref> and a subsequent bill to approve the purchase of Jones's Wood was also defeated in 1854.<ref name=\"Kinkead p. 162\">{{harvnb|Kinkead|1990|page=16}}</ref><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 51-532\">{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=51\u201353}}</ref> The second possible site for a large public park was a {{convert|750|acre|ha|adj=on}} area labeled [[Central Park]], which was bounded by 59th and 106th Streets between Fifth and Eighth Avenues.<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar p. 452\"/><ref name=\"Heckscher pp. 12, 14\">{{harvnb|Heckscher|2008|pages=12, 14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=1851|title=First Annual Report|work=Board of Commissioners of Central Park}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1853, the New York State Legislature passed the Central Park Act, authorizing the purchase of the present-day site of Central Park.<ref name=\"Kinkead p. 162\"/><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 51-532\"/> The initial plans for Central Park were devised by [[Egbert Ludovicus Viele]], who had devised unofficial plans for the park in 1853.<ref name=\"Kinkead p. 18\">{{harvnb|Kinkead|1990|page=18}}</ref><ref name=\"Heckscher p. 18\">{{harvnb|Heckscher|2008|page=18}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30200811/|title=The Central Park; The Work to be Commenced Immediately|date=June 5, 1856|work=New York Herald|access-date=March 30, 2019|page=1|via=Newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref> However, Viele's plan was disregarded by the Central Park commission,<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 102-103\">{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"Heckscher p. 202\">{{harvnb|Heckscher|2008|page=20}}</ref>  who started a landscape design contest in April 1857 to find a suitable design for the park.<ref name=\"Heckscher p. 202\"/><ref name=\"Kinkead pp. 24-252\">{{harvnb|Kinkead|1990|pages=24&ndash;25}}</ref><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar p. 110\">{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1850_compete.html|title=The Design Competition|work=CentralParkHistory.com|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance of Greensward Plan===\nCentral Park superintendent [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] worked with [[Calvert Vaux]] to create the \"[[Greensward Plan]]\", which was eventually decided as the winner of the contest.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1858/04/30/archives/the-central-park-plans.html|title=The Central Park Plans.|date=1858-04-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 117-120\">{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=117\u2013120}}</ref><ref name=\"Heckscher pp. 23-24\">{{harvnb|Heckscher|2008|pages=23\u201324}}</ref> The Greensward Plan distinguished itself from many of the other designs in the contest by including four sunken \"transverse\" roadways, which carried crosstown traffic through Central Park and were not intended to be seen or heard from the rest of the park.<ref name=\"Kinkead pp. 24-252\"/><ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 130-135\">{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=130\u2013135}}</ref><ref name=\"Heckscher p. 27\">{{harvnb|Heckscher|2008|page=27}}</ref> The transverse roadways were the most difficult to construct, as they were to run below the rest of the park, but engineer J.

While MOPME is involved in formulation of policies, the responsibility of implementation rests with the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) headed by a Director General. The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) and its subordinate offices in the district and [[upazila]] are solely responsible for management and supervision of primary education. Their responsibilities include recruitment, posting, and transfer of teachers and other staff; arranging in-service training of teachers; distribution of free textbooks; and supervision of schools. The responsibility of school construction, repair and supply of school furniture lies with the DPE executed through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). The National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) is responsible for the development of curriculum and production of textbooks. While the Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for formulation of policies, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) under the Ministry of Education is responsible for implementing the same at secondary and higher education levels. The NCTB is responsible for developing curriculum and publishing standard textbooks.\n\nThe Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations:\n* [[Primary Education Certificate]] (PEC) ([[Fifth grade|5 grade]])\n* [[Junior School Certificate]] (JSC) ([[Eighth grade|8th grade]])\n\n===Secondary education===\n{{main|High Schools in Bangladesh}}\nThe secondary level of education is controlled by the eight General Education boards:\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Barisal|Barisal Education Board]] for [[Barisal Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Chittagong|Chittagong Education Board]] for [[Chittagong Division]] \n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Comilla|Comilla Education Board]] for [[Comilla Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka|Dhaka Education Board]] for [[Dhaka Division]] \n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dinajpur|Dinajpur Education Board]] for [[Rangpur Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Jessore|Jessore Education Board]] for [[Khulna Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Mymensingh|Mymensingh Education Board]] for [[Mymensingh Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Rajshahi|Rajshahi Education Board]] for [[Rajshahi Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Sylhet|Sylhet Education Board]] for [[Sylhet Division]]\n\nThe boards' headquarters are located in [[Barishal]], [[Comilla]] [[Chittagong]], [[Dhaka]], [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]] [[Jessore District|Jessore]], [[Rajshahi]] and [[Sylhet]].\n\nEight region-based Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations:\n* [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) ([[Tenth grade|10th grade]])\n* [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) ([[Twelfth grade|12th grade]])\n\nAt the school level, in the case of non-government secondary schools, School Management Committees (SMC), and at the intermediate college level, in the case of non-government colleges, Governing Bodies (GB), formed as per government directives, are responsible for mobilising resources, approving budgets, controlling expenditures, and appointing and disciplining staff. While teachers of non-government secondary schools are recruited by concerned SMCs observing relevant government rules, teachers of government secondary schools are recruited centrally by the DSHE through a competitive examination.\n\nIn government secondary schools, there is not an SMC. The headmaster is solely responsible for running the school and is supervised by the deputy director of the respective zone.

Course duration ranges from one month to four years. The [[Technical Education Board]] controls technical and vocational training in the secondary level.\n\nThe Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) is responsible for the planning, development, and implementation of technical and vocational education in the country. Curriculum is implemented by BTEB. In the Technical Education System, after obtaining a Diploma-in-Engineering degree (four-year curriculum) from the institutes listed below, students can further pursue their educational career by obtaining a bachelor's degree from Engineering & Technology Universities. It normally it takes an additional two and a half to three years of coursework to obtain a bachelor's degree, although some students take more than three years to do so. They can then enroll in post-graduate studies. Students can also study CA (Chartered Accounting) after passing HSC or bachelor's degree and subject to fulfilling the entry criteria of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB).\n\n*[[BCMC College of Engineering & Technology]] - ISO certified & the largest private engineering college in Bangladesh, situated in Jessore.\n*Comilla Polytechnic Institute- It's founded 1962.

These schools in Bangladesh follow the General Certificate of Education (GCE) syllabus where students are prepared for taking their Ordinary Level (O Level) and Advanced Level (A Level) examinations. The General Certificate of Education system is one of the most internationally recognised qualifications, based in the United Kingdom. The Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations are English equivalent to the [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) and [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) examinations respectively. Most students sit for these exams from the registered schools in Bangladesh who follow the GCE syllabus. Those who do not attend a school that follows the GCE syllabus may also sit for their Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations from the British Council. These examinations are conducted under the supervision of the British Council in Bangladesh. The GCE examination conducted by the British Council takes place twice a year. Currently there are two boards operating from Bangladesh for Ordinary and Advanced Level Examinations, which are Edexcel and University of Cambridge International Examinations.\nBangladesh has recently opened [[English version schools (Bangladesh)|English version schools]] translating board textbooks in English. In recent years national language policy has given top priority to English language education in Bangladesh <ref>https://rdcu.be/bFJXM</ref>\n\n===Madrasah education===\nThe [[Madrasah]] Education System focuses on religious education, teaching all the basics of education in a religious environment. Religious studies are taught in [[Arabic]] and the students in some areas also serve the local area [[masjid]]s. Students also have to complete all the courses from the General Education System. Many privately licensed Madrasas take in homeless children and provide them with food, shelter and education, e.g. [[Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah]] in Sylhet.\nIn the Madrasah Education System there are two systems:\n\nOne, called the \"Quomi\" Madrasah system is privately owned and funded<ref name=\"Mumtaz2007\">{{cite book |author1=Ahmad, Mumtaz |year=2007 |chapter=Islam, state, and society in Bangladesh |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-8HrM55XfgC&pg=PA56 |editor=Esposito, John |editor2=Voll, John |editor3=Bakar, Osman |title=Asian Islam in the 21st Century |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=56 |isbn=978-0-19-804421-5}}</ref> and is run according to the Deobandi system of Islamic education, which rejects the rational sciences.<ref name=\"Tan2014\">{{cite book |editor=Tan, Charlene |year=2014 |title=Reforms in Islamic Education: International Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bMAAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT91 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |location=New York |page=91 |isbn=978-1-4411-0134-1}}</ref>\n\nThe other, called the \"Alia\" madrasah system, is privately owned but subsidised by the government (the government spends 11.5% of its education budget on alia madrasahs, paying 80% of teacher and administrator salaries).<ref name=\"Mumtaz2007\" /> Quomi madrasahs account for 1.9% of total primary enrollment and 2.2% of secondary enrollment; aliyah madrasahs account for 8.4% of primary and 19% of secondary enrollment.<ref name=\"DavisMiroshnikova2013\">{{cite book |author=Alam, Mahmadul |author2=A.T.M Shaifullah Mehedi |author3=Nehraz Mahmud |year=2013 |chapter= Religious education in Bangladesh |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyfnbXzdpZMC&pg=PA48|editor=Davis, Derek |editor2=Miroshnikova, Elena |title=The Routledge International Handbook of Religious Education |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-1-136-25641-7|pages=48\u201349}}</ref> The alia system is like the general education system, except that Arabic is taught in addition to general education.

After passing successfully, they can further enroll for another 2 years to obtain a \"Kamil\" level degree. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe following table provides a statistical comparison of the \"Quomi\" and \"Alia\" madrasah systems.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahmad |first=Mumtaz |year=2004 |chapter=Madrassa Education in Pakistan and Bangladesh |chapter-url=http://apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/ReligiousRadicalism/PagesfromReligiousRadicalismandSecurityinSouthAsiach5.pdf |editor1-last=Limaye |editor1-first=Satu P. |editor2-last=Wirsing |editor2-first=Robert C. |editor3-last=Malik |editor3-first=Mohan |title=Religious radicalism and security in South Asia |location=Honolulu |publisher=Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies |page=107 |isbn=978-1-234-28935-5}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n!

UNICEF runs approximately 1,600 learning centers across the country, educating around 145,000 children.<ref name=\"AJE\">{{cite news |title='Great news': Bangladesh allows education for Rohingya children |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/news-bangladesh-education-rohingya-children-200130061617667.html |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |first=Saba |last=Aziz |first2=Faisal |last2=Mahmud |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> Beginning in April 2020, [[UNICEF]] and the Government of Bangladesh will enroll 10,000 Rohingya children in schools where they will be taught the Myanmar school curriculum.<ref name=\"AJE\"/>\n\n==Grading system in Bangladesh==\nIn Bangladesh, grades equal or above 33% (or one third) is considered as a passing grade. Although by no means it is considered as a good grade.\nSince the education system of Bangladesh is completely controlled by the government up to higher secondary level (or grade 12), the grading system up to this point is more or less the same. For each subject, grades are converted in to '''grade points (GP)''' and are summed up and dived by the total number of subjects and thus is called '''Grade Point Average (GPA)'''. The highest achievable GPA is '''5.0'''. There is also a term called '''Letter Grade (LG)''' that indicates a range of '''GPA''' for total result or a single '''GP''' for a single subject. The grading system is shown below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:center;\"\n|+ Letter Grade System of Individual [http://www.educationboard.gov.bd/grads.htm Subject]\n!Class interval\n!Grade Point\n!Letter Grade\n|-\n|100-80\n|5\n|A+\n|-\n|79 -70\n|4\n|A\n|-\n|69 - 60\n|3.5\n|A-\n|-\n|59 - 50\n|3\n|B\n|-\n|49 -40\n|2\n|C\n|-\n|39 - 33\n|1\n|D\n|-\n|32 - 0\n|0\n|F\n|}\n\nHowever, in Secondary and Higher Secondary Level, a 4th subject or optional subject system is introduced. Although failing in the 4th subject will not be judged as a failure for the whole, Doing good in it can contribute to gain additional grade points. The additional grade points received is simply (GP in 4th subject) - 2. While counting GPA the algorithm can be simply written as\n\n=== <math>GPA = \\tfrac{TGP+OGP}{N}</math> ===\nHere, TGP is the total Grade EPoints gained in subjects other than optional. OGP is the additional GP gained in 4th subject. And N is the number of total subjects of course without optional.\n\nNote that GPA cannot be above 5. and Additional GP gained from the optional subject will not be counted if the GP of the subject is less than or equal to 2.\nGaining a GPA of 5.0 or A+ is naturally considered as a good result. However, since a student can gain grade far above the required 80% to receive a GPA of 5.0, the actual grades received in each subject is also included in the official mark sheets given by the education board for PSC, SSC and HSC exams. There is also an unofficial term called Golden A+ which means receiving A+ in all subjects, since a student can receive a perfect GPA also without gaining more than 80% marks in all subjects thanks to the 4th subject system.\n\n==Non-formal education==\nThere exists a substantial number of NGO-run non-formal schools, catering mainly to the drop-outs of the government and non-government primary schools. Very few NGOs, however, impart education for the full five-year primary education cycle. Because of this, on completion of their two-to-three-year non-formal primary education in NGO-run schools, students normally re-enter into government/non-government primary schools at higher classes.\n\nThere are Non-Governmental Schools (NGO) and Non-Formal Education Centers (NFE) and many of these are funded by the government. The largest NFE program is the much reputed [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] program. However, not all NFE graduates continue on to secondary school.\n\nNGO-run schools differ from other non-government private schools. While the private schools operate like private enterprises often guided by commercial interests, NGO schools operate mainly in areas not served either by the government or private schools, essentially to meet the educational needs of vulnerable groups in the society. They usually follow an informal approach to suit the special needs of children from these vulnerable groups. But nowadays, some NGO schools are operating into places where there are both private and government schools.\n\nSimilarly, in NGO-run schools there does not exist any SMC. The style of management differs depending upon differences in policies pursued by different NGOs. Some are centrally managed within a highly bureaucratic set-up, while others enjoy considerable autonomy.\n\nDifferent NGOs pursue different policies regarding recruitment of teachers. Some prepare a panel of prospective teachers on the basis of a rigorous test and recruit teachers from this panel. Other NGOs recruit teachers rather informally from locally available interested persons.\n\n==Current Issues==\n[[File:10 years old Dipa and 12 years old Laboni study in class 2 at \"Unique Child learning Center\", Mirmur-Dhaka, Bangladesh.jpg|thumbnail|Girls studying at the Unique Child Learning Center in Mirpur-Dhaka]]\nCurrent government projects to promote the education of children in Bangladesh include compulsory primary education for all, free education for girls up to grade 10,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} stipends for female students, a nationwide integrated education system and a food-for-education literacy movement. A large section of the country's national budget is set aside to help put these programs into action and to promote education and make it more accessible. Recent years have seen these efforts pay off and the Bangladesh education system is strides ahead of what it was only a few years ago. Now even national curriculum books from class 5 to class 12 are distributed freely among all students and schools.\n\nThe educational system of Bangladesh faces several problems. In the past, Bangladesh education was primarily a British modelled upper class affair with all courses given in English and very little being done for the common people. The Bangladesh education board has taken steps to leave such practices in the past and is looking forward to education as a way to provide a poverty-stricken nation with a brighter future.<!-- \"In the past\" refers to what approximate time period?  100 years ago?  20 years ago?  I guess 1947 -->\nAs Bangladesh is an overpopulated country, there is a huge demand to turn its population into labour, which is why proper education is needed and proper help from government in the educational sectors of Bangladesh is crucial.\n\n===Education expenditure as percentage of GDP===\nPublic expenditure on education lies on the fringes of 2 percent of GDP with a minimum of 0.94 percent in 1980 and a maximum of 2.2 percent in 2007.<ref>[http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Bangladesh/Education_spending/ Education Spending, Bangladesh, at theglobaleconomy.com] Accessed 26 April 2017</ref>\n\n===Qualitative dimension===\nThe Education system lacks a sound Human Resource Development and deployment system<ref>Sedere, Upali M.

Poverty is a big threat to primary education. In Bangladesh, the population is very high. The number of seats available in colleges is less than the number of students who want to enroll, and the number of seats available in universities is also less than the number of students who passed higher secondary level and want to join in a university. Besides, the cost of education is increasing day by day, as a result many students are unable to afford it.\n\nOne study found a 15.5% primary school teacher absence rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSOUTHASIA/Resources/Roll_Call_Teacher_Absence_Bangladesh.pdf|title=Roll Call: Teacher Absence in Bangladesh|year=2004|publisher=Site resources.world bank.org|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Gender disparity===\nIn Bangladesh, gender discrimination in education occurs amongst the rural households but is non-existent amongst rich households.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huq |first1=Molla |last2=Rahman |first2=Pk Md.

The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) and its subordinate offices in the district and [[upazila]] are solely responsible for management and supervision of primary education. Their responsibilities include recruitment, posting, and transfer of teachers and other staff; arranging in-service training of teachers; distribution of free textbooks; and supervision of schools. The responsibility of school construction, repair and supply of school furniture lies with the DPE executed through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). The National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) is responsible for the development of curriculum and production of textbooks. While the Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for formulation of policies, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) under the Ministry of Education is responsible for implementing the same at secondary and higher education levels. The NCTB is responsible for developing curriculum and publishing standard textbooks.\n\nThe Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations:\n* [[Primary Education Certificate]] (PEC) ([[Fifth grade|5 grade]])\n* [[Junior School Certificate]] (JSC) ([[Eighth grade|8th grade]])\n\n===Secondary education===\n{{main|High Schools in Bangladesh}}\nThe secondary level of education is controlled by the eight General Education boards:\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Barisal|Barisal Education Board]] for [[Barisal Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Chittagong|Chittagong Education Board]] for [[Chittagong Division]] \n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Comilla|Comilla Education Board]] for [[Comilla Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka|Dhaka Education Board]] for [[Dhaka Division]] \n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dinajpur|Dinajpur Education Board]] for [[Rangpur Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Jessore|Jessore Education Board]] for [[Khulna Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Mymensingh|Mymensingh Education Board]] for [[Mymensingh Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Rajshahi|Rajshahi Education Board]] for [[Rajshahi Division]]\n* [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Sylhet|Sylhet Education Board]] for [[Sylhet Division]]\n\nThe boards' headquarters are located in [[Barishal]], [[Comilla]] [[Chittagong]], [[Dhaka]], [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]] [[Jessore District|Jessore]], [[Rajshahi]] and [[Sylhet]].\n\nEight region-based Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations:\n* [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) ([[Tenth grade|10th grade]])\n* [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) ([[Twelfth grade|12th grade]])\n\nAt the school level, in the case of non-government secondary schools, School Management Committees (SMC), and at the intermediate college level, in the case of non-government colleges, Governing Bodies (GB), formed as per government directives, are responsible for mobilising resources, approving budgets, controlling expenditures, and appointing and disciplining staff. While teachers of non-government secondary schools are recruited by concerned SMCs observing relevant government rules, teachers of government secondary schools are recruited centrally by the DSHE through a competitive examination.\n\nIn government secondary schools, there is not an SMC. The headmaster is solely responsible for running the school and is supervised by the deputy director of the respective zone. Parent Teachers Associations (PTAs), however, exist to ensure a better teaching and learning environment.\n\n===Tertiary education===\n{{Further|Universities in Bangladesh|University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)}}\n{{See also|List of universities in Bangladesh|List of medical colleges in Bangladesh}}\n\n[[File:NSU-Front_View_by_xergone.jpg|thumb|Front view of [[North South University]](NSU).

BUET is regarded as one of the best universities for engineering education in Bangladesh]]\n\nAt the tertiary level, universities are regulated by the [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]]. The colleges providing tertiary education are under the National University. Each of the medical colleges is affiliated with a public university. Universities in Bangladesh are autonomous bodies administered by statutory bodies such as Syndicate, Senate, Academic Council, etc. in accordance with provisions laid down in their respective acts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Private_University |title=Private University |website=Banglapedia |access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=University_Grants_Commission |title=University Grants Commission |website=Banglapedia |access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Technical and vocational education===\n\nThe Technical and Vocational Education System provides courses related to various applied and practical areas of science, technology and engineering, or focuses on a specific specialized area. Course duration ranges from one month to four years. The [[Technical Education Board]] controls technical and vocational training in the secondary level.\n\nThe Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) is responsible for the planning, development, and implementation of technical and vocational education in the country. Curriculum is implemented by BTEB. In the Technical Education System, after obtaining a Diploma-in-Engineering degree (four-year curriculum) from the institutes listed below, students can further pursue their educational career by obtaining a bachelor's degree from Engineering & Technology Universities. It normally it takes an additional two and a half to three years of coursework to obtain a bachelor's degree, although some students take more than three years to do so. They can then enroll in post-graduate studies. Students can also study CA (Chartered Accounting) after passing HSC or bachelor's degree and subject to fulfilling the entry criteria of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB).\n\n*[[BCMC College of Engineering & Technology]] - ISO certified & the largest private engineering college in Bangladesh, situated in Jessore.\n*Comilla Polytechnic Institute- It's founded 1962.

These schools in Bangladesh follow the General Certificate of Education (GCE) syllabus where students are prepared for taking their Ordinary Level (O Level) and Advanced Level (A Level) examinations. The General Certificate of Education system is one of the most internationally recognised qualifications, based in the United Kingdom. The Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations are English equivalent to the [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) and [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) examinations respectively. Most students sit for these exams from the registered schools in Bangladesh who follow the GCE syllabus. Those who do not attend a school that follows the GCE syllabus may also sit for their Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations from the British Council. These examinations are conducted under the supervision of the British Council in Bangladesh. The GCE examination conducted by the British Council takes place twice a year. Currently there are two boards operating from Bangladesh for Ordinary and Advanced Level Examinations, which are Edexcel and University of Cambridge International Examinations.\nBangladesh has recently opened [[English version schools (Bangladesh)|English version schools]] translating board textbooks in English. In recent years national language policy has given top priority to English language education in Bangladesh <ref>https://rdcu.be/bFJXM</ref>\n\n===Madrasah education===\nThe [[Madrasah]] Education System focuses on religious education, teaching all the basics of education in a religious environment. Religious studies are taught in [[Arabic]] and the students in some areas also serve the local area [[masjid]]s. Students also have to complete all the courses from the General Education System. Many privately licensed Madrasas take in homeless children and provide them with food, shelter and education, e.g. [[Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah]] in Sylhet.\nIn the Madrasah Education System there are two systems:\n\nOne, called the \"Quomi\" Madrasah system is privately owned and funded<ref name=\"Mumtaz2007\">{{cite book |author1=Ahmad, Mumtaz |year=2007 |chapter=Islam, state, and society in Bangladesh |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-8HrM55XfgC&pg=PA56 |editor=Esposito, John |editor2=Voll, John |editor3=Bakar, Osman |title=Asian Islam in the 21st Century |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=56 |isbn=978-0-19-804421-5}}</ref> and is run according to the Deobandi system of Islamic education, which rejects the rational sciences.<ref name=\"Tan2014\">{{cite book |editor=Tan, Charlene |year=2014 |title=Reforms in Islamic Education: International Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bMAAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT91 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |location=New York |page=91 |isbn=978-1-4411-0134-1}}</ref>\n\nThe other, called the \"Alia\" madrasah system, is privately owned but subsidised by the government (the government spends 11.5% of its education budget on alia madrasahs, paying 80% of teacher and administrator salaries).<ref name=\"Mumtaz2007\" /> Quomi madrasahs account for 1.9% of total primary enrollment and 2.2% of secondary enrollment; aliyah madrasahs account for 8.4% of primary and 19% of secondary enrollment.<ref name=\"DavisMiroshnikova2013\">{{cite book |author=Alam, Mahmadul |author2=A.T.M Shaifullah Mehedi |author3=Nehraz Mahmud |year=2013 |chapter= Religious education in Bangladesh |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyfnbXzdpZMC&pg=PA48|editor=Davis, Derek |editor2=Miroshnikova, Elena |title=The Routledge International Handbook of Religious Education |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-1-136-25641-7|pages=48\u201349}}</ref> The alia system is like the general education system, except that Arabic is taught in addition to general education. The [[Madrasah Education Board]] covers religious education in government-registered Madrasahs in the secondary level. After passing \"Alim\", a student can enroll for 3 additional years to obtain a \"Fazil\" level. Students can go for further general education and earn a university degree. After passing successfully, they can further enroll for another 2 years to obtain a \"Kamil\" level degree. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe following table provides a statistical comparison of the \"Quomi\" and \"Alia\" madrasah systems.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahmad |first=Mumtaz |year=2004 |chapter=Madrassa Education in Pakistan and Bangladesh |chapter-url=http://apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/ReligiousRadicalism/PagesfromReligiousRadicalismandSecurityinSouthAsiach5.pdf |editor1-last=Limaye |editor1-first=Satu P. |editor2-last=Wirsing |editor2-first=Robert C. |editor3-last=Malik |editor3-first=Mohan |title=Religious radicalism and security in South Asia |location=Honolulu |publisher=Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies |page=107 |isbn=978-1-234-28935-5}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n!

UNICEF runs approximately 1,600 learning centers across the country, educating around 145,000 children.<ref name=\"AJE\">{{cite news |title='Great news': Bangladesh allows education for Rohingya children |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/news-bangladesh-education-rohingya-children-200130061617667.html |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |first=Saba |last=Aziz |first2=Faisal |last2=Mahmud |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> Beginning in April 2020, [[UNICEF]] and the Government of Bangladesh will enroll 10,000 Rohingya children in schools where they will be taught the Myanmar school curriculum.<ref name=\"AJE\"/>\n\n==Grading system in Bangladesh==\nIn Bangladesh, grades equal or above 33% (or one third) is considered as a passing grade. Although by no means it is considered as a good grade.\nSince the education system of Bangladesh is completely controlled by the government up to higher secondary level (or grade 12), the grading system up to this point is more or less the same. For each subject, grades are converted in to '''grade points (GP)''' and are summed up and dived by the total number of subjects and thus is called '''Grade Point Average (GPA)'''. The highest achievable GPA is '''5.0'''. There is also a term called '''Letter Grade (LG)''' that indicates a range of '''GPA''' for total result or a single '''GP''' for a single subject. The grading system is shown below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:center;\"\n|+ Letter Grade System of Individual [http://www.educationboard.gov.bd/grads.htm Subject]\n!Class interval\n!Grade Point\n!Letter Grade\n|-\n|100-80\n|5\n|A+\n|-\n|79 -70\n|4\n|A\n|-\n|69 - 60\n|3.5\n|A-\n|-\n|59 - 50\n|3\n|B\n|-\n|49 -40\n|2\n|C\n|-\n|39 - 33\n|1\n|D\n|-\n|32 - 0\n|0\n|F\n|}\n\nHowever, in Secondary and Higher Secondary Level, a 4th subject or optional subject system is introduced. Although failing in the 4th subject will not be judged as a failure for the whole, Doing good in it can contribute to gain additional grade points. The additional grade points received is simply (GP in 4th subject) - 2. While counting GPA the algorithm can be simply written as\n\n=== <math>GPA = \\tfrac{TGP+OGP}{N}</math> ===\nHere, TGP is the total Grade EPoints gained in subjects other than optional. OGP is the additional GP gained in 4th subject. And N is the number of total subjects of course without optional.\n\nNote that GPA cannot be above 5. and Additional GP gained from the optional subject will not be counted if the GP of the subject is less than or equal to 2.\nGaining a GPA of 5.0 or A+ is naturally considered as a good result. However, since a student can gain grade far above the required 80% to receive a GPA of 5.0, the actual grades received in each subject is also included in the official mark sheets given by the education board for PSC, SSC and HSC exams. There is also an unofficial term called Golden A+ which means receiving A+ in all subjects, since a student can receive a perfect GPA also without gaining more than 80% marks in all subjects thanks to the 4th subject system.\n\n==Non-formal education==\nThere exists a substantial number of NGO-run non-formal schools, catering mainly to the drop-outs of the government and non-government primary schools. Very few NGOs, however, impart education for the full five-year primary education cycle. Because of this, on completion of their two-to-three-year non-formal primary education in NGO-run schools, students normally re-enter into government/non-government primary schools at higher classes.\n\nThere are Non-Governmental Schools (NGO) and Non-Formal Education Centers (NFE) and many of these are funded by the government. The largest NFE program is the much reputed [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] program. However, not all NFE graduates continue on to secondary school.\n\nNGO-run schools differ from other non-government private schools. While the private schools operate like private enterprises often guided by commercial interests, NGO schools operate mainly in areas not served either by the government or private schools, essentially to meet the educational needs of vulnerable groups in the society. They usually follow an informal approach to suit the special needs of children from these vulnerable groups. But nowadays, some NGO schools are operating into places where there are both private and government schools.\n\nSimilarly, in NGO-run schools there does not exist any SMC. The style of management differs depending upon differences in policies pursued by different NGOs. Some are centrally managed within a highly bureaucratic set-up, while others enjoy considerable autonomy.\n\nDifferent NGOs pursue different policies regarding recruitment of teachers. Some prepare a panel of prospective teachers on the basis of a rigorous test and recruit teachers from this panel. Other NGOs recruit teachers rather informally from locally available interested persons.\n\n==Current Issues==\n[[File:10 years old Dipa and 12 years old Laboni study in class 2 at \"Unique Child learning Center\", Mirmur-Dhaka, Bangladesh.jpg|thumbnail|Girls studying at the Unique Child Learning Center in Mirpur-Dhaka]]\nCurrent government projects to promote the education of children in Bangladesh include compulsory primary education for all, free education for girls up to grade 10,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} stipends for female students, a nationwide integrated education system and a food-for-education literacy movement. A large section of the country's national budget is set aside to help put these programs into action and to promote education and make it more accessible. Recent years have seen these efforts pay off and the Bangladesh education system is strides ahead of what it was only a few years ago. Now even national curriculum books from class 5 to class 12 are distributed freely among all students and schools.\n\nThe educational system of Bangladesh faces several problems. In the past, Bangladesh education was primarily a British modelled upper class affair with all courses given in English and very little being done for the common people. The Bangladesh education board has taken steps to leave such practices in the past and is looking forward to education as a way to provide a poverty-stricken nation with a brighter future.<!-- \"In the past\" refers to what approximate time period?  100 years ago?  20 years ago?  I guess 1947 -->\nAs Bangladesh is an overpopulated country, there is a huge demand to turn its population into labour, which is why proper education is needed and proper help from government in the educational sectors of Bangladesh is crucial.\n\n===Education expenditure as percentage of GDP===\nPublic expenditure on education lies on the fringes of 2 percent of GDP with a minimum of 0.94 percent in 1980 and a maximum of 2.2 percent in 2007.<ref>[http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Bangladesh/Education_spending/ Education Spending, Bangladesh, at theglobaleconomy.com] Accessed 26 April 2017</ref>\n\n===Qualitative dimension===\nThe Education system lacks a sound Human Resource Development and deployment system<ref>Sedere, Upali M.

Poverty is a big threat to primary education. In Bangladesh, the population is very high. The number of seats available in colleges is less than the number of students who want to enroll, and the number of seats available in universities is also less than the number of students who passed higher secondary level and want to join in a university. Besides, the cost of education is increasing day by day, as a result many students are unable to afford it.\n\nOne study found a 15.5% primary school teacher absence rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSOUTHASIA/Resources/Roll_Call_Teacher_Absence_Bangladesh.pdf|title=Roll Call: Teacher Absence in Bangladesh|year=2004|publisher=Site resources.world bank.org|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Gender disparity===\nIn Bangladesh, gender discrimination in education occurs amongst the rural households but is non-existent amongst rich households.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huq |first1=Molla |last2=Rahman |first2=Pk Md.

The crux of the question is: What do we meditate upon?' Continuing his talk, Baba said: 'Kundalini starts dancing when one repeats ''Om Namah Shivaya''.' Hearing this, I mentally repeated the mantra, I noticed that my breathing was getting heavier. Suddenly, I felt a great impact of a rising force within me. The intensity of this rising ''kundalini'' force was so tremendous that my body lifted up a little and fell flat into the aisle; my eyeglasses flew off. As I lay there with my eyes closed, I could see a continuous fountain of dazzling white lights erupting within me. In brilliance, these lights were brighter than the sun but possessed no heat at all. I was experiencing the thought-free state of \"''I am'',\" realizing that \"I\" have always been, and will continue to be, eternal. I was fully conscious and completely aware while I was experiencing the pure \"''I am'',\" a state of supreme bliss.  Outwardly, at that precise moment, Baba delightfully shouted from his platform\u2026'''mene kuch nahi kiya; kisiko shakti ne pakda'' (I didn't do anything. The Energy has caught someone.)' Baba noticed that the dramatic awakening of kundalini in me frightened some people in the audience. Therefore, he said, 'Do not be frightened.

He professed that regional unions with appropriate qualifications should be eligible for permanent seats in the Security Council. By adding permanent seats for regional unions, he stated that the [[UN]] can dilute the veto power without downgrading the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|P5]].
