{"title_page": "Servilia (gens)", "text_new": "The '''gens Servilia''' was a [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family at [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].  The [[gens]] was celebrated during the early ages of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and the names of few gentes appear more frequently at this period in the [[Fasti consulares|consular Fasti]].  It continued to produce men of influence in the state down to the latest times of the Republic, and even in the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]].  The first member of the gens who obtained the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 495 BC)|Publius Servilius Priscus Structus]] in 495 BC, and the last of the name who appears in the consular Fasti is Quintus Servilius Silanus, in AD 189, thus occupying a prominent position in the Roman state for nearly seven hundred years.\n\nLike other Roman gentes, the Servilii of course had their own [[sacra (ancient Rome)|sacra]]; and they are said to have worshipped a ''triens'', or copper coin, which is reported to have increased or diminished in size at various times, thus indicating the increase or diminution of the honors of the gens.  Although the Servilii were originally patricians, in the later Republic there were also [[plebeian]] Servilii.<ref name=\"DGRBM Servilia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 793 (\"Servilia Gens\").</ref><ref name=\"Fasti Capitolini\">''[[Fasti Capitolini]]'', {{AE|1900|83}}; 1904, 114; {{AE|1927|101}}; 1940, 59, 60.</ref><ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Gaius Plinius Secundus]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', xxxiv. 13. s. 38.</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n\nAccording to tradition, the Servilia gens was one of the [[Alba Longa|Alban]] houses removed to Rome by [[Tullus Hostilius]], and enrolled by him among the patricians.  It was, consequently, one of the ''gentes minores''.  The [[Roman naming convention#Nomen|nomen]] ''Servilius'' is a patronymic surname, derived from the [[praenomen]] ''[[Servius (praenomen)|Servius]]'' (meaning \"one who keeps safe\" or \"preserves\"), which must have been borne by the ancestor of the gens.<ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', i. 30.</ref><ref>George Davis Chase, \"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\", in ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', vol. VIII (1897).</ref>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe different branches of the Servilii each used slightly different sets of [[praenomen|praenomina]].  The oldest stirpes used the praenomina ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], [[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]], [[Spurius (praenomen)|Spurius]]'', and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]''.  The Servilii Caepiones used primarily ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' and ''Quintus''.  The Servilii Gemini employed ''Gnaeus, Quintus, Publius, Gaius'', and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]''.  The ancestors of the gens must have used the praenomen ''Servius'', but the family no longer used it in historical times.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe Servilii were divided into numerous families; of these the names in the Republican period are ''Ahala, Axilla, Caepio, Casca, Geminus, Glaucia, Globulus, Priscus'' (with the agnomen ''Fidenas''), ''Rullus, Structus, Tucca'', and ''Vatia'' (with the agnomen ''Isauricus'').  The Structi, Prisci, Ahalae, and Caepiones were patricians; the Gemini originally patrician, and later plebeian; the Vatiae and Cascae plebeians.  Other [[cognomen|cognomina]] appear under the Empire.  The only surnames found on coins are those of ''Ahala, Caepio, Casca'', and ''Rullus''.<ref name=\"DGRBM Servilia Gens\"/><ref>[[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel]], ''Doctrina Numorum Veterum'', v. p. 308 ''ff.''</ref>\n\nThe cognomen ''Structus'' almost always occurs in connection with those of ''Priscus'' or ''Ahala''.  The only Structus who is mentioned with this cognomen alone is Spurius Servilius Structus, who was [[tribuni militum consulari potestate|consular tribune]] in 368 BC.  The fact that ''Structus'' appears in two of the oldest stirpes of the Servilii, neither of which clearly predates the other, could indicate that persons bearing this surname were ancestral to both great houses.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 928 (\"Structus\").</ref>\n\nThe Prisci (\"antique\") were an ancient family of the Servilia gens, and filled the highest offices of the state during the early years of the Republic.  They also bore the agnomen of ''Structus'', which is always appended to their name in the Fasti, till it was supplanted by that of ''Fidenas'', which was first obtained by Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus, who took [[Fidenae]] in his [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]], in 435 BC, and which was also borne by his descendants.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 528 (\"Servilius Priscus\").</ref>\n\n''Ahala'', of which ''Axilla'' is merely another form, is a diminutive of ''ala'', a wing.  A popular legend related that the name was first given to [[Gaius Servilius Ahala|Gaius Servilius Structus]], [[Master of the Horse|magister equitum]] in 439 BC, because he hid the knife with which he slew [[Spurius Maelius]] in his armpit (also ''ala'').  However, this does not appear to be the case, since the name had been in use by the family for at least a generation before that event.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 83 (\"Ahala\"), 448 (\"Axilla\").</ref>\n\nThe surnames ''Caepio'' and ''Geminus'' appear almost simultaneously in the middle of the third century BC, with the consuls of 253 and 252.  Each was the grandson of a Gnaeus Servilius, suggesting that the two cognomina belonged to two branches of the same family.  ''Caepio'', an onion, belongs to a large class of surnames derived from ordinary objects, while ''Geminus'' originally denoted a twin, and was typically given to the younger of two brothers.  In a discussion concerning appearances, [[Cicero]] mentions a certain Quintus Servilius Geminus, who was frequently mistaken for his brother, Publius, the consul of 252 BC.  The Servilii Vatiae (\"cross-legged\") seem to be descended from the Gemini.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 533\u2013535 (\"Caepio\"), vol. II, p. 239 (\"Geminus\"), vol. III, pp. 1232, 1233 (\"Vatia\").</ref><ref>Chase, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Academica Priora'', ii. 84.</ref>\n\n==Members==\n\n===Servilii Prisci===\n* Publius Servilius Priscus Structus, father of the consul of 495 BC.\n* [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 495 BC)|Publius Servilius P. f.

The [[gens]] was celebrated during the early ages of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and the names of few gentes appear more frequently at this period in the [[Fasti consulares|consular Fasti]].  It continued to produce men of influence in the state down to the latest times of the Republic, and even in the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]].  The first member of the gens who obtained the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 495 BC)|Publius Servilius Priscus Structus]] in 495 BC, and the last of the name who appears in the consular Fasti is Quintus Servilius Silanus, in AD 189, thus occupying a prominent position in the Roman state for nearly seven hundred years.\n\nLike other Roman gentes, the Servilii of course had their own [[sacra (ancient Rome)|sacra]]; and they are said to have worshipped a ''triens'', or copper coin, which is reported to have increased or diminished in size at various times, thus indicating the increase or diminution of the honors of the gens.  Although the Servilii were originally patricians, in the later Republic there were also [[plebeian]] Servilii.<ref name=\"DGRBM Servilia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 793 (\"Servilia Gens\").</ref><ref name=\"Fasti Capitolini\">''[[Fasti Capitolini]]'', {{AE|1900|83}}; 1904, 114; {{AE|1927|101}}; 1940, 59, 60.</ref><ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Gaius Plinius Secundus]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', xxxiv. 13. s. 38.</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n\nAccording to tradition, the Servilia gens was one of the [[Alba Longa|Alban]] houses removed to Rome by [[Tullus Hostilius]], and enrolled by him among the patricians.  It was, consequently, one of the ''gentes minores''.  The [[Roman naming convention#Nomen|nomen]] ''Servilius'' is a patronymic surname, derived from the [[praenomen]] ''[[Servius (praenomen)|Servius]]'' (meaning \"one who keeps safe\" or \"preserves\"), which must have been borne by the ancestor of the gens.<ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', i. 30.</ref><ref>George Davis Chase, \"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\", in ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', vol. VIII (1897).</ref>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe different branches of the Servilii each used slightly different sets of [[praenomen|praenomina]].  The oldest stirpes used the praenomina ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], [[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]], [[Spurius (praenomen)|Spurius]]'', and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]''.  The Servilii Caepiones used primarily ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' and ''Quintus''.  The Servilii Gemini employed ''Gnaeus, Quintus, Publius, Gaius'', and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]''.  The ancestors of the gens must have used the praenomen ''Servius'', but the family no longer used it in historical times.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe Servilii were divided into numerous families; of these the names in the Republican period are ''Ahala, Axilla, Caepio, Casca, Geminus, Glaucia, Globulus, Priscus'' (with the agnomen ''Fidenas''), ''Rullus, Structus, Tucca'', and ''Vatia'' (with the agnomen ''Isauricus'').  The Structi, Prisci, Ahalae, and Caepiones were patricians; the Gemini originally patrician, and later plebeian; the Vatiae and Cascae plebeians.  Other [[cognomen|cognomina]] appear under the Empire.  The only surnames found on coins are those of ''Ahala, Caepio, Casca'', and ''Rullus''.<ref name=\"DGRBM Servilia Gens\"/><ref>[[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel]], ''Doctrina Numorum Veterum'', v. p. 308 ''ff.''</ref>\n\nThe cognomen ''Structus'' almost always occurs in connection with those of ''Priscus'' or ''Ahala''.  The only Structus who is mentioned with this cognomen alone is Spurius Servilius Structus, who was [[tribuni militum consulari potestate|consular tribune]] in 368 BC.  The fact that ''Structus'' appears in two of the oldest stirpes of the Servilii, neither of which clearly predates the other, could indicate that persons bearing this surname were ancestral to both great houses.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 928 (\"Structus\").</ref>\n\nThe Prisci (\"antique\") were an ancient family of the Servilia gens, and filled the highest offices of the state during the early years of the Republic.  They also bore the agnomen of ''Structus'', which is always appended to their name in the Fasti, till it was supplanted by that of ''Fidenas'', which was first obtained by Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus, who took [[Fidenae]] in his [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]], in 435 BC, and which was also borne by his descendants.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 528 (\"Servilius Priscus\").</ref>\n\n''Ahala'', of which ''Axilla'' is merely another form, is a diminutive of ''ala'', a wing.  A popular legend related that the name was first given to [[Gaius Servilius Ahala|Gaius Servilius Structus]], [[Master of the Horse|magister equitum]] in 439 BC, because he hid the knife with which he slew [[Spurius Maelius]] in his armpit (also ''ala'').  However, this does not appear to be the case, since the name had been in use by the family for at least a generation before that event.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 83 (\"Ahala\"), 448 (\"Axilla\").</ref>\n\nThe surnames ''Caepio'' and ''Geminus'' appear almost simultaneously in the middle of the third century BC, with the consuls of 253 and 252.  Each was the grandson of a Gnaeus Servilius, suggesting that the two cognomina belonged to two branches of the same family.  ''Caepio'', an onion, belongs to a large class of surnames derived from ordinary objects, while ''Geminus'' originally denoted a twin, and was typically given to the younger of two brothers.  In a discussion concerning appearances, [[Cicero]] mentions a certain Quintus Servilius Geminus, who was frequently mistaken for his brother, Publius, the consul of 252 BC.  The Servilii Vatiae (\"cross-legged\") seem to be descended from the Gemini.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 533\u2013535 (\"Caepio\"), vol. II, p. 239 (\"Geminus\"), vol. III, pp. 1232, 1233 (\"Vatia\").</ref><ref>Chase, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Academica Priora'', ii. 84.</ref>\n\n==Members==\n\n===Servilii Prisci===\n* Publius Servilius Priscus Structus, father of the consul of 495 BC.\n* [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 495 BC)|Publius Servilius P. f.
