The appointment is made as the country faces [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Malaysia|COVID-19]] disease.<ref name=\"Malay Mail\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\n===Warm Water Helps Prevent the Spread of Coronavirus===\nOn 19 March 2020, Adham advised the public that drinking warm water will help prevent [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] virus infection as the virus will be flushed down to the stomach and the digestive acids will kill any virus, while being interviewed at [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]]'s ''Bicara Naratif'' programme. His remarks later went viral on social media, with many netizens questioning his dubious claim. Dr Nur Amalina Che Bakri had criticised Adham saying that there was no scientific evidence that the stomach's acid can kill the virus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/20/health-minister039s-039warm-water-method039-to-kill-coronavirus-questioned|title=Health Minister's 'warm water method' to kill coronavirus questioned|work=The Star}}</ref> [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) has also refuted the claim, noting that while staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent the coronavirus infection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/health-minister-wrongly-claims-hot-water-can-kill-coronavirus-because-it-doesn-t-like-heat|title=Health Minister Claims Warm Water Can Kill Coronavirus Because It \"Doesn't Like Heat\"|work=Says}}</ref> Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah later refuted   Adham's statement, commenting that the Health Ministry's approach for patient treatment and management is always based on scientific evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.therakyatpost.com/2020/03/22/health-dg-appears-to-disagree-with-health-minister-on-warm-water-claim/|title=Health DG appears to disagree with Health Minister on Warm Water claim|work=The Rakyat Post}}</ref>\n\n===Pakatan Harapan Blamed for Failing to Contain Tabligh Cluster===\nOn 18 April 2020, Adham in a live-streamed video conference call with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], he erroneously claimed that the previous [[Pakatan Harapan]] government has failed to contain the tabligh cluster happened from 27 February to 3 March, which grew to become a source of the largest [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] infections. Notably, as the tabligh event at Sri Petaling Mosque was held from 27 February to 1 March, Malaysia did not possess any ruling government as the [[Pakatan Harapan]] administration had collapsed due to the [[2020 Malaysian political crisis|political crisis]] caused by the [[Perikatan Nasional]] ruling coalition which came to power without any general election taking place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-health-minister-blames-previous-ph-govt-for-failure-to-contain-covid-19-surge|title=Malaysia's Health Minister blames previous PH govt for failure to contain Covid-19 surge|last=|first=|date=2020-04-18|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The Ministry of Health was without any Health Minister until 10 March, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Another important fact that Adham conveniently omnited, is that Ministry of Health under the previous health minister Dr. [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]] had prepared for the Covid-19 infections since December 2019, when seven hospitals were planned and identified to treat Covid-19 patients even before the first cases were reported on 25 January 2020. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/fact-checking-dr-adham-baba-s-claim-that-previous-govt-failed-to-contain-the-tabligh-covid-19-cluster|title=Fact-Checking Dr Adham Baba's Claim That PH Failed To Contain The Tabligh Cluster|work=Says}}</ref>\n\n===WHO Conference Call with 500 Countries===\nOn 19 April 2020, Adham was ridiculed once again for erroneously claiming that he conducted video-conferencing with 500 countries within the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) members during a Facebook live session with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]]. He also boasted that he was confident that his accomplishments as a Health Minister was recognised globally. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/238783|title=Health minister mocked over \u2018500 countries\u2019 claim|work=The Malaysian Insight}}</ref> This event highlighted Adham\u2018s overconfidence, ineptitude, incompetence and a lack of attention to detail when fulfilling his ministerial duties, as there are less than 200 countries present in the world today. As a minister who gained the position through the formation of a Backdoor government (formation of a new government without any general election), Adham has little to no credibility in making his own assertions (that were subsequently proven false).\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAdham is married to Taibah Tabrani and has 3 children and 2 adopted children.  On April 23, 2007, Adham's wife suffered from asthma and fainting at her home after suffering a respiratory problem.  She was later rushed to the hospital but she passed away.  At the time, Adham was in Auckland, New Zealand on official duty.\n\n==Honours==\n\n*[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Malacca.svg|30px]] {{flag|Malacca}} :\n**[[File:MY-MAL Exalted Order of Malacca.svg|50px]] Darjah Mulia Seri Melaka (DMSM) \u2013 '''Datuk''' (2003)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2003.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2003.}}</ref>\n*[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Pahang.svg|25px]] {{flag|Pahang}} :\n**[[File:MY-PAH Order of the Crown of Pahang - Grand Knight - SIMP.svg|50px]] [[Pahang honours list|Sri Indera Mahkota Pahang]] (SIMP) \u2013 '''Dato\u2019 Indera''' (2013)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2013.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2013.}}</ref>\n**[[File:MY-PAH Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang - Grand Knight - SSAP.svg|50px]] Sri Sultan Ahmad Shah Pahang (SSAP) \u2013 '''Dato\u2019 Sri''' (2016)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2016.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2016.}}</ref>\n\n==Election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ '''[[Johor State Legislative Assembly]]'''<ref name=\"election results\">{{cite web|url=http://semak.spr.gov.my/spr/laporan/5_KedudukanAkhir.php |title=Keputusan Pilihan Raya Umum Parlimen/Dewan Undangan Negeri |publisher=[[Election Commission of Malaysia]] |accessdate=14 April 2010}} Percentage figures based on total turnout, including votes for third parties.

His remarks later went viral on social media, with many netizens questioning his dubious claim. Dr Nur Amalina Che Bakri had criticised Adham saying that there was no scientific evidence that the stomach's acid can kill the virus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/20/health-minister039s-039warm-water-method039-to-kill-coronavirus-questioned|title=Health Minister's 'warm water method' to kill coronavirus questioned|work=The Star}}</ref> [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) has also refuted the claim, noting that while staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent the coronavirus infection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/health-minister-wrongly-claims-hot-water-can-kill-coronavirus-because-it-doesn-t-like-heat|title=Health Minister Claims Warm Water Can Kill Coronavirus Because It \"Doesn't Like Heat\"|work=Says}}</ref> Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah later refuted   Adham's statement, commenting that the Health Ministry's approach for patient treatment and management is always based on scientific evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.therakyatpost.com/2020/03/22/health-dg-appears-to-disagree-with-health-minister-on-warm-water-claim/|title=Health DG appears to disagree with Health Minister on Warm Water claim|work=The Rakyat Post}}</ref>\n\n===Pakatan Harapan Blamed for Failing to Contain Tabligh Cluster===\nOn 18 April 2020, Adham in a live-streamed video conference call with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], he erroneously claimed that the previous [[Pakatan Harapan]] government has failed to contain the tabligh cluster happened from 27 February to 3 March, which grew to become a source of the largest [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] infections. Notably, as the tabligh event at Sri Petaling Mosque was held from 27 February to 1 March, Malaysia did not possess any ruling government as the [[Pakatan Harapan]] administration had collapsed due to the [[2020 Malaysian political crisis|political crisis]] caused by the [[Perikatan Nasional]] ruling coalition which came to power without any general election taking place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-health-minister-blames-previous-ph-govt-for-failure-to-contain-covid-19-surge|title=Malaysia's Health Minister blames previous PH govt for failure to contain Covid-19 surge|last=|first=|date=2020-04-18|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The Ministry of Health was without any Health Minister until 10 March, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Another important fact that Adham conveniently omnited, is that Ministry of Health under the previous health minister Dr. [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]] had prepared for the Covid-19 infections since December 2019, when seven hospitals were planned and identified to treat Covid-19 patients even before the first cases were reported on 25 January 2020. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/fact-checking-dr-adham-baba-s-claim-that-previous-govt-failed-to-contain-the-tabligh-covid-19-cluster|title=Fact-Checking Dr Adham Baba's Claim That PH Failed To Contain The Tabligh Cluster|work=Says}}</ref>\n\n===WHO Conference Call with 500 Countries===\nOn 19 April 2020, Adham was ridiculed once again for erroneously claiming that he conducted video-conferencing with 500 countries within the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) members during a Facebook live session with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]]. He also boasted that he was confident that his accomplishments as a Health Minister was recognised globally. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/238783|title=Health minister mocked over \u2018500 countries\u2019 claim|work=The Malaysian Insight}}</ref> This event highlighted Adham\u2018s overconfidence, ineptitude, incompetence and a lack of attention to detail when fulfilling his ministerial duties, as there are less than 200 countries present in the world today. As a minister who gained the position through the formation of a Backdoor government (formation of a new government without any general election), Adham has little to no credibility in making his own assertions (that were subsequently proven false).\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAdham is married to Taibah Tabrani and has 3 children and 2 adopted children.  On April 23, 2007, Adham's wife suffered from asthma and fainting at her home after suffering a respiratory problem.  She was later rushed to the hospital but she passed away.  At the time, Adham was in Auckland, New Zealand on official duty.\n\n==Honours==\n\n*[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Malacca.svg|30px]] {{flag|Malacca}} :\n**[[File:MY-MAL Exalted Order of Malacca.svg|50px]] Darjah Mulia Seri Melaka (DMSM) \u2013 '''Datuk''' (2003)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2003.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2003.}}</ref>\n*[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Pahang.svg|25px]] {{flag|Pahang}} :\n**[[File:MY-PAH Order of the Crown of Pahang - Grand Knight - SIMP.svg|50px]] [[Pahang honours list|Sri Indera Mahkota Pahang]] (SIMP) \u2013 '''Dato\u2019 Indera''' (2013)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2013.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2013.}}</ref>\n**[[File:MY-PAH Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang - Grand Knight - SSAP.svg|50px]] Sri Sultan Ahmad Shah Pahang (SSAP) \u2013 '''Dato\u2019 Sri''' (2016)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2016.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2016.}}</ref>\n\n==Election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ '''[[Johor State Legislative Assembly]]'''<ref name=\"election results\">{{cite web|url=http://semak.spr.gov.my/spr/laporan/5_KedudukanAkhir.php |title=Keputusan Pilihan Raya Umum Parlimen/Dewan Undangan Negeri |publisher=[[Election Commission of Malaysia]] |accessdate=14 April 2010}} Percentage figures based on total turnout, including votes for third parties.
