It was prevalent during the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] periods (approximately 1350 to 1550), with early and late use reaching into the 13th and 17th centuries.\n\n==Terminology==\n{{Further|Oakeshott typology#Type XIII}}\n\nThe term ''longsword'' is ambiguous, and refers to the \"[[bastard sword]]\" only where the late medieval to Renaissance context is implied. [[Longsword (disambiguation)|\"Longsword\" in other contexts]] has been used to refer to [[Bronze Age sword]]s, [[Migration period sword|Migration period]] and [[Viking sword]]s as well as the early modern [[European dueling sword|dueling sword]].\n\nHistorical (15th to 16th century) terms for this type of sword included [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{lang|es|espad\u00f3n}}'', ''{{lang|es|montante}}'', or ''{{lang|es|mandoble}}'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|spada longa (lunga)}}'' or ''{{lang|it|spada due mani (Bolognese)}}'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''{{lang|pt|montante}}'' and [[Middle French]] ''{{lang|fr|passot}}''. The [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|claidheamh m\u00f2r}}'' means \"great sword\"; anglicised as ''[[claymore]],'' it came to refer to the Scottish type of longsword with v-shaped crossguard.\nHistorical terminology overlaps with that applied to the [[Zweih\u00e4nder]] sword in the 16th century: French ''{{lang|fr|espadon}}'', Spanish ''{{lang|es|espad\u00f3n}}'', or Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|montante}}'' may also be used more narrowly to refer to these large swords. The French ''{{lang|fr|\u00e9p\u00e9e de passot}}'' may also refer to a medieval single-handed sword optimized for thrusting.\n\nThe French ''{{lang|fr|\u00e9p\u00e9e b\u00e2tarde}}'' and the English ''bastard sword'' originate in the 15th or 16th century, originally in the general sense of \"irregular sword, sword of uncertain origin\", but by the mid-16th century could refer to exceptionally large swords.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Qui n'\u00e9toit ni Fran\u00e7oise , ni Espagnole, ni proprement Lansquenette, mais plus grande que pas une de ces fortes \u00e9p\u00e9es.

Swords with exceptionally long hilts are found throughout the High Middle Ages, but these remain rare, and are not representative of an identifiable trend before the late 13th or early 14th century.\n\nThe longsword as a late medieval type of sword emerges in the 14th century, as a military steel weapon of the earlier phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It remains identifiable as a type during the period of about 1350 to 1550.<ref>{{cite book | last=Oakeshott | first=Ewart | title=The Sword in the Age of Chivalry | location=Woodbridge, Suffolk | date=1994 | publisher=The Boydell Press | isbn=9780851157153 | oclc=807485557 | page=56 | url=http://www.e-reading.co.uk/bookreader.php/135704/The_Sword_in_the_Age_of_Chivalry.pdf}}</ref>\nIt remained in use as a weapon of war intended for wielders wearing full [[plate armour]] either on foot or on horseback, throughout the late medieval period.\nFrom the late 15th century, however, it is also attested as being worn and used by unarmoured soldiers or mercenaries.\n\nUse of the two-handed Great Sword or ''Schlachtschwert'' by infantry (as opposed to their use as a weapon of mounted and fully armoured knights) seems to have originated with the [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] in the 14th century.\n<ref>{{cite book | last=Boeheim | first=Wendelin | title=Handbuch der Waffenkunde: Das Waffenwesen in seiner historischen Entwicklung| location= | date=1890 | publisher=Seemann Verlag | isbn= | oclc= | page=261ff | url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=NNVgAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA261}}</ref>\nBy the 16th century, its military use was mostly obsolete, culminating in the brief period where the oversized [[Zweih\u00e4nder]] were wielded by the German ''[[Landsknecht]]e'' during the early to mid 16th century. By the second half of the 16th century, it persisted mostly as a weapon for sportive competition (''[[Schulfechten]]''), and possibly in knightly [[duel]]s.\n\nDistinct \"bastard sword\" hilt types developed during the first half of the 16th century. [[Ewart Oakeshott]] distinguishes twelve different types.<ref name=oakeshott />{{rp|130}}  These all seem to have originated in Bavaria and in Switzerland. By the late 16th century, early forms of the developed-hilt appear on this type of sword.\nBeginning about 1520, the [[Swiss sabre]] (''schnepf'') in Switzerland began to replace the straight longsword, inheriting its hilt types, and the longsword had fallen out of use in Switzerland by 1550.\nIn southern Germany, it persisted into the 1560s, but its use also declined during the second half of the 16th century.\nThere are two late examples of longswords kept in the Swiss National Museum, both with vertically grooved pommels and elaborately decorated with silver inlay, and both belonging to Swiss noblemen in French service during the late 16th and early 17th century, Gugelberg von Moos and Rudolf von Schauenstein.<ref name=oakeshott />{{rp|133}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.peterfiner.com/current-stock/item/1548/ | title=Peter Finer | quote=Two further silver-encrusted swords possessing pommels of this type can be seen in the Schweizerisches Landesmuseum, Zurich...The first belonged to Hans Gugelberg von Moos (recorded 1562\u20131618), and the second to Rudolf von Schauenstein (recorded 1587\u20131626), whose name appears on its blade along with the date 1614. | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717014730/http://www.peterfiner.com/current-stock/item/1548/ | archivedate=2011-07-17}}</ref>\nThe longsword, greatsword and bastard-sword were also made in Spain, appearing relatively late, known as the ''{{lang|es|espadon}}'', the ''{{lang|es|montante}}'' and ''{{lang|es|bastarda}}'' or ''{{lang|es|espada de mano y media}}'' respectively.\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Sword cross section.svg|thumb|Different blade cross-sections. At the top, variants of the diamond shape. At the bottom, variants of the lenticular shape.]]\n\nThe swords grouped as \"longswords\" for the purposes of this article are united by their being intended for two-handed use.  In terms of blade typology, they do not form a single category. In the [[Oakeshott typology]] of blade morphology, \"longswords\" figure as a range of sub-types of the corresponding single-handed sword types.<ref>[http://www.albion-swords.com/articles/oakeshott-typology.htm Oakeshott's Typology of the Medieval Sword A Summary], [[Albion Swords]] (2005).</ref>\n\n*Types XIIa and XIIIa represent the Great Sword or War Sword type used in the later 13th and in the 14th century. They represent larger versions of type XII and type XIII swords which were the standard [[knightly sword]]s during the [[Crusades]]. They are primarily intended for cutting, with grips for either \"hand-and-half\" or two-handed use.  Type XIIa blades are broad, flat and evenly tapering, with a lenticular cross-section and a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] running along about two thirds of the blade's length. Type XIIIa blades are broad, with a flat lenticular cross-section, parallel edges and a fuller running along half the blade's length.\n*Type XVa is the classical two-handed  sword  of the 14th and 15th centuries (with early examples appearing from the later 13th century). These blades are strongly tapered, more narrow and slender even than the single-handed type XV variant, with a flattened diamond cross-section.\n*Type XVIa is the classical \"longsword\" of the 14th and 15th centuries. These blades are long and slowly tapering, with a flat hexagonal blade cross-section and a fuller running along one third of the blade. They represent an optimised compromise between thrusting capability and retaining good cutting characteristics.\n*Type XVII is a shorter-lived type, popular during the mid-14th to early 15th century. These blades are long, slender and acutely tapering, approaching the outline of type XVa, while still retaining a narrow hexagonal cross-section and a shallow fuller running along about one quarter of the blade.\n*Types XVIIIb and XVIIIc represent the later longswords of the mid-15th to early 16th centuries. They have a flattened diamond cross-section, often with pronounced mid-rib, some being hollow-ground. Type XVIIIb blades are slender, comparable to XVa blades but longer, measuring between 90 and 107&nbsp;cm, with a correspondingly longer grip, often waisted for comfortable two-handed use. Type XVIIIc blades are somewhat broader and shorter (about 85&nbsp;cm), and sometimes have a short and narrow fuller.\n*Type XX blades are broad, with lenticular or octagonal cross-sections. Their defining characteristics is that they have three fullers, a shallow central fuller running along half the blade's length, with two shallow parallel fullers along the first quarter. They were in use during the 14th and 15th centuries. Sub-type XXa has a more acutely tapering blade and a more acute point.\n\n==Fighting with the longsword==\n{{details|Historical fencing}}\n\nThe expression ''{{lang|de|fechten mit dem langen schwert}}'' (\"fighting with the long sword\") in the [[German school of fencing]] denotes the style of fencing which uses both hands at the hilt; ''{{lang|de|fechten mit dem kurzen schwert}}'' (\"fighting with the short sword\") is used in [[half-sword]] fighting, with one hand gripping the blade.\nThe two terms are largely equivalent to \"unarmoured fighting\" (''{{lang|de|blossfechten}}'') and \"armoured fencing\" (''{{lang|de|fechten im harnisch}}'').\n\n===History===\n[[File:Parzival und Condviramur.jpg|thumb|200px|1440s illustration of one- and two-handed use of the longsword. Note the sword being used one-handed is drawn shorter and may also be intended as a large [[knightly sword]] ([[CPG 339]] fol. 135r).]]\n[[File:Cpg359 46v.jpg|thumb|200px|Example of two handed use vs. half-sword, dating to ca. 1418 ([[CPG 359]], fol. 46v).]]\n\nCodified systems of fighting with the longsword existed from the later 14th century, with a variety of styles and teachers each providing a slightly different take on the art. Hans Talhoffer, a mid-15th-century German fightmaster, is probably the most prominent, using a wide variety of moves, most resulting in wrestling. The longsword was a quick, effective, and versatile weapon capable of deadly thrusts, slices, and cuts.<ref name=\"medcombat\">{{cite book | last=Talhoffer | first=Hans | editor=Rector, Mark | title=Medieval Combat: A Fifteenth-Century Illustrated Manual of Swordfighting and Close-Quarter Combat | date=2000 | publisher=Greenhill Books | isbn=1853674184 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/medievalcombatfi00talh_0 }}</ref>{{rp|15\u201316}} The blade was generally used with both hands on the hilt, one resting close to or on the pommel. The weapon may be held with one hand during disarmament or grappling techniques.\nIn a depiction of a duel, individuals may be seen wielding sharply pointed longswords in one hand, leaving the other hand open to manipulate the large dueling shield.<ref name=medcombat />{{rp|plates 128\u2013150}}\n\nAnother variation of use comes from the use of armour. [[Half-sword]]ing was a manner of using both hands, one on the hilt and one on the blade, to better control the weapon in thrusts and jabs. This versatility was unique, as multiple works hold that the longsword provided the foundations for learning a variety of other weapons including [[spear]]s, [[Quarterstaff|staves]], and [[polearms]].<ref name=\"medcombat\" /><ref>{{cite book | last=Lindholm | first=David | title=Fighting with the Quarterstaff: A Modern Study of Renaissance Technique | location=Highland Village, Texas | date=2006 | publisher=Chivalry Bookshelf | isbn=9781891448362 | page=32}}</ref> Use of the longsword in attack was not limited only to use of the blade, however, as several Fechtb\u00fccher explain and depict use of the pommel and cross as offensive weapons.<ref name=medcombat />{{rp|73\u201373; plate 67}} The cross has been shown to be used as a hook for tripping or knocking an opponent off balance.<ref name=\"medcombat\" />{{rp|plate 58}} Some manuals even depict the cross as a hammer.<ref>{{cite book| author =Talhoffer, Hans | title=Fechtbuch | url =https://archive.org/details/fechtbuchausdemj00talh | year=1467|language=de}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known of combat with the longsword comes from artistic depictions of battle from manuscripts and the Fechtb\u00fccher of Medieval and Renaissance Masters. Therein the basics of combat were described and, in some cases, depicted. The [[German school of swordsmanship]] includes the earliest known longsword Fechtbuch, a manual from approximately 1389, known as [[N\u00fcrnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a|GNM 3227a]]. This manual, unfortunately for modern scholars, was written in obscure verse. It was through students of Liechtenauer, like [[Sigmund Ringeck]], who transcribed the work into more understandable prose<ref>{{cite book | author=Ringeck, Sigmund | title=MS Dresd. C 487 | url=http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Codex_Ringeck_%28MS_Dresd.C.487%29}}</ref> that the system became notably more codified and understandable.<ref name=linholm2003>{{cite book | last=Lindholm | first=David |author2=Svard, P.  | title=Sigmund Ringneck's Knightly Art of the Longsword | location=Boulder, Colorado | date=2003 | publisher=Paladin Press | isbn=1581604106 | page=11}}</ref> Others provided similar work, some with a wide array of images to accompany the text.<ref>{{cite book| author=Talhoffer, Hans | title=Thott 290 2 | url=http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Talhoffer_Fechtbuch_%28MS_Thott.290.2%C2%BA%29}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Italian school of swordsmanship]] was the other primary school of longsword use. The 1410 manuscript by [[Fiore dei Liberi]] presents a variety of uses for the longsword. Like the German manuals, the weapon is most commonly depicted and taught with both hands on the hilt. However, a section on one-handed use is among the volume and demonstrates the techniques and advantages, such as sudden additional reach, of single-handed longsword play.<ref>{{cite book| author=dei Liberi, Fiore | title=Flos Duellatorum | url=http://www.aemma.org/onlineResources/liberi/flos_dellaSpada.pdf|language=it}}</ref> The manual also presents half-sword techniques as an integral part of armoured combat.\n\nBoth schools declined in the late 16th century, with the later Italian masters forgoing the longsword and focusing primarily on [[rapier]] fencing. The last known German manual to include longsword teaching was that of [[Jacob Sutor|Jakob Sutor]], published in 1612. In Italy, ''{{lang|it|spadone}}'', or longsword, instruction lingered on despite the popularity of the rapier, at least into the mid-17th century (Alfieri's ''Lo Spadone'' of 1653), with a late treatise of the \"two handed sword\" by one [[Giuseppe Colombani]], a dentist in [[Venice]] dating to 1711. A tradition of teaching based on this has survived in contemporary French and Italian [[stick fighting]].<ref>See, for instance, Giuseppe Cerri's ''Trattato teorico e pratico della scherma di bastone'' of 1854.</ref>\n\n===German school of fencing===\n{{main|German school of fencing}}\n\n===={{lang|de|Blo\u00dffechten}}====\n[[File:De Fechtbuch Talhoffer 025.jpg|thumb|200px|Unarmoured longsword fencers (plate 25 of the 1467 manual of [[Hans Talhoffer]])]]\n''{{lang|de|Blo\u00dffechten}}'' (''blosz fechten'') or \"bare fighting\" is the technique of fighting without significant protective armour such as [[plate armour|plate]] or [[mail (armour)|mail]].\n\nThe lack of significant torso and limb protection leads to the use of a large amount of cutting and slicing techniques in addition to thrusts. These techniques could be nearly instantly fatal or incapacitating, as a thrust to the skull, heart, or major blood vessel would cause massive trauma. Similarly, strong strikes could cut through skin and bone, effectively amputating limbs. The hands and forearms are a frequent target of some cuts and slices in a defensive or offensive manoeuvre, serving both to disable an opponent and align the swordsman and his weapon for the next attack.\n\n====Harnischfechten====\n[[File:Augsburg Cod.I.6.4\u00ba.2 (Codex Wallerstein) 107v.jpg|thumb|200px|Page of the Codex Wallerstein showing a half-sword thrust against a two-handed sword's [[Mordstreich]] (Plate 214)]]\n''{{lang|de|Harnischfechten}}'', or \"armoured fighting\" (German ''{{lang|de|kampffechten}}'', or ''{{lang|de|Fechten in Harnisch zu Fuss}}'', literally \"fighting in armour on foot\"), depicts fighting in full [[plate armour]].<ref name=terms2>{{cite web|author=Clements, John | url=http://thearma.org/terms2.htm | title=Medieval and Renaissance Fencing Terminology}}</ref>\n\nThe increased defensive capability of a man clad in full plate armour caused the use of the sword to be drastically changed. While slashing attacks were still moderately effective against [[infantry]] wearing half-plate armour, cutting and slicing attacks against an opponent wearing [[plate armour]] were almost entirely ineffective in providing any sort of slashing wound as the sword simply could not cut through the steel, although a combatant could aim for the chinks in a suit of armour, sometimes to great effect.<ref name=knightly>{{cite book | last=Lindholm | first=David | last2=Sv\u00e4rd | first2=Peter | title=Signmund Ringeck's Knightly Arts of Combat | location=Boulder, Colorado | date=2006 | publisher=Paladin Press | isbn=1581604998 | page=219}}</ref> Instead, the energy of the cut becomes essentially pure [[impact force|concussive energy]]. The later hardened plate armours, complete with ridges and roping, posed a threat against the careless attacker. It is considered possible for strong blows of the sword against plate armour to damage the blade of the sword, potentially rendering it much less effective at cutting and producing only a concussive effect against the armoured opponent.\n\nTo overcome this problem, swords began to be used primarily for thrusting. The weapon was used in the half-sword, with one or both hands on the blade. This increased the accuracy and strength of thrusts and provided more leverage for ''{{lang|de|Ringen am Schwert}}'' or \"wrestling at/with the sword\". Also, the hand on the blade increases its rigidity which is advantageous when thrusting. This technique combines the use of the sword with wrestling, providing opportunities to trip, disarm, break, or throw an opponent and place them in a less offensively and defensively capable position. During half-swording, the entirety of the sword works as a weapon, including the pommel and crossguard. One example how a sword can be used this way is to thrust the tip of the crossguard at the opponent's head right after parrying a stroke. Another technique would be the [[Mordhau (weaponry)|Mordstreich]] (lit. \"murder stroke\"), where the weapon is held by the blade (hilt, pommel and crossguard serving as an improvised hammer head) and swung, taking advantage of the balance being close to the hilt to increase the concussive effect (see the fighter on the right of the Codex Wallerstein picture).<ref name=knightly />\n\n==See also==\n* [[English Longsword School]]\n* [[Historical European martial arts]]\n* [[wikt:montante|Montante]]\n* [[Ricasso]]\n* [[Waster]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n* {{cite journal | author=Cvet, David M. | url=http://www.ejmas.com/jwma/articles/2002/jwmaart_cvet_0102.htm | title=Study of the Destructive Capabilities of the European Longsword | journal=Journal of Western Martial Art | date=February 2002}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Dawson, Timothy | url=http://www.ejmas.com/jwma/articles/2005/jwmaart_dawson_0205.htm | title=A club with an edge | journal=Journal of Western Martial Art | date=February 2005}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Hellqvist, Bj\u00f6rn | url=http://www.ejmas.com/jwma/articles/2000/jwmaart_hellqvist_1100.htm | title=Oakeshott's Typology \u2013 An Introduction | journal=Journal of Western Martial Art | date=November 2000}}\n* {{cite journal| author=Melville, Neil H.

It was prevalent during the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] periods (approximately 1350 to 1550), with early and late use reaching into the 13th and 17th centuries.\n\n==Terminology==\n{{Further|Oakeshott typology#Type XIII}}\n\nThe term ''longsword'' is ambiguous, and refers to the \"[[bastard sword]]\" only where the late medieval to Renaissance context is implied. [[Longsword (disambiguation)|\"Longsword\" in other contexts]] has been used to refer to [[Bronze Age sword]]s, [[Migration period sword|Migration period]] and [[Viking sword]]s as well as the early modern [[European dueling sword|dueling sword]].\n\nHistorical (15th to 16th century) terms for this type of sword included [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{lang|es|espad\u00f3n}}'', ''{{lang|es|montante}}'', or ''{{lang|es|mandoble}}'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|spada longa (lunga)}}'' or ''{{lang|it|spada due mani (Bolognese)}}'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''{{lang|pt|montante}}'' and [[Middle French]] ''{{lang|fr|passot}}''. The [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|claidheamh m\u00f2r}}'' means \"great sword\"; anglicised as ''[[claymore]],'' it came to refer to the Scottish type of longsword with v-shaped crossguard.\nHistorical terminology overlaps with that applied to the [[Zweih\u00e4nder]] sword in the 16th century: French ''{{lang|fr|espadon}}'', Spanish ''{{lang|es|espad\u00f3n}}'', or Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|montante}}'' may also be used more narrowly to refer to these large swords. The French ''{{lang|fr|\u00e9p\u00e9e de passot}}'' may also refer to a medieval single-handed sword optimized for thrusting.\n\nThe French ''{{lang|fr|\u00e9p\u00e9e b\u00e2tarde}}'' and the English ''bastard sword'' originate in the 15th or 16th century, originally in the general sense of \"irregular sword, sword of uncertain origin\", but by the mid-16th century could refer to exceptionally large swords.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Qui n'\u00e9toit ni Fran\u00e7oise , ni Espagnole, ni proprement Lansquenette, mais plus grande que pas une de ces fortes \u00e9p\u00e9es.

Swords with exceptionally long hilts are found throughout the High Middle Ages, but these remain rare, and are not representative of an identifiable trend before the late 13th or early 14th century.\n\nThe longsword as a late medieval type of sword emerges in the 14th century, as a military steel weapon of the earlier phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It remains identifiable as a type during the period of about 1350 to 1550.<ref>{{cite book | last=Oakeshott | first=Ewart | title=The Sword in the Age of Chivalry | location=Woodbridge, Suffolk | date=1994 | publisher=The Boydell Press | isbn=9780851157153 | oclc=807485557 | page=56 | url=http://www.e-reading.co.uk/bookreader.php/135704/The_Sword_in_the_Age_of_Chivalry.pdf}}</ref>\nIt remained in use as a weapon of war intended for wielders wearing full [[plate armour]] either on foot or on horseback, throughout the late medieval period.\nFrom the late 15th century, however, it is also attested as being worn and used by unarmoured soldiers or mercenaries.\n\nUse of the two-handed Great Sword or ''Schlachtschwert'' by infantry (as opposed to their use as a weapon of mounted and fully armoured knights) seems to have originated with the [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] in the 14th century.\n<ref>{{cite book | last=Boeheim | first=Wendelin | title=Handbuch der Waffenkunde: Das Waffenwesen in seiner historischen Entwicklung| location= | date=1890 | publisher=Seemann Verlag | isbn= | oclc= | page=261ff | url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=NNVgAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA261}}</ref>\nBy the 16th century, its military use was mostly obsolete, culminating in the brief period where the oversized [[Zweih\u00e4nder]] were wielded by the German ''[[Landsknecht]]e'' during the early to mid 16th century. By the second half of the 16th century, it persisted mostly as a weapon for sportive competition (''[[Schulfechten]]''), and possibly in knightly [[duel]]s.\n\nDistinct \"bastard sword\" hilt types developed during the first half of the 16th century. [[Ewart Oakeshott]] distinguishes twelve different types.<ref name=oakeshott />{{rp|130}}  These all seem to have originated in Bavaria and in Switzerland. By the late 16th century, early forms of the developed-hilt appear on this type of sword.\nBeginning about 1520, the [[Swiss sabre]] (''schnepf'') in Switzerland began to replace the straight longsword, inheriting its hilt types, and the longsword had fallen out of use in Switzerland by 1550.\nIn southern Germany, it persisted into the 1560s, but its use also declined during the second half of the 16th century.\nThere are two late examples of longswords kept in the Swiss National Museum, both with vertically grooved pommels and elaborately decorated with silver inlay, and both belonging to Swiss noblemen in French service during the late 16th and early 17th century, Gugelberg von Moos and Rudolf von Schauenstein.<ref name=oakeshott />{{rp|133}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.peterfiner.com/current-stock/item/1548/ | title=Peter Finer | quote=Two further silver-encrusted swords possessing pommels of this type can be seen in the Schweizerisches Landesmuseum, Zurich...The first belonged to Hans Gugelberg von Moos (recorded 1562\u20131618), and the second to Rudolf von Schauenstein (recorded 1587\u20131626), whose name appears on its blade along with the date 1614. | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717014730/http://www.peterfiner.com/current-stock/item/1548/ | archivedate=2011-07-17}}</ref>\nThe longsword, greatsword and bastard-sword were also made in Spain, appearing relatively late, known as the ''{{lang|es|espadon}}'', the ''{{lang|es|montante}}'' and ''{{lang|es|bastarda}}'' or ''{{lang|es|espada de mano y media}}'' respectively.\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Sword cross section.svg|thumb|Different blade cross-sections. At the top, variants of the diamond shape. At the bottom, variants of the lenticular shape.]]\n\nThe swords grouped as \"longswords\" for the purposes of this article are united by their being intended for two-handed use.  In terms of blade typology, they do not form a single category. In the [[Oakeshott typology]] of blade morphology, \"longswords\" figure as a range of sub-types of the corresponding single-handed sword types.<ref>[http://www.albion-swords.com/articles/oakeshott-typology.htm Oakeshott's Typology of the Medieval Sword A Summary], [[Albion Swords]] (2005).</ref>\n\n*Types XIIa and XIIIa represent the Great Sword or War Sword type used in the later 13th and in the 14th century. They represent larger versions of type XII and type XIII swords which were the standard [[knightly sword]]s during the [[Crusades]]. They are primarily intended for cutting, with grips for either \"hand-and-half\" or two-handed use.  Type XIIa blades are broad, flat and evenly tapering, with a lenticular cross-section and a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] running along about two thirds of the blade's length. Type XIIIa blades are broad, with a flat lenticular cross-section, parallel edges and a fuller running along half the blade's length.\n*Type XVa is the classical two-handed  sword  of the 14th and 15th centuries (with early examples appearing from the later 13th century). These blades are strongly tapered, more narrow and slender even than the single-handed type XV variant, with a flattened diamond cross-section.\n*Type XVIa is the classical \"longsword\" of the 14th and 15th centuries. These blades are long and slowly tapering, with a flat hexagonal blade cross-section and a fuller running along one third of the blade. They represent an optimised compromise between thrusting capability and retaining good cutting characteristics.\n*Type XVII is a shorter-lived type, popular during the mid-14th to early 15th century. These blades are long, slender and acutely tapering, approaching the outline of type XVa, while still retaining a narrow hexagonal cross-section and a shallow fuller running along about one quarter of the blade.\n*Types XVIIIb and XVIIIc represent the later longswords of the mid-15th to early 16th centuries. They have a flattened diamond cross-section, often with pronounced mid-rib, some being hollow-ground. Type XVIIIb blades are slender, comparable to XVa blades but longer, measuring between 90 and 107&nbsp;cm, with a correspondingly longer grip, often waisted for comfortable two-handed use. Type XVIIIc blades are somewhat broader and shorter (about 85&nbsp;cm), and sometimes have a short and narrow fuller.\n*Type XX blades are broad, with lenticular or octagonal cross-sections. Their defining characteristics is that they have three fullers, a shallow central fuller running along half the blade's length, with two shallow parallel fullers along the first quarter. They were in use during the 14th and 15th centuries. Sub-type XXa has a more acutely tapering blade and a more acute point.\n\n==Fighting with the longsword==\n{{details|Historical fencing}}\n\nThe expression ''{{lang|de|fechten mit dem langen schwert}}'' (\"fighting with the long sword\") in the [[German school of fencing]] denotes the style of fencing which uses both hands at the hilt; ''{{lang|de|fechten mit dem kurzen schwert}}'' (\"fighting with the short sword\") is used in [[half-sword]] fighting, with one hand gripping the blade.\nThe two terms are largely equivalent to \"unarmoured fighting\" (''{{lang|de|blossfechten}}'') and \"armoured fencing\" (''{{lang|de|fechten im harnisch}}'').\n\n===History===\n[[File:Parzival und Condviramur.jpg|thumb|200px|1440s illustration of one- and two-handed use of the longsword. Note the sword being used one-handed is drawn shorter and may also be intended as a large [[knightly sword]] ([[CPG 339]] fol. 135r).]]\n[[File:Cpg359 46v.jpg|thumb|200px|Example of two handed use vs. half-sword, dating to ca. 1418 ([[CPG 359]], fol. 46v).]]\n\nCodified systems of fighting with the longsword existed from the later 14th century, with a variety of styles and teachers each providing a slightly different take on the art. Hans Talhoffer, a mid-15th-century German fightmaster, is probably the most prominent, using a wide variety of moves, most resulting in wrestling. The longsword was a quick, effective, and versatile weapon capable of deadly thrusts, slices, and cuts.<ref name=\"medcombat\">{{cite book | last=Talhoffer | first=Hans | editor=Rector, Mark | title=Medieval Combat: A Fifteenth-Century Illustrated Manual of Swordfighting and Close-Quarter Combat | date=2000 | publisher=Greenhill Books | isbn=1853674184 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/medievalcombatfi00talh_0 }}</ref>{{rp|15\u201316}} The blade was generally used with both hands on the hilt, one resting close to or on the pommel. The weapon may be held with one hand during disarmament or grappling techniques.\nIn a depiction of a duel, individuals may be seen wielding sharply pointed longswords in one hand, leaving the other hand open to manipulate the large dueling shield.<ref name=medcombat />{{rp|plates 128\u2013150}}\n\nAnother variation of use comes from the use of armour. [[Half-sword]]ing was a manner of using both hands, one on the hilt and one on the blade, to better control the weapon in thrusts and jabs. This versatility was unique, as multiple works hold that the longsword provided the foundations for learning a variety of other weapons including [[spear]]s, [[Quarterstaff|staves]], and [[polearms]].<ref name=\"medcombat\" /><ref>{{cite book | last=Lindholm | first=David | title=Fighting with the Quarterstaff: A Modern Study of Renaissance Technique | location=Highland Village, Texas | date=2006 | publisher=Chivalry Bookshelf | isbn=9781891448362 | page=32}}</ref> Use of the longsword in attack was not limited only to use of the blade, however, as several Fechtb\u00fccher explain and depict use of the pommel and cross as offensive weapons.<ref name=medcombat />{{rp|73\u201373; plate 67}} The cross has been shown to be used as a hook for tripping or knocking an opponent off balance.<ref name=\"medcombat\" />{{rp|plate 58}} Some manuals even depict the cross as a hammer.<ref>{{cite book| author =Talhoffer, Hans | title=Fechtbuch | url =https://archive.org/details/fechtbuchausdemj00talh | year=1467|language=de}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known of combat with the longsword comes from artistic depictions of battle from manuscripts and the Fechtb\u00fccher of Medieval and Renaissance Masters. Therein the basics of combat were described and, in some cases, depicted. The [[German school of swordsmanship]] includes the earliest known longsword Fechtbuch, a manual from approximately 1389, known as [[N\u00fcrnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a|GNM 3227a]]. This manual, unfortunately for modern scholars, was written in obscure verse. It was through students of Liechtenauer, like [[Sigmund Ringeck]], who transcribed the work into more understandable prose<ref>{{cite book | author=Ringeck, Sigmund | title=MS Dresd. C 487 | url=http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Codex_Ringeck_%28MS_Dresd.C.487%29}}</ref> that the system became notably more codified and understandable.<ref name=linholm2003>{{cite book | last=Lindholm | first=David |author2=Svard, P.  | title=Sigmund Ringneck's Knightly Art of the Longsword | location=Boulder, Colorado | date=2003 | publisher=Paladin Press | isbn=1581604106 | page=11}}</ref> Others provided similar work, some with a wide array of images to accompany the text.<ref>{{cite book| author=Talhoffer, Hans | title=Thott 290 2 | url=http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Talhoffer_Fechtbuch_%28MS_Thott.290.2%C2%BA%29}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Italian school of swordsmanship]] was the other primary school of longsword use. The 1410 manuscript by [[Fiore dei Liberi]] presents a variety of uses for the longsword. Like the German manuals, the weapon is most commonly depicted and taught with both hands on the hilt. However, a section on one-handed use is among the volume and demonstrates the techniques and advantages, such as sudden additional reach, of single-handed longsword play.<ref>{{cite book| author=dei Liberi, Fiore | title=Flos Duellatorum | url=http://www.aemma.org/onlineResources/liberi/flos_dellaSpada.pdf|language=it}}</ref> The manual also presents half-sword techniques as an integral part of armoured combat.\n\nBoth schools declined in the late 16th century, with the later Italian masters forgoing the longsword and focusing primarily on [[rapier]] fencing. The last known German manual to include longsword teaching was that of [[Jacob Sutor|Jakob Sutor]], published in 1612. In Italy, ''{{lang|it|spadone}}'', or longsword, instruction lingered on despite the popularity of the rapier, at least into the mid-17th century (Alfieri's ''Lo Spadone'' of 1653), with a late treatise of the \"two handed sword\" by one [[Giuseppe Colombani]], a dentist in [[Venice]] dating to 1711. A tradition of teaching based on this has survived in contemporary French and Italian [[stick fighting]].<ref>See, for instance, Giuseppe Cerri's ''Trattato teorico e pratico della scherma di bastone'' of 1854.</ref>\n\n===German school of fencing===\n{{main|German school of fencing}}\n\n===={{lang|de|Blo\u00dffechten}}====\n[[File:De Fechtbuch Talhoffer 025.jpg|thumb|200px|Unarmoured longsword fencers (plate 25 of the 1467 manual of [[Hans Talhoffer]])]]\n''{{lang|de|Blo\u00dffechten}}'' (''blosz fechten'') or \"bare fighting\" is the technique of fighting without significant protective armour such as [[plate armour|plate]] or [[mail (armour)|mail]].\n\nThe lack of significant torso and limb protection leads to the use of a large amount of cutting and slicing techniques in addition to thrusts. These techniques could be nearly instantly fatal or incapacitating, as a thrust to the skull, heart, or major blood vessel would cause massive trauma. Similarly, strong strikes could cut through skin and bone, effectively amputating limbs. The hands and forearms are a frequent target of some cuts and slices in a defensive or offensive manoeuvre, serving both to disable an opponent and align the swordsman and his weapon for the next attack.\n\n====Harnischfechten====\n[[File:Augsburg Cod.I.6.4\u00ba.2 (Codex Wallerstein) 107v.jpg|thumb|200px|Page of the Codex Wallerstein showing a half-sword thrust against a two-handed sword's [[Mordstreich]] (Plate 214)]]\n''{{lang|de|Harnischfechten}}'', or \"armoured fighting\" (German ''{{lang|de|kampffechten}}'', or ''{{lang|de|Fechten in Harnisch zu Fuss}}'', literally \"fighting in armour on foot\"), depicts fighting in full [[plate armour]].<ref name=terms2>{{cite web|author=Clements, John | url=http://thearma.org/terms2.htm | title=Medieval and Renaissance Fencing Terminology}}</ref>\n\nThe increased defensive capability of a man clad in full plate armour caused the use of the sword to be drastically changed. While slashing attacks were still moderately effective against [[infantry]] wearing half-plate armour, cutting and slicing attacks against an opponent wearing [[plate armour]] were almost entirely ineffective in providing any sort of slashing wound as the sword simply could not cut through the steel, although a combatant could aim for the chinks in a suit of armour, sometimes to great effect.<ref name=knightly>{{cite book | last=Lindholm | first=David | last2=Sv\u00e4rd | first2=Peter | title=Signmund Ringeck's Knightly Arts of Combat | location=Boulder, Colorado | date=2006 | publisher=Paladin Press | isbn=1581604998 | page=219}}</ref> Instead, the energy of the cut becomes essentially pure [[impact force|concussive energy]]. The later hardened plate armours, complete with ridges and roping, posed a threat against the careless attacker. It is considered possible for strong blows of the sword against plate armour to damage the blade of the sword, potentially rendering it much less effective at cutting and producing only a concussive effect against the armoured opponent.\n\nTo overcome this problem, swords began to be used primarily for thrusting. The weapon was used in the half-sword, with one or both hands on the blade. This increased the accuracy and strength of thrusts and provided more leverage for ''{{lang|de|Ringen am Schwert}}'' or \"wrestling at/with the sword\". Also, the hand on the blade increases its rigidity which is advantageous when thrusting. This technique combines the use of the sword with wrestling, providing opportunities to trip, disarm, break, or throw an opponent and place them in a less offensively and defensively capable position. During half-swording, the entirety of the sword works as a weapon, including the pommel and crossguard. One example how a sword can be used this way is to thrust the tip of the crossguard at the opponent's head right after parrying a stroke. Another technique would be the [[Mordhau (weaponry)|Mordstreich]] (lit. \"murder stroke\"), where the weapon is held by the blade (hilt, pommel and crossguard serving as an improvised hammer head) and swung, taking advantage of the balance being close to the hilt to increase the concussive effect (see the fighter on the right of the Codex Wallerstein picture).<ref name=knightly />\n\n==See also==\n* [[English Longsword School]]\n* [[Historical European martial arts]]\n* [[wikt:montante|Montante]]\n* [[Ricasso]]\n* [[Waster]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n* {{cite journal | author=Cvet, David M. | url=http://www.ejmas.com/jwma/articles/2002/jwmaart_cvet_0102.htm | title=Study of the Destructive Capabilities of the European Longsword | journal=Journal of Western Martial Art | date=February 2002}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Dawson, Timothy | url=http://www.ejmas.com/jwma/articles/2005/jwmaart_dawson_0205.htm | title=A club with an edge | journal=Journal of Western Martial Art | date=February 2005}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Hellqvist, Bj\u00f6rn | url=http://www.ejmas.com/jwma/articles/2000/jwmaart_hellqvist_1100.htm | title=Oakeshott's Typology \u2013 An Introduction | journal=Journal of Western Martial Art | date=November 2000}}\n* {{cite journal| author=Melville, Neil H.

Only a few days after his promotion, he fought at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], where he commanded the [[Michigan Cavalry Brigade]] and despite being outnumbered, defeated [[J. E. B. Stuart]]'s attack at what is now known as the [[Battle of Gettysburg, third day cavalry battles|East Cavalry Field]]. In 1864, Custer served in the [[Overland Campaign]] and in Sheridan's army in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|Shenandoah Valley]], defeating [[Jubal Early]] at [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]]. His division blocked the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]'s final retreat and received the first flag of truce from the Confederates, and Custer was present at [[Robert E.

His class numbered seventy-nine cadets embarking on a five-year course of study. With the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, the course was shortened to four years, and Custer and his class graduated on June 24, 1861.

In his four years at West Point, he amassed a record-total of 726 demerits, one of the worst conduct records in the history of the academy. The local minister remembered Custer as \"\u201cthe instigator of devilish plots both during the service and in Sunday school.

Custer lost no time in implanting his aggressive character on his brigade, part of the division of Brigadier General [[Judson Kilpatrick]]. \n \nNow a general officer, Custer had great latitude in choosing his uniform. Though often criticized as gaudy, it was more than personal vanity. \"A showy uniform for Custer was one of command presence on the battlefield: he wanted to be readily distinguishable at first glance from all other soldiers. He intended to lead from the front, and to him it was a crucial issue of unit morale that his men be able to look up in the middle of a charge, or at any other time on the battlefield, and instantly see him leading the way into danger.\" <ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. (New York: G. P. Putnam & Sons, 2003), p. 119.</ref>\n\nSome have claimed Custer's leadership in battle as reckless or foolhardy. However, he \"meticulously scouted every battlefield, gauged the enemies{{sic}} weak points and strengths, ascertained the best line of attack and only after he was satisfied was the 'Custer Dash' with a Michigan yell focused with complete surprise on the enemy in routing them every time.\"<ref>Marguerite Merrington, The Custer Story In Letters.(Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1987).</ref>\n\n===Hanover and Abbottstown===\nOn June 30, 1863, Custer and the First and Seventh Michigan Cavalry had just passed through [[Hanover, Pennsylvania]], while the Fifth and Sixth Michigan Cavalry followed about seven miles behind. Hearing gunfire, he turned and started to the sound of the guns. A courier reported that Farnsworth's Brigade had been attacked by rebel cavalry from side streets in the town. Reassembling his command, he received orders from Kilpatrick to engage the enemy northeast of town near the railway station. Custer deployed his troops and began to advance. After a brief firefight, the rebels withdrew to the northeast. This seemed odd, since it was supposed that Lee and his army were somewhere to the west. Though seemingly of little consequence, this skirmish further delayed Stuart from joining Lee. Further, as Captain James H. Kidd, commander of F troop, Sixth Michigan Cavalry, later wrote:  \"Under [Custer's] skillful hand the four regiments were soon welded into a cohesive unit....\" <ref>James Harvey Kidd, ''Personal Recollections of a Cavalryman With Custer's Michigan Cavalry Brigade in the Civil War''. (Ionia, MI:The Sentinel Press, 1908), pp. 132\u2013133.</ref>\n\nNext morning, July 1, they passed through [[Abbottstown, Pennsylvania]], still searching for Stuart's cavalry. Late in the morning they heard sounds of gunfire from the direction of Gettysburg. At [[Heidlersburg, Pennsylvania]], that night they learned that General [[John Buford]]'s cavalry had found Lee's army at Gettysburg. The next morning, July 2, orders came to hurry north to disrupt General [[Richard S. Ewell]]'s communications and relieve the pressure on the union forces. By mid afternoon, as they approached [[Hunterstown, Pennsylvania]], they encountered Stuart's cavalry.<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. (New York: G. P. Putnam & Sons, 2003), pp. 126\u2013127.</ref> Custer rode alone ahead to investigate and found that the rebels were unaware of the arrival of his troops. Returning to his men, he carefully positioned them along both sides of the road where they would be hidden from the rebels. Further along the road, behind a low rise, he positioned the First and Fifth Michigan Cavalry and his artillery, under the command of Lieutenant [[Alexander Cummings McWhorter Pennington, Jr.]] To bait his trap, he gathered A Troop, Sixth Michigan Cavalry, called out, \"Come on boys, I'll lead you this time!\" and galloped directly at the unsuspecting rebels. As he had expected, the rebels, \"more than two hundred horsemen, came racing down the country road\" after Custer and his men. He lost half of his men in the deadly rebel fire and his horse went down, leaving him on foot.<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. New York: G. P.

The rebels broke off their attack, and both sides withdrew.\n\nAfter spending most of the night in the saddle, Custer's brigade arrived at [[Two Taverns, Pennsylvania]], roughly five miles southeast of Gettysburg around 3&nbsp;a.m. July 3. There he was joined by Farnsworth's brigade. By daybreak they received orders to protect Meade's flanks. He was about to experience perhaps his finest hours during the war.\n\n===Gettysburg===\n[[Robert E. Lee|Lee]]'s battle plan, shared with less than a handful of subordinates, was to defeat [[George Meade|Meade]] through a combined assault by all of his resources. General [[James Longstreet]] would attack [[Cemetery Hill]] from the west, [[J.E.B. Stuart|Stuart]] would attack [[Culp's Hill]] from the southeast and [[Richard S. Ewell|Ewell]] would attack Culp's Hill from the north. Once the Union forces holding Culp's Hill had collapsed, the rebels would \"roll up\" the remaining Union defenses on [[Cemetery Ridge]]. To accomplish this, he sent Stuart with six thousand cavalrymen and mounted infantry on a long, flanking maneuver.<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. (New York: G. P. Putnam & Sons, 2003), pp. 158-161.</ref>\n\nBy mid-morning, Custer had arrived at the intersection of Old Dutch road and Hanover Road. He was later joined by Brigadier General [[David McMurtrie Gregg]], who had him deploy his men at the northeast corner. Custer then sent out scouts to investigate nearby wooded areas. Gregg, meanwhile, placed Colonel [[John Baillie McIntosh]]'s brigade near the intersection and sent the rest of his command to picket duty along two miles to the southwest. After making additional deployments, that left 2,400 cavalry under McIntosh and 1,200 under Custer, together with Colonel [[Alexander Cummings McWhorter Pennington, Jr.]]'s and Captain [[Alanson Merwin Randol]]'s artillery, a total of ten three-inch guns.\n\nAbout noon Custer's men heard cannon fire, Stuart's signal to Lee that he was in position and had not been detected. About the same time Gregg received a message warning that a large body of rebel cavalry had moved out the York Pike and might be trying to get around the Union right. A second message, from Pleasonton, ordered Gregg to send Custer to cover the Union far left. Since Gregg had already sent most of his force off to other duties, it was clear to both Gregg and Custer that Custer must remain. They had about 2700 men facing 6000 Confederates.\n\nSoon afterward fighting broke out between the skirmish lines. Stuart ordered an attack by his mounted infantry under General [[Albert G. Jenkins]], but the Union line- men from the [[First Michigan cavalry]], the [[1st New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry|First New Jersey Cavalry]] and the [[Third Pennsylvania Cavalry]]- held. Stuart ordered Jackson's four gun battery into action. Custer ordered Pennington to answer. After a brief exchange in which two of Jackson's guns were destroyed, there was a lull.\n\nAbout one o'clock, the massive Confederate artillery barrage in support of the upcoming assault on Cemetery Ridge began. Jenkins' men renewed the attack, but soon ran out of ammunition and fell back. Resupplied, they again pressed the attack. Outnumbered, the Union cavalry fell back, firing as they went. Custer sent most of his Fifth Michigan cavalry ahead on foot, forcing Jenkins' men to fall back. Jenkins' men were reinforced by about 150 sharpshooters from General [[Fitzhugh Lee]]'s brigade and, shortly after, Stuart ordered a mounted charge by the [[Ninth Virginia Cavalry]] and the [[Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry]]. Now it was Custer's men who were running out of ammunition. The Fifth Michigan was forced back and the battle was reduced to vicious, hand-to-hand combat.\n\nSeeing this, Custer mounted a counter- attack, riding ahead of the fewer than 400 new troopers of the Seventh Michigan Cavalry, shouting, \"Come on, you Wolverines!\" As he swept forward, he formed a line of squadrons five ranks deep- five rows of eighty horsemen side by side- chasing the retreating rebels until their charge was stopped by a wood rail fence. The horses and men became jammed into a solid mass and were soon attacked on their left flank by the dismounted Ninth and Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry and on the right flank by the mounted First Virginia cavalry. Custer extricated his men and raced south to the protection of Pennington's artillery near Hanover Road. The pursuing Confederates were cut down by canister, then driven back by the remounted Fifth Michigan Cavalry. Both forces withdrew to a safe distance to regroup.\n\nIt was then about three o'clock. The artillery barrage to the west had suddenly stopped. Union soldiers were surprised to see Stuart's entire force about a half mile away, coming toward them, not in line of battle, but \"formed in close column of squadrons... A grander spectacle than their advance has rarely been beheld\".<ref>William E. Miller, \"The Cavalry Battle near Gettysburg\". ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'', Vol. 3, p. 402.</ref> Stuart recognized he now had little time to reach and attack the Union rear along Cemetery Ridge. He must make one, last effort to break through the Union cavalry.\n\nStuart passed by McIntosh's cavalry- the First New Jersey, Third Pennsylvania and Company A of Purnell's Legion- posted about half way down the field, with relative ease. As he approached, they were ordered back into the woods, without slowing down Stuart's column, \"advancing as if in review, with sabers drawn and glistening like silver in the bright sunlight....\" <ref>William Brooke-Rawle, The Right flank at Gettysburg\". (Philadelphia: McLaughlin Brothers, 1878), p. 20.</ref>\n\nStuart's last obstacle was Custer, with four hundred veteran troopers of the First Michigan Cavalry, directly in his path. Outnumbered but undaunted, Custer rode to the head of the regiment, \"drew his saber, threw off his hat so they could see his long yellow hair\" and shouted... \"Come on, you Wolverines!\"<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''.

Miller, \"The Cavalry Battle near Gettysburg\". ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'', Vol. 3, p. 404.</ref> As the Confederate advance stopped, their right flank was struck by troopers of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Michigan. McIntosh was able to gather some of his men from the First New Jersey and Third Pennsylvania and charged the rebel left flank. \"Seeing that the situation was becoming critical, I [Captain Miller] turned to [Lieutenant Brooke-Rawle] and said: \"I have been ordered to hold this position, but, if you will back me up in case I am court-martialed for disobedience, I will order a charge.\"<ref>William E. Miller, \"The Cavalry Battle near Gettysburg\". ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'', Vol. 3, pp. 404-405.</ref> The rebel column disintegrated into individual saber and pistol fights.\n\nWithin twenty minutes the combatants heard the sound of the Union artillery opening up on Pickett's men. Stuart knew that whatever chance he had of joining the Confederate assault was gone.

Gen. (CSA)|Confederate Lieutenant General]] [[Jubal Early]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. During May and June, Sheridan and Custer (Captain, 5th Cavalry, May 8 and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel, May 11) took part in cavalry actions supporting the [[Overland Campaign]], including the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] (after which Custer ascended to [[division (military)|division]] command), and the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]] (where [[J.E.B. Stuart]] was mortally wounded). In the largest all-cavalry engagement of the war, the [[Battle of Trevilian Station]], in which Sheridan sought to destroy the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] and the Confederates' western resupply route, Custer captured [[Wade Hampton III|Hampton's]] divisional train, but was then cut off and suffered heavy losses (including having his division's trains overrun and his personal baggage captured by the enemy) before being relieved. When Lieutenant General Early was then ordered to move down the Shenandoah Valley and threaten [[Washington, D.C.]], Custer's division was again dispatched under Sheridan. In the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], they pursued the Confederates at the [[Battle of Opequon|Third Battle of Winchester]] and effectively destroyed Early's army during Sheridan's [[Battle of Cedar Creek|counterattack at Cedar Creek]].\n\nSheridan and Custer, having defeated Early, returned to the main Union Army lines at the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where they spent the winter. In April 1865 the Confederate lines finally broke, and Robert E. Lee began his [[Appomattox Campaign|retreat]] to [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], pursued by the Union cavalry. Custer distinguished himself by his actions at [[Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]], [[Battle of Dinwiddie Court House|Dinwiddie Court House]], and [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]]. His division blocked Lee's retreat on its final day and received the first flag of truce from the Confederate force. After a truce was arranged Custer was escorted through the lines to meet Longstreet, who described Custer as having flaxen locks flowing over his shoulders, and Custer said \u201cin the name of General Sheridan I demand the unconditional surrender of this army.\u201d Longstreet replied that he was not in command of the army, but if he was he would not deal with messages from Sheridan. Custer responded it would be a pity to have more blood upon the field to which Longstreet suggested the truce be respected, and then added \u201cGeneral Lee has gone to meet General Grant, and it is for them to determine the future of the armies.\u201d<ref>Longstreet, p.627.</ref> Custer was present at the surrender at Appomattox Court House and the table upon which the surrender was signed was presented to him as a gift for his wife by Sheridan, who included a note to her praising Custer's gallantry. She treasured the gift of the historical table, which is now in the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref>Wert, p. 225.</ref>\n\nOn April 25, after the war officially ended, Custer had his men search for, then illegally seize a large, prize racehorse \"Don Juan\" near Clarksville, Virginia, worth then an estimated $10,000 (several hundred thousand today), along with his written pedigree. Custer rode Don Juan in the grand review victory parade in Washington, D.C. on May 23, creating a sensation when the scared thoroughbred bolted. The owner, Richard Gaines, wrote to General Grant, who then ordered Custer to return the horse to Gaines, but he did not, instead hiding the horse and winning a race with it the next year, before the horse died suddenly.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-custer-stole-thoroughbred-180956961/ |title=That Time When Custer Stole a Horse |magazine=Smithsonian Magazine |date=November 2015 |accessdate=2016-07-26 }}</ref>\n\n=== Promotions and ranks ===\nCuster's promotions and ranks including his six brevet [honorary] promotions which were all for gallant and meritorious services at five different battles and one campaign:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/Army/USMA/Cullums_Register/1966*.html|title=George Armstrong Custer: West Point Class of June 24, 1861 \u2022 Cullum's Register|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSecond lieutenant, 2nd Cavalry: June 24, 1861<br>\nFirst lieutenant, 5th Cavalry: July 17, 1862<br>\nCaptain staff, additional aide-de-camp: June 5, 1862<br>\nBrigadier general, U.S. Volunteers: June 29, 1863<br>\nBrevet major, July 3, 1863 (Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania)<br>\n\nCaptain, 5th Cavalry: May 8, 1864<br>\nBrevet lieutenant colonel: May 11, 1864 (Battle of Yellow Tavern \u2013 Combat at Meadow)<br>\n\nBrevet colonel: September 19, 1864 (Battle of Winchester, Virginia)<br>\nBrevet major general, U.S. Volunteers: October 19, 1864 (Battle of Winchester and Fisher's Hill, Virginia)<br>\nBrevet brigadier general, U.S. Army, March 13, 1865 (Battle of Five Forks, Virginia)<br>\nBrevet major general, U.S. Army: March 13, 1865 (The campaign ending in the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia)<br>\n\nMajor general, U.S. Volunteers: April 15, 1865<br>\nMustered out of Volunteer Service: February 1, 1866<br>\n\nLieutenant colonel, 7th Cavalry: July 28, 1866 (killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, June 25, 1876)<br>\n\n==Reconstruction duties in Texas==\nOn June 3, 1865, at Sheridan's behest, Major General Custer accepted command of the 2nd Division of Cavalry, Military Division of the Southwest, to march from [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], to [[Hempstead, Texas]], as part of the Union occupation forces. Custer arrived at Alexandria on June 27 and began assembling his units, which took more than a month to gather and remount. On July 17, he assumed command of the Cavalry Division of the Military Division of the Gulf (on August 5, officially named the 2nd Division of Cavalry of the Military Division of the Gulf), and accompanied by his wife, he led the division (five regiments of veteran Western Theater cavalrymen) to Texas on an arduous 18-day march in August. On October 27, the division departed to Austin. On October 29, Custer moved the division from Hempstead to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], arriving on November 4. Major General Custer became Chief of Cavalry of the Department of Texas, from November 13 to February 1, 1866, succeeding Major General [[Wesley Merritt]].\n\nDuring his entire period of command of the division, Custer encountered considerable friction and near mutiny from the volunteer cavalry regiments who had campaigned along the Gulf coast. They desired to be mustered out of Federal service rather than continue campaigning, resented imposition of discipline (particularly from an Eastern Theater general), and considered Custer nothing more than a vain dandy.<ref>Wert (1996), pp. 232\u2013238.</ref><ref>Richter, William L. \"It is Best to Go Strong-Armed: Army Occupation of Texas, 1865\u201366\", ''Arizona and The West'' (Summer 1985), Vol. 27, No. 2, p. 121-122.</ref>\n\nCuster's division was mustered out beginning in November 1865, replaced by the regulars of the [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 6th Cavalry Regiment]]. Although their occupation of Austin had apparently been pleasant, many veterans harbored deep resentments against Custer, particularly in the [[2nd Regiment Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry|2nd Wisconsin Cavalry]], because of his attempts to maintain discipline. Upon its mustering out, several members planned to ambush Custer, but he was warned the night before and the attempt thwarted.<ref>Richter, \"It is Best to Go Strong-Armed: Army Occupation of Texas, 1865\u201366\", p. 135.</ref>\n\n==American Indian Wars==\n[[File:Maj.

Grant|Grant]] and Secretary of War Stanton. Sheridan and Mrs. Custer disapproved, however, and when his request for leave was opposed by U.S. Secretary of State [[William H.

He took part in public discussion over the treatment of the [[Southern United States|American South]] in the aftermath of the Civil War, advocating a policy of moderation.<ref name=\"utley-39\"/> He was named head of the Soldiers and Sailors Union, regarded as a response to the hyper-partisan [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR). Also formed in 1866, it was led by Republican activist [[John A. Logan|John Alexander Logan]]. In September 1866 Custer accompanied President [[Andrew Johnson]] on a journey by train known as the \"[[Swing Around the Circle]]\" to build up public support for Johnson's policies towards the South. Custer denied a charge by the newspapers that Johnson had promised him a colonel's commission in return for his support, but Custer had written to Johnson some weeks before seeking such a commission. Custer and his wife stayed with the president during most of the trip. At one point Custer confronted a small group of Ohio men who repeatedly jeered Johnson, saying to them: \"I was born two miles and a half from here, but I am ashamed of you.\"<ref name=\"utley-39-40\">Utley 2001, pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 1866, Custer was appointed lieutenant colonel of the newly created [[7th Cavalry Regiment]],<ref name=\"utley-40\">Utley 2001, p. 40.</ref> which was headquartered at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]].<ref name=\"utley-41\">Utley 2001, p. 41.</ref> He served on frontier duty at Fort Riley from October 18 to March 26, and scouted in Kansas and Colorado to July 28. 1867. He took part in Major General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]]'s expedition against the [[Cheyenne]]. On June 26, Lt. Lyman Kidder's party, made up of ten troopers and one scout, were massacred while en route to [[Fort Wallace]]. Lt. Kidder was to deliver dispatches to Custer from [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]], but his party was attacked by Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne (see ''[[Kidder fight|Kidder massacre]]''). Days later, Custer and a search party found the bodies of Kidder's patrol.\n\nFollowing the Hancock campaign, Custer was arrested and suspended at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]], to August 12, 1868, for being [[AWOL]], after having abandoned his post to see his wife. At the request of Major General Sheridan, who wanted Custer for his planned winter campaign against the Cheyenne, Custer was allowed to return to duty before his one-year term of suspension had expired and joined his regiment to October 7, 1868. He then went on frontier duty, scouting in Kansas and [[Indian Territory]] to October 1869.\n\nUnder Sheridan's orders, Custer took part in establishing [[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]] in Indian Territory in early November 1868 as a supply base for the winter campaign. On November 27, 1868, Custer led the 7th Cavalry Regiment in an attack on the Cheyenne encampment of Chief [[Black Kettle]] \u2013 the [[Battle of Washita River]]. Custer reported killing 103 warriors and some women and children; 53 women and children were taken as prisoners. Estimates by the Cheyenne of their casualties were substantially lower (11 warriors plus 19 women and children).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of the Battle of the Washita|publisher=National Park Service (USA)|date=November 1999|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/waba/story.htm|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> Custer had his men shoot most of the 875 Indian ponies they had captured.<ref name=Schultz2010>{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane|title=Custer: lessons in leadership|chapter=The snow was made red with blood|pages=111\u201326|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-11424-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DorvCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA124&dq=Now+Custer+had+to+decide+what+to+do+with+the+875+horses#v=onepage&q=Now%20Custer%20had%20to%20decide%20what%20to%20do%20with%20the%20875%20horses&f=false}}</ref> The Battle of Washita River was regarded as the first substantial U.S. victory in the [[American Indian Wars#Sheridan's campaigns|Southern Plains War]], and it helped force a significant portion of the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Southern Cheyenne]] onto a U.S.-assigned reservation.\n\nIn 1873, Custer was sent to the [[Dakota Territory]] to protect a railroad survey party against the [[Lakota people|Lakota]]. On August 4, 1873, near the [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]], Custer and the 7th Cavalry Regiment clashed for the first time with the Lakota. One man on each side was killed. In 1874 Custer led [[Black Hills Expedition|an expedition]] into the [[Black Hills]] and announced the discovery of gold on [[French Creek (Cheyenne River)|French Creek]] near present-day [[Custer, South Dakota]]. Custer's announcement triggered the [[Black Hills Gold Rush]]. Among the towns that immediately grew up was [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], notorious for lawlessness.\n\n==Grant, Belknap and politics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n{{further|Trader post scandal}}\n[[File:Custer9.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer, 7th U.S. Cavalry, ca. 1875]]\nIn 1875, the Grant administration attempted to buy the [[Black Hills]] region from the Sioux. When the Sioux refused to sell, they were ordered to report to reservations by the end of January, 1876. Mid-winter conditions made it impossible for them to comply. The administration labeled them \"hostiles\" and tasked the Army with bringing them in. Custer was to command an expedition planned for the spring, part of a three-pronged campaign. While Custer's expedition marched west from [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]], near present-day [[Mandan, North Dakota]], troops under Colonel [[John Gibbon]] were to march east from [[Fort Ellis]], near present-day [[Bozeman, Montana]] while a force under General [[George Crook]] was to march north from [[Fort Fetterman]], near present-day [[Douglas, Wyoming]].\n\nCuster's 7th Cavalry was originally scheduled to leave [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] on April 6, 1876, but on March 15 he was summoned to Washington to testify at congressional hearings. Rep. [[Hiester Clymer]]'s Committee was investigating alleged corruption involving Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] (who had resigned March 2), President Grant's brother Orvil and traders granted monopolies at frontier Army posts.<ref>Edgar I. Stewart, ''Custer's Luck''. (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press,1967) p. 124.</ref> It was alleged that Belknap had been selling these lucrative trading post positions where soldiers were required to make their purchases. Custer himself had experienced first hand the high prices being charged at Fort Lincoln.<ref>Stewart, ''Custer's Luck''. pp. 120-121</ref>\n\nConcerned that he might miss the coming campaign, Custer did not want to go to Washington. He asked to answer questions in writing, but Clymer insisted.<ref>Stewart, Custer's Luck, p. 124.</ref> Recognizing that his testimony would be explosive, Custer tried \"to follow a moderate and prudent course, avoiding prominence.\" <ref>Marguerite Merrington, ''The Custer Story: The Life and Intimate Letters of General George A. Custer and his Wife Elizabeth''. (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1987), p. 293.</ref> Despite his care, his testimony was a sensation: Custer was sharply criticized by the Republican press and loudly praised by the Democratic press.\n\nAfter Custer testified on March 29 and April 4, Belknap was impeached and the case sent to the Senate for trial. Custer asked the impeachment managers to release him from further testimony. With the help of a request from his superior, Brigadier General [[Alfred Terry]], Commander of the [[Department of Dakota]], he was excused. Then President Ulysses S. Grant intervened.\n\nThe Congressional investigation had created a serious rift with Grant. Custer had written articles published anonymously in ''The New York Herald'' that exposed trader post kickback rings and implied that Belknap was behind the rings. Moreover, during the investigation, Custer testified on hearsay evidence that President Grant's brother Orvil was involved. Grant had also not forgotten that Custer had once arrested his son Fred for drunkenness. Infuriated, Grant decided to retaliate by stripping Custer of his command in the upcoming campaign.\n\nGeneral Terry protested, saying he had no available officers of rank qualified to replace Custer. Both Sheridan and Sherman wanted Custer in command but had to support Grant. General Sherman, hoping to resolve the issue, advised Custer to meet personally with President Grant before leaving Washington. Three times Custer requested meetings with Grant, but each request was refused.<ref>Merrington, The Custer Story. p. 281</ref>\n\nFinally, Custer gave up and took a train to [[Chicago]] on May 2, planning to rejoin his regiment. A furious Grant ordered Sheridan to arrest Custer for leaving Washington without permission. On May 3, a member of Sheridan's staff arrested Custer as he arrived in Chicago.<ref>Stewart, ''Custer's Luck'', pp. 132-133.</ref> The arrest sparked public outrage. The New York Herald called Grant the \"modern Caesar\" and asked, \"Are officers... to be dragged from railroad trains and ignominiously ordered to stand aside until the whims of the Chief magistrate ... are satisfied?\"<ref>James Wengert, ''The Custer Dispatches''. (Manhattan, KS: Sunflower University Press, 1987), p. 5</ref>\n\nGrant relented but insisted that Terry\u2014not Custer\u2014personally command the expedition. Terry met Custer in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] on May 6. He later recalled, \"(Custer) with tears in his eyes, begged for my aid.

European-Americans continually broke treaty agreements and advanced further westward, resulting in violence and acts of depredation by both sides. To take possession of the [[Black Hills]] (and thus the gold deposits), and to stop Indian attacks, the U.S. decided to corral all remaining free Plains Indians.

The surviving troopers apparently shot their remaining horses to use as [[breastworks]] for a final stand on the knoll at the north end of the ridge. The warriors closed in for the final attack and killed every man in Custer's command.

He says that Joseph White Bull stated he had shot a rider wearing a buckskin jacket and big hat at the riverside when the soldiers first approached the village from the east. The initial force facing the soldiers, according to this version, was quite small (possibly as few as four warriors) yet challenged Custer's command. The rider who was hit was mounted next to a rider who bore a flag and had shouted orders that prompted the soldiers to attack, but when the buckskin-clad rider fell off his horse after being shot, many of the attackers reined up. The allegation that the buckskin-clad officer was Custer, if accurate, might explain the supposed rapid disintegration of Custer's forces.<ref>Connell (1984), pp. 413\u2013414.</ref> However, several other officers of the Seventh, including William Cooke, Tom Custer and William Sturgis, were also dressed in buckskin on the day of the battle, and the fact that each of the non-mutilation wounds to George Custer's body (a bullet wound below the heart and a shot to the left temple) would have been instantly fatal casts doubt on his being wounded or killed at the ford, more than a mile from where his body was found.<ref>Wert, 1996, p. 355.</ref> The circumstances are, however, consistent with [[David Humphreys Miller]]'s suggestion that Custer's attendants would not have left his dead body behind to be desecrated.<ref>[[David Humphreys Miller]], ''Custer's Fall: The Indian Side of the Story''. University of Nebraska Press, 1985.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, two elderly Cheyenne women spoke briefly with oral historians about their having recognized Custer's body on the battlefield and said that they had stopped a Sioux warrior from desecrating the body. The women were relatives of [[Mo-nah-se-tah]], who was alleged to have been Custer's lover in late 1868 and through 1869, and borne two children by him. In the Cheyenne culture of the time, such a relationship was considered a marriage. The women allegedly told the warrior: \"Stop, he is a relative of ours,\" and then shooed him away. The two women said they shoved their [[Stitching awl|sewing awls]] into his ears to permit Custer's corpse to \"hear better in the afterlife\" because he had broken his promise to [[Stone Forehead]] never to fight against Native Americans again.<ref>{{cite news|magazine=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]| date=November 2010|title=How Little Bighorn was won|author=Powers, Thomas }}</ref>\n\nWhen the main column under General Terry arrived two days later, the army found most of the soldiers' corpses stripped, scalped, and mutilated.<ref>Marshall 2007, p. 11</ref><ref>Welch 2007, pp. 175\u2013181.</ref> Custer's body had two bullet holes, one in the left temple and one just below the heart.<ref>Welch 2007, p. 175.</ref> Capt.

He worked closely with General [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]] and the future General [[Alfred Pleasonton|Pleasonton]], both of whom recognized his qualities as a cavalry leader, and he was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers at age 23. Only a few days after his promotion, he fought at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], where he commanded the [[Michigan Cavalry Brigade]] and despite being outnumbered, defeated [[J. E. B. Stuart]]'s attack at what is now known as the [[Battle of Gettysburg, third day cavalry battles|East Cavalry Field]]. In 1864, Custer served in the [[Overland Campaign]] and in Sheridan's army in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|Shenandoah Valley]], defeating [[Jubal Early]] at [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]]. His division blocked the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]'s final retreat and received the first flag of truce from the Confederates, and Custer was present at [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender to [[Ulysses S. Grant]] at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]].\n\nAfter the war, Custer was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and was sent west to fight in the Indian Wars.

When I took him to the doctor to have the tooth pulled, it was in the night and I told him if it bled well it would get well right away, and he must be a good soldier. When he got to the doctor he took his seat, and the pulling began. The forceps slipped off and he had to make a second trial. He pulled it out, and Autie never even scrunched. Going home, I led him by the arm. He jumped and skipped, and said 'Father you and me can whip all the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in Michigan.' I thought that was saying a good deal but I did not contradict him.\" <ref>Elizabeth Bacon Custer, ''Tenting on the Plains, or  General Custer in Kansas and Texas''.

It was to train teachers for elementary schools. While attending Hopedale, Custer and classmate William Enos Emery were known to have carried coal to help pay for their room and board. After graduating from McNeely Normal School in 1856, Custer taught school in [[Cadiz, Ohio]].<ref name=\"Custer Lives Bio\">{{cite web|title=General George Custer Biography, US 7th Cavalry|url=http://custerlives.com/custer1.htm|publisher=Custer Lives!|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref> His first sweetheart was Mary Jane Holland.<ref>Jim Donovan, ''Custer and the Little Bighorn: The Man, The Mystery, The Myth'', 2011 - 0785825894, p 22.

His class numbered seventy-nine cadets embarking on a five-year course of study. With the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, the course was shortened to four years, and Custer and his class graduated on June 24, 1861. He was 34th in a class of 34 graduates: 23 classmates had dropped out for academic reasons while 22 classmates had already resigned to join the Confederacy.<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. (New York: G. P. Putnam & Sons, 2003), p. 39.</ref>\n\nThroughout his life, Custer tested boundaries and rules. In his four years at West Point, he amassed a record-total of 726 demerits, one of the worst conduct records in the history of the academy. The local minister remembered Custer as \"\u201cthe instigator of devilish plots both during the service and in Sunday school. On the surface he appeared attentive and respectful, but underneath the mind boiled with disruptive ideas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Custer|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}</ref> \u201dA fellow cadet recalled Custer as declaring there were only two places in a class, the head and the foot, and since he had no desire to be the head, he aspired to be the foot.

On July 21, 1861, he was with his regiment at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] during the [[Manassas Campaign]], where Army commander [[Winfield Scott]] detailed him to carry messages to Major General [[Irvin McDowell]]. After the battle, Custer continued participating in the defenses of Washington D.C. until October, when he became ill.<!-- From what? --> He was absent from his unit until February 1862. In March, he participated with the 2nd Cavalry in the [[Peninsula Campaign]] (March to August) in Virginia until April 4.\n\nOn April 5, Custer served in the [[5th Cavalry Regiment]] and participated in the [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)|Siege of Yorktown]], from April 5 to May 4 and was aide to [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George B.

Barnard|General Barnard]] and his staff were reconnoitering a potential crossing point on the [[Chickahominy River]], they stopped, and Custer overheard Barnard mutter, \"I wish I knew how deep it is.\" Custer dashed forward on his horse out to the middle of the river, turned to the astonished officers, and shouted triumphantly, \"That's how deep it is, Mr. General!\"<ref name=\"tagg\"/> \n\nCuster was allowed to lead an attack with four companies of the 4th Michigan Infantry across the [[Chickahominy River]] above New Bridge. The attack was successful, resulting in the capture of 50 Confederate soldiers and the seizing of the first Confederate battle flag of the war. McClellan termed it a \"very gallant affair\" and congratulated Custer personally. In his role as aide-de-camp to McClellan, Custer began his life-long pursuit of publicity.<ref name=\"tagg\">Tagg, Larry. (1988).

On June 29, after consulting with his new commander, [[George Meade]], Pleasanton began replacing political generals with \"commanders who were prepared to fight, to personally lead mounted attacks\".<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''.

Custer lost no time in implanting his aggressive character on his brigade, part of the division of Brigadier General [[Judson Kilpatrick]]. \n \nNow a general officer, Custer had great latitude in choosing his uniform. Though often criticized as gaudy, it was more than personal vanity. \"A showy uniform for Custer was one of command presence on the battlefield: he wanted to be readily distinguishable at first glance from all other soldiers. He intended to lead from the front, and to him it was a crucial issue of unit morale that his men be able to look up in the middle of a charge, or at any other time on the battlefield, and instantly see him leading the way into danger.\" <ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. (New York: G. P. Putnam & Sons, 2003), p. 119.</ref>\n\nSome have claimed Custer's leadership in battle as reckless or foolhardy. However, he \"meticulously scouted every battlefield, gauged the enemies{{sic}} weak points and strengths, ascertained the best line of attack and only after he was satisfied was the 'Custer Dash' with a Michigan yell focused with complete surprise on the enemy in routing them every time.\"<ref>Marguerite Merrington, The Custer Story In Letters.(Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1987).</ref>\n\n===Hanover and Abbottstown===\nOn June 30, 1863, Custer and the First and Seventh Michigan Cavalry had just passed through [[Hanover, Pennsylvania]], while the Fifth and Sixth Michigan Cavalry followed about seven miles behind. Hearing gunfire, he turned and started to the sound of the guns. A courier reported that Farnsworth's Brigade had been attacked by rebel cavalry from side streets in the town. Reassembling his command, he received orders from Kilpatrick to engage the enemy northeast of town near the railway station. Custer deployed his troops and began to advance. After a brief firefight, the rebels withdrew to the northeast. This seemed odd, since it was supposed that Lee and his army were somewhere to the west. Though seemingly of little consequence, this skirmish further delayed Stuart from joining Lee. Further, as Captain James H. Kidd, commander of F troop, Sixth Michigan Cavalry, later wrote:  \"Under [Custer's] skillful hand the four regiments were soon welded into a cohesive unit....\" <ref>James Harvey Kidd, ''Personal Recollections of a Cavalryman With Custer's Michigan Cavalry Brigade in the Civil War''. (Ionia, MI:The Sentinel Press, 1908), pp. 132\u2013133.</ref>\n\nNext morning, July 1, they passed through [[Abbottstown, Pennsylvania]], still searching for Stuart's cavalry. Late in the morning they heard sounds of gunfire from the direction of Gettysburg. At [[Heidlersburg, Pennsylvania]], that night they learned that General [[John Buford]]'s cavalry had found Lee's army at Gettysburg. The next morning, July 2, orders came to hurry north to disrupt General [[Richard S. Ewell]]'s communications and relieve the pressure on the union forces. By mid afternoon, as they approached [[Hunterstown, Pennsylvania]], they encountered Stuart's cavalry.<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. (New York: G. P. Putnam & Sons, 2003), pp. 126\u2013127.</ref> Custer rode alone ahead to investigate and found that the rebels were unaware of the arrival of his troops. Returning to his men, he carefully positioned them along both sides of the road where they would be hidden from the rebels. Further along the road, behind a low rise, he positioned the First and Fifth Michigan Cavalry and his artillery, under the command of Lieutenant [[Alexander Cummings McWhorter Pennington, Jr.]] To bait his trap, he gathered A Troop, Sixth Michigan Cavalry, called out, \"Come on boys, I'll lead you this time!\" and galloped directly at the unsuspecting rebels. As he had expected, the rebels, \"more than two hundred horsemen, came racing down the country road\" after Custer and his men. He lost half of his men in the deadly rebel fire and his horse went down, leaving him on foot.<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. New York: G. P. Putnam & Sons, 2003, pp. 132\u2013133.</ref> He was rescued by Private Norvell Francis Churchill of the 1st Michigan Cavalry, who galloped up, shot Custer's nearest assailant, and pulled Custer up behind him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Connell|first1=Mike|title=Custer and the Man Who Saved im|url=http://archive.thetimesherald.com/article/20111009/OPINION02/110090313/Custer-man-who-saved-him|website=The Times Herald|publisher=Gannett|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> Custer and his remaining men reached safety, while the pursuing rebels were cut down by slashing rifle fire, then [[Canister shot|canister]] from six cannons. The rebels broke off their attack, and both sides withdrew.\n\nAfter spending most of the night in the saddle, Custer's brigade arrived at [[Two Taverns, Pennsylvania]], roughly five miles southeast of Gettysburg around 3&nbsp;a.m. July 3. There he was joined by Farnsworth's brigade. By daybreak they received orders to protect Meade's flanks. He was about to experience perhaps his finest hours during the war.\n\n===Gettysburg===\n[[Robert E. Lee|Lee]]'s battle plan, shared with less than a handful of subordinates, was to defeat [[George Meade|Meade]] through a combined assault by all of his resources. General [[James Longstreet]] would attack [[Cemetery Hill]] from the west, [[J.E.B. Stuart|Stuart]] would attack [[Culp's Hill]] from the southeast and [[Richard S. Ewell|Ewell]] would attack Culp's Hill from the north. Once the Union forces holding Culp's Hill had collapsed, the rebels would \"roll up\" the remaining Union defenses on [[Cemetery Ridge]]. To accomplish this, he sent Stuart with six thousand cavalrymen and mounted infantry on a long, flanking maneuver.<ref>Tom Carhart, ''Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed''. (New York: G. P. Putnam & Sons, 2003), pp. 158-161.</ref>\n\nBy mid-morning, Custer had arrived at the intersection of Old Dutch road and Hanover Road. He was later joined by Brigadier General [[David McMurtrie Gregg]], who had him deploy his men at the northeast corner. Custer then sent out scouts to investigate nearby wooded areas. Gregg, meanwhile, placed Colonel [[John Baillie McIntosh]]'s brigade near the intersection and sent the rest of his command to picket duty along two miles to the southwest. After making additional deployments, that left 2,400 cavalry under McIntosh and 1,200 under Custer, together with Colonel [[Alexander Cummings McWhorter Pennington, Jr.]]'s and Captain [[Alanson Merwin Randol]]'s artillery, a total of ten three-inch guns.\n\nAbout noon Custer's men heard cannon fire, Stuart's signal to Lee that he was in position and had not been detected. About the same time Gregg received a message warning that a large body of rebel cavalry had moved out the York Pike and might be trying to get around the Union right. A second message, from Pleasonton, ordered Gregg to send Custer to cover the Union far left. Since Gregg had already sent most of his force off to other duties, it was clear to both Gregg and Custer that Custer must remain. They had about 2700 men facing 6000 Confederates.\n\nSoon afterward fighting broke out between the skirmish lines. Stuart ordered an attack by his mounted infantry under General [[Albert G. Jenkins]], but the Union line- men from the [[First Michigan cavalry]], the [[1st New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry|First New Jersey Cavalry]] and the [[Third Pennsylvania Cavalry]]- held. Stuart ordered Jackson's four gun battery into action. Custer ordered Pennington to answer. After a brief exchange in which two of Jackson's guns were destroyed, there was a lull.\n\nAbout one o'clock, the massive Confederate artillery barrage in support of the upcoming assault on Cemetery Ridge began. Jenkins' men renewed the attack, but soon ran out of ammunition and fell back. Resupplied, they again pressed the attack. Outnumbered, the Union cavalry fell back, firing as they went. Custer sent most of his Fifth Michigan cavalry ahead on foot, forcing Jenkins' men to fall back. Jenkins' men were reinforced by about 150 sharpshooters from General [[Fitzhugh Lee]]'s brigade and, shortly after, Stuart ordered a mounted charge by the [[Ninth Virginia Cavalry]] and the [[Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry]]. Now it was Custer's men who were running out of ammunition. The Fifth Michigan was forced back and the battle was reduced to vicious, hand-to-hand combat.\n\nSeeing this, Custer mounted a counter- attack, riding ahead of the fewer than 400 new troopers of the Seventh Michigan Cavalry, shouting, \"Come on, you Wolverines!\" As he swept forward, he formed a line of squadrons five ranks deep- five rows of eighty horsemen side by side- chasing the retreating rebels until their charge was stopped by a wood rail fence. The horses and men became jammed into a solid mass and were soon attacked on their left flank by the dismounted Ninth and Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry and on the right flank by the mounted First Virginia cavalry. Custer extricated his men and raced south to the protection of Pennington's artillery near Hanover Road. The pursuing Confederates were cut down by canister, then driven back by the remounted Fifth Michigan Cavalry. Both forces withdrew to a safe distance to regroup.\n\nIt was then about three o'clock. The artillery barrage to the west had suddenly stopped.

Gen. (CSA)|Confederate Lieutenant General]] [[Jubal Early]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. During May and June, Sheridan and Custer (Captain, 5th Cavalry, May 8 and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel, May 11) took part in cavalry actions supporting the [[Overland Campaign]], including the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] (after which Custer ascended to [[division (military)|division]] command), and the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]] (where [[J.E.B. Stuart]] was mortally wounded). In the largest all-cavalry engagement of the war, the [[Battle of Trevilian Station]], in which Sheridan sought to destroy the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] and the Confederates' western resupply route, Custer captured [[Wade Hampton III|Hampton's]] divisional train, but was then cut off and suffered heavy losses (including having his division's trains overrun and his personal baggage captured by the enemy) before being relieved. When Lieutenant General Early was then ordered to move down the Shenandoah Valley and threaten [[Washington, D.C.]], Custer's division was again dispatched under Sheridan. In the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], they pursued the Confederates at the [[Battle of Opequon|Third Battle of Winchester]] and effectively destroyed Early's army during Sheridan's [[Battle of Cedar Creek|counterattack at Cedar Creek]].\n\nSheridan and Custer, having defeated Early, returned to the main Union Army lines at the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where they spent the winter. In April 1865 the Confederate lines finally broke, and Robert E. Lee began his [[Appomattox Campaign|retreat]] to [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], pursued by the Union cavalry. Custer distinguished himself by his actions at [[Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]], [[Battle of Dinwiddie Court House|Dinwiddie Court House]], and [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]]. His division blocked Lee's retreat on its final day and received the first flag of truce from the Confederate force. After a truce was arranged Custer was escorted through the lines to meet Longstreet, who described Custer as having flaxen locks flowing over his shoulders, and Custer said \u201cin the name of General Sheridan I demand the unconditional surrender of this army.\u201d Longstreet replied that he was not in command of the army, but if he was he would not deal with messages from Sheridan. Custer responded it would be a pity to have more blood upon the field to which Longstreet suggested the truce be respected, and then added \u201cGeneral Lee has gone to meet General Grant, and it is for them to determine the future of the armies.\u201d<ref>Longstreet, p.627.</ref> Custer was present at the surrender at Appomattox Court House and the table upon which the surrender was signed was presented to him as a gift for his wife by Sheridan, who included a note to her praising Custer's gallantry. She treasured the gift of the historical table, which is now in the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref>Wert, p. 225.</ref>\n\nOn April 25, after the war officially ended, Custer had his men search for, then illegally seize a large, prize racehorse \"Don Juan\" near Clarksville, Virginia, worth then an estimated $10,000 (several hundred thousand today), along with his written pedigree. Custer rode Don Juan in the grand review victory parade in Washington, D.C. on May 23, creating a sensation when the scared thoroughbred bolted. The owner, Richard Gaines, wrote to General Grant, who then ordered Custer to return the horse to Gaines, but he did not, instead hiding the horse and winning a race with it the next year, before the horse died suddenly.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-custer-stole-thoroughbred-180956961/ |title=That Time When Custer Stole a Horse |magazine=Smithsonian Magazine |date=November 2015 |accessdate=2016-07-26 }}</ref>\n\n=== Promotions and ranks ===\nCuster's promotions and ranks including his six brevet [honorary] promotions which were all for gallant and meritorious services at five different battles and one campaign:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/Army/USMA/Cullums_Register/1966*.html|title=George Armstrong Custer: West Point Class of June 24, 1861 \u2022 Cullum's Register|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSecond lieutenant, 2nd Cavalry: June 24, 1861<br>\nFirst lieutenant, 5th Cavalry: July 17, 1862<br>\nCaptain staff, additional aide-de-camp: June 5, 1862<br>\nBrigadier general, U.S. Volunteers: June 29, 1863<br>\nBrevet major, July 3, 1863 (Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania)<br>\n\nCaptain, 5th Cavalry: May 8, 1864<br>\nBrevet lieutenant colonel: May 11, 1864 (Battle of Yellow Tavern \u2013 Combat at Meadow)<br>\n\nBrevet colonel: September 19, 1864 (Battle of Winchester, Virginia)<br>\nBrevet major general, U.S. Volunteers: October 19, 1864 (Battle of Winchester and Fisher's Hill, Virginia)<br>\nBrevet brigadier general, U.S. Army, March 13, 1865 (Battle of Five Forks, Virginia)<br>\nBrevet major general, U.S. Army: March 13, 1865 (The campaign ending in the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia)<br>\n\nMajor general, U.S. Volunteers: April 15, 1865<br>\nMustered out of Volunteer Service: February 1, 1866<br>\n\nLieutenant colonel, 7th Cavalry: July 28, 1866 (killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, June 25, 1876)<br>\n\n==Reconstruction duties in Texas==\nOn June 3, 1865, at Sheridan's behest, Major General Custer accepted command of the 2nd Division of Cavalry, Military Division of the Southwest, to march from [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], to [[Hempstead, Texas]], as part of the Union occupation forces. Custer arrived at Alexandria on June 27 and began assembling his units, which took more than a month to gather and remount. On July 17, he assumed command of the Cavalry Division of the Military Division of the Gulf (on August 5, officially named the 2nd Division of Cavalry of the Military Division of the Gulf), and accompanied by his wife, he led the division (five regiments of veteran Western Theater cavalrymen) to Texas on an arduous 18-day march in August. On October 27, the division departed to Austin. On October 29, Custer moved the division from Hempstead to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], arriving on November 4. Major General Custer became Chief of Cavalry of the Department of Texas, from November 13 to February 1, 1866, succeeding Major General [[Wesley Merritt]].\n\nDuring his entire period of command of the division, Custer encountered considerable friction and near mutiny from the volunteer cavalry regiments who had campaigned along the Gulf coast. They desired to be mustered out of Federal service rather than continue campaigning, resented imposition of discipline (particularly from an Eastern Theater general), and considered Custer nothing more than a vain dandy.<ref>Wert (1996), pp. 232\u2013238.</ref><ref>Richter, William L. \"It is Best to Go Strong-Armed: Army Occupation of Texas, 1865\u201366\", ''Arizona and The West'' (Summer 1985), Vol. 27, No. 2, p. 121-122.</ref>\n\nCuster's division was mustered out beginning in November 1865, replaced by the regulars of the [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 6th Cavalry Regiment]]. Although their occupation of Austin had apparently been pleasant, many veterans harbored deep resentments against Custer, particularly in the [[2nd Regiment Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry|2nd Wisconsin Cavalry]], because of his attempts to maintain discipline. Upon its mustering out, several members planned to ambush Custer, but he was warned the night before and the attempt thwarted.<ref>Richter, \"It is Best to Go Strong-Armed: Army Occupation of Texas, 1865\u201366\", p. 135.</ref>\n\n==American Indian Wars==\n[[File:Maj.

Grant|Grant]] and Secretary of War Stanton. Sheridan and Mrs. Custer disapproved, however, and when his request for leave was opposed by U.S. Secretary of State [[William H.

He took part in public discussion over the treatment of the [[Southern United States|American South]] in the aftermath of the Civil War, advocating a policy of moderation.<ref name=\"utley-39\"/> He was named head of the Soldiers and Sailors Union, regarded as a response to the hyper-partisan [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR). Also formed in 1866, it was led by Republican activist [[John A. Logan|John Alexander Logan]]. In September 1866 Custer accompanied President [[Andrew Johnson]] on a journey by train known as the \"[[Swing Around the Circle]]\" to build up public support for Johnson's policies towards the South. Custer denied a charge by the newspapers that Johnson had promised him a colonel's commission in return for his support, but Custer had written to Johnson some weeks before seeking such a commission. Custer and his wife stayed with the president during most of the trip. At one point Custer confronted a small group of Ohio men who repeatedly jeered Johnson, saying to them: \"I was born two miles and a half from here, but I am ashamed of you.\"<ref name=\"utley-39-40\">Utley 2001, pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 1866, Custer was appointed lieutenant colonel of the newly created [[7th Cavalry Regiment]],<ref name=\"utley-40\">Utley 2001, p. 40.</ref> which was headquartered at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]].<ref name=\"utley-41\">Utley 2001, p. 41.</ref> He served on frontier duty at Fort Riley from October 18 to March 26, and scouted in Kansas and Colorado to July 28. 1867. He took part in Major General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]]'s expedition against the [[Cheyenne]]. On June 26, Lt. Lyman Kidder's party, made up of ten troopers and one scout, were massacred while en route to [[Fort Wallace]]. Lt. Kidder was to deliver dispatches to Custer from [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]], but his party was attacked by Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne (see ''[[Kidder fight|Kidder massacre]]''). Days later, Custer and a search party found the bodies of Kidder's patrol.\n\nFollowing the Hancock campaign, Custer was arrested and suspended at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]], to August 12, 1868, for being [[AWOL]], after having abandoned his post to see his wife. At the request of Major General Sheridan, who wanted Custer for his planned winter campaign against the Cheyenne, Custer was allowed to return to duty before his one-year term of suspension had expired and joined his regiment to October 7, 1868. He then went on frontier duty, scouting in Kansas and [[Indian Territory]] to October 1869.\n\nUnder Sheridan's orders, Custer took part in establishing [[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]] in Indian Territory in early November 1868 as a supply base for the winter campaign. On November 27, 1868, Custer led the 7th Cavalry Regiment in an attack on the Cheyenne encampment of Chief [[Black Kettle]] \u2013 the [[Battle of Washita River]]. Custer reported killing 103 warriors and some women and children; 53 women and children were taken as prisoners. Estimates by the Cheyenne of their casualties were substantially lower (11 warriors plus 19 women and children).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of the Battle of the Washita|publisher=National Park Service (USA)|date=November 1999|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/waba/story.htm|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> Custer had his men shoot most of the 875 Indian ponies they had captured.<ref name=Schultz2010>{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane|title=Custer: lessons in leadership|chapter=The snow was made red with blood|pages=111\u201326|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-11424-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DorvCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA124&dq=Now+Custer+had+to+decide+what+to+do+with+the+875+horses#v=onepage&q=Now%20Custer%20had%20to%20decide%20what%20to%20do%20with%20the%20875%20horses&f=false}}</ref> The Battle of Washita River was regarded as the first substantial U.S. victory in the [[American Indian Wars#Sheridan's campaigns|Southern Plains War]], and it helped force a significant portion of the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Southern Cheyenne]] onto a U.S.-assigned reservation.\n\nIn 1873, Custer was sent to the [[Dakota Territory]] to protect a railroad survey party against the [[Lakota people|Lakota]]. On August 4, 1873, near the [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]], Custer and the 7th Cavalry Regiment clashed for the first time with the Lakota. One man on each side was killed. In 1874 Custer led [[Black Hills Expedition|an expedition]] into the [[Black Hills]] and announced the discovery of gold on [[French Creek (Cheyenne River)|French Creek]] near present-day [[Custer, South Dakota]]. Custer's announcement triggered the [[Black Hills Gold Rush]]. Among the towns that immediately grew up was [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], notorious for lawlessness.\n\n==Grant, Belknap and politics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n{{further|Trader post scandal}}\n[[File:Custer9.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer, 7th U.S. Cavalry, ca. 1875]]\nIn 1875, the Grant administration attempted to buy the [[Black Hills]] region from the Sioux. When the Sioux refused to sell, they were ordered to report to reservations by the end of January, 1876. Mid-winter conditions made it impossible for them to comply. The administration labeled them \"hostiles\" and tasked the Army with bringing them in. Custer was to command an expedition planned for the spring, part of a three-pronged campaign. While Custer's expedition marched west from [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]], near present-day [[Mandan, North Dakota]], troops under Colonel [[John Gibbon]] were to march east from [[Fort Ellis]], near present-day [[Bozeman, Montana]] while a force under General [[George Crook]] was to march north from [[Fort Fetterman]], near present-day [[Douglas, Wyoming]].\n\nCuster's 7th Cavalry was originally scheduled to leave [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] on April 6, 1876, but on March 15 he was summoned to Washington to testify at congressional hearings. Rep. [[Hiester Clymer]]'s Committee was investigating alleged corruption involving Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] (who had resigned March 2), President Grant's brother Orvil and traders granted monopolies at frontier Army posts.<ref>Edgar I. Stewart, ''Custer's Luck''. (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press,1967) p. 124.</ref> It was alleged that Belknap had been selling these lucrative trading post positions where soldiers were required to make their purchases. Custer himself had experienced first hand the high prices being charged at Fort Lincoln.<ref>Stewart, ''Custer's Luck''. pp. 120-121</ref>\n\nConcerned that he might miss the coming campaign, Custer did not want to go to Washington. He asked to answer questions in writing, but Clymer insisted.<ref>Stewart, Custer's Luck, p. 124.</ref> Recognizing that his testimony would be explosive, Custer tried \"to follow a moderate and prudent course, avoiding prominence.\" <ref>Marguerite Merrington, ''The Custer Story: The Life and Intimate Letters of General George A. Custer and his Wife Elizabeth''. (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1987), p. 293.</ref> Despite his care, his testimony was a sensation: Custer was sharply criticized by the Republican press and loudly praised by the Democratic press.\n\nAfter Custer testified on March 29 and April 4, Belknap was impeached and the case sent to the Senate for trial. Custer asked the impeachment managers to release him from further testimony. With the help of a request from his superior, Brigadier General [[Alfred Terry]], Commander of the [[Department of Dakota]], he was excused. Then President Ulysses S. Grant intervened.\n\nThe Congressional investigation had created a serious rift with Grant. Custer had written articles published anonymously in ''The New York Herald'' that exposed trader post kickback rings and implied that Belknap was behind the rings. Moreover, during the investigation, Custer testified on hearsay evidence that President Grant's brother Orvil was involved. Grant had also not forgotten that Custer had once arrested his son Fred for drunkenness. Infuriated, Grant decided to retaliate by stripping Custer of his command in the upcoming campaign.\n\nGeneral Terry protested, saying he had no available officers of rank qualified to replace Custer. Both Sheridan and Sherman wanted Custer in command but had to support Grant. General Sherman, hoping to resolve the issue, advised Custer to meet personally with President Grant before leaving Washington. Three times Custer requested meetings with Grant, but each request was refused.<ref>Merrington, The Custer Story. p. 281</ref>\n\nFinally, Custer gave up and took a train to [[Chicago]] on May 2, planning to rejoin his regiment. A furious Grant ordered Sheridan to arrest Custer for leaving Washington without permission. On May 3, a member of Sheridan's staff arrested Custer as he arrived in Chicago.<ref>Stewart, ''Custer's Luck'', pp. 132-133.</ref> The arrest sparked public outrage. The New York Herald called Grant the \"modern Caesar\" and asked, \"Are officers... to be dragged from railroad trains and ignominiously ordered to stand aside until the whims of the Chief magistrate ... are satisfied?\"<ref>James Wengert, ''The Custer Dispatches''. (Manhattan, KS: Sunflower University Press, 1987), p. 5</ref>\n\nGrant relented but insisted that Terry\u2014not Custer\u2014personally command the expedition. Terry met Custer in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] on May 6. He later recalled, \"(Custer) with tears in his eyes, begged for my aid. How could I resist it?\"<ref>Stewart, ''Custer's Luck'', p. 136.</ref> Terry wrote to Grant attesting to the advantages of Custer's leading the expedition. Sheridan endorsed his effort, accepting Custer's \"guilt\" and suggesting his restraint in future.\n\nGrant was already under pressure for his treatment of Custer. His administration worried that if the \"Sioux campaign\" failed without Custer, then Grant would be blamed for ignoring the recommendations of senior Army officers. On May 8, Custer was told that he would lead the expedition, but only under Terry's direct supervision.\n\nElated, Custer told General Terry's chief engineer, Captain Ludlow, that he would \"cut loose\" from Terry and operate independently.<ref>Stewart, ''Custer's Luck'', p. 138</ref>\n\n==Battle of the Little Bighorn==\n{{Main|Battle of the Little Bighorn}}\n[[File:Bloody Knife, Custer's scout, on Yellowstone Expedition, 1873 - NARA - 524373.tif|thumb|right|250px|Bloody Knife, Custer's scout, on Yellowstone Expedition, 1873]][[File:Camp Verde-Fort Camp Verde-Custers Last Stand Calvary Trumpet-1878-2.jpg|thumb|200px|The 7th Cavalry's trumpet was found in 1878 on the grounds of the Little Bighorn Battlefield (Custer's Last Stand) and is on display in Camp Verde in Arizona]]\nBy the time of Custer's [[Black Hills Expedition|Black Hills expedition]] in 1874, the level of conflict and tension between the U.S. and many of the [[Plains Indians]] tribes (including the [[Lakota Sioux]] and the [[Cheyenne]]) had become exceedingly high. European-Americans continually broke treaty agreements and advanced further westward, resulting in violence and acts of depredation by both sides. To take possession of the [[Black Hills]] (and thus the gold deposits), and to stop Indian attacks, the U.S. decided to corral all remaining free Plains Indians.

The surviving troopers apparently shot their remaining horses to use as [[breastworks]] for a final stand on the knoll at the north end of the ridge. The warriors closed in for the final attack and killed every man in Custer's command.

He says that Joseph White Bull stated he had shot a rider wearing a buckskin jacket and big hat at the riverside when the soldiers first approached the village from the east. The initial force facing the soldiers, according to this version, was quite small (possibly as few as four warriors) yet challenged Custer's command. The rider who was hit was mounted next to a rider who bore a flag and had shouted orders that prompted the soldiers to attack, but when the buckskin-clad rider fell off his horse after being shot, many of the attackers reined up. The allegation that the buckskin-clad officer was Custer, if accurate, might explain the supposed rapid disintegration of Custer's forces.<ref>Connell (1984), pp. 413\u2013414.</ref> However, several other officers of the Seventh, including William Cooke, Tom Custer and William Sturgis, were also dressed in buckskin on the day of the battle, and the fact that each of the non-mutilation wounds to George Custer's body (a bullet wound below the heart and a shot to the left temple) would have been instantly fatal casts doubt on his being wounded or killed at the ford, more than a mile from where his body was found.<ref>Wert, 1996, p. 355.</ref> The circumstances are, however, consistent with [[David Humphreys Miller]]'s suggestion that Custer's attendants would not have left his dead body behind to be desecrated.<ref>[[David Humphreys Miller]], ''Custer's Fall: The Indian Side of the Story''. University of Nebraska Press, 1985.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, two elderly Cheyenne women spoke briefly with oral historians about their having recognized Custer's body on the battlefield and said that they had stopped a Sioux warrior from desecrating the body. The women were relatives of [[Mo-nah-se-tah]], who was alleged to have been Custer's lover in late 1868 and through 1869, and borne two children by him. In the Cheyenne culture of the time, such a relationship was considered a marriage. The women allegedly told the warrior: \"Stop, he is a relative of ours,\" and then shooed him away. The two women said they shoved their [[Stitching awl|sewing awls]] into his ears to permit Custer's corpse to \"hear better in the afterlife\" because he had broken his promise to [[Stone Forehead]] never to fight against Native Americans again.<ref>{{cite news|magazine=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]| date=November 2010|title=How Little Bighorn was won|author=Powers, Thomas }}</ref>\n\nWhen the main column under General Terry arrived two days later, the army found most of the soldiers' corpses stripped, scalped, and mutilated.<ref>Marshall 2007, p. 11</ref><ref>Welch 2007, pp. 175\u2013181.</ref> Custer's body had two bullet holes, one in the left temple and one just below the heart.<ref>Welch 2007, p. 175.</ref> Capt.

He frequently invited journalists to accompany his campaigns (one, [[Associated Press]] reporter [[Mark Kellogg (reporter)|Mark Kellogg]], died at the Little Bighorn), and their favorable reporting contributed to his high reputation, which lasted well into the latter 20th century.\n\nCuster enjoyed writing, often writing all night long.

The work is still a valued primary source for information on US-Native relations.\n\n===Posthumous legacy===\nAfter his death, Custer achieved lasting fame. Despite some initial criticism, the public eventually saw him as a tragic military hero and exemplary gentleman who sacrificed his life for his country.\n\nCuster's wife, [[Elizabeth Bacon Custer|Elizabeth]], who had accompanied him in many of his frontier expeditions, did much to advance this view with the publication of several books about her late husband: ''Boots and Saddles, Life with General Custer in Dakota'',<ref>Elizabeth B.

It was the second printing house that operated in the territory of present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], founded in [[Sarajevo]] almost 350 years after the [[Gora\u017ede printing house]] ceased its activity. Its founder was [[Ignjat Sopron]], a publisher and printer from [[Zemun]], who sold the establishment to the Government of the Vilayet of Bosnia in October 1866. Its foundation happened in the context of modernising and Europeanising [[Tanzimat]] reforms in the Ottoman Empire. Its principal aim was to issue an official gazette of the ''vilayet'' and publish textbooks for the elementary schools of Bosnian Serbs and Croats, thus stopping their import from the [[Principality of Serbia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\nThe first newspaper to be published in Bosnia and Herzegovina was ''Bosanski vjestnik'', a political-informative and educational weekly edited by Sopron and printed in [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]. It had a pro-Serb inclination, though it generally promoted a unitary Bosnian nation, in accordance with the Ottoman policy in the province. The official gazette, the weekly ''Bosna'', was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws, orders, and proclamations. Another weekly issued by the printing house was ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'', which fiercely defended the Ottoman regime and polemicised with Serbian and Austrian newspapers that criticised it. ''Bosna'' and ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'' were bilingual, printed half in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and half in Serbo-Croatian in the Cyrillic script. The printing house produced a number of elementary school textbooks, including the second [[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[alphabet book]] using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic, following [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]]'s book published in Vienna in 1827. Other books include a collection of Bosnian Serb lyric folk poetry, an Ottoman Turkish grammar, and several Jewish religious books. The first printed exemplar of Bosnian [[Aljamiado]] literature was also published by the Vilayet Printing House. It produced around 50 books and booklets altogether, most of them being concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Gora\u017ede printing house]] was one of the earliest among the [[Serbs]] and the first in the territory of present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was founded by [[Bo\u017eidar Ljubavi\u0107]] near the town of [[Gora\u017ede]] in 1519, in the early period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule over the region. It produced three Orthodox religious books, including the [[Gora\u017ede Psalter]], with its last book printed in 1523. The next printing house would not be opened in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the second half of the 19th century.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2001|pp=123\u201324}}\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to centralise and Europeanise the government of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]]. The Ottoman military intervened in the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] in 1831 and 1850, crushing the local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the [[Tanzimat]] began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire, and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians ([[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Orthodox Serbs]] and [[Bosnian Croats|Catholic Croats]]) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and to run their own schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians,{{sfn|McCarthy|1996|pp=74\u201378}} especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province.{{sfn|Ekme\u010di\u0107|1989|pp=254\u201355}} [[Ivan Franjo Juki\u0107]] and other [[Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena|Bosnian Franciscans]] requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nThe reforms became firmly rooted in Bosnia during the 1860s, when the Ottoman governor (''[[W\u0101li|vali]]'') of the province was Topal Sherif Osman Pasha, though most of the changes proceeded at a slow pace.{{sfn|McCarthy|1996|pp=74\u201378}} According to the recently issued Ottoman constitutional law, each ''[[vilayet]]'' (first-order administrative division) was to have an official printing house and an official gazette.{{sfn|Papi\u0107|1976|p=160}} The Constitutional Law for the [[Vilayet of Bosnia]], published in 1865, promoted the province from the rank of eyalet to that of vilayet, and Article&nbsp;9 of this law stipulated that there be an official printing house in its capital.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}} Osman Pasha also had other motivations to establish a printing house. At that time, the press in the [[Principality of Serbia]] and in South Slavic parts of the [[Austrian Empire]] sharply criticised the Ottoman regime in Bosnia. Textbooks imported from Serbia for Serb elementary schools in Bosnia also disseminated nationalist sentiment,{{sfn|Papi\u0107|1976|p=160}} which Osman Pasha saw as anti-Ottoman. In his view, the national movement of the Serbs in Bosnia presented a danger for Ottoman state interests.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}} To protect their hold on Bosnia, the Ottomans sought to promote the idea of a unitary Bosnian nation, thus counteracting the particular national identities and political aspirations of Bosnia's Serbs, Croats, and Muslims.{{sfn|Ekme\u010di\u0107|1989|pp=254\u201355}}{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|p=32}}\n\n==History and publications==\n\n===Under Sopron===\n[[File:Topal Sherif Osman Pasha.jpg|thumb|right|Topal Sherif Osman Pasha]]\nShortly after the Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia was issued, Osman Pasha invited publishing magnate [[Ignjat Sopron]] to Sarajevo. Sopron was the owner and manager of a publishing and printing house in [[Zemun]] (then part of the Austrian Empire, today one of the municipalities of [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]).{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}} An ethnic German, he was born in 1821 in [[Novi Sad]] as Ignaz Karl Soppron.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} Upon his arrival in Sarajevo, Osman Pasha offered him a subsidy to establish and organise a printing house. It was to be headquartered in a building on Sarajevo's ''Dugi sokak'' street that was being rented by the vilayet's government.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=12\u201313}} Sopron soon came to the city bringing with him printing tools and materials, accompanied by a [[Typesetting|typesetter]] from Belgrade, Ilija Tomi\u0107. Tomi\u0107 was in charge of the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters, and he engaged three graduated students of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo to be his trainees. Osman Pasha also invited a man named Kadri-effendi from [[Istanbul]] to work as the typesetter for [[Arabic script|Arabic]] letters.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=12\u201313}} The principal aim of the printing house was to issue an official gazette and to publish elementary school textbooks, thus stopping their import from Serbia and Austria.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}}\n\n''Sopronova pe\u010datnja'', or Sopron's Printing House, was officially opened on {{OldStyleDate|19&nbsp;April|1866|7&nbsp;April}}.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} The Cyrillic orthography that was used in it was consistently in accordance with the linguistic reform of Serbian philologist [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], which was at that time relatively new and still not universally accepted.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|p=49}}{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|p=19}} The first issue of a political-informative and educational weekly newspaper named ''Bosanski vjestnik'' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0458\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a}}, \"Bosnian Herald\") appeared on the same day.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} This was the first newspaper ever to be published in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=71}} Sopron made a deal with the vilayet's authorities to publish it independently from the official gazette.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} When Sopron presented the editorial policy of his newspaper to the authorities, he indicated that it would be printed in the Serbian language, much to the Ottomans' displeasure. The authorities subsequently scratched \"Serbian\" and replaced it with \"Bosnian\". Sopron accepted the revision and went along with Osman Pasha's idea of promoting a unitary Bosnian nation.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|p=32}} Nevertheless, ''Bosanski vjestnik'' had \"a decidedly Serb orientation\".{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=71}} Sopron did not consider this contradictory, as he apparently identified Bosnian-ness with Serbness. In the newspaper, the language was occasionally referred to as Serbo-Bosnian, while both the Serb and the Croat ethnic designations were expressed.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|p=32}}\n\nThe first issue of the official gazette, named ''Bosna'' ([[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Ottoman Turkish]]: {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0648\u0633\u0646\u0647}}; Cyrillic: \u0411\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0430, \"Bosnia\"), appeared on {{OldStyleDate|28&nbsp;May|1866|16&nbsp;May}}, i.e., 13&nbsp;Muharram 1283 [[Anno Hegirae|AH]]. It was a bilingual weekly with half of the pages printed in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] in the Arabic script, and the other half printed in Serbo-Croatian in the Cyrillic script. The text in Serbo-Croatian was a faithful translation of that in Turkish. The gazette was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws, orders, and proclamations, but it also provided news from the political, economic, cultural, and social life of the vilayet. It would be issued without interruption for more than twelve years, and for much of that period it was the only newspaper in the Vilayet of Bosnia. It had different editors over time: Mustafa Rifet Imamovi\u0107, Mehmed \u0160akir Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107, Salih Biogradlija, Javer Baruh, Nurudin Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107, and Kadri-effendi. Most of them were Bosnian Muslims, except Baruh (a Jew) and Kadri-effendi (a Turk). A constant in the gazette was its translator from Turkish, Milo\u0161 Mandi\u0107,{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=41\u201342}} a polyglot who had previously worked as a teacher in a Serb elementary school in [[Prijepolje]]. Besides Sopron, Mandi\u0107 was one of the contributors to ''Bosanski vjestnik'', along with Bogoljub Petranovi\u0107 and Salih Sidki Had\u017eihuseinovi\u0107. Petranovi\u0107 was the manager of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo and the leader of the Serb youth movement in the city, while Had\u017eihuseinovi\u0107 was an official of the [[Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque]].{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} In August 1866, the printing house published its first book, ''Lesson on Man and His Duties'' (''\u041d\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u043e \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u045a\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043c \u0434\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0430''), translated from Greek by Georgije Jovanovi\u0107.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=23\u201328}}{{sfn|Budi\u0161a|1984|p=176}}\n\n===Under the vilayet government===\n[[File:Bukvar (Milo\u0161 Mandi\u0107, 1867) 11.png|thumb|Mandi\u0107's alphabet book, page 11]]\nIn October 1866, Sopron sold the establishment to the Government of the Vilayet of Bosnia.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} It was renamed ''Vilajetska pe\u010datnja'', or the Vilayet Printing House, and from March 1867 onwards it bore the name ''Vilajetska \u0161tamparija'' (the same meaning).{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=41\u201342}} Sopron remained the owner and editor of ''Bosanski vjestnik'', and managed to publish 51 issues.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} After a year in Sarajevo, Sopron left the city and returned to Zemun.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=50\u201352}} The first director of the printing house was Haim Davi\u010do, a Belgrade Jew, who was offered that position by Osman Pasha.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=16\u201317}} Mehmed \u0160akir Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107, the editor of ''Bosna'' since early 1868, began publishing ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'' at the end of that year. It was a bilingual weekly like ''Bosna'', containing commentaries on current politics and articles on various social issues, most of which was written by Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107. He fiercely defended the Ottoman regime in Bosnia, polemicising with newspapers from Serbia and Austria which criticised it.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=50\u201352}} In May 1869, when Osman Pasha ceased to be the governor of the Vilayet of Bosnia, Davi\u010do returned to Belgrade. The new governor installed Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107 as the director of the printing house.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=16\u201317}} Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107 died of tuberculosis in September 1872;{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=50\u201352}} the last issue of ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'' had appeared two months earlier.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|p=21}}\n\nKurt\u0107ehaji\u0107's death marked the end of a prosperous period for the Vilayet Printing House. Its subsequent directors were less capable, and the establishment's condition began to deteriorate. In 1877, the last Ottoman governor of Bosnia installed Kadri-effendi as director, and he significantly improved the condition of the printing house. [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] troops entered Sarajevo on 19 August 1878, marking the start of 40 years of Austro-Hungarian occupation. Four days later, General [[Josip Filipovi\u0107]], the Austro-Hungarian commander in Sarajevo, transferred the management of the printing house from Kadri-effendi to an Austrian official. This spelled the end of the Vilayet Printing House, which was renamed ''Zemaljska \u0161tamparija'' (''National Printing Press''), and continued its work as the official printing house of the [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=16\u201317}} The last, 636th, issue of ''Bosna'' appeared shortly before the end of Ottoman rule over Bosnia, on {{OldStyleDate|30&nbsp;July|1878|18&nbsp;July}}.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nApart from the newspapers ''Bosanski vjestnik'', ''Bosna'', and ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'', the Vilayet Printing House published around fifty books and booklets in Serbo-Croatian, Ottoman Turkish, and Hebrew. While most of these publications were concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation, the printing house also published a number of textbooks.{{sfn|Budi\u0161a|1984|p=176}} The textbooks for Serb elementary schools in the ''vilayet'' were prepared by Milo\u0161 Mandi\u0107 on the basis of those that were used in Serbia.

\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u045a\u0430, ''Sopronova pe\u010datnja''), was the official [[printing house]] of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Vilayet of Bosnia]] from April 1866 until the [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|occupation of the province]] by [[Austria-Hungary]] in August 1878. It was the second printing house that operated in the territory of present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], founded in [[Sarajevo]] almost 350 years after the [[Gora\u017ede printing house]] ceased its activity. Its founder was [[Ignjat Sopron]], a publisher and printer from [[Zemun]], who sold the establishment to the Government of the Vilayet of Bosnia in October 1866. Its foundation happened in the context of modernising and Europeanising [[Tanzimat]] reforms in the Ottoman Empire. Its principal aim was to issue an official gazette of the ''vilayet'' and publish textbooks for the elementary schools of Bosnian Serbs and Croats, thus stopping their import from the [[Principality of Serbia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\nThe first newspaper to be published in Bosnia and Herzegovina was ''Bosanski vjestnik'', a political-informative and educational weekly edited by Sopron and printed in [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]. It had a pro-Serb inclination, though it generally promoted a unitary Bosnian nation, in accordance with the Ottoman policy in the province. The official gazette, the weekly ''Bosna'', was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws, orders, and proclamations. Another weekly issued by the printing house was ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'', which fiercely defended the Ottoman regime and polemicised with Serbian and Austrian newspapers that criticised it. ''Bosna'' and ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'' were bilingual, printed half in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and half in Serbo-Croatian in the Cyrillic script. The printing house produced a number of elementary school textbooks, including the second [[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[alphabet book]] using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic, following [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]]'s book published in Vienna in 1827. Other books include a collection of Bosnian Serb lyric folk poetry, an Ottoman Turkish grammar, and several Jewish religious books. The first printed exemplar of Bosnian [[Aljamiado]] literature was also published by the Vilayet Printing House. It produced around 50 books and booklets altogether, most of them being concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Gora\u017ede printing house]] was one of the earliest among the [[Serbs]] and the first in the territory of present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was founded by [[Bo\u017eidar Ljubavi\u0107]] near the town of [[Gora\u017ede]] in 1519, in the early period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule over the region. It produced three Orthodox religious books, including the [[Gora\u017ede Psalter]], with its last book printed in 1523. The next printing house would not be opened in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the second half of the 19th century.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2001|pp=123\u201324}}\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to centralise and Europeanise the government of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]]. The Ottoman military intervened in the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] in 1831 and 1850, crushing the local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the [[Tanzimat]] began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire, and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians ([[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Orthodox Serbs]] and [[Bosnian Croats|Catholic Croats]]) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and to run their own schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians,{{sfn|McCarthy|1996|pp=74\u201378}} especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province.{{sfn|Ekme\u010di\u0107|1989|pp=254\u201355}} [[Ivan Franjo Juki\u0107]] and other [[Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena|Bosnian Franciscans]] requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nThe reforms became firmly rooted in Bosnia during the 1860s, when the Ottoman governor (''[[W\u0101li|vali]]'') of the province was Topal Sherif Osman Pasha, though most of the changes proceeded at a slow pace.{{sfn|McCarthy|1996|pp=74\u201378}} According to the recently issued Ottoman constitutional law, each ''[[vilayet]]'' (first-order administrative division) was to have an official printing house and an official gazette.{{sfn|Papi\u0107|1976|p=160}} The Constitutional Law for the [[Vilayet of Bosnia]], published in 1865, promoted the province from the rank of eyalet to that of vilayet, and Article&nbsp;9 of this law stipulated that there be an official printing house in its capital.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}} Osman Pasha also had other motivations to establish a printing house. At that time, the press in the [[Principality of Serbia]] and in South Slavic parts of the [[Austrian Empire]] sharply criticised the Ottoman regime in Bosnia. Textbooks imported from Serbia for Serb elementary schools in Bosnia also disseminated nationalist sentiment,{{sfn|Papi\u0107|1976|p=160}} which Osman Pasha saw as anti-Ottoman. In his view, the national movement of the Serbs in Bosnia presented a danger for Ottoman state interests.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}} To protect their hold on Bosnia, the Ottomans sought to promote the idea of a unitary Bosnian nation, thus counteracting the particular national identities and political aspirations of Bosnia's Serbs, Croats, and Muslims.{{sfn|Ekme\u010di\u0107|1989|pp=254\u201355}}{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|p=32}}\n\n==History and publications==\n\n===Under Sopron===\n[[File:Topal Sherif Osman Pasha.jpg|thumb|right|Topal Sherif Osman Pasha]]\nShortly after the Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia was issued, Osman Pasha invited publishing magnate [[Ignjat Sopron]] to Sarajevo. Sopron was the owner and manager of a publishing and printing house in [[Zemun]] (then part of the Austrian Empire, today one of the municipalities of [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]).{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}} An ethnic German, he was born in 1821 in [[Novi Sad]] as Ignaz Karl Soppron.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} Upon his arrival in Sarajevo, Osman Pasha offered him a subsidy to establish and organise a printing house. It was to be headquartered in a building on Sarajevo's ''Dugi sokak'' street that was being rented by the vilayet's government.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=12\u201313}} Sopron soon came to the city bringing with him printing tools and materials, accompanied by a [[Typesetting|typesetter]] from Belgrade, Ilija Tomi\u0107. Tomi\u0107 was in charge of the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters, and he engaged three graduated students of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo to be his trainees. Osman Pasha also invited a man named Kadri-effendi from [[Istanbul]] to work as the typesetter for [[Arabic script|Arabic]] letters.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=12\u201313}} The principal aim of the printing house was to issue an official gazette and to publish elementary school textbooks, thus stopping their import from Serbia and Austria.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=11\u201312}}\n\n''Sopronova pe\u010datnja'', or Sopron's Printing House, was officially opened on {{OldStyleDate|19&nbsp;April|1866|7&nbsp;April}}.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} The Cyrillic orthography that was used in it was consistently in accordance with the linguistic reform of Serbian philologist [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], which was at that time relatively new and still not universally accepted.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|p=49}}{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|p=19}} The first issue of a political-informative and educational weekly newspaper named ''Bosanski vjestnik'' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0458\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a}}, \"Bosnian Herald\") appeared on the same day.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} This was the first newspaper ever to be published in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=71}} Sopron made a deal with the vilayet's authorities to publish it independently from the official gazette.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} When Sopron presented the editorial policy of his newspaper to the authorities, he indicated that it would be printed in the Serbian language, much to the Ottomans' displeasure. The authorities subsequently scratched \"Serbian\" and replaced it with \"Bosnian\". Sopron accepted the revision and went along with Osman Pasha's idea of promoting a unitary Bosnian nation.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|p=32}} Nevertheless, ''Bosanski vjestnik'' had \"a decidedly Serb orientation\".{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=71}} Sopron did not consider this contradictory, as he apparently identified Bosnian-ness with Serbness. In the newspaper, the language was occasionally referred to as Serbo-Bosnian, while both the Serb and the Croat ethnic designations were expressed.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|p=32}}\n\nThe first issue of the official gazette, named ''Bosna'' ([[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Ottoman Turkish]]: {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0648\u0633\u0646\u0647}}; Cyrillic: \u0411\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0430, \"Bosnia\"), appeared on {{OldStyleDate|28&nbsp;May|1866|16&nbsp;May}}, i.e., 13&nbsp;Muharram 1283 [[Anno Hegirae|AH]]. It was a bilingual weekly with half of the pages printed in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] in the Arabic script, and the other half printed in Serbo Croatian in the Cyrillic script. The text in Serbo Croatian was a faithful translation of that in Turkish. The gazette was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws, orders, and proclamations, but it also provided news from the political, economic, cultural, and social life of the vilayet. It would be issued without interruption for more than twelve years, and for much of that period it was the only newspaper in the Vilayet of Bosnia. It had different editors over time: Mustafa Rifet Imamovi\u0107, Mehmed \u0160akir Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107, Salih Biogradlija, Javer Baruh, Nurudin Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107, and Kadri-effendi. Most of them were Bosnian Muslims, except Baruh (a Jew) and Kadri-effendi (a Turk). A constant in the gazette was its translator from Turkish, Milo\u0161 Mandi\u0107,{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=41\u201342}} a polyglot who had previously worked as a teacher in a Serb elementary school in [[Prijepolje]]. Besides Sopron, Mandi\u0107 was one of the contributors to ''Bosanski vjestnik'', along with Bogoljub Petranovi\u0107 and Salih Sidki Had\u017eihuseinovi\u0107. Petranovi\u0107 was the manager of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo and the leader of the Serb youth movement in the city, while Had\u017eihuseinovi\u0107 was an official of the [[Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque]].{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} In August 1866, the printing house published its first book, ''Lesson on Man and His Duties'' (''\u041d\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u043e \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u045a\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043c \u0434\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0430''), translated from Greek by Georgije Jovanovi\u0107.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=23\u201328}}{{sfn|Budi\u0161a|1984|p=176}}\n\n===Under the vilayet government===\n[[File:Bukvar (Milo\u0161 Mandi\u0107, 1867) 11.png|thumb|Mandi\u0107's alphabet book, page 11]]\nIn October 1866, Sopron sold the establishment to the Government of the Vilayet of Bosnia.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} It was renamed ''Vilajetska pe\u010datnja'', or the Vilayet Printing House, and from March 1867 onwards it bore the name ''Vilajetska \u0161tamparija'' (the same meaning).{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=41\u201342}} Sopron remained the owner and editor of ''Bosanski vjestnik'', and managed to publish 51 issues.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=27\u201330}} After a year in Sarajevo, Sopron left the city and returned to Zemun.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=50\u201352}} The first director of the printing house was Haim Davi\u010do, a Belgrade Jew, who was offered that position by Osman Pasha.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=16\u201317}} Mehmed \u0160akir Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107, the editor of ''Bosna'' since early 1868, began publishing ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'' at the end of that year. It was a bilingual weekly like ''Bosna'', containing commentaries on current politics and articles on various social issues, most of which was written by Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107. He fiercely defended the Ottoman regime in Bosnia, polemicising with newspapers from Serbia and Austria which criticised it.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=50\u201352}} In May 1869, when Osman Pasha ceased to be the governor of the Vilayet of Bosnia, Davi\u010do returned to Belgrade. The new governor installed Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107 as the director of the printing house.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=16\u201317}} Kurt\u0107ehaji\u0107 died of tuberculosis in September 1872;{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=50\u201352}} the last issue of ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'' had appeared two months earlier.{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|p=21}}\n\nKurt\u0107ehaji\u0107's death marked the end of a prosperous period for the Vilayet Printing House. Its subsequent directors were less capable, and the establishment's condition began to deteriorate. In 1877, the last Ottoman governor of Bosnia installed Kadri-effendi as director, and he significantly improved the condition of the printing house. [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] troops entered Sarajevo on 19 August 1878, marking the start of 40 years of Austro-Hungarian occupation. Four days later, General [[Josip Filipovi\u0107]], the Austro-Hungarian commander in Sarajevo, transferred the management of the printing house from Kadri-effendi to an Austrian official. This spelled the end of the Vilayet Printing House, which was renamed ''Zemaljska \u0161tamparija'' (''National Printing Press''), and continued its work as the official printing house of the [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{sfn|Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107|1920|pp=16\u201317}} The last, 636th, issue of ''Bosna'' appeared shortly before the end of Ottoman rule over Bosnia, on {{OldStyleDate|30&nbsp;July|1878|18&nbsp;July}}.{{sfn|Kru\u0161evac|1978|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nApart from the newspapers ''Bosanski vjestnik'', ''Bosna'', and ''Sarajevski cvjetnik'', the Vilayet Printing House published around fifty books and booklets in Serbo-Croatian, Ottoman Turkish, and Hebrew.
