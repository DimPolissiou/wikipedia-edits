It is located on the [[Mandurah railway line|Mandurah line]], 43.2 kilometres from [[Perth railway station|Perth station]] serving the suburb of [[Cooloongup]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Transperth Rockingham Station entrance.jpg|thumb|Station entrance in December 2007]]\n[[File:Transperth Rockingham Station decoration.jpg|thumb|Decorations in December 2007]]\n[[File:Transperth Rockingham Station platforms.jpg|thumb|Platforms in December 2007]]\n[[File:Transperth Rockingham Station platforms from footbridge.jpg|thumb|Northbound view in December 2007]]\nUnder the original 1999 Southern Suburbs Railway plan, Rockingham station would have been located within the [[Rockingham, Western Australia|Rockingham]] central business district in close proximity to major shopping and civic areas. This plan proposed the line to access Rockingham CBD by tunnel.\n\nHowever, in 2002, the Southern Suburbs Railway ([[Mandurah railway line|Mandurah line]]) was altered to operate via a more direct route from [[Perth railway station|Perth]] via the [[median strip]] of the [[Kwinana Freeway]] rather than via the [[Armadale/Thornlie railway line|Armadale]] and [[Kwinana railway line|Kwinana]] lines as originally planned.<ref>[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/bills.nsf/4EA2208075A7A89B48256C15000C9D1F/$File/Bill135-2.pdf Railway (Jandakot to Perth) Bill 2002] Parliament of Western Australia</ref> The planned central Rockingham station was abandoned at this time, in order to offset the extra cost of the Perth leg. The new location avoided the cost of tunnelling under Rockingham, but was now located on the edge of the city rather than in the centre of it two kilometres east of [[Rockingham Shopping Centre]].\n\nTo offset this, the [[Government of Western Australia|State Government]] announced plans to construct a light rail link to the Rockingham CBD instead. This did not transpire, although provision was made in the station design and layout for it. Evidence of the abandoned light rail is seen in the busway approach to the station, where concrete 'tracks' can be seen. These would have accommodated rail inset into a concrete base and presumably can still be used in this way in the future. The light rail track would have ended at a platform under the existing station canopy near the western entrance.\n\nRockingham station opened along with the rest of the [[Mandurah railway

Section 24 of the Peace of Augsburg (''ius emigrandi'') guaranteed members of denominations other than the ruler's the freedom of emigration with all their possessions. Political stalemates among the government members of different denominations within a number of the republican [[free imperial city|free imperial cities]] such as [[Augsburg]], the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], and [[Regensburg]], made their territories de facto bi-denominational, but the two denominations did not usually have equal legal status.\n\nThe Peace of Augsburg protected Catholicism and Lutheranism, but not [[Calvinism]]. Thus, in 1613, when [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg]] converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism, he could not exercise the principle of ''cuius regio, eius religio''. This situation paved the way for bi- or multi-denominational monarchies, wherein a ruler adhering to a creed different from most of his subjects would permit conversions to his minority denomination and immigration of his fellow faithful. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] extended the principle of ''cuius regio, eius religio'' to Calvinism.\n\nHowever, the principle grew impracticable in the 17th and 18th centuries, which experienced continuous territorial changes arising from annexations and inheritances, and the religious conversion of rulers. For instance, Saxon [[Augustus II the Strong]] converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism in 1697, but did not exercise his ''cuius regio, eius religio'' privilege. A conqueror or successor to the throne who adhered to a different creed from his new subjects usually would not complicate his takeover by imposing conversions. These enlarged realms spawned diaspora congregations, as immigrants settled in areas where the prevailing creeds differed from their own. This juxtaposition of beliefs in turn brought about more frequent personal changes in denomination, often in the form of [[marital conversion]]s.\n\nHowever, regional mobility was low, especially in the countryside, which generally did not attract newcomers, but experienced rural exodus, so that today's denominational make-up in Germany and Switzerland still represents the former boundaries among territories ruled by Calvinist, Catholic, or Lutheran rulers in the 16th century quite well. In a major departure, the legislature of the [[North German Confederation]] instituted the right of [[irreligion]]ism in 1869, permitting the declaration of secession from all religious bodies.\n\nThe Protestant Church in Germany was and is divided into geographic regions and along denominational affiliations (Calvinist, Lutheran, and United churches). In the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the then-existing monarchies and republics established regional churches (''[[Landeskirche]]n''), comprising the respective congregations within the then-existing state borders. In the case of Protestant ruling dynasties, each regional church affiliated with the [[royal family|regnal houses]], and the crown provided financial and institutional support for its church.

With [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|revolutionary fervor]] in the air, the conservative church leaders had to contend with [[Socialism|socialists]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD) and [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democrats]] (USPD)), who mostly held to [[disestablishment]]arianism.<ref>Beyond the principle of disestablishment, the SPD did not have a real religious policy.

A compromise was reached&nbsp;\u2014 one which favored the Protestant church establishment. There would no longer be state churches, but the churches remained public corporations and retained their subsidies from the state governments for services they performed on behalf of the government (running hospitals, kindergartens etc.). In turn, on behalf of the churches, the state governments  collected church fees from those taxpayers enlisted as parishioners and distributed these funds to the churches. These fees were, and still are, used to finance church activities and administration. The theological faculties in the universities continued to exist, as did religious instruction in the schools, however, allowing the parents to opt out for their children. The rights formerly held by the monarchs in the German Empire simply devolved to church councils instead, and the high-ranking church administrators&nbsp;\u2014 who had been civil servants in the Empire&nbsp;\u2014 simply became church officials instead. The governing structure of the churches effectively changed with the introduction of chairpersons elected by church synods instead of being appointed by the state.\n\nAccordingly, in this initial period of the [[Weimar Republic]], in 1922, the Protestant Church in Germany formed the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]] of 28 regional (or provincial) churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}), with their regional boundaries more or less delineated by those of the federal states.<ref>The correlation between political state ({{lang-de|link=no|Land}}) and church region in the Weimar period was not necessarily exact, because regional churches mostly did not comply to territorial changes in the 19th century.</ref><ref>The federation was governed and administered by a 36-member Executive Committee ({{lang-de|link=no|Kirchenausschuss}}), which was responsible for ongoing governance between the annual conventions of the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]] (''Kirchentag''). This assembly was composed of elected representatives of the various regional churches. The German Evangelical Church Union (''Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund'') was formed following the model of the [[Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches]] (''Schweizerischer Evangelischer Kirchenbund'') established by the Swiss ''[[Landeskirche]]n'' in 1920. Save for the organizational matters under the jurisdiction of the national League, the regional churches remained independent in other matters, including especially in theology, since they comprised Calvinist, Lutheran and united churches.</ref> This federal system allowed for a great deal of regional autonomy in the governance of German Protestantism, as it allowed for a national church parliament that served as a forum for discussion and that endeavored to resolve [[theological]] and organizational conflicts.\n\n===The Nazi regime===\nMany Protestants voted for the Nazis in the elections of [[German federal election, July 1932|summer]] and [[November 1932 German federal election|autumn 1932]] and [[March 1933 German federal election|March 1933]].

Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.</blockquote>\nHowever other interpreters, such as Barth in his commentary on Romans, interpret these verses differently.</ref> \n\"For German Christians, race was the fundamental principle of human life, and they interpreted and effected that notion in religious terms. German Christianity emphasized the distinction between the visible and invisible church. For the German Christians, the church on earth was not the fellowship of the holy spirit described in the New Testament but a contrast to it, a vehicle for the expression of race and ethnicity.\u201d {{sfn | Bergen | 1996 | p= 10}}\n\nThe German Christians were sympathetic to the Nazi regime's goal of \"co-ordinating\" the individual Protestant churches into a single and uniform [[Reich]] church, consistent with the ''[[Volk]]'' ethos and the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]''.\n\n===Creating a New National Church (''Deutsche Evangelische Kirche'')===\nWhen the Nazis took power, the German Protestant church consisted of a federation of independent regional churches which included Lutheran, Reformed and United traditions.{{sfn | Hockenos | 2004 | p=4}}\nIn late April 1933 the leadership of the Protestant federation agreed to write a new constitution for a new \"national\" church, the [[German Evangelical Church]] ({{lang-de|link=no| Deutsche Evangelische Kirche}} or DEK). This had been one goal of many German Christians for some time, as centralization would enhance the coordination of Church and State, as a part of the overall Nazi process of [[Gleichschaltung]] (\"coordination\", resulting in co-option). These  German Christians agitated for Hitler's advisor on religious affairs, [[Ludwig M\u00fcller]], to be elected as the new Church's bishop ({{lang-de|link=no|Reichsbischof}}).\n\nM\u00fcller had poor political skills, little political support within the Church and no real qualifications for the job, other than his commitment to Nazism and a desire to exercise power. When the federation council met in May 1933 to approve the new constitution, it elected [[Friedrich von Bodelschwingh|Friedrich von Bodelschwingh the Younger]] as ''Reichsbischof'' of the new [[Protestant Reich Church]] by a wide margin, largely on the advice and support of the leadership of the 28 church bodies.<ref name=\"Barnett\">Bodelschwingh was a well-known and popular [[Westphalia]]n pastor who headed [[Bethel Institution]], a large charitable organization for the [[mentally ill]] and disabled. His father, also a pastor, had founded Bethel.

Among adherents of the Confessing Church these church bodies were termed ''intact churches'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Intakte Kirchen|Intakte Kirchen]]}}), as opposed to the German Christian-ruled bodies which they designated as \"destroyed churches\" ({{lang-de|link=no|zerst\u00f6rte Kirchen}}).<ref>Also within the church bodies dominated by the German Christians the parishioners in a minority of congregations elected presbyteries without German Christian majorities.</ref> This electoral victory enabled the German Christians to secure sufficient delegates to prevail at the so-called ''national synod'' that conducted the \"revised\" September election for ''Reichsbischof''.<ref>''Kershaw'' pp. 487\u201388.</ref> Further pro-Nazi developments followed the elevation of M\u00fcller to the bishopric: in late summer the old-Prussian church (led by M\u00fcller since his government appointment on 6 July 1933) adopted the [[Aryan Paragraph]], effectively [[defrocking]] clergy of Jewish descent and even clergy married to non-Aryans.<ref>In 1933 the Protestant churches in Germany employed 18,842 pastors (1933); 37 of them were classified by the Nazi terminology as \"full Jews\" ({{lang-de|link=no|Volljuden}}). Before the promulgation of the Nazi's racist [[Nuremberg Laws]], there was no standard definition of who was or would be deemed a \"Jew,\" or which [[Mischling]] would be deemed \"sufficiently Jewish\" for purposes of Hitlerian racial policy, so the net would certainly have swept wider than this rather small fraction. The extension of the prohibition to address the wives of German pastors was surely, to many middle-of-the-road Protestants, shocking. ''See'' ''Barnett'' pp. 33\u201336. The Evangelisches Pfarrhausarchiv (in English: Evangelical Archive on Pastors and their Families) recorded for all of Nazi Germany 115 Protestant pastors with one up to four grandparents who were enlisted in a Jewish congregation.

Under the leadership of [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]], the [[Pfarrernotbund|Pastors' Emergency League]] (''Pfarrernotbund'') was formed, presumably for the purpose of assisting clergy of Jewish descent, but the League soon evolved into a locus of dissent against Nazi interference in church affairs. Its membership grew<ref name=\"B\">By the end of 1933 the League already had 6,000 members. ''Barnett'' p. 35.</ref> while the objections and rhetoric of the German Christians escalated.\n\nThe League pledged itself to contest the state's attempts to infringe on the confessional freedom of the churches, that is to say, their ability to determine their own doctrine.   It expressly opposed the adoption of the Aryan Paragraph which changed the meaning of  baptism. It distinguished between Jews and Christians of Jewish descent and insisted, consistent with the demands of orthodox Christianity, that converted Jews and their descendants were as Christian as anyone else and were full members of the Church in every sense.<ref>''Barnett'' p. 35.</ref>\n\nAt this stage, the objections of Protestant leaders were not motivated by moral outrage over antisemitism as much as by the regime's interference in matters that were considered as being wholly within the church's province. The controversy was thus over church autonomy and church/state demarcation, not over the morality or immorality of persecuting Jews.<ref name=\"B\"/> Eventually, this dissenting group evolved into the Confessing Church.\n\nOn 13 November 1933 a rally of German Christians was held at the [[Berlin Sportpalast]], where&nbsp;\u2014 before a packed hall&nbsp;\u2014 banners proclaimed the unity of National Socialism and Christianity, interspersed with the omnipresent swastikas. A series of speakers<ref>The most notable was apparently one Dr. Reinhardt Krause, who was the Berlin district leader of the German Christians. He advocated the abandonment of the [[Old Testament]] with its tales of \"cattle merchants and pimps\" and a new portrait of Jesus \"corresponding entirely with the demands of National Socialism.\" Resolutions were also proposed that would require all pastors to take a personal [[oath to Hitler]], to require all churches to adopt and implement the Aryan Paragraph and to exclude converted Jews and their descendants from the church. Krause's speech was so vulgar and objectionable that even M\u00fcller disavowed him and, for public relations purposes, suspended him from the group as a \"punishment\" to emphasize the disavowal. ''Shirer'' p. 237.</ref> addressed the crowd's pro-Nazi sentiments with ideas such as:\n*the removal of all pastors unsympathetic with National Socialism\n*the expulsion of members of Jewish descent, who might be arrogated to a separate church\n*the implementation of the Aryan Paragraph church-wide\n*the [[Marcionism|removal of the Old Testament from the Bible]]\n*the removal of \"non-German\" elements from religious services\n*the adoption of a more \"heroic\" and \"positive\" interpretation of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], who in pro-[[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan]] fashion should be portrayed to be battling mightily against corrupt Jewish influences.<ref>''Barnett'' pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\nThis rather shocking attempt to rally the pro-Nazi elements among the German Christians backfired, as it now appeared to many Protestants that the State was attempting to intervene in the most central theological matters of the church, rather than only in matters of church organization and [[polity]].\n\nWhile Hitler, a consummate politician, was sensitive to the implications of such developments,{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[Ludwig M\u00fcller (theologian)|Ludwig M\u00fcller]] was apparently not: he fired and transferred pastors adhering to the Emergency League, and in April 1934 actually deposed the heads of the W\u00fcrttembergian church (Bishop [[Theophil Wurm]]) and of the Bavarian church (Bishop Hans Meiser){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. They and the synodals of their church bodies continuously refused to declare the merger of their church bodies in the German Evangelical Church (DEK). The continuing aggressiveness of the DEK and M\u00fcller spurred the schismatic Protestant leaders to further action.\n\n===Barmen Declaration of Faith===\nIn May 1934, the opposition met in a church synod in [[Barmen]]. The rebellious pastors denounced M\u00fcller and his leadership and declared that they and their congregations constituted the true Evangelical Church of Germany. The [[Barmen Declaration]], primarily authored by [[Karl Barth]], with the consultation and advice of other protesting pastors like [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]] and individual congregations, re-affirmed that the German Church was not an \"organ of the State\" and that the concept of State control over the Church was doctrinally false. The Declaration stipulated, at its core, that any State&nbsp;\u2014 even the totalitarian one&nbsp;\u2014 necessarily encountered a limit when confronted with God's commandments. The Barmen declaration became in fact the foundation of the Confessing Church, confessing because it was based on a confession of faith.<ref>''Barnett'' p. 7.</ref>\n\nAfter the Barmen Declaration, there were in effect two opposing movements in the German Protestant Church:\n\n*the German Christian movement and\n*the Confessing Church (the ''Bekennende Kirche'', BK), often naming itself ''Deutsche Evangelische Kirche'' too, in order to reinforce its claim to be the true church<ref>However, bodies and functions within the BK were mostly designated with alternative expressions.</ref>\n\nIt should nevertheless be emphasized that the Confessing Church's rebellion was directed at the regime's ecclesiastical policy, and the German Christian movement, not at its overall political and social objectives.{{sfn | Bergen | 1996 | p=12}}\n\n{{quote|text=The Confessional Church as a whole did not offer resistance in a political sense, with the intent of bringing down the National Socialist regime.

[yet] the adherents of the Church found themselves increasingly in a state of principled opposition to both the state and the German Christians...they opposed a faith that was blended with anti-Semitism and neo-Pagan heresies ...[such as] a \"heroic Jesus\" and a faith founded on race, [[Volkstum]] and nation.{{sfn | Benz | 2006 | p=45}}}}\n\n===Post-Barmen===\nThe situation grew complex after Barmen.<ref>These developments are explained in ''Shirer'' Chapter 8.</ref> M\u00fcller's ineptitude in political matters did not endear him to the [[F\u00fchrer]].<ref>After the various political missteps by M\u00fcller, the Nazis started emphasizing separation of church and state. Both Frick and G\u00f6ring considered M\u00fcller a \"bungler\" and even the Prussian church commissioner considered him a \"scoundrel\" and a \"shifty character\". ''Barnett'' p. 36.</ref> Furthermore, the Sportpalast speech had proved a public relations disaster; the Nazis, who had promised \"freedom of religion\" in point 24 of their [[National Socialist Program|25-point program]], now appeared to be dictating religious doctrine.\n\nHitler sought to defuse the situation  in the autumn of 1934 by lifting the [[house arrest]] of Meiser and Wurm, leaders of the Bavarian and W\u00fcrttembergian Lutheran churches, respectively. Having lost his patience with M\u00fcller in particular and the German Christians in general, he removed M\u00fcller's authority, brought ''Gleichschaltung'' to a temporary halt and created a new Reich Ministry \u2014 aptly named Church Affairs \u2014 under [[Hanns Kerrl]], one of Hitler's lawyer friends. The ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' would now be continued on the basis of Church against State, rather than internally between two [[Political faction|factions]] of a single church. Kerrl's charge was to attempt another coordination, hopefully with more tact than the heavy-handed M\u00fcller.\n\nKerrl was more mild-mannered than the somewhat vulgar M\u00fcller, and was also politically astute; he shrewdly appointed a committee of conciliation, to be headed by [[Wilhelm Zoellner]], a retired Westphalian [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|general superintendent]] who was generally respected within the church and did not identify with any one faction. M\u00fcller himself resigned, more or less in disgrace, at the end of 1935, having failed to integrate the Protestant church and in fact having created somewhat of a rebellion. [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]]'s group generally cooperated with the new Zoellner committee, but still maintained that it represented the true Protestant Church in Germany and that the DEK was, to put it more bluntly than Niem\u00f6ller would in public, no more than a collection of heretics.\n\nThe Confessing Church, under the leadership of Niem\u00f6ller, addressed a polite, but firm, memorandum to Hitler in May 1936. The memorandum protested the regime's anti-Christian tendencies, denounced the regime's antisemitism and demanded that the regime terminate its interference with the internal affairs of the Protestant church.\n\nThis was essentially the straw on the back of the proverbial camel. The regime responded by:\n* arresting several hundred dissenting pastors\n* murdering Dr. [[Friedrich Wei\u00dfler]], office manager and legal advisor of the \"second preliminary church executive\" of the Confessing Church, in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]\n* confiscating the funds of the Confessing Church\n* forbidding the Confessing Church from taking up collections of [[offertories]]\n\nEventually, the Nazi tactics of repression were too much for Zoellner to bear and he resigned on 12 February 1937, after the Gestapo had denied him the right to visit some imprisoned pastors. The Minister of Church Affairs spoke to the churchmen the next day in a shocking presentation that clearly disclosed the regime's hostility to the church:{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n{{quote|text=Positive Christianity ''is'' National Socialism ... [and] National Socialism is the doing of God's will.... Dr. Zoellner ... has tried to tell me that Christianity consists in faith in Christ as the Son of God. That makes me laugh ...

The F\u00fchrer is the herald of a new revelation. |sign=|source=}}\n\n===A resistance movement?===\nThe [[Barmen Declaration]] itself did not mention the Nazi [[persecution of Jews]] or other totalitarian measures taken by the Nazis; it was a declaration of [[ecclesiastical]] independence, consistent with centuries of Protestant doctrine. It was not a statement of rebellion against the regime or its political and social doctrines and actions.\n\n{{quote|text=We totally deferred our political opposition to Nazism and tried to bring the church opposition to its feet\u2026  We did it from a tactical standpoint\u2026  We hoped to bring [our brethren] to recognize the contradictions of being a Christian and a Nazi\u2026 so we deferred our political polemic against the Nazi state.<ref>''Barnett'' p. 55</ref>}}\n\nThe Confessing Church engaged in only one form of unified resistance: resistance to state manipulation of religious affairs. While many leaders of the Confessing Church attempted to persuade the church to take a radical stance in opposition to Hitler, it never adopted this policy.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSome of the leaders of the Confessing Church, such as [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]] or [[Heinrich Gr\u00fcber]], were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. While Gr\u00fcber and Niem\u00f6ller survived, not all did: [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] was sent initially to {{ill|Tegel Prison|de|Justizvollzugsanstalt Tegel}}, then to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], and finally to [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]], where he was hanged. This left Christians who did not agree with the Nazis without leadership for much of the era.\n\nA select few of the Confessing Church risked their lives to help Jews hiding illegally in Berlin during the war. A hat would be passed around at the end of secret meetings into which the congregation would donate identity cards and passbooks. These were then modified by forgers and given to underground Jews so they could pass as legal Berlin citizens.<ref name=\"Schonhaus\">''See generally'' ''Schonhaus''.</ref> Several members of the Confessing Church were caught and tried for their part in creating forged papers, including [[Franz Kaufmann]] who was shot, and [[Helene Jacobs]], who was jailed.<ref name= \"Schonhaus\"/>\n\nMany of those few Confessing Church members who actively attempted to subvert Hitler's policies were extremely cautious and relatively ineffective. Some urged the need for more radical and risky resistance action. A Berlin Deaconess, {{ill|Marga Meusel|de}}, showed courage and offered \"perhaps the most impassioned, the bluntest, the most detailed and most damning of the protests against the silence of the Christian churches\" because she went the furthest in speaking on behalf of the Jews.{{sfn|Goldhagen |1996|p=438}} Another Confessing Church member who was notable for speaking out against anti-Semitism was [[Hans Ehrenberg]].{{sfn |Gerlach|2000| p= 24}}\n\nMeusel and two other leading women members of the Confessing Church in Berlin, {{ill|Elisabeth Schmitz|de}} and {{ill|Gertrud Staewen|de}}, were members of the Berlin parish where Martin Niem\u00f6ller served as pastor. Their efforts to prod the church to speak out for the Jews were unsuccessful.\n\nMeusel and Bonhoeffer condemned the failure of the Confessing Church \u2014 which was organized specifically in resistance to governmental interference in religion \u2014 to move beyond its very limited concern for religious civil liberties and to focus instead on helping the suffering Jews. In 1935 Meusel protested to the Confessing Church's timid action:{{sfn | Gerlach | 2000 | p=85}}\n\n{{quote|text=Why does the church do nothing? Why does it allow unspeakable injustice to occur? ... What shall we one day answer to the question, where is thy brother [[Abel]]?  The only answer that will be left to us, as well as to the Confessing Church, is the answer of [[Cain]]. (\"Am I my brother's keeper?\" [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 4:9)}}\n\nKarl Barth also wrote in 1935: \"For the millions that suffer unjustly, the Confessing Church does not yet have a heart\".{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=438}}\n\nThe [[Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt]], was a declaration issued on 19 October 1945 by the Council of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland or EKD), in which it confessed guilt for its inadequacies in opposition to the Nazis and the Third Reich. It was written mainly by former members of Confessing Church.\n\nThe Nazi policy of interference in Protestantism did not achieve its aims. A majority of German Protestants sided neither with ''Deutsche Christen'', nor with the Confessing Church. Both groups also faced significant internal disagreements and division.

Section 24 of the Peace of Augsburg (''ius emigrandi'') guaranteed members of denominations other than the ruler's the freedom of emigration with all their possessions. Political stalemates among the government members of different denominations within a number of the republican [[free imperial city|free imperial cities]] such as [[Augsburg]], the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], and [[Regensburg]], made their territories de facto bi-denominational, but the two denominations did not usually have equal legal status.\n\nThe Peace of Augsburg protected Catholicism and Lutheranism, but not [[Calvinism]]. Thus, in 1613, when [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg]] converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism, he could not exercise the principle of ''cuius regio, eius religio''. This situation paved the way for bi- or multi-denominational monarchies, wherein a ruler adhering to a creed different from most of his subjects would permit conversions to his minority denomination and immigration of his fellow faithful. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] extended the principle of ''cuius regio, eius religio'' to Calvinism.\n\nHowever, the principle grew impracticable in the 17th and 18th centuries, which experienced continuous territorial changes arising from annexations and inheritances, and the religious conversion of rulers. For instance, Saxon [[Augustus II the Strong]] converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism in 1697, but did not exercise his ''cuius regio, eius religio'' privilege. A conqueror or successor to the throne who adhered to a different creed from his new subjects usually would not complicate his takeover by imposing conversions. These enlarged realms spawned diaspora congregations, as immigrants settled in areas where the prevailing creeds differed from their own. This juxtaposition of beliefs in turn brought about more frequent personal changes in denomination, often in the form of [[marital conversion]]s.\n\nHowever, regional mobility was low, especially in the countryside, which generally did not attract newcomers, but experienced rural exodus, so that today's denominational make-up in Germany and Switzerland still represents the former boundaries among territories ruled by Calvinist, Catholic, or Lutheran rulers in the 16th century quite well. In a major departure, the legislature of the [[North German Confederation]] instituted the right of [[irreligion]]ism in 1869, permitting the declaration of secession from all religious bodies.\n\nThe Protestant Church in Germany was and is divided into geographic regions and along denominational affiliations (Calvinist, Lutheran, and United churches). In the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the then-existing monarchies and republics established regional churches (''[[Landeskirche]]n''), comprising the respective congregations within the then-existing state borders. In the case of Protestant ruling dynasties, each regional church affiliated with the [[royal family|regnal houses]], and the crown provided financial and institutional support for its church. [[State religion|Church and State]] were, therefore, to a large extent combined on a regional basis.<ref>The ruler of each state was also the highest authority ({{lang-la|summus episcopus}}) in that [[Separation of church and state|state's church]]. ''See generally'' the Wikipedia article on the [[German Empire]] and its constitutive states, as it existed before the end of the First World War.</ref>\n\n====Weimar Germany====\n\nIn the [[aftermath of World War I]] with its political and social turmoil, the regional churches lost their secular rulers. With [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|revolutionary fervor]] in the air, the conservative church leaders had to contend with [[Socialism|socialists]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD) and [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democrats]] (USPD)), who mostly held to [[disestablishment]]arianism.<ref>Beyond the principle of disestablishment, the SPD did not have a real religious policy. It had for years considered religion a private matter of conscience and it favored [[freedom of religion]] in principle.</ref> When [[Adolph Hoffmann]], a strident secularist,<ref>Hoffmann had written a pamphlet denouncing the [[Ten Commandments]] as a [[capitalism|capitalistic]] tool.</ref> was appointed [[Prussia]]n Minister of Education and Public Worship in November 1918 by the USPD, he attempted to implement a number of plans,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=yOzqtaYYqHAC&pg=PA299&lpg=PA299|title=Christian History: An Introduction|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|date=2013-03-04|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118337790|location=|pages=299|language=en}}</ref> which included:\n*cutting government [[subsidies]] for the church \n*[[confiscation]] of church property\n*abolition of [[theology]] as a course of study in universities\n*banning [[school prayer]]\n*banning compulsory [[religious education|religious instruction]] in schools\n*prohibiting schools from requiring attendance at [[Service of worship|worship services]]\n\nAfter storms of protests from both Protestants and Catholics, Hoffmann was forced to resign and, by political means, the churches were able to prevent complete disestablishment. A compromise was reached&nbsp;\u2014 one which favored the Protestant church establishment. There would no longer be state churches, but the churches remained public corporations and retained their subsidies from the state governments for services they performed on behalf of the government (running hospitals, kindergartens etc.). In turn, on behalf of the churches, the state governments  collected church fees from those taxpayers enlisted as parishioners and distributed these funds to the churches. These fees were, and still are, used to finance church activities and administration. The theological faculties in the universities continued to exist, as did religious instruction in the schools, however, allowing the parents to opt out for their children. The rights formerly held by the monarchs in the German Empire simply devolved to church councils instead, and the high-ranking church administrators&nbsp;\u2014 who had been civil servants in the Empire&nbsp;\u2014 simply became church officials instead. The governing structure of the churches effectively changed with the introduction of chairpersons elected by church synods instead of being appointed by the state.\n\nAccordingly, in this initial period of the [[Weimar Republic]], in 1922, the Protestant Church in Germany formed the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]] of 28 regional (or provincial) churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}), with their regional boundaries more or less delineated by those of the federal states.<ref>The correlation between political state ({{lang-de|link=no|Land}}) and church region in the Weimar period was not necessarily exact, because regional churches mostly did not comply to territorial changes in the 19th century.</ref><ref>The federation was governed and administered by a 36-member Executive Committee ({{lang-de|link=no|Kirchenausschuss}}), which was responsible for ongoing governance between the annual conventions of the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]] (''Kirchentag''). This assembly was composed of elected representatives of the various regional churches. The German Evangelical Church Union (''Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund'') was formed following the model of the [[Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches]] (''Schweizerischer Evangelischer Kirchenbund'') established by the Swiss ''[[Landeskirche]]n'' in 1920. Save for the organizational matters under the jurisdiction of the national League, the regional churches remained independent in other matters, including especially in theology, since they comprised Calvinist, Lutheran and united churches.</ref> This federal system allowed for a great deal of regional autonomy in the governance of German Protestantism, as it allowed for a national church parliament that served as a forum for discussion and that endeavored to resolve [[theological]] and organizational conflicts.\n\n===The Nazi regime===\nMany Protestants voted for the Nazis in the elections of [[German federal election, July 1932|summer]] and [[November 1932 German federal election|autumn 1932]] and [[March 1933 German federal election|March 1933]]. There is a remarkable gap to the Catholic populated areas, where the results of the Nazis were lower, even after the [[Machtergreifung]] (\"seizure of power\") of Hitler.\n\n{{quote|The [Protestant] churches did not reject National Socialism on principle.

In general, the group's political and religious motivations developed in response to the social and political tensions wrought by the end of World War I and the attendant substitution of a [[republicanism|republican]] regime for the [[authoritarian]] one of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]&nbsp;\u2014 much the same as the conditions leading to [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Hitler's rise to power]].\n\nThe German Christian movement was sustained and encouraged by factors such as:\n*the 400th anniversary (in 1917) of [[Martin Luther]]'s posting of the [[Ninety-five Theses]] in 1517, an event which served to endorse German nationalism, to emphasize that Germany had a preferred place in the Protestant tradition, and to legitimize [[antisemitism]].

Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.</blockquote>\nHowever other interpreters, such as Barth in his commentary on Romans, interpret these verses differently.</ref> \n\"For German Christians, race was the fundamental principle of human life, and they interpreted and effected that notion in religious terms. German Christianity emphasized the distinction between the visible and invisible church. For the German Christians, the church on earth was not the fellowship of the holy spirit described in the New Testament but a contrast to it, a vehicle for the expression of race and ethnicity.\u201d {{sfn | Bergen | 1996 | p= 10}}\n\nThe German Christians were sympathetic to the Nazi regime's goal of \"co-ordinating\" the individual Protestant churches into a single and uniform [[Reich]] church, consistent with the ''[[Volk]]'' ethos and the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]''.\n\n===Creating a New National Church (''Deutsche Evangelische Kirche'')===\nWhen the Nazis took power, the German Protestant church consisted of a federation of independent regional churches which included Lutheran, Reformed and United traditions.{{sfn | Hockenos | 2004 | p=4}}\nIn late April 1933 the leadership of the Protestant federation agreed to write a new constitution for a new \"national\" church, the [[German Evangelical Church]] ({{lang-de|link=no| Deutsche Evangelische Kirche}} or DEK). This had been one goal of many German Christians for some time, as centralization would enhance the coordination of Church and State, as a part of the overall Nazi process of [[Gleichschaltung]] (\"coordination\", resulting in co-option). These  German Christians agitated for Hitler's advisor on religious affairs, [[Ludwig M\u00fcller]], to be elected as the new Church's bishop ({{lang-de|link=no|Reichsbischof}}).\n\nM\u00fcller had poor political skills, little political support within the Church and no real qualifications for the job, other than his commitment to Nazism and a desire to exercise power. When the federation council met in May 1933 to approve the new constitution, it elected [[Friedrich von Bodelschwingh|Friedrich von Bodelschwingh the Younger]] as ''Reichsbischof'' of the new [[Protestant Reich Church]] by a wide margin, largely on the advice and support of the leadership of the 28 church bodies.<ref name=\"Barnett\">Bodelschwingh was a well-known and popular [[Westphalia]]n pastor who headed [[Bethel Institution]], a large charitable organization for the [[mentally ill]] and disabled. His father, also a pastor, had founded Bethel. ''Barnett'' p. 33.</ref>\n[[File:Deutsche Christen Bekennende Kirche.jpg|thumb|[[Synod#Lutheran usage|Synodal]] elections 1933: German Christians and Confessing Church campaigners in Berlin]]\nHitler was infuriated with the rejection of his candidate, and after a series of political maneuvers, Bodelschwingh resigned and M\u00fcller was elected as the new ''Reichsbischof'' on 27 September 1933, after the government had already imposed him on 28 June 1933.<ref>The entire old-Prussian church (both M\u00fcller and Bodelschwingh were members of this largest regional church) was placed under police jurisdiction; pastors were fired, suspended and sometimes arrested, and the German Christians supporting M\u00fcller carried on a vicious campaign against Bodelschwingh.</ref> The formidable propaganda apparatus of the Nazi state was deployed to help the German Christians win presbyter and synodal elections in order to dominate the upcoming synod and finally put M\u00fcller into office.<ref>''Barnett'' p. 34.</ref><ref>The new constitution for the new unitary DEK was approved by the thoroughly nazified [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] on 14 July 1933. ''Shirer'' p. 237.</ref> Hitler discretionarily decreed unconstitutional premature re-elections of all presbyters and synodals for 23 July; the night before the elections, Hitler made a personal appeal to Protestants by radio.\n\nThe German Christians won handily (70\u201380% of all seats in presbyteries and synods), except in four regional churches and one provincial body of the united old-Prussian church: the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria right of the river Rhine]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover]], [[Evangelical Reformed Church in Bavaria and Northwestern Germany|Evangelical Reformed State Church of the Province of Hanover]] the Lutheran [[Evangelical State Church in W\u00fcrttemberg]], and in the [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|old-Prussian ecclesiastical province of Westphalia]], where the German Christians gained no majorities. Among adherents of the Confessing Church these church bodies were termed ''intact churches'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Intakte Kirchen|Intakte Kirchen]]}}), as opposed to the German Christian-ruled bodies which they designated as \"destroyed churches\" ({{lang-de|link=no|zerst\u00f6rte Kirchen}}).<ref>Also within the church bodies dominated by the German Christians the parishioners in a minority of congregations elected presbyteries without German Christian majorities.</ref> This electoral victory enabled the German Christians to secure sufficient delegates to prevail at the so-called ''national synod'' that conducted the \"revised\" September election for ''Reichsbischof''.<ref>''Kershaw'' pp. 487\u201388.</ref> Further pro-Nazi developments followed the elevation of M\u00fcller to the bishopric: in late summer the old-Prussian church (led by M\u00fcller since his government appointment on 6 July 1933) adopted the [[Aryan Paragraph]], effectively [[defrocking]] clergy of Jewish descent and even clergy married to non-Aryans.<ref>In 1933 the Protestant churches in Germany employed 18,842 pastors (1933); 37 of them were classified by the Nazi terminology as \"full Jews\" ({{lang-de|link=no|Volljuden}}). Before the promulgation of the Nazi's racist [[Nuremberg Laws]], there was no standard definition of who was or would be deemed a \"Jew,\" or which [[Mischling]] would be deemed \"sufficiently Jewish\" for purposes of Hitlerian racial policy, so the net would certainly have swept wider than this rather small fraction. The extension of the prohibition to address the wives of German pastors was surely, to many middle-of-the-road Protestants, shocking. ''See'' ''Barnett'' pp. 33\u201336. The Evangelisches Pfarrhausarchiv (in English: Evangelical Archive on Pastors and their Families) recorded for all of Nazi Germany 115 Protestant pastors with one up to four grandparents who were enlisted in a Jewish congregation. Cf. ''Wider das Vergessen: Schicksale judenchristlicher Pfarrer in der Zeit 1933\u20131945'' (catalogue for the special exhibition in the Lutherhaus Eisenach April 1988&nbsp;\u2013 April 1989), Evangelisches Pfarrhausarchiv (ed.), Eisenach: Evangelisches Pfarrhausarchiv, 1988. No ISBN.</ref>\n\n==The Confessing Church==\n\n===Formation===\n[[File:Remembrance Bekennde Kirche.Parish Hall.Ev.Kirchengemeinde Dahlem.BerlinGermany2007.jpg|thumb|Meeting house of the Evangelical [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] Congregation, Berlin]] \n[[File:Remembrance Bekennende Kirche.Bekenntnissynode 1934.Berlin-DahlemGermany2007.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the ''second Reich Synod of Confession'' on the outside wall of the meeting house]]\nThe Aryan Paragraph created a furor among some of the clergy. Under the leadership of [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]], the [[Pfarrernotbund|Pastors' Emergency League]] (''Pfarrernotbund'') was formed, presumably for the purpose of assisting clergy of Jewish descent, but the League soon evolved into a locus of dissent against Nazi interference in church affairs. Its membership grew<ref name=\"B\">By the end of 1933 the League already had 6,000 members. ''Barnett'' p. 35.</ref> while the objections and rhetoric of the German Christians escalated.\n\nThe League pledged itself to contest the state's attempts to infringe on the confessional freedom of the churches, that is to say, their ability to determine their own doctrine.   It expressly opposed the adoption of the Aryan Paragraph which changed the meaning of  baptism. It distinguished between Jews and Christians of Jewish descent and insisted, consistent with the demands of orthodox Christianity, that converted Jews and their descendants were as Christian as anyone else and were full members of the Church in every sense.<ref>''Barnett'' p. 35.</ref>\n\nAt this stage, the objections of Protestant leaders were not motivated by moral outrage over antisemitism as much as by the regime's interference in matters that were considered as being wholly within the church's province. The controversy was thus over church autonomy and church/state demarcation, not over the morality or immorality of persecuting Jews.<ref name=\"B\"/> Eventually, this dissenting group evolved into the Confessing Church.\n\nOn 13 November 1933 a rally of German Christians was held at the [[Berlin Sportpalast]], where&nbsp;\u2014 before a packed hall&nbsp;\u2014 banners proclaimed the unity of National Socialism and Christianity, interspersed with the omnipresent swastikas. A series of speakers<ref>The most notable was apparently one Dr. Reinhardt Krause, who was the Berlin district leader of the German Christians. He advocated the abandonment of the [[Old Testament]] with its tales of \"cattle merchants and pimps\" and a new portrait of Jesus \"corresponding entirely with the demands of National Socialism.\" Resolutions were also proposed that would require all pastors to take a personal [[oath to Hitler]], to require all churches to adopt and implement the Aryan Paragraph and to exclude converted Jews and their descendants from the church. Krause's speech was so vulgar and objectionable that even M\u00fcller disavowed him and, for public relations purposes, suspended him from the group as a \"punishment\" to emphasize the disavowal. ''Shirer'' p. 237.</ref> addressed the crowd's pro-Nazi sentiments with ideas such as:\n*the removal of all pastors unsympathetic with National Socialism\n*the expulsion of members of Jewish descent, who might be arrogated to a separate church\n*the implementation of the Aryan Paragraph church-wide\n*the [[Marcionism|removal of the Old Testament from the Bible]]\n*the removal of \"non-German\" elements from religious services\n*the adoption of a more \"heroic\" and \"positive\" interpretation of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], who in pro-[[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan]] fashion should be portrayed to be battling mightily against corrupt Jewish influences.<ref>''Barnett'' pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\nThis rather shocking attempt to rally the pro-Nazi elements among the German Christians backfired, as it now appeared to many Protestants that the State was attempting to intervene in the most central theological matters of the church, rather than only in matters of church organization and [[polity]].\n\nWhile Hitler, a consummate politician, was sensitive to the implications of such developments,{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[Ludwig M\u00fcller (theologian)|Ludwig M\u00fcller]] was apparently not: he fired and transferred pastors adhering to the Emergency League, and in April 1934 actually deposed the heads of the W\u00fcrttembergian church (Bishop [[Theophil Wurm]]) and of the Bavarian church (Bishop Hans Meiser). They and the synodals of their church bodies continuously refused to declare the merger of their church bodies in the German Evangelical Church (DEK). The continuing aggressiveness of the DEK and M\u00fcller spurred the schismatic Protestant leaders to further action.\n\n===Barmen Declaration of Faith===\nIn May 1934, the opposition met in a church synod in [[Barmen]]. The rebellious pastors denounced M\u00fcller and his leadership and declared that they and their congregations constituted the true Evangelical Church of Germany. The [[Barmen Declaration]], primarily authored by [[Karl Barth]], with the consultation and advice of other protesting pastors like [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]] and individual congregations, re-affirmed that the German Church was not an \"organ of the State\" and that the concept of State control over the Church was doctrinally false. The Declaration stipulated, at its core, that any State&nbsp;\u2014 even the totalitarian one&nbsp;\u2014 necessarily encountered a limit when confronted with God's commandments. The Barmen declaration became in fact the foundation of the Confessing Church, confessing because it was based on a confession of faith.<ref>''Barnett'' p. 7.</ref>\n\nAfter the Barmen Declaration, there were in effect two opposing movements in the German Protestant Church:\n\n*the German Christian movement and\n*the Confessing Church (the ''Bekennende Kirche'', BK), often naming itself ''Deutsche Evangelische Kirche'' too, in order to reinforce its claim to be the true church<ref>However, bodies and functions within the BK were mostly designated with alternative expressions.</ref>\n\nIt should nevertheless be emphasized that the Confessing Church's rebellion was directed at the regime's ecclesiastical policy, and the German Christian movement, not at its overall political and social objectives.{{sfn | Bergen | 1996 | p=12}}\n\n{{quote|text=The Confessional Church as a whole did not offer resistance in a political sense, with the intent of bringing down the National Socialist regime. It fought first to keep its organizational structures intact, and then to preserve the independence of church doctrine, according to which the Christian commandments were not to be subordinated to Nazi ideology.... [yet] the adherents of the Church found themselves increasingly in a state of principled opposition to both the state and the German Christians...they opposed a faith that was blended with anti-Semitism and neo-Pagan heresies ...[such as] a \"heroic Jesus\" and a faith founded on race, [[Volkstum]] and nation.{{sfn | Benz | 2006 | p=45}}}}\n\n===Post-Barmen===\nThe situation grew complex after Barmen.<ref>These developments are explained in ''Shirer'' Chapter 8.</ref> M\u00fcller's ineptitude in political matters did not endear him to the [[F\u00fchrer]].<ref>After the various political missteps by M\u00fcller, the Nazis started emphasizing separation of church and state. Both Frick and G\u00f6ring considered M\u00fcller a \"bungler\" and even the Prussian church commissioner considered him a \"scoundrel\" and a \"shifty character\". ''Barnett'' p. 36.</ref> Furthermore, the Sportpalast speech had proved a public relations disaster; the Nazis, who had promised \"freedom of religion\" in point 24 of their [[National Socialist Program|25-point program]], now appeared to be dictating religious doctrine.\n\nHitler sought to defuse the situation  in the autumn of 1934 by lifting the [[house arrest]] of Meiser and Wurm, leaders of the Bavarian and W\u00fcrttembergian Lutheran churches, respectively. Having lost his patience with M\u00fcller in particular and the German Christians in general, he removed M\u00fcller's authority, brought ''Gleichschaltung'' to a temporary halt and created a new Reich Ministry \u2014 aptly named Church Affairs \u2014 under [[Hanns Kerrl]], one of Hitler's lawyer friends. The ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' would now be continued on the basis of Church against State, rather than internally between two [[Political faction|factions]] of a single church. Kerrl's charge was to attempt another coordination, hopefully with more tact than the heavy-handed M\u00fcller.\n\nKerrl was more mild-mannered than the somewhat vulgar M\u00fcller, and was also politically astute; he shrewdly appointed a committee of conciliation, to be headed by [[Wilhelm Zoellner]], a retired Westphalian [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|general superintendent]] who was generally respected within the church and did not identify with any one faction. M\u00fcller himself resigned, more or less in disgrace, at the end of 1935, having failed to integrate the Protestant church and in fact having created somewhat of a rebellion. [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]]'s group generally cooperated with the new Zoellner committee, but still maintained that it represented the true Protestant Church in Germany and that the DEK was, to put it more bluntly than Niem\u00f6ller would in public, no more than a collection of heretics.\n\nThe Confessing Church, under the leadership of Niem\u00f6ller, addressed a polite, but firm, memorandum to Hitler in May 1936. The memorandum protested the regime's anti-Christian tendencies, denounced the regime's antisemitism and demanded that the regime terminate its interference with the internal affairs of the Protestant church.\n\nThis was essentially the straw on the back of the proverbial camel. The regime responded by:\n* arresting several hundred dissenting pastors\n* murdering Dr. [[Friedrich Wei\u00dfler]], office manager and legal advisor of the \"second preliminary church executive\" of the Confessing Church, in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]\n* confiscating the funds of the Confessing Church\n* forbidding the Confessing Church from taking up collections of [[offertories]]\n\nEventually, the Nazi tactics of repression were too much for Zoellner to bear and he resigned on 12 February 1937, after the Gestapo had denied him the right to visit some imprisoned pastors. The Minister of Church Affairs spoke to the churchmen the next day in a shocking presentation that clearly disclosed the regime's hostility to the church:{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n{{quote|text=Positive Christianity ''is'' National Socialism ... [and] National Socialism is the doing of God's will.... Dr. Zoellner ... has tried to tell me that Christianity consists in faith in Christ as the Son of God. That makes me laugh ... Christianity is not dependent upon the Apostle's Creed .... [but] is represented by the Party .... the German people are now called ... by the F\u00fchrer to a real Christianity .... The F\u00fchrer is the herald of a new revelation. |sign=|source=}}\n\n===A resistance movement?===\nThe [[Barmen Declaration]] itself did not mention the Nazi [[persecution of Jews]] or other totalitarian measures taken by the Nazis; it was a declaration of [[ecclesiastical]] independence, consistent with centuries of Protestant doctrine. It was not a statement of rebellion against the regime or its political and social doctrines and actions.\n\n{{quote|text=We totally deferred our political opposition to Nazism and tried to bring the church opposition to its feet\u2026  We did it from a tactical standpoint\u2026  We hoped to bring [our brethren] to recognize the contradictions of being a Christian and a Nazi\u2026 so we deferred our political polemic against the Nazi state.<ref>''Barnett'' p. 55</ref>}}\n\nThe Confessing Church engaged in only one form of unified resistance: resistance to state manipulation of religious affairs. While many leaders of the Confessing Church attempted to persuade the church to take a radical stance in opposition to Hitler, it never adopted this policy.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSome of the leaders of the Confessing Church, such as [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]] or [[Heinrich Gr\u00fcber]], were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. While Gr\u00fcber and Niem\u00f6ller survived, not all did: [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] was sent initially to {{ill|Tegel Prison|de|Justizvollzugsanstalt Tegel}}, then to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], and finally to [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]], where he was hanged. This left Christians who did not agree with the Nazis without leadership for much of the era.\n\nA select few of the Confessing Church risked their lives to help Jews hiding illegally in Berlin during the war. A hat would be passed around at the end of secret meetings into which the congregation would donate identity cards and passbooks. These were then modified by forgers and given to underground Jews so they could pass as legal Berlin citizens.<ref name=\"Schonhaus\">''See generally'' ''Schonhaus''.</ref> Several members of the Confessing Church were caught and tried for their part in creating forged papers, including [[Franz Kaufmann]] who was shot, and [[Helene Jacobs]], who was jailed.<ref name= \"Schonhaus\"/>\n\nMany of those few Confessing Church members who actively attempted to subvert Hitler's policies were extremely cautious and relatively ineffective. Some urged the need for more radical and risky resistance action. A Berlin Deaconess, {{ill|Marga Meusel|de}}, showed courage and offered \"perhaps the most impassioned, the bluntest, the most detailed and most damning of the protests against the silence of the Christian churches\" because she went the furthest in speaking on behalf of the Jews.{{sfn|Goldhagen |1996|p=438}} Another Confessing Church member who was notable for speaking out against anti-Semitism was [[Hans Ehrenberg]].{{sfn |Gerlach|2000| p= 24}}\n\nMeusel and two other leading women members of the Confessing Church in Berlin, {{ill|Elisabeth Schmitz|de}} and {{ill|Gertrud Staewen|de}}, were members of the Berlin parish where Martin Niem\u00f6ller served as pastor. Their efforts to prod the church to speak out for the Jews were unsuccessful.\n\nMeusel and Bonhoeffer condemned the failure of the Confessing Church \u2014 which was organized specifically in resistance to governmental interference in religion \u2014 to move beyond its very limited concern for religious civil liberties and to focus instead on helping the suffering Jews. In 1935 Meusel protested to the Confessing Church's timid action:{{sfn | Gerlach | 2000 | p=85}}\n\n{{quote|text=Why does the church do nothing? Why does it allow unspeakable injustice to occur? ... What shall we one day answer to the question, where is thy brother [[Abel]]?  The only answer that will be left to us, as well as to the Confessing Church, is the answer of [[Cain]]. (\"Am I my brother's keeper?\" [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 4:9)}}\n\nKarl Barth also wrote in 1935: \"For the millions that suffer unjustly, the Confessing Church does not yet have a heart\".{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=438}}\n\nThe [[Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt]], was a declaration issued on 19 October 1945 by the Council of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland or EKD), in which it confessed guilt for its inadequacies in opposition to the Nazis and the Third Reich. It was written mainly by former members of Confessing Church.\n\nThe Nazi policy of interference in Protestantism did not achieve its aims. A majority of German Protestants sided neither with ''Deutsche Christen'', nor with the Confessing Church. Both groups also faced significant internal disagreements and division. The Nazis gave up trying to co-opt Christianity and instead expressed contempt toward it. When German Christians persisted, some members of the SS found it hard to believe that they were sincere and even thought they might be a threat.<ref>\"The Nazis eventually gave up their attempt to co-opt Christianity, and made little pretence at concealing their contempt for Christian beliefs, ethics and morality. Unable to comprehend that some Germans genuinely wanted to combine commitment to Christianity and Nazism, some members of the SS even came to view German Christians as almost more of a threat than the Confessing Church.\" Mary Fulbrook, ''The Fontana History of Germany 1918\u20131990: The Divided Nation'', Fontana Press, 1991, p. 81</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[G\u00fcnther Dehn]]\n* [[Kirchenkampf]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{cite book | title = Nazism, Liberalism, & Christianity: Protestant social thought in Germany & Great Britain, 1925\u20131937| first =Kenneth C. | last = Barnes|publisher=University Press of Kentucky| year= 1991|isbn = 0-8131-1729-1 }}\n*{{cite book | title = For the Soul of the People: Protestant Protest Against Hitler| first =Victoria | last = Barnett| publisher=Oxford University Press US| year= 1992|\nISBN = 0-19-512118-X }}\n*{{cite book| title =The Holocaust Encyclopedia | first=Judith Tydor |last=Baumel |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-300-08432-3 }}\n*{{cite book | last= Benz | first= Wolfgang | title= A Concise History of the Third Reich | publisher= University of California Press | year= 2006 | isbn= 0-520-23489-8 | ref= harv | url= https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00benz }}\n*{{cite book | first = Doris L. | last = Bergen | title=Twisted Cross: The German Christian Movement in the Third Reich | location = Chapel Hill |publisher=UNC Press| year = 1996 | isbn = 0-8078-4560-4|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book | last=Browning | first=Christopher | title=Holocaust scholarship : personal trajectories and professional interpretations | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | location=Houndmills, Basingstoke New York | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-137-51418-9 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Ericksen | first=Robert| title=Complicity in the Holocaust : churches and universities in Nazi Germany  | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-107-01591-3 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book  | last = Evans|first = Richard J.|author-link=Richard J.

After the suicide of his brother-in-law, he returns home. At the urging of his sister, Sandra, who believes that her husband's death was caused by one of their creditors, Marco tries to avenge his family. He moves into an apartment above the one occupied by the creditor, Edouard Laporte, and begins an affair with his wife, Rapha\u00eblle. Marco discovers that his sister is deep in debt and that his niece, Justine, has been hospitalized and might need reconstructive surgery as her vagina has been badly damaged. After some investigation, he believes that Edouard was the one who injured his niece by penetrating her with a corn cob.\n\nJustine eventually runs away from the hospital she was staying in. Her friends offer Marco access to images of her going to a sex club with Edouard and her father. After viewing the images, Marco realizes that both his sister and his brother-in-law allowed Edouard to use their daughter for sexual favors in return for money to keep their failing shoe factory afloat. Justine and her friends leave together, but she deliberately crashes the car they are driving, killing them all.\n\nDiscovering that Rapha\u00eblle and Marco are sleeping together, Edouard leaves her, taking their young son with him. When he returns to collect a few of his son's things and to tell Rapha\u00eblle that he is moving to Geneva with the boy, Marco tries to stop him. In the ensuing fight, Marco is shot and killed by Rapha\u00eblle. Sandra receives a video in the mail which she watches with Justine's doctor. It is a sex tape involving Edouard, Justine, her father, and another woman. The tape shows Justine's father holding a corn cob.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vincent Lindon]] as Marco Silvestri\n* [[Chiara Mastroianni]] as Rapha\u00eblle\n* Julie Bataille as Sandra\n*

It was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=cannes/><ref name=rogerebert/>\n\n==Plot==\nMarco Silvestri is a sailor who has cut off ties with most of his family. After the suicide of his brother-in-law, he returns home. At the urging of his sister, Sandra, who believes that her husband's death was caused by one of their creditors, Marco tries to avenge his family. He moves into an apartment above the one occupied by the creditor, Edouard Laporte, and begins an affair with his wife, Rapha\u00eblle. Marco discovers that his sister is deep in debt and that his niece, Justine, has been hospitalized and might need reconstructive surgery as her vagina has been badly damaged. After some investigation, he believes that Edouard was the one who injured his niece by penetrating her with a corn cob.\n\nJustine eventually runs away from the hospital she was staying in. Her friends offer Marco access to images of her going to a sex club with Edouard and her father. After viewing the images, Marco realizes that both his sister and his brother-in-law allowed Edouard to use their daughter for sexual favors in return for money to keep their failing shoe factory afloat. Justine and her friends leave together, but she deliberately crashes the car they are driving, killing them all.\n\nDiscovering that Rapha\u00eblle and Marco are sleeping together, Edouard leaves her, taking their young son with him. When he returns to collect a few of his son's things and to tell Rapha\u00eblle that he is moving to Geneva with the boy, Marco tries to stop him. In the ensuing fight, Marco is shot and killed by Rapha\u00eblle. Sandra receives a video in the mail which she watches with Justine's doctor. It is a sex tape involving Edouard, Justine, her father, and another woman. The tape shows Justine's father holding a corn cob.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vincent Lindon]] as Marco Silvestri\n* [[Chiara Mastroianni]] as Rapha\u00eblle\n* Julie Bataille as Sandra\n*

When the [[Empire of Japan]] [[surrender of Japan|surrendered]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the end of [[World War II]], Singapore was returned to the British in 1945. In 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] were dissolved and Singapore together with the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos-Keeling]] and [[Christmas Island]] became a separate Crown colony.<ref>Colony of Singapore.

Incidents of [[looting]] and revenge-killing were widespread.\n\nWhen British troops returned to Singapore in September 1945, thousands of Singaporeans lined the streets to cheer them. Singapore was ruled by a [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] (BMA) between September 1945 and March 1946, during which it also served as the headquarters of the British governor-general for Southeast Asia. However much of the infrastructure had been destroyed, including electricity and [[water supply]] systems, telephone services, as well as the harbour facilities at the [[Port of Singapore]].<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\">{{cite web\n | title = Singapore \u2013 Aftermath of War\n | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm\n | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress \n | accessdate = 18 June 2006 }} \n</ref>\n\nThere was also a shortage of food including rice, and this led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crimes and violence. Unemployment, high food prices, and workers' discontent culminated in a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by the growing demand for tin and rubber around the world. But it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the colony===\nOn 1 April 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] was dissolved and Singapore became a Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor and separated from peninsular Malaya. In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and provisions were made to allow for the election of six members of the Legislative Council the next year.<ref name=\"micaSelfGovernment\">{{cite web|title=Towards Self-government|url=http://www.sg/explore/history_towards.htm|publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore|accessdate=18 June 2006}}|{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Merger with Malaysia===\n{{main|Singapore in Malaysia|Self-governance of Singapore}}\n\nThe failure of the British to defend Singapore had destroyed their credibility as infallible rulers in the eyes of the locals in Singapore. The decades after and during the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of nationalist and [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] sentiments, including a cry for ''[[Merdeka]]'', roughly translated to \"independence\" in the Malay language. The British, on their part, were prepared to embark on a program of gradually increasing [[self-governance]] for Singapore and Malaya.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/> The Crown colony was dissolved on 16 September 1963 when Singapore became a state of Malaysia, ending 144 years' of British rule on the island.\n\nOn 9 August 1965, Singapore officially left Malaysia to become the independent [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]], due to political, economic and racial disputes.\n\n==Government==\n\n===First Legislative Council (1948\u20131951)===\n\nThe [[1948 Singapore general election|first Singaporean elections]], held in March 1948 to select members of the Legislative Council, were rather limited.  The right to vote was restricted to adult British subjects, of which only 23,000 or about 10 percent of those eligible [[Voter registration|registered to vote]]. In addition, only six of the twenty-five seats on the [[Legislative Council of Singapore|Legislative Council]] were to be elected; the rest were chosen either by the Governor or by the chambers of commerce.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/>\n\nThree of the elected seats were won by a newly formed [[Singapore Progressive Party]] (SPP), a conservative party whose leaders were businessmen and professionals and were disinclined to press for immediate self-rule. The other three seats were won by independents.\n\nThree months after the elections, an armed insurgency by communist groups in Malaya \u2013 the [[Malayan Emergency]] \u2013 broke out, and the British imposed harsh measures to control left-wing groups in both Singapore and Malaya; the controversial [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]], which allowed indefinite detention without [[trial (law)|trial]] for persons suspected of being \"threats to security\", was introduced at this time.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/>\n\nSince the left-wing groups were the strongest critics of the colonial system, progress on self-government stalled for several years. The colonial government also tried to prevent contacts between Singaporean Chinese and [[People's Republic of China|China]], which had just fallen under the rule of the [[Communist Party of China]]. [[Tan Kah Kee]], a local businessman and philanthropist, was denied re-entry into Singapore after he made a trip to China.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/>\n\n===Second Legislative Council (1951\u20131955)===\n\nA second Legislative Council election was held in 1951 with the number of elected seats increased to nine. This election was again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. This slowly contributed to the formation of a distinct [[government of Singapore]], although colonial administration was still dominant.\n \nIn 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the 'Emergency' period over, the government appointed a commission, headed by [[George William Rendel|Sir George Rendel]], to study the possibility of self-government for Singapore. The commission proposed a limited form of self-government.\n\nThe [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a [[Chief Minister]] as [[head of government]] and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a [[parliamentary system]]. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.\n\nThe government agreed with the recommendations, and Legislative Assembly elections were scheduled for 2 April 1955. The election was a lively and closely fought affair, with several newly formed political parties joining the fray. In contrast to previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly defeated in the election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the largest winner with ten seats and was able to form a coalition government with the [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]]-[[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] Alliance, which won three seats.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/> Another new party, the then [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), won three seats.\n\n==Administration==\nOn 1 April 1946, the colony of Singapore was formed with [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos-Keeling]], [[Christmas Island]] after the dissolution of the Straits Settlement. As a Crown colony, Singapore inherited the hierarchical organisational structure of the Straits Settlements government with a governor, who was assisted by an Advisory Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a Municipal Council.<ref>Electoral representation for the new Singapore Council.

When the [[Empire of Japan]] [[surrender of Japan|surrendered]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the end of [[World War II]], Singapore was returned to the British in 1945. In 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] were dissolved and Singapore together with the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos-Keeling]] and [[Christmas Island]] became a separate Crown colony.<ref>Colony of Singapore.

Note the huge [[flag of the Republic of China]] held by the people, and a smaller flag waving near the background.]] -->\n\nAfter Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August 1945, there was a state of [[anomie]] in Singapore, as the British had not arrived to take control, while the Japanese occupiers had a considerably weakened hold over the populace.  Incidents of [[looting]] and revenge-killing were widespread.\n\nWhen British troops returned to Singapore in September 1945, thousands of Singaporeans lined the streets to cheer them. Singapore was ruled by a [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] (BMA) between September 1945 and March 1946, during which it also served as the headquarters of the British governor-general for Southeast Asia. However much of the infrastructure had been destroyed, including electricity and [[water supply]] systems, telephone services, as well as the harbour facilities at the [[Port of Singapore]].<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\">{{cite web\n | title = Singapore \u2013 Aftermath of War\n | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm\n | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress \n | accessdate = 18 June 2006 }} \n</ref>\n\nThere was also a shortage of food including rice, and this led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crimes and violence. Unemployment, high food prices, and workers' discontent culminated in a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by the growing demand for tin and rubber around the world. But it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the colony===\nOn 1 April 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] was dissolved and Singapore became a Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor and separated from peninsular Malaya. In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and provisions were made to allow for the election of six members of the Legislative Council the next year.<ref name=\"micaSelfGovernment\">{{cite web|title=Towards Self-government|url=http://www.sg/explore/history_towards.htm|publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore|accessdate=18 June 2006}}|{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Merger with Malaysia===\n{{main|Singapore in Malaysia|Self-governance of Singapore}}\n\nThe failure of the British to defend Singapore had destroyed their credibility as infallible rulers in the eyes of the locals in Singapore. The decades after and during the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of nationalist and [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] sentiments, including a cry for ''[[Merdeka]]'', roughly translated to \"independence\" in the Malay language. The British, on their part, were prepared to embark on a program of gradually increasing [[self-governance]] for Singapore and Malaya.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/> The Crown colony was dissolved on 16 September 1963 when Singapore became a state of Malaysia, ending 144 years' of British rule on the island.\n\nOn 9 August 1965, Singapore officially left Malaysia to become the independent [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]], due to political, economic and racial disputes.\n\n==Government==\n\n===First Legislative Council (1948\u20131951)===\n\nThe [[1948 Singapore general election|first Singaporean elections]], held in March 1948 to select members of the Legislative Council, were rather limited.  The right to vote was restricted to adult British subjects, of which only 23,000 or about 10 percent of those eligible [[Voter registration|registered to vote]]. In addition, only six of the twenty-five seats on the [[Legislative Council of Singapore|Legislative Council]] were to be elected; the rest were chosen either by the Governor or by the chambers of commerce.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/>\n\nThree of the elected seats were won by a newly formed [[Singapore Progressive Party]] (SPP), a conservative party whose leaders were businessmen and professionals and were disinclined to press for immediate self-rule. The other three seats were won by independents.\n\nThree months after the elections, an armed insurgency by communist groups in Malaya \u2013 the [[Malayan Emergency]] \u2013 broke out, and the British imposed harsh measures to control left-wing groups in both Singapore and Malaya; the controversial [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]], which allowed indefinite detention without [[trial (law)|trial]] for persons suspected of being \"threats to security\", was introduced at this time.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/>\n\nSince the left-wing groups were the strongest critics of the colonial system, progress on self-government stalled for several years. The colonial government also tried to prevent contacts between Singaporean Chinese and [[People's Republic of China|China]], which had just fallen under the rule of the [[Communist Party of China]]. [[Tan Kah Kee]], a local businessman and philanthropist, was denied re-entry into Singapore after he made a trip to China.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/>\n\n===Second Legislative Council (1951\u20131955)===\n\nA second Legislative Council election was held in 1951 with the number of elected seats increased to nine. This election was again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. This slowly contributed to the formation of a distinct [[government of Singapore]], although colonial administration was still dominant.\n \nIn 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the 'Emergency' period over, the government appointed a commission, headed by [[George William Rendel|Sir George Rendel]], to study the possibility of self-government for Singapore. The commission proposed a limited form of self-government.\n\nThe [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a [[Chief Minister]] as [[head of government]] and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a [[parliamentary system]]. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.\n\nThe government agreed with the recommendations, and Legislative Assembly elections were scheduled for 2 April 1955. The election was a lively and closely fought affair, with several newly formed political parties joining the fray. In contrast to previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly defeated in the election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the largest winner with ten seats and was able to form a coalition government with the [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]]-[[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] Alliance, which won three seats.<ref name=\"uslcAftermathOfWar\"/> Another new party, the then [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), won three seats.\n\n==Administration==\nOn 1 April 1946, the colony of Singapore was formed with [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos-Keeling]], [[Christmas Island]] after the dissolution of the Straits Settlement. As a Crown colony, Singapore inherited the hierarchical organisational structure of the Straits Settlements government with a governor, who was assisted by an Advisory Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a Municipal Council.<ref>Electoral representation for the new Singapore Council.
