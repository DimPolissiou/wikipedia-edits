Consequently, Continuation classes for students interested in technical subjects commenced at the Sydney Technical College.<ref name=\"SchoolHistory\" />\n\nIn April 1911, these Continuation classes were given the status of a high school, and Sydney Technical High was established. Originally, the school was co-educational with 113 boys and 15 girls. In February 1913, the girls were transferred to Fort Street Girls' High; and, from then on, the school became for boys only.<ref name=\"SchoolHistory\"/>\n\nSince 1911, the school has been located at three Sydney sites:\n*[[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] House on Mary Ann Street: this was the \"country\" home of [[John Harris (Australian settler)|John Harris]], Surgeon of the [[New South Wales Corps]]. The property was bought by the Government in 1899 and used by Technical Education for many years before being used by Sydney Tech High from 1911 to 1924.\n*[[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] on Albion Street: in 1925, with an enrolment of 421, Sydney Tech High was transferred to Albion Street, Paddington. Although it was a note of expansion, it was a vigorous P&C campaign that encouraged the State Government to fund an entirely new site for the school.\n*[[Bexley, New South Wales|Bexley]] on Forest Road: the Old McConnachie's Paddock was occupied and first stone for the school's foundations was laid in March 1955, with the school completed and occupied by September 1956. The official opening for the school's new facilities was on 2 August 1958, with four units: the administration block, general classrooms ('A block'), manual training block and the auditorium and gymnasium. Throughout the years numerous additions have been made to the site. The School Pool was opened in 1966, the Kingston-David Library and Laboratories in 1975 and a brand-new administration block in 1998.<ref name=\"SchoolHistory\"/>\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe current grounds at Bexley include the following physical facilities:\n* Upper courts and Lower Courts (\"The Cage\") \u2013 basketball courts for Years 7\u20139 and 10\u201312, respectively\n* Elmo Landsberger Cricket nets \u2013 located between Lower courts and Back oval, 3 [[cricket]] batting nets & a plaque dedicated to Elmo Landsberger\n* New courts \u2013 A new basketball court as well as 3 small handball courts and a volleyball court has been put in, near the Anderson Street car park.

Consequently, Continuation classes for students interested in technical subjects commenced at the Sydney Technical College.<ref name=\"SchoolHistory\" />\n\nIn April 1911, these Continuation classes were given the status of a high school, and Sydney Technical High was established. Originally, the school was co-educational with 113 boys and 15 girls. In February 1913, the girls were transferred to Fort Street Girls' High; and, from then on, the school became for boys only.<ref name=\"SchoolHistory\"/>\n\nSince 1911, the school has been located at three Sydney sites:\n*[[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] House on Mary Ann Street: this was the \"country\" home of [[John Harris (Australian settler)|John Harris]], Surgeon of the [[New South Wales Corps]].

Although it was a note of expansion, it was a vigorous P&C campaign that encouraged the State Government to fund an entirely new site for the school.\n*[[Bexley, New South Wales|Bexley]] on Forest Road: the Old McConnachie's Paddock was occupied and first stone for the school's foundations was laid in March 1955, with the school completed and occupied by September 1956. The official opening for the school's new facilities was on 2 August 1958, with four units: the administration block, general classrooms ('A block'), manual training block and the auditorium and gymnasium. Throughout the years numerous additions have been made to the site. The School Pool was opened in 1966, the Kingston-David Library and Laboratories in 1975 and a brand-new administration block in 1998.<ref name=\"SchoolHistory\"/>\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe current grounds at Bexley include the following physical facilities:\n* Upper courts and Lower Courts (\"The Cage\") \u2013 basketball courts for Years 7\u20139 and 10\u201312, respectively\n* Elmo Landsberger Cricket nets \u2013 located between Lower courts and Back oval, 3 [[cricket]] batting nets & a plaque dedicated to Elmo Landsberger\n* New courts \u2013 A new basketball court as well as 3 small handball courts and a volleyball court has been put in, near the Anderson Street car park.

The first Thunderbolt peripheral devices appeared in retail stores only in late 2011, with the relatively expensive ''Pegasus R4'' (4-drive) and ''Pegasus R6'' (6-drive) [[RAID]] enclosures by [[Promise Technology]] aimed at the [[prosumer]] and professional market, initially offering up to 12&nbsp;TB of storage, later increased to 18&nbsp;TB. Sales of these units were hurt by the [[2011 Thailand floods|2011 floods in Thailand]] (who manufacture much of the world's supply of hard-drives) resulting in a cut to worldwide hard-drive production and a subsequent driving-up of storage costs, hence the retail price of these Promise units increased in response, contributing to a slower take-up of the devices.\n\nIt also took some time for other storage manufacturers to release products: most were smaller devices aimed at the professional market, and focused on speed rather than high capacity. Many storage devices were under 1&nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]] in size, with some featuring SSDs for faster external-data access rather than standard hard-drives.\n\nOther companies have offered interface products that can route multiple older, usually slower, connections through a single Thunderbolt port. In July 2011, Apple released its [[Apple Thunderbolt Display]], whose [[gigabit Ethernet]] and other older connector types made it the first hub of its type. Later, companies such as [[Belkin]], [http://www.caldigit.com/us/ CalDigit], [[Other World Computing]], [[Matrox]], [[StarTech.com|StarTech]], and [[Elgato]] have all released Thunderbolt docks.\n\nAs of late 2012, few other storage devices offering double-digit [[terabyte|TB]] capacity had appeared. Exceptions included Sonnet Technologies' highly priced professional units, and [[Drobo]]'s 4- and 5-drive enclosures, the latter featuring their own [[Drobo#BeyondRAID|BeyondRAID]] proprietary data-handling system.\n\nBackwards compatibility with non-Thunderbolt-equipped computers was a problem, as most storage devices featured only two Thunderbolt ports, for daisy-chaining up to six devices from each one. In mid-2012, [[LaCie]], Drobo, and other device makers started to swap out one of the two Thunderbolt ports for a [[USB 3.0]] connection on some of their low-to-mid end products. Later models had the USB 3.0 added ''in addition'' to the two Thunderbolt ports, including those from LaCie on their ''2big'' range.\n\nThe late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro was the first product to have Thunderbolt 2 ports, following which manufacturers started to update their model offerings to those featuring the newer, faster, 20 Gbit/s connection throughout 2014. Again, among the first was Promise Technology, who released updated ''Pegasus 2'' versions of their R4 and R6 models along with an even larger R8 (8-drive) [[RAID]] unit, offering up to 32&nbsp;TBs of storage. Later, other brands similarly introduced high capacity models with the newer connection type, including G-Technology (with their ''G-RAID Studio'' models offering up to 24&nbsp;TB) and LaCie (with their ''5big'', and [[19-inch rack|rack mounted]] ''8big'' models, offering up to 48&nbsp;TB). LaCie also offering updated designed versions of their ''2big'' mainstream consumer models, up to 12&nbsp;TB, using new 6&nbsp;TB hard-drives.\n\nThunderbolt 3 was introduced in late 2015, with several motherboard manufacturers and [[OEM]] laptop manufacturers including Thunderbolt 3 with their products. [[Gigabyte Technology|Gigabyte]] and [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], large computer component manufacturers, enter the market for the first time with Thunderbolt 3 compatible components.<ref name=\"TPU TB3 info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/215773/gigabyte-unveils-the-z170x-ud5-th-thunderbolt-3-certified-motherboard.html|title=Gigabyte Unveils the Z170X-UD5 TH Thunderbolt 3 Certified Motherboard|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"PCW TB3 info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2978318/laptop-computers/msi-embraces-skylake-and-thunderbolt-3-0-for-new-gaming-laptops.html|title=MSI embraces Skylake and Thunderbolt 3.0 for new gaming laptops|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Dell]] was the first to include Thunderbolt 3 ports in laptops with their [[Dell XPS|XPS Series]] and their [[Dell Alienware]] range.<ref name=\"PCW TB3 info 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2976593/laptop-computers/new-alienware-laptops-pack-thunderbolt-3-and-better-screens-but-oddly-lack-skylake.html|title=New Alienware laptops pack Thunderbolt 3 and prettier screens, but oddly lack Skylake|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nApple Mac machines with Thunderbolt 3 include: [[iMac Pro]], [[iMac]] 2017, [[Mac Mini]] 2018, [[MacBook Pro]] 2016 onwards, [[MacBook Air]] 2018.\n\nAlthough Thunderbolt has initially had poor hardware support outside of Apple devices and has been relegated to a niche gadget port, the adoption of the Thunderbolt 3 using USB-C connector standard into a wide array of hardware bodes well for market acceptance of the standard, besides that it will become part of USB4 standard.\n\n===Vulnerability to DMA attacks===\n\nThunderbolt \u2014 like many high-speed expansion buses, including [[PCI Express]], [[PC Card]], [[ExpressCard]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]], [[Conventional PCI|PCI]], and [[PCI-X]] \u2014 is potentially vulnerable to a [[direct memory access]] (DMA) [[DMA attack|attack]]. If users extend the PCI Express bus (the most common high-speed expansion bus in systems {{as of | 2018| lc = on}}) with Thunderbolt, it allows very low-level access to the computer. An attacker could physically attach a malicious device, which, through its direct and unimpeded access to system memory and other devices, would be able to bypass almost all security measures of the operating system, allowing the attacker to read and write system memory, potentially exposing encryption keys or installing [[malware]].<ref name=\"erratasec\"/> Such attacks have been demonstrated, modifying inexpensive commodity Thunderbolt hardware.<ref name=\"funderbolt\"/> An [[Input\u2013output memory management unit|IOMMU]], if present, bug-free, and correctly integrated into and configured by the operating system, can close a computer's vulnerability to DMA attacks,<ref name=\"funderbolt\"/> but only if a malicious device can't alter the code that configures the IOMMU before the code is executed. As of 2019, the major OS vendors had not taken into account the variety of ways in which a malicious device could take advantage of complex interactions between multiple emulated peripherals, exposing subtle bugs and vulnerabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/thunderclap-exploring-vulnerabilities-in-operating-system-iommu-protection-via-dma-from-untrustworthy-peripherals/|title=Thunderclap: Exploring Vulnerabilities in Operating System IOMMU Protection via DMA from Untrustworthy Peripherals \u2013 NDSS Symposium|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> Some UEFI implementations offer Kernel DMA Protection.\n\nThis vulnerability is not present when Thunderbolt is used as a system interconnection ({{abbr|IPoTB|Internet Protocol over Thunderbolt Bridge}} supported on [[OS X Mavericks]]), because the [[Internet Protocol|IP]] implementation runs on the underlying Thunderbolt low-latency packet-switching fabric, and the PCI Express protocol is not present on the cable. That means that if IPoTB networking is used between a group of computers, there is no threat of such DMA attack between them.<ref name=\"erratasec\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.erratasec.com/2011/02/thunderbolt-introducing-new-way-to-hack.html|title=Thunderbolt: Introducing a new way to hack Macs|last=Graham|first=Robert|date=24 February 2011|website=Errata Security|accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"funderbolt\">{{cite conference |url=https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Sevinsky-Funderbolt-Adventures-in-Thunderbolt-DMA-Attacks-Slides.pdf|title=Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks|first=Russ|last=Sevinsky |conference=Black Hat Briefings|conferenceurl=https://www.blackhat.com|location=Las Vegas |format=PDF |date=1 August 2013 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=\"TBHW\">{{cite web|url= https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works|title=Thunderbolt how it works|publisher=Intel|date=2014|accessdate=1 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029185956/https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |archive-date=2014-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0HthE3qDMw|title=Black Hat USA 2013 - Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks|first=Russ|last=Sevinsky|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Vulnerability to Option ROM attacks===\nWhen a system with Thunderbolt boots, it loads and executes [[Option ROM]]s from attached devices.

The first Thunderbolt peripheral devices appeared in retail stores only in late 2011, with the relatively expensive ''Pegasus R4'' (4-drive) and ''Pegasus R6'' (6-drive) [[RAID]] enclosures by [[Promise Technology]] aimed at the [[prosumer]] and professional market, initially offering up to 12&nbsp;TB of storage, later increased to 18&nbsp;TB. Sales of these units were hurt by the [[2011 Thailand floods|2011 floods in Thailand]] (who manufacture much of the world's supply of hard-drives) resulting in a cut to worldwide hard-drive production and a subsequent driving-up of storage costs, hence the retail price of these Promise units increased in response, contributing to a slower take-up of the devices.\n\nIt also took some time for other storage manufacturers to release products: most were smaller devices aimed at the professional market, and focused on speed rather than high capacity. Many storage devices were under 1&nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]] in size, with some featuring SSDs for faster external-data access rather than standard hard-drives.\n\nOther companies have offered interface products that can route multiple older, usually slower, connections through a single Thunderbolt port. In July 2011, Apple released its [[Apple Thunderbolt Display]], whose [[gigabit Ethernet]] and other older connector types made it the first hub of its type. Later, companies such as [[Belkin]], [http://www.caldigit.com/us/ CalDigit], [[Other World Computing]], [[Matrox]], [[StarTech.com|StarTech]], and [[Elgato]] have all released Thunderbolt docks.\n\nAs of late 2012, few other storage devices offering double-digit [[terabyte|TB]] capacity had appeared. Exceptions included Sonnet Technologies' highly priced professional units, and [[Drobo]]'s 4- and 5-drive enclosures, the latter featuring their own [[Drobo#BeyondRAID|BeyondRAID]] proprietary data-handling system.\n\nBackwards compatibility with non-Thunderbolt-equipped computers was a problem, as most storage devices featured only two Thunderbolt ports, for daisy-chaining up to six devices from each one. In mid-2012, [[LaCie]], Drobo, and other device makers started to swap out one of the two Thunderbolt ports for a [[USB 3.0]] connection on some of their low-to-mid end products. Later models had the USB 3.0 added ''in addition'' to the two Thunderbolt ports, including those from LaCie on their ''2big'' range.\n\nThe late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro was the first product to have Thunderbolt 2 ports, following which manufacturers started to update their model offerings to those featuring the newer, faster, 20 Gbit/s connection throughout 2014. Again, among the first was Promise Technology, who released updated ''Pegasus 2'' versions of their R4 and R6 models along with an even larger R8 (8-drive) [[RAID]] unit, offering up to 32&nbsp;TBs of storage. Later, other brands similarly introduced high capacity models with the newer connection type, including G-Technology (with their ''G-RAID Studio'' models offering up to 24&nbsp;TB) and LaCie (with their ''5big'', and [[19-inch rack|rack mounted]] ''8big'' models, offering up to 48&nbsp;TB). LaCie also offering updated designed versions of their ''2big'' mainstream consumer models, up to 12&nbsp;TB, using new 6&nbsp;TB hard-drives.\n\nThunderbolt 3 was introduced in late 2015, with several motherboard manufacturers and [[OEM]] laptop manufacturers including Thunderbolt 3 with their products. [[Gigabyte Technology|Gigabyte]] and [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], large computer component manufacturers, enter the market for the first time with Thunderbolt 3 compatible components.<ref name=\"TPU TB3 info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/215773/gigabyte-unveils-the-z170x-ud5-th-thunderbolt-3-certified-motherboard.html|title=Gigabyte Unveils the Z170X-UD5 TH Thunderbolt 3 Certified Motherboard|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"PCW TB3 info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2978318/laptop-computers/msi-embraces-skylake-and-thunderbolt-3-0-for-new-gaming-laptops.html|title=MSI embraces Skylake and Thunderbolt 3.0 for new gaming laptops|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Dell]] was the first to include Thunderbolt 3 ports in laptops with their [[Dell XPS|XPS Series]] and their [[Dell Alienware]] range.<ref name=\"PCW TB3 info 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2976593/laptop-computers/new-alienware-laptops-pack-thunderbolt-3-and-better-screens-but-oddly-lack-skylake.html|title=New Alienware laptops pack Thunderbolt 3 and prettier screens, but oddly lack Skylake|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nApple Mac machines with Thunderbolt 3 include: [[iMac Pro]], [[iMac]] 2017, [[Mac Mini]] 2018, [[MacBook Pro]] 2016 onwards, [[MacBook Air]] 2018.\n\nAlthough Thunderbolt has initially had poor hardware support outside of Apple devices and has been relegated to a niche gadget port, the adoption of the Thunderbolt 3 using USB-C connector standard into a wide array of hardware bodes well for market acceptance of the standard, besides that it will become part of USB4 standard.\n\n===Vulnerability to DMA attacks===\n\nThunderbolt \u2014 like many high-speed expansion buses, including [[PCI Express]], [[PC Card]], [[ExpressCard]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]], [[Conventional PCI|PCI]], and [[PCI-X]] \u2014 is potentially vulnerable to a [[direct memory access]] (DMA) [[DMA attack|attack]]. If users extend the PCI Express bus (the most common high-speed expansion bus in systems {{as of | 2018| lc = on}}) with Thunderbolt, it allows very low-level access to the computer. An attacker could physically attach a malicious device, which, through its direct and unimpeded access to system memory and other devices, would be able to bypass almost all security measures of the operating system, allowing the attacker to read and write system memory, potentially exposing encryption keys or installing [[malware]].<ref name=\"erratasec\"/> Such attacks have been demonstrated, modifying inexpensive commodity Thunderbolt hardware.<ref name=\"funderbolt\"/> An [[Input\u2013output memory management unit|IOMMU]], if present, bug-free, and correctly integrated into and configured by the operating system, can close a computer's vulnerability to DMA attacks,<ref name=\"funderbolt\"/> but only if a malicious device can't alter the code that configures the IOMMU before the code is executed. As of 2019, the major OS vendors had not taken into account the variety of ways in which a malicious device could take advantage of complex interactions between multiple emulated peripherals, exposing subtle bugs and vulnerabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/thunderclap-exploring-vulnerabilities-in-operating-system-iommu-protection-via-dma-from-untrustworthy-peripherals/|title=Thunderclap: Exploring Vulnerabilities in Operating System IOMMU Protection via DMA from Untrustworthy Peripherals \u2013 NDSS Symposium|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> Some UEFI implementations offer Kernel DMA Protection.\n\nThis vulnerability is not present when Thunderbolt is used as a system interconnection ({{abbr|IPoTB|Internet Protocol over Thunderbolt Bridge}} supported on [[OS X Mavericks]]), because the [[Internet Protocol|IP]] implementation runs on the underlying Thunderbolt low-latency packet-switching fabric, and the PCI Express protocol is not present on the cable. That means that if IPoTB networking is used between a group of computers, there is no threat of such DMA attack between them.<ref name=\"erratasec\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.erratasec.com/2011/02/thunderbolt-introducing-new-way-to-hack.html|title=Thunderbolt: Introducing a new way to hack Macs|last=Graham|first=Robert|date=24 February 2011|website=Errata Security|accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"funderbolt\">{{cite conference |url=https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Sevinsky-Funderbolt-Adventures-in-Thunderbolt-DMA-Attacks-Slides.pdf|title=Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks|first=Russ|last=Sevinsky |conference=Black Hat Briefings|conferenceurl=https://www.blackhat.com|location=Las Vegas |format=PDF |date=1 August 2013 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=\"TBHW\">{{cite web|url= https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works|title=Thunderbolt how it works|publisher=Intel|date=2014|accessdate=1 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029185956/https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |archive-date=2014-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0HthE3qDMw|title=Black Hat USA 2013 - Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks|first=Russ|last=Sevinsky|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Vulnerability to Option ROM attacks===\nWhen a system with Thunderbolt boots, it loads and executes [[Option ROM]]s from attached devices.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>[https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html VP Association List of Maritime Aircraft Mishaps]</ref> lost an engine on approach.

Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=\"Anderson\">Unknown, \"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n\nOn 16 October 1958, returning from Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">[https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html Skywarrior Association Aircraft History by Bureau Number]</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=DeanBoys>[http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm Dean Boys' History of EC-121]</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened causing the tail to separate from the remainder of the fuselage at the main cargo door. The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref name=StaHypo>[https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/ Staion Hypo History Of VQ-2. Part 3]</ref><ref name=VQH>[http://vqassociation.org/history/ VQ Association]</ref>. All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref><ref>https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/</ref>\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref>, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Twp squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref>https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name=VPNavy>[https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html VP Association List of Maritime Aircraft Mishaps]</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=Anderson>Unknown, \"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n\nOn 16 October 1958, returning from Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=A3BUNO>[https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html Skywarrior Association Aircraft History by Bureau Number]</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=DeanBoys>[http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm Dean Boys' History of EC-121]</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened causing the tail to separate from the remainder of the fuselage at the main cargo door. The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref name=StaHypo>[https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/ Staion Hypo History Of VQ-2. Part 3]</ref><ref name=VQH>[http://vqassociation.org/history/ VQ Association]</ref>. All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref><ref>https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/</ref>\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref>, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Twp squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref>https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref>https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html</ref> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach.
