It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.  The term ''aerodynamics'' is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that \"gas dynamics\" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. \nThe formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as [[aerodynamic drag]] were recorded much earlier.  Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving [[Aircraft#Heavier than air \u2013 aerodynes|heavier-than-air flight]], which was first demonstrated by [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1891.<ref>{{cite web |title=How the Stork Inspired Human Flight |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/how-stork-inspired-human-flight.html|publisher= flyingmag.com}}</ref>  Since then, the use of aerodynamics through [[mathematical]] analysis, empirical approximations, [[wind tunnel]] experimentation, and [[computer simulation]]s has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies.

Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.\n\nDuring the time of the first flights, [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | url=https://archive.org/details/aerodynamicscons00lanc | year=1907}}</ref> [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics<ref>{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragfl\u00fcgeltheorie | publisher=G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451\u2013477 | year=1919}}</ref> behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s.\n\nAs aircraft speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air [[compressibility]] at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound.  The differences in air flows under such conditions leads to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to [[shock wave]]s, and the threat of structural failure due to [[Aeroelasticity|aeroelastic flutter]].  The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]] who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]], while [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt |volume=16|pages=72\u201374 | year=1925}}</ref> [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the [[sound barrier]] was broken for the first time in 1947 using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft.\n\nBy the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The [[Cold War]] prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions.  Understanding of [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behavior of fluid flow to the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts predictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n==Fundamental concepts==\n[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces of flight on an [[airfoil]]]]\nUnderstanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field)  enables the calculation of forces and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] acting on the object.  In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], [[thrust]], and [[weight]].  Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body.  Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, [[momentum]], and energy in air flows.  Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, [[viscosity]], are used to classify flow fields. \n\n===Flow classification===\nFlow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.  Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.\n\n[[Compressibility|Compressible flow]] accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.\n\nViscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).\n\n====Continuum assumption====\nUnlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete [[molecule]]s which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.\n\nThe validity of the [[continuum assumption]] is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the [[mean free path]] length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000&nbsp;ft/90&nbsp;km)<ref name = \"andersonhist\">{{cite book|last = Anderson|first = John David | title = A History of Aerodynamics and its Impact on Flying Machines| publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1997| location=New York, NY | isbn=0-521-45435-2}}</ref> or satellites in [[Low Earth orbit]]. In those cases, [[statistical mechanics]] is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The [[Knudsen number]] can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.\n\n===Conservation laws===\nThe assumption of  a [[Continuum mechanics|fluid continuum]] allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using [[Fluid dynamics#Conservation laws|fluid dynamics conservation laws]]. Three conservation principles are used: \n; [[Conservation of mass]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle is known as the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|mass continuity equation]], which requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow of interest.\n; [[Conservation of momentum]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of [[Newton's Second Law]]. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the system by external forces, which may include both [[surface force]]s, such as viscous ([[friction]]al) forces, and [[body force]]s, such as [[gravity|weight]].  The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a [[Vector space|vector]] equation or separated into a set of three [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] equations (x,y,z components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation equations are known as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].  The Navier-Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using [[computational fluid dynamics|computational techniques]]. Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces and may be used in cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small. Additionally, [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's equation]] is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an inviscid flow that neglects gravity.\n; [[Conservation of energy]]: The energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by the fluid flow, by [[heat transfer]], or by [[Work (physics)|work]] into and out of the region of interest.\n\nThe [[ideal gas law]] or another such [[equation of state]] is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.\n\n==Branches of aerodynamics==\nAerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including [[flow speed]], [[compressibility]], and [[viscosity]]. ''External'' aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on an [[airplane]] or the [[shock wave]]s that form in front of the nose of a [[rocket]] are examples of external aerodynamics. ''Internal'' aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a [[jet engine]] or through an [[air conditioning]] pipe.\n\nAerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the [[flow speed]] is below, near or above the [[speed of sound]]. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, [[transonic]] if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), [[supersonic]] when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and [[hypersonic]] when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with [[Mach number]]s above 5 to be hypersonic.<ref name = \"andersonhist\"/>\n\nThe influence of [[viscosity]] on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called [[inviscid flow]]s. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.\n\n===Incompressible aerodynamics===\n{{further information|incompressible flow}}\nAn incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space.  Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound.  The [[Mach number]] is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.\n\n====Subsonic flow====\nSubsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is [[inviscid]], [[Compressibility|incompressible]] and [[irrotational]]. This case is called [[potential flow]] and allows the [[differential equations]] that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of [[fluid dynamics]], thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Joseph|title=Low-speed aerodynamics: From wing theory to panel methods|series=McGraw-Hill series in aeronautical and aerospace engineering|year=1991|publisher=McGraw-Hill\n|location=New York|isbn=0-07-050446-6|oclc=21593499}}</ref>\n\nIn solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of [[density]] in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the [[Mach number]] in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102&nbsp;m) per second or 228 miles (366&nbsp;km) per hour at 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.\n\n===Compressible aerodynamics===\n{{main article|Compressible flow}}\nAccording to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the [[density]] changes along a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. This means that \u2013 unlike incompressible flow \u2013 changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the [[Mach number]] in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the [[stagnation point]] (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.\n\n====Transonic flow====\n{{main article|Transonic}}\nThe term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local [[speed of sound]] (generally taken as [[Mach Number|Mach]] 0.8\u20131.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the [[critical mach|critical Mach number]], when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become [[supersonic]], and a higher speed, typically near [[Mach number|Mach 1.2]], when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.\n\n{{anchor|Supersonic aerodynamics}}<!-- anchor for the link that leads directly to the section -->\n\n====Supersonic flow====\n{{main article|Supersonic}}\nSupersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. problem. the lift on the [[Concorde]] during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.\n\nSupersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is \"told\" to respond to its environment. Therefore, since [[sound]] is, in fact, an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the [[speed of sound]] in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that \"information\" can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a [[stagnation pressure]] as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid \"knows\" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow, however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties \u2013 [[temperature]], [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[Mach number]]\u2014in an extremely violent and [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]] fashion called a [[shock wave]]. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see [[Reynolds number]]) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.\n\n====Hypersonic flow====\n{{main article|Hypersonic}}\nIn aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.\n\n==Associated terminology==\n[[File:Types of flow analysis in fluid mechanics.svg|thumb|Different types flow analysis around an airfoil: \n  {{legend|#f3f3fd|[[Potential flow]] theory}}\n  {{legend|#ff9665|[[Boundary layer|Boundary layer flow]] theory}}\n  {{legend|#3b3bde|[[Turbulence|Turbulent wake]] analysis}}]]\n\nThe incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.\n\n===Boundary layers===\n{{main article|Boundary layer}}\nThe concept of a [[boundary layer]] is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.\n\n===Turbulence===\n{{main article|Turbulence}}\nIn aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called [[laminar flow]].\n\n==Aerodynamics in other fields==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n===Engineering design===\n{{Further information|Automotive aerodynamics}}\nAerodynamics is a significant factor in [[Automotive engineering|vehicle design]], including [[automobile]]s, and in the prediction of forces and moments acting on [[sailing|sailing vessels]]. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as [[hard drive]] heads. [[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] resort to aerodynamics, and particularly [[aeroelasticity]], when calculating [[wind]] loads in the design of large buildings, [[bridge]]s, and [[Wind turbine design|wind turbines]] \n\nThe aerodynamics of internal passages is important in [[HVAC|heating/ventilation]], [[Duct (HVAC)|gas piping]], and in [[Internal combustion engine|automotive engines]] where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.\n\n===Environmental design===\nUrban aerodynamics are studied by [[Urban planning|town planners]] and designers seeking to improve [[amenity]] in outdoor spaces, or in creating urban microclimates to reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes ways in which [[atmospheric circulation]] and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. \n\nAerodynamic equations are used in [[numerical weather prediction]].\n\n===Ball-control in sports===\nSports in which aerodynamics are of crucial importance include [[Association football|soccer]], [[cricket]] and golf, in which control over the trajectory of ball movement is sought by expert players who can, for instance, exploit the \"[[Magnus effect#In sport|Magnus effect]]\" and other environmental conditions to advantage.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aeronautics]]\n* [[Aerostatics]]\n* [[Aviation]]\n* [[Insect flight]] \u2013 how bugs fly\n* [[List of aerospace engineering topics]]\n* [[List of engineering topics]]\n* [[Nose cone design]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n'''General aerodynamics'''\n* {{cite book | author=Anderson, John D.| authorlink=John D.

It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.  The term ''aerodynamics'' is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that \"gas dynamics\" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. \nThe formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as [[aerodynamic drag]] were recorded much earlier.  Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving [[Aircraft#Heavier than air \u2013 aerodynes|heavier-than-air flight]], which was first demonstrated by [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1891.<ref>{{cite web |title=How the Stork Inspired Human Flight |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/how-stork-inspired-human-flight.html|publisher= flyingmag.com}}</ref>  Since then, the use of aerodynamics through [[mathematical]] analysis, empirical approximations, [[wind tunnel]] experimentation, and [[computer simulation]]s has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies.

Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.\n\nDuring the time of the first flights, [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | url=https://archive.org/details/aerodynamicscons00lanc | year=1907}}</ref> [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics<ref>{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragfl\u00fcgeltheorie | publisher=G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451\u2013477 | year=1919}}</ref> behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s.\n\nAs aircraft speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air [[compressibility]] at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound.  The differences in air flows under such conditions leads to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to [[shock wave]]s, and the threat of structural failure due to [[Aeroelasticity|aeroelastic flutter]].  The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]] who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]], while [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt |volume=16|pages=72\u201374 | year=1925}}</ref> [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the [[sound barrier]] was broken for the first time in 1947 using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft.\n\nBy the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The [[Cold War]] prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions.  Understanding of [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behavior of fluid flow to the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts predictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n==Fundamental concepts==\n[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces of flight on an [[airfoil]]]]\nUnderstanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field)  enables the calculation of forces and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] acting on the object.  In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], [[thrust]], and [[weight]].  Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body.  Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, [[momentum]], and energy in air flows.  Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, [[viscosity]], are used to classify flow fields. \n\n===Flow classification===\nFlow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.  Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.\n\n[[Compressibility|Compressible flow]] accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.\n\nViscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).\n\n====Continuum assumption====\nUnlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete [[molecule]]s which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.\n\nThe validity of the [[continuum assumption]] is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the [[mean free path]] length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000&nbsp;ft/90&nbsp;km)<ref name = \"andersonhist\">{{cite book|last = Anderson|first = John David | title = A History of Aerodynamics and its Impact on Flying Machines| publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1997| location=New York, NY | isbn=0-521-45435-2}}</ref> or satellites in [[Low Earth orbit]]. In those cases, [[statistical mechanics]] is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The [[Knudsen number]] can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.\n\n===Conservation laws===\nThe assumption of  a [[Continuum mechanics|fluid continuum]] allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using [[Fluid dynamics#Conservation laws|fluid dynamics conservation laws]]. Three conservation principles are used: \n; [[Conservation of mass]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle is known as the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|mass continuity equation]], which requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow of interest.\n; [[Conservation of momentum]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of [[Newton's Second Law]]. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the system by external forces, which may include both [[surface force]]s, such as viscous ([[friction]]al) forces, and [[body force]]s, such as [[gravity|weight]].  The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a [[Vector space|vector]] equation or separated into a set of three [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] equations (x,y,z components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation equations are known as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].  The Navier-Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using [[computational fluid dynamics|computational techniques]]. Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces and may be used in cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small. Additionally, [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's equation]] is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an inviscid flow that neglects gravity.\n; [[Conservation of energy]]: The energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by the fluid flow, by [[heat transfer]], or by [[Work (physics)|work]] into and out of the region of interest.\n\nThe [[ideal gas law]] or another such [[equation of state]] is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.\n\n==Branches of aerodynamics==\nAerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including [[flow speed]], [[compressibility]], and [[viscosity]]. ''External'' aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on an [[airplane]] or the [[shock wave]]s that form in front of the nose of a [[rocket]] are examples of external aerodynamics. ''Internal'' aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a [[jet engine]] or through an [[air conditioning]] pipe.\n\nAerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the [[flow speed]] is below, near or above the [[speed of sound]]. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, [[transonic]] if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), [[supersonic]] when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and [[hypersonic]] when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with [[Mach number]]s above 5 to be hypersonic.<ref name = \"andersonhist\"/>\n\nThe influence of [[viscosity]] on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called [[inviscid flow]]s. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.\n\n===Incompressible aerodynamics===\n{{further information|incompressible flow}}\nAn incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space.  Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound.  The [[Mach number]] is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.\n\n====Subsonic flow====\nSubsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is [[inviscid]], [[Compressibility|incompressible]] and [[irrotational]]. This case is called [[potential flow]] and allows the [[differential equations]] that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of [[fluid dynamics]], thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Joseph|title=Low-speed aerodynamics: From wing theory to panel methods|series=McGraw-Hill series in aeronautical and aerospace engineering|year=1991|publisher=McGraw-Hill\n|location=New York|isbn=0-07-050446-6|oclc=21593499}}</ref>\n\nIn solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of [[density]] in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the [[Mach number]] in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102&nbsp;m) per second or 228 miles (366&nbsp;km) per hour at 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.\n\n===Compressible aerodynamics===\n{{main article|Compressible flow}}\nAccording to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the [[density]] changes along a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. This means that \u2013 unlike incompressible flow \u2013 changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the [[Mach number]] in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the [[stagnation point]] (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.\n\n====Transonic flow====\n{{main article|Transonic}}\nThe term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local [[speed of sound]] (generally taken as [[Mach Number|Mach]] 0.8\u20131.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the [[critical mach|critical Mach number]], when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become [[supersonic]], and a higher speed, typically near [[Mach number|Mach 1.2]], when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.\n\n{{anchor|Supersonic aerodynamics}}<!-- anchor for the link that leads directly to the section -->\n\n====Supersonic flow====\n{{main article|Supersonic}}\nSupersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the [[Concorde]] during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.\n\nSupersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is \"told\" to respond to its environment. Therefore, since [[sound]] is, in fact, an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the [[speed of sound]] in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that \"information\" can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a [[stagnation pressure]] as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid \"knows\" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow, however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties \u2013 [[temperature]], [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[Mach number]]\u2014in an extremely violent and [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]] fashion called a [[shock wave]]. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see [[Reynolds number]]) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.\n\n====Hypersonic flow====\n{{main article|Hypersonic}}\nIn aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.\n\n==Associated terminology==\n[[File:Types of flow analysis in fluid mechanics.svg|thumb|Different types flow analysis around an airfoil: \n  {{legend|#f3f3fd|[[Potential flow]] theory}}\n  {{legend|#ff9665|[[Boundary layer|Boundary layer flow]] theory}}\n  {{legend|#3b3bde|[[Turbulence|Turbulent wake]] analysis}}]]\n\nThe incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.\n\n===Boundary layers===\n{{main article|Boundary layer}}\nThe concept of a [[boundary layer]] is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.\n\n===Turbulence===\n{{main article|Turbulence}}\nIn aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called [[laminar flow]].\n\n==Aerodynamics in other fields==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n===Engineering design===\n{{Further information|Automotive aerodynamics}}\nAerodynamics is a significant factor in [[Automotive engineering|vehicle design]], including [[automobile]]s, and in the prediction of forces and moments acting on [[sailing|sailing vessels]]. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as [[hard drive]] heads. [[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] resort to aerodynamics, and particularly [[aeroelasticity]], when calculating [[wind]] loads in the design of large buildings, [[bridge]]s, and [[Wind turbine design|wind turbines]] \n\nThe aerodynamics of internal passages is important in [[HVAC|heating/ventilation]], [[Duct (HVAC)|gas piping]], and in [[Internal combustion engine|automotive engines]] where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.\n\n===Environmental design===\nUrban aerodynamics are studied by [[Urban planning|town planners]] and designers seeking to improve [[amenity]] in outdoor spaces, or in creating urban microclimates to reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes ways in which [[atmospheric circulation]] and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. \n\nAerodynamic equations are used in [[numerical weather prediction]].\n\n===Ball-control in sports===\nSports in which aerodynamics are of crucial importance include [[Association football|soccer]], [[cricket]] and golf, in which control over the trajectory of ball movement is sought by expert players who can, for instance, exploit the \"[[Magnus effect#In sport|Magnus effect]]\" and other environmental conditions to advantage.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aeronautics]]\n* [[Aerostatics]]\n* [[Aviation]]\n* [[Insect flight]] \u2013 how bugs fly\n* [[List of aerospace engineering topics]]\n* [[List of engineering topics]]\n* [[Nose cone design]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n'''General aerodynamics'''\n* {{cite book | author=Anderson, John D.| authorlink=John D.

{"title_page": "Relativistic angular momentum", "text_new": "{{Short description|Angular momentum in special and general relativity}}\n{{spacetime}}\n{{main|Angular Momentum}}\n\nIn [[physics]], '''relativistic angular momentum''' refers to the mathematical formalisms and physical concepts that define [[angular momentum]] in [[special relativity]] (SR) and [[general relativity]] (GR). The relativistic quantity is subtly different from the [[three-dimensional]] quantity in [[classical mechanics]].\n\nAngular momentum is an important dynamical quantity derived from position and momentum. It is a measure of an object's rotational motion and resistance to stop rotating. Also, in the same way momentum conservation corresponds to translational symmetry, angular momentum conservation corresponds to rotational symmetry \u2013 the connection between [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] and [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s is made by [[Noether's theorem]]. While these concepts were originally discovered in [[classical mechanics]], they are also true and significant in special and general relativity. In terms of abstract algebra, the invariance of angular momentum, four-momentum, and other symmetries in spacetime, are described by the [[Lorentz group]], or more generally the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]].\n\n[[Physical quantity|Physical quantities]] that remain separate in classical physics are ''naturally combined'' in SR and GR by enforcing the postulates of relativity. Most notably, the space and time coordinates combine into the [[Four-vector#Four-position|four-position]], and energy and momentum combine into the [[four-momentum]]. The components of these [[four-vector]]s depend on the [[frame of reference]] used, and change under [[Lorentz transformation]]s to other [[inertial frame]]s or [[Non-inertial reference frame|accelerated frame]]s.\n\nRelativistic angular momentum is less obvious. The classical definition of angular momentum is the [[cross product]] of position '''x''' with momentum '''p''' to obtain a [[pseudovector]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u00d7 '''p'''}}, or alternatively as the [[exterior product]] to obtain a second order [[antisymmetric tensor]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2227 '''p'''}}. What does this combine with, if anything? There is another vector quantity not often discussed \u2013 it is the time-varying moment of mass polar-vector (''not'' the [[moment of inertia]]) related to the boost of the [[centre of mass]] of the system, and this combines with the classical angular momentum pseudovector to form an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order, in exactly the same way as how the electric field polar-vector combines with the magnetic field pseudovector to form the electromagnetic field antisymmetric tensor. For rotating mass\u2013energy distributions (such as [[gyroscopes]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, and [[black hole]]s) instead of point-like particles, the '''angular momentum tensor''' is expressed in terms of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] of the rotating object.\n\nIn special relativity alone, in the [[rest frame]] of a spinning object; there is an intrinsic angular momentum analogous to the \"spin\" in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], although for an extended body rather than a point particle. In relativistic quantum mechanics, [[elementary particle]]s have ''[[spin (physics)|spin]]'' and this is an additional contribution to the ''orbital'' angular momentum operator, yielding the ''total'' angular momentum tensor operator. In any case, the intrinsic \"spin\" addition to the orbital angular momentum of an object can be expressed in terms of the [[Pauli\u2013Lubanski pseudovector]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Geometry and quantum field theory|edition=2nd|author1=D.S.A.

It is related to the boost ([[relative velocity]]) of the [[centre of mass]] (COM) of the particle or system of particles, as measured in the [[lab frame]]. There is no universal symbol, nor even a universal name, for this quantity. Different authors may denote it by other symbols if any (for example '''\u03bc'''), may designate other names, and may define '''N''' to be the negative of what is used here. The above form has the advantage that it resembles the familiar [[Galilean transformation]] for position, which in turn is the non-relativistic boost transformation between inertial frames.\n\nThis vector is also additive: for a system of particles, the vector sum is the resultant\n\n:<math>\\sum_n \\mathbf{N}_n = \\sum_n m_n \\left(\\mathbf{x}_n - t \\mathbf{u}_n \\right) = \\left(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{COM}\\sum_n m_n - t \\sum_n m_n \\mathbf{u}_n \\right)= M_{\\mathrm{TOT}}(\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}}-\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{COM}}t)</math>\n\nwhere the system's [[centre of mass]] position and velocity and total mass are respectively\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{COM} = \\frac{\\sum_n m_n\\mathbf{x}_n}{\\sum_n m_n}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{COM}=\\frac{\\sum_n m_n \\mathbf{u}_n}{\\sum_n m_n}</math>, <math>M_{\\mathrm{TOT}} = \\sum_n m_n</math>.\n\nFor an isolated system, '''N''' is conserved in time, which can be seen by differentiating with respect to time. The angular momentum '''L''' is a pseudovector, but '''N''' is an \"ordinary\" (polar) vector, and is therefore invariant under rotations.\n\nThe resultant '''N'''<sub>total</sub> for a multiparticle system has the physical visualization that, whatever the complicated motion of all the particles are, they move in such a way that the system's COM moves in a straight line. This does not necessarily mean all particles \"follow\" the COM, nor that all particles all move in almost the same direction simultaneously, only that the motion of all the particles are constrained in relation to the centre of mass.\n\nIn special relativity, if the particle moves with velocity '''u''' relative to the lab frame, then\n\n:<math>E = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0c^2, \\quad \\mathbf{p} = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0\\mathbf{u}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\gamma (\\mathbf{u}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}}{c^2}}}</math>\n\nis the [[Lorentz factor]] and ''m''<sub>0</sub> the rest mass of the particle.

The Cartesian components are\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_x = mx - p_xt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}x - p_xt = \\gamma(u)m_0(x - u_x t) \\\\\n  N_y = my - p_yt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}y - p_yt = \\gamma(u)m_0(y - u_y t) \\\\\n  N_z = mz - p_zt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}z - p_zt = \\gamma(u)m_0(z - u_z t)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nExpressing '''N''' in terms of relativistic mass-energy and momentum, rather than rest mass and velocity, avoids extra Lorentz factors. However, relativistic mass is discouraged by some authors since it can be a misleading quantity to apply in certain equations.\n\n==Special relativity==\n\n===Coordinate transformations for a boost in the x direction===\n\nConsider a coordinate frame F&prime; which moves with velocity '''v''' = (''v'', 0, 0) relative to another frame F, along the direction of the coincident ''xx&prime;'' axes. The origins of the two coordinate frames coincide at times ''t'' = ''t''&prime; = 0. The mass\u2013energy ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup> and momentum components '''p''' = (''p<sub>x</sub>'', ''p<sub>y</sub>'', ''p<sub>z</sub>'') of an object, as well as position coordinates '''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and time ''t'' in frame F are transformed to ''E''&prime; = ''m''&prime;''c''<sup>2</sup>, '''p'''&prime; = (''p<sub>x</sub>''&prime;, ''p<sub>y</sub>''&prime;, ''p<sub>z</sub>''&prime;), '''x'''&prime; = (''x''&prime;, ''y''&prime;, ''z''&prime;), and ''t''&prime; in F&prime; according to the [[Lorentz transformation]]s\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  t' &= \\gamma(v) \\left(t - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right) \\,,\\quad & E'   &= \\gamma(v) \\left(E - vp_x \\right) \\\\ \n  x' &= \\gamma(v) (x - vt) \\,,\\quad                        & p_x' &= \\gamma(v) \\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right) \\\\ \n  y' &= y \\,,\\quad                                         & p_y' &= p_y \\\\ \n  z' &= z \\,,\\quad                                         & p_z' &= p_z \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe Lorentz factor here applies to the velocity '''v''', the relative velocity between the frames. This is not necessarily the same as the velocity '''u''' of an object.\n\nFor the orbital 3-angular momentum '''L''' as a pseudovector, we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L_x' &= y' p_z' - z' p_y' = L_x \\\\ \n  L_y' &= z' p_x' - x' p_z' = \\gamma(v) ( L_y - v N_z ) \\\\ \n  L_z' &= x' p_y' - y' p_x' = \\gamma(v) ( L_z + v N_y ) \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n{{hidden|\n|header=Derivation\n|content=\n\nFor the x-component\n\n:<math>L_x' = y'p_z' - z'p_y' = yp_z - zp_y = L_x</math>\n\nthe y-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L_y' &= z'p_x' - x'p_z'\\\\\n       &= z\\gamma\\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right) - \\gamma\\left(x - vt\\right)p_z \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[zp_x - z\\frac{vE}{c^2} - xp_z + vtp_z\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\left(zp_x - xp_z\\right) + v\\left(p_zt - z\\frac{E}{c^2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(L_y - vN_z\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand z-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L_z' &= x' p_y' - y' p_x'\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(x - vt\\right)p_y - y\\gamma\\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right)\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[xp_y - vtp_y - yp_x + y\\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\left(xp_y - yp_x\\right) + v\\left(y\\frac{E}{c^2} - tp_y\\right)\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(L_z + vN_y\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n \n}}\n\nIn the second terms of ''L<sub>y</sub>''&prime; and ''L<sub>z</sub>''&prime;, the ''y'' and ''z'' components of the [[cross product]] '''v'''\u00d7'''N''' can be inferred by recognizing [[cyclic permutation]]s of ''v<sub>x</sub>'' = ''v'' and ''v<sub>y</sub>'' = ''v<sub>z</sub>'' = 0 with the components of '''N''',\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   -v N_z &= v_z N_x - v_x N_z = \\left(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{N}\\right)_y \\\\ \n    v N_y &= v_x N_y - v_y N_x = \\left(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{N}\\right)_z \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNow, ''L<sub>x</sub>'' is parallel to the relative velocity '''v''', and the other components ''L<sub>y</sub>'' and ''L<sub>z</sub>'' are perpendicular to '''v'''. The parallel\u2013perpendicular correspondence can be facilitated by splitting the entire 3-angular momentum pseudovector into components parallel (\u2225) and perpendicular (\u22a5) to '''v''', in each frame,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{L}_\\parallel + \\mathbf{L}_\\perp \\,,\\quad \\mathbf{L}' = \\mathbf{L}_\\parallel' + \\mathbf{L}_\\perp'\\,.</math>\n\nThen the component equations can be collected into the pseudovector equations\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{L}_\\parallel' &= \\mathbf{L}_\\parallel \\\\ \n      \\mathbf{L}_\\perp' &= \\gamma(\\mathbf{v})\\left(\\mathbf{L}_\\perp + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{N} \\right) \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTherefore, the components of angular momentum along the direction of motion do not change, while the components perpendicular do change. By contrast to the transformations of space and time, time and the spatial coordinates change along the direction of motion, while those perpendicular do not.\n\nThese transformations are true for ''all'' '''v''', not just for motion along the ''xx&prime;'' axes.\n\nConsidering '''L''' as a tensor, we get a similar result\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L}_\\perp' = \\gamma(\\mathbf{v})\\left(\\mathbf{L}_\\perp + \\mathbf{v} \\wedge \\mathbf{N} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   v_z N_x - v_x N_z &= \\left(\\mathbf{v}\\wedge\\mathbf{N}\\right)_{zx} \\\\ \n   v_x N_y - v_y N_x &= \\left(\\mathbf{v}\\wedge\\mathbf{N}\\right)_{xy} \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe boost of the dynamic mass moment along the x direction is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_x' &= m' x' - p_x' t' = N_x \\\\ \n  N_y' &= m' y' - p_y' t' = \\gamma(v)\\left(N_y + \\frac{v L_z}{c^2}\\right) \\\\ \n  N_z' &= m' z' - p_z' t' = \\gamma(v)\\left(N_z - \\frac{v L_y}{c^2}\\right) \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n{{hidden|\n|header=Derivation\n|content=\n\nFor the x-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_x' &= \\frac{E'}{c^2}x' - t'p_x'\\\\\n       &= \\frac{\\gamma}{c^2}(E - vp_x)\\gamma(x - vt) - \\gamma\\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)\\gamma\\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right) \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}\\left(E - vp_x\\right)(x - vt) - \\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)\\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[\\frac{Ex}{c^2} - \\frac{Evt}{c^2} - \\frac{vp_x x}{c^2} + \\frac{vp_xvt}{c^2} - tp_x + \\frac{xv}{c^2}p_x + t\\frac{vE}{c^2} - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[\\frac{Ex}{c^2}\\cancel{-\\frac{Evt}{c^2}}\\cancel{-\\frac{vp_xx}{c^2}} + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}p_xt - tp_x\\cancel{+\\frac{xv}{c^2}p_x}\\cancel{+t\\frac{vE}{c^2}} - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\frac{Ex}{c^2}\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[\\left(\\frac{Ex}{c^2} - tp_x\\right) + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\left(p_xt - \\frac{Ex}{c^2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right]N_x \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}N_x\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nthe y-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_y' &= \\frac{E'}{c^2}y' - t'p_y' \\\\\n       &= \\frac{1}{c^2}\\gamma(E - vp_x)y - \\gamma\\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)p_y \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}(E - vp_x)y - \\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)p_y\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}Ey - \\frac{1}{c^2}vp_x y - tp_y + \\frac{xv}{c^2}p_y\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{c^2}Ey - tp_y\\right) + \\frac{v}{c^2}(xp_y - yp_x)\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(N_y + \\frac{v}{c^2}L_z\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand z-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_z' &= \\frac{E'}{c^2}z' - t'p_z' \\\\\n       &= \\frac{1}{c^2}\\gamma(E-vp_x)z - \\gamma\\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)p_z\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}(E - vp_x)z - \\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)p_z\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}Ez - \\frac{1}{c^2}vp_z z - tp_z + \\frac{xv}{c^2}p_z\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{c^2}Ez - tp_z\\right) + \\frac{v}{c^2}(xp_z - zp_x)\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(N_z - \\frac{v}{c^2}L_y\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n \n}}\n\nCollecting parallel and perpendicular components as before\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{N}_\\parallel' &= \\mathbf{N}_\\parallel \\\\ \n      \\mathbf{N}_\\perp' &= \\gamma(\\mathbf{v})\\left(\\mathbf{N}_\\perp - \\frac{1}{c^2}\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{L}\\right)\\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAgain, the components parallel to the direction of relative motion do not change, those perpendicular do change.\n\n===Vector transformations for a boost in any direction===\n\nSo far these are only the parallel and perpendicular decompositions of the vectors.

[[Lorentz transformations|Lorentz boosts]] can be parametrized by [[rapidity]], and a 3d [[unit vector]] {{nowrap|'''n'''}} pointing in the direction of the boost, which combine into the \"rapidity vector\"\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\zeta} = \\zeta\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{n}\\tanh^{-1}\\beta</math>\n\nwhere {{nowrap|''\u03b2'' {{=}} ''v/c''}} is the speed of the relative motion divided by the speed of light. Spatial rotations can be parametrized by the [[axis\u2013angle representation]], the angle {{nowrap|''\u03b8''}} and a unit vector {{nowrap|'''a'''}} pointing in the direction of the axis, which combine into an \"axis-angle vector\"\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\theta\\mathbf{a}</math>\n\nEach unit vector only has two independent components, the third is determined from the unit magnitude. Altogether there are six parameters of the Lorentz group; three for rotations and three for boosts. The (homogeneous) Lorentz group is 6-dimensional.\n\nThe boost generators {{nowrap|'''K'''}} and rotation generators {{nowrap|'''J'''}} can be combined into one generator for Lorentz transformations; {{nowrap|'''M'''}} the antisymmetric angular momentum tensor, with components\n\n:<math>M^{0i} = -M^{i0} = K_i \\,,\\quad M^{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ijk} J_k \\,.</math>\n\nand correspondingly, the boost and rotation parameters are collected into another antisymmetric four-dimensional matrix {{nowrap|'''\u03c9'''}}, with entries:\n\n:<math>\\omega_{0i} = - \\omega_{i0} = \\zeta_i \\,,\\quad \\omega_{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ijk} \\theta_k \\,,</math>\n\nwhere the [[summation convention]] over the repeated indices ''i, j, k'' has been used to prevent clumsy summation signs. The general [[Lorentz transformation]] is then given by the [[matrix exponential]]\n\n:<math>\\Lambda(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta},\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{\\alpha\\beta}M^{\\alpha\\beta}\\right) = \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta} \\cdot \\mathbf{K} + \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\cdot\\mathbf{J}\\right)</math>\n\nand the summation convention has been applied to the repeated matrix indices ''\u03b1'' and ''\u03b2''.\n\nThe general Lorentz transformation \u039b is the transformation law for any [[four vector]] '''A''' = (''A''<sub>0</sub>, ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ''A''<sub>3</sub>), giving the components of this same 4-vector in another inertial frame of reference\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}' = \\Lambda(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta},\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\mathbf{A}</math>\n\nThe angular momentum tensor forms 6 of the 10 generators of the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], the other four are the components of the four-momentum for spacetime translations.\n\n==Angular momentum in general relativity==\n\nThe angular momentum of test particles in a gently curved background is more complicated in GR but can be generalized in a straightforward manner.  If the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] is expressed with respect to angular variables as the [[generalized coordinates]], then the angular momenta are the [[functional derivative]]s of the Lagrangian with respect to the [[angular velocity|angular velocities]].  Referred to Cartesian coordinates, these are typically given by the off-diagonal shear terms of the spacelike part of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]].  If the spacetime supports a [[Killing vector field]] tangent to a circle, then the angular momentum about the axis is conserved.\n\nOne also wishes to study the effect of a compact, rotating mass on its surrounding spacetime.  The prototype solution is of the [[Kerr metric]], which describes the spacetime around an axially symmetric [[black hole]].  It is obviously impossible to draw a point on the event horizon of a Kerr black hole and watch it circle around.  However, the solution does support a constant of the system that acts mathematically similar to an angular momentum.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Thomas precession]]\n*[[Angular momentum of light]]\n*[[Two-body problem in general relativity]]\n*[[Kepler problem in general relativity]]\n*[[Relativistic mechanics]]\n*[[Center of mass (relativistic)]]\n*[[Mathisson\u2013Papapetrou\u2013Dixon equations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|title=Center of mass in special and general relativity and its role in an effective description of spacetime|author1=C.

The relativistic quantity is subtly different from the [[three-dimensional]] quantity in [[classical mechanics]].\n\nAngular momentum is an important dynamical quantity derived from position and momentum. It is a measure of an object's rotational motion and resistance to stop rotating. Also, in the same way momentum conservation corresponds to translational symmetry, angular momentum conservation corresponds to rotational symmetry \u2013 the connection between [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] and [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s is made by [[Noether's theorem]]. While these concepts were originally discovered in [[classical mechanics]], they are also true and significant in special and general relativity. In terms of abstract algebra, the invariance of angular momentum, four-momentum, and other symmetries in spacetime, are described by the [[Lorentz group]], or more generally the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]].\n\n[[Physical quantity|Physical quantities]] which remain separate in classical physics are ''naturally combined'' in SR and GR by enforcing the postulates of relativity. Most notably; space and time coordinates combine into the [[Four-vector#Four-position|four-position]], and energy and momentum combine into the [[four-momentum]]. The components of these [[four-vector]]s depend on the [[frame of reference]] used, and change under [[Lorentz transformation]]s to other [[inertial frame]]s or [[Non-inertial reference frame|accelerated frame]]s.\n\nRelativistic angular momentum is less obvious. The classical definition of angular momentum is the [[cross product]] of position '''x''' with momentum '''p''' to obtain a [[pseudovector]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u00d7 '''p'''}}, or alternatively as the [[exterior product]] to obtain a second order [[antisymmetric tensor]] {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2227 '''p'''}}. What does this combine with, if anything? There is another vector quantity not often discussed \u2013 it is the time-varying moment of mass polar-vector (''not'' the [[moment of inertia]]) related to the boost of the [[centre of mass]] of the system, and this combines with the classical angular momentum pseudovector to form an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order, in exactly the same way as how the electric field polar-vector combines with the magnetic field pseudovector to form the electromagnetic field antisymmetric tensor. For rotating mass\u2013energy distributions (such as [[gyroscopes]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, and [[black hole]]s) instead of point-like particles, the '''angular momentum tensor''' is expressed in terms of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] of the rotating object.\n\nIn special relativity alone, in the [[rest frame]] of a spinning object; there is an intrinsic angular momentum analogous to the \"spin\" in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], although for an extended body rather than a point particle. In relativistic quantum mechanics, [[elementary particle]]s have ''[[spin (physics)|spin]]'' and this is an additional contribution to the ''orbital'' angular momentum operator, yielding the ''total'' angular momentum tensor operator. In any case, the intrinsic \"spin\" addition to the orbital angular momentum of an object can be expressed in terms of the [[Pauli\u2013Lubanski pseudovector]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Geometry and quantum field theory|edition=2nd|author1=D.S.A.

It is related to the boost ([[relative velocity]]) of the [[centre of mass]] (COM) of the particle or system of particles, as measured in the [[lab frame]]. There is no universal symbol, nor even a universal name, for this quantity. Different authors may denote it by other symbols if any (for example '''\u03bc'''), may designate other names, and may define '''N''' to be the negative of what is used here. The above form has the advantage that it resembles the familiar [[Galilean transformation]] for position, which in turn is the non-relativistic boost transformation between inertial frames.\n\nThis vector is also additive: for a system of particles, the vector sum is the resultant\n\n:<math>\\sum_n \\mathbf{N}_n = \\sum_n m_n \\left(\\mathbf{x}_n - t \\mathbf{u}_n \\right) = \\left(\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{COM}\\sum_n m_n - t \\sum_n m_n \\mathbf{u}_n \\right)= M_{\\mathrm{TOT}}(\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}}-\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{COM}}t)</math>\n\nwhere the system's [[centre of mass]] position and velocity and total mass are respectively\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{COM} = \\frac{\\sum_n m_n\\mathbf{x}_n}{\\sum_n m_n}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{COM}=\\frac{\\sum_n m_n \\mathbf{u}_n}{\\sum_n m_n}</math>, <math>M_{\\mathrm{TOT}} = \\sum_n m_n</math>.\n\nFor an isolated system, '''N''' is conserved in time, which can be seen by differentiating with respect to time. The angular momentum '''L''' is a pseudovector, but '''N''' is an \"ordinary\" (polar) vector, and is therefore invariant under rotations.\n\nThe resultant '''N'''<sub>total</sub> for a multiparticle system has the physical visualization that, whatever the complicated motion of all the particles are, they move in such a way that the system's COM moves in a straight line. This does not necessarily mean all particles \"follow\" the COM, nor that all particles all move in almost the same direction simultaneously, only that the motion of all the particles are constrained in relation to the centre of mass.\n\nIn special relativity, if the particle moves with velocity '''u''' relative to the lab frame, then\n\n:<math>E = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0c^2, \\quad \\mathbf{p} = \\gamma(\\mathbf{u})m_0\\mathbf{u}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\gamma (\\mathbf{u}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}}{c^2}}}</math>\n\nis the [[Lorentz factor]] and ''m''<sub>0</sub> the rest mass of the particle.

The Cartesian components are\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_x = mx - p_xt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}x - p_xt = \\gamma(u)m_0(x - u_x t) \\\\\n  N_y = my - p_yt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}y - p_yt = \\gamma(u)m_0(y - u_y t) \\\\\n  N_z = mz - p_zt &= \\frac{E}{c^2}z - p_zt = \\gamma(u)m_0(z - u_z t)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nExpressing '''N''' in terms of relativistic mass-energy and momentum, rather than rest mass and velocity, avoids extra Lorentz factors. However, relativistic mass is discouraged by some authors since it can be a misleading quantity to apply in certain equations.\n\n==Special relativity==\n\n===Coordinate transformations for a boost in the x direction===\n\nConsider a coordinate frame F&prime; which moves with velocity '''v''' = (''v'', 0, 0) relative to another frame F, along the direction of the coincident ''xx&prime;'' axes. The origins of the two coordinate frames coincide at times ''t'' = ''t''&prime; = 0. The mass\u2013energy ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup> and momentum components '''p''' = (''p<sub>x</sub>'', ''p<sub>y</sub>'', ''p<sub>z</sub>'') of an object, as well as position coordinates '''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and time ''t'' in frame F are transformed to ''E''&prime; = ''m''&prime;''c''<sup>2</sup>, '''p'''&prime; = (''p<sub>x</sub>''&prime;, ''p<sub>y</sub>''&prime;, ''p<sub>z</sub>''&prime;), '''x'''&prime; = (''x''&prime;, ''y''&prime;, ''z''&prime;), and ''t''&prime; in F&prime; according to the [[Lorentz transformation]]s\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  t' &= \\gamma(v) \\left(t - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right) \\,,\\quad & E'   &= \\gamma(v) \\left(E - vp_x \\right) \\\\ \n  x' &= \\gamma(v) (x - vt) \\,,\\quad                        & p_x' &= \\gamma(v) \\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right) \\\\ \n  y' &= y \\,,\\quad                                         & p_y' &= p_y \\\\ \n  z' &= z \\,,\\quad                                         & p_z' &= p_z \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe Lorentz factor here applies to the velocity '''v''', the relative velocity between the frames. This is not necessarily the same as the velocity '''u''' of an object.\n\nFor the orbital 3-angular momentum '''L''' as a pseudovector, we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L_x' &= y' p_z' - z' p_y' = L_x \\\\ \n  L_y' &= z' p_x' - x' p_z' = \\gamma(v) ( L_y - v N_z ) \\\\ \n  L_z' &= x' p_y' - y' p_x' = \\gamma(v) ( L_z + v N_y ) \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n{{hidden|\n|header=Derivation\n|content=\n\nFor the x-component\n\n:<math>L_x' = y'p_z' - z'p_y' = yp_z - zp_y = L_x</math>\n\nthe y-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L_y' &= z'p_x' - x'p_z'\\\\\n       &= z\\gamma\\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right) - \\gamma\\left(x - vt\\right)p_z \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[zp_x - z\\frac{vE}{c^2} - xp_z + vtp_z\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\left(zp_x - xp_z\\right) + v\\left(p_zt - z\\frac{E}{c^2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(L_y - vN_z\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand z-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  L_z' &= x' p_y' - y' p_x'\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(x - vt\\right)p_y - y\\gamma\\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right)\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[xp_y - vtp_y - yp_x + y\\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\left(xp_y - yp_x\\right) + v\\left(y\\frac{E}{c^2} - tp_y\\right)\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(L_z + vN_y\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n \n}}\n\nIn the second terms of ''L<sub>y</sub>''&prime; and ''L<sub>z</sub>''&prime;, the ''y'' and ''z'' components of the [[cross product]] '''v'''\u00d7'''N''' can be inferred by recognizing [[cyclic permutation]]s of ''v<sub>x</sub>'' = ''v'' and ''v<sub>y</sub>'' = ''v<sub>z</sub>'' = 0 with the components of '''N''',\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   -v N_z &= v_z N_x - v_x N_z = \\left(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{N}\\right)_y \\\\ \n    v N_y &= v_x N_y - v_y N_x = \\left(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{N}\\right)_z \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNow, ''L<sub>x</sub>'' is parallel to the relative velocity '''v''', and the other components ''L<sub>y</sub>'' and ''L<sub>z</sub>'' are perpendicular to '''v'''. The parallel\u2013perpendicular correspondence can be facilitated by splitting the entire 3-angular momentum pseudovector into components parallel (\u2225) and perpendicular (\u22a5) to '''v''', in each frame,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{L}_\\parallel + \\mathbf{L}_\\perp \\,,\\quad \\mathbf{L}' = \\mathbf{L}_\\parallel' + \\mathbf{L}_\\perp'\\,.</math>\n\nThen the component equations can be collected into the pseudovector equations\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{L}_\\parallel' &= \\mathbf{L}_\\parallel \\\\ \n      \\mathbf{L}_\\perp' &= \\gamma(\\mathbf{v})\\left(\\mathbf{L}_\\perp + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{N} \\right) \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTherefore, the components of angular momentum along the direction of motion do not change, while the components perpendicular do change. By contrast to the transformations of space and time, time and the spatial coordinates change along the direction of motion, while those perpendicular do not.\n\nThese transformations are true for ''all'' '''v''', not just for motion along the ''xx&prime;'' axes.\n\nConsidering '''L''' as a tensor, we get a similar result\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L}_\\perp' = \\gamma(\\mathbf{v})\\left(\\mathbf{L}_\\perp + \\mathbf{v} \\wedge \\mathbf{N} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   v_z N_x - v_x N_z &= \\left(\\mathbf{v}\\wedge\\mathbf{N}\\right)_{zx} \\\\ \n   v_x N_y - v_y N_x &= \\left(\\mathbf{v}\\wedge\\mathbf{N}\\right)_{xy} \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe boost of the dynamic mass moment along the x direction is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_x' &= m' x' - p_x' t' = N_x \\\\ \n  N_y' &= m' y' - p_y' t' = \\gamma(v)\\left(N_y + \\frac{v L_z}{c^2}\\right) \\\\ \n  N_z' &= m' z' - p_z' t' = \\gamma(v)\\left(N_z - \\frac{v L_y}{c^2}\\right) \\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n{{hidden|\n|header=Derivation\n|content=\n\nFor the x-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_x' &= \\frac{E'}{c^2}x' - t'p_x'\\\\\n       &= \\frac{\\gamma}{c^2}(E - vp_x)\\gamma(x - vt) - \\gamma\\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)\\gamma\\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right) \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}\\left(E - vp_x\\right)(x - vt) - \\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)\\left(p_x - \\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[\\frac{Ex}{c^2} - \\frac{Evt}{c^2} - \\frac{vp_x x}{c^2} + \\frac{vp_xvt}{c^2} - tp_x + \\frac{xv}{c^2}p_x + t\\frac{vE}{c^2} - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\frac{vE}{c^2}\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[\\frac{Ex}{c^2}\\cancel{-\\frac{Evt}{c^2}}\\cancel{-\\frac{vp_xx}{c^2}} + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}p_xt - tp_x\\cancel{+\\frac{xv}{c^2}p_x}\\cancel{+t\\frac{vE}{c^2}} - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\frac{Ex}{c^2}\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[\\left(\\frac{Ex}{c^2} - tp_x\\right) + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\left(p_xt - \\frac{Ex}{c^2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\left[1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right]N_x \\\\\n       &= \\gamma^2\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}N_x\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nthe y-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_y' &= \\frac{E'}{c^2}y' - t'p_y' \\\\\n       &= \\frac{1}{c^2}\\gamma(E - vp_x)y - \\gamma\\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)p_y \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}(E - vp_x)y - \\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)p_y\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}Ey - \\frac{1}{c^2}vp_x y - tp_y + \\frac{xv}{c^2}p_y\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{c^2}Ey - tp_y\\right) + \\frac{v}{c^2}(xp_y - yp_x)\\right] \\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(N_y + \\frac{v}{c^2}L_z\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand z-component\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  N_z' &= \\frac{E'}{c^2}z' - t'p_z' \\\\\n       &= \\frac{1}{c^2}\\gamma(E-vp_x)z - \\gamma\\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)p_z\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}(E - vp_x)z - \\left(t - \\frac{xv}{c^2}\\right)p_z\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{c^2}Ez - \\frac{1}{c^2}vp_z z - tp_z + \\frac{xv}{c^2}p_z\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{c^2}Ez - tp_z\\right) + \\frac{v}{c^2}(xp_z - zp_x)\\right]\\\\\n       &= \\gamma\\left(N_z - \\frac{v}{c^2}L_y\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n \n}}\n\nCollecting parallel and perpendicular components as before\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{N}_\\parallel' &= \\mathbf{N}_\\parallel \\\\ \n      \\mathbf{N}_\\perp' &= \\gamma(\\mathbf{v})\\left(\\mathbf{N}_\\perp - \\frac{1}{c^2}\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{L}\\right)\\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAgain, the components parallel to the direction of relative motion do not change, those perpendicular do change.\n\n===Vector transformations for a boost in any direction===\n\nSo far these are only the parallel and perpendicular decompositions of the vectors.

Integrating the angular momentum density over a 3d spacetime hypersurface yields the angular momentum tensor about {{overline|''X''}},\n\n:<math>M^{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(\\bar{X}\\right) = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathcal{M}^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma} d \\Sigma_\\gamma</math>\n\nwhere d\u03a3<sub>\u03b3</sub> is the volume [[One-form|1-form]] playing the role of a [[unit vector]] normal to a 2d surface in ordinary 3d Euclidean space. The integral is taken over the coordinates ''X'', not {{overline|''X''}}. The integral within a spacelike surface of constant time is\n\n:<math>M^{ij} = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathcal{M}^{ij0} d \\Sigma_0 = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\left[\\left(X^i - Y^i\\right)T^{j0} - \\left(X^j - Y^j\\right)T^{i0}\\right] dxdydz</math>\n\nwhich collectively form the angular momentum tensor.\n\n===Angular momentum about the centre of mass===\n\nThere is an intrinsic angular momentum in the centre-of-mass frame, in other words, the angular momentum about any event\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{X}_\\text{COM} = \\left(X^0_\\text{COM}, X^1_\\text{COM}, X^2_\\text{COM}, X^3_\\text{COM}\\right)</math>\n\n''on'' the wordline of the object's center of mass. Since ''T''<sup>00</sup> is the energy density of the object, the spatial coordinates of the [[center of mass]] are given by\n\n:<math>X^i_\\text{COM} = \\frac{1}{m_0} \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} X^i T^{00} dxdydz</math>\n\nSetting ''Y'' = '''X'''<sub>COM</sub> obtains the orbital angular momentum density about the centre-of-mass of the object.\n\n===Angular momentum conservation ===\n\nThe [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation]] of energy\u2013momentum is given in differential form by the [[continuity equation]]\n\n:<math> \\partial_\\gamma T^{\\beta\\gamma} = 0</math>\n\nwhere \u2202<sub>''\u03b3''</sub> is the [[four gradient]].

[[Lorentz transformations|Lorentz boosts]] can be parametrized by [[rapidity]], and a 3d [[unit vector]] {{nowrap|'''n'''}} pointing in the direction of the boost, which combine into the \"rapidity vector\"\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\zeta} = \\zeta\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{n}\\tanh^{-1}\\beta</math>\n\nwhere {{nowrap|''\u03b2'' {{=}} ''v/c''}} is the speed of the relative motion divided by the speed of light. Spatial rotations can be parametrized by the [[axis\u2013angle representation]], the angle {{nowrap|''\u03b8''}} and a unit vector {{nowrap|'''a'''}} pointing in the direction of the axis, which combine into an \"axis-angle vector\"\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\theta\\mathbf{a}</math>\n\nEach unit vector only has two independent components, the third is determined from the unit magnitude. Altogether there are six parameters of the Lorentz group; three for rotations and three for boosts. The (homogeneous) Lorentz group is 6-dimensional.\n\nThe boost generators {{nowrap|'''K'''}} and rotation generators {{nowrap|'''J'''}} can be combined into one generator for Lorentz transformations; {{nowrap|'''M'''}} the antisymmetric angular momentum tensor, with components\n\n:<math>M^{0i} = -M^{i0} = K_i \\,,\\quad M^{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ijk} J_k \\,.</math>\n\nand correspondingly, the boost and rotation parameters are collected into another antisymmetric four-dimensional matrix {{nowrap|'''\u03c9'''}}, with entries:\n\n:<math>\\omega_{0i} = - \\omega_{i0} = \\zeta_i \\,,\\quad \\omega_{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ijk} \\theta_k \\,,</math>\n\nwhere the [[summation convention]] over the repeated indices ''i, j, k'' has been used to prevent clumsy summation signs. The general [[Lorentz transformation]] is then given by the [[matrix exponential]]\n\n:<math>\\Lambda(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta},\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{\\alpha\\beta}M^{\\alpha\\beta}\\right) = \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta} \\cdot \\mathbf{K} + \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\cdot\\mathbf{J}\\right)</math>\n\nand the summation convention has been applied to the repeated matrix indices ''\u03b1'' and ''\u03b2''.\n\nThe general Lorentz transformation \u039b is the transformation law for any [[four vector]] '''A''' = (''A''<sub>0</sub>, ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ''A''<sub>3</sub>), giving the components of this same 4-vector in another inertial frame of reference\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}' = \\Lambda(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta},\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\mathbf{A}</math>\n\nThe angular momentum tensor forms 6 of the 10 generators of the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], the other four are the components of the four-momentum for spacetime translations.\n\n==Angular momentum in general relativity==\n\nThe angular momentum of test particles in a gently curved background is more complicated in GR but can be generalized in a straightforward manner.  If the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] is expressed with respect to angular variables as the [[generalized coordinates]], then the angular momenta are the [[functional derivative]]s of the Lagrangian with respect to the [[angular velocity|angular velocities]].  Referred to Cartesian coordinates, these are typically given by the off-diagonal shear terms of the spacelike part of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]].  If the spacetime supports a [[Killing vector field]] tangent to a circle, then the angular momentum about the axis is conserved.\n\nOne also wishes to study the effect of a compact, rotating mass on its surrounding spacetime.  The prototype solution is of the [[Kerr metric]], which describes the spacetime around an axially symmetric [[black hole]].  It is obviously impossible to draw a point on the event horizon of a Kerr black hole and watch it circle around.  However, the solution does support a constant of the system that acts mathematically similar to an angular momentum.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Thomas precession]]\n*[[Angular momentum of light]]\n*[[Two-body problem in general relativity]]\n*[[Kepler problem in general relativity]]\n*[[Relativistic mechanics]]\n*[[Center of mass (relativistic)]]\n*[[Mathisson\u2013Papapetrou\u2013Dixon equations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|title=Center of mass in special and general relativity and its role in an effective description of spacetime|author1=C.

As with all of her previous works, Hamasaki wrote all of the lyrics on ''Secret''. The album's composition was handled largely by [[Dai Nagao]] and Tetsuya Yukumi, both of whom were frequent collaborators with Hamasaki. Generally a rock-pop influenced album, Hamasaki said that the meaning of the album was itself a secret, and that it incorporated secrets she was keeping about herself that the public did not know.\n\nSecret had been announced originally as a seven-track [[extended play|EP]]; however, it eventually evolved into a fourteen-track album. \"[[Startin'/Born to Be...]]\" was released as the lead single from ''Secret'' on March 8, 2006. It debuted at the number-one position in Japan, becoming Hamasaki's twenty-sixth chart topper; with this, she became the female singer with the most number-one singles in Japan, breaking [[Seiko Matsuda]]'s record. However, it would sell poorly thereafter, charting for fifteen weeks and selling under 200,000 copies. \"[[Blue Bird (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Blue Bird]]\" would have more success: it topped the charts in Japan and was certified Platinum for shipments of 250,000 copies. With \"Blue Bird\", which sold around 300,000 copies, Hamasaki became the first solo artist in Japan to sell over 20 million singles.\n\n''Secret'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised its rock influences and thought that every song stood well enough on its own, but felt that it \"failed to leave a clear impression\" as a cohesive record. The album won Album of the Year at the [[Japan Gold Disc Awards]]; its title track received \"Japanese Song of the Year\" at the RTHK International Awards in [[Hong Kong]]. ''Secret'' debuted at number one in Japan with first week sales of 386,280 copies. It would go on to become the 22nd best selling album of 2006 in Japan, and the 73rd best seller of 2007, selling 675,400 copies in its 15-week chart run and receiving a triple-platinum certification for having 750,000 copies shipped to stores. Despite this success, ''Secret'' would become her lowest-selling album at that point and her first to not to be certified Million. According to Avex, ''Secret'' has sold 900,000 copies worldwide.\n\n==Title==\nHamasaki on an interview stated that the reason behind naming the album 'Secret' was that the album literally was a secret.<ref name=\"Secret Interview\">{{in lang|ja}} [http://avexnet.or.jp/ayu/en/special/secret/index.html SPECIAL\uff5cayumi hamasaki official website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She said it was named so that people might think \"That's one of her secrets\". She also said she wanted to feel when they hear a song, they should think they knew her secret. The album's lyrics reinforce the understanding others, rather than just yourself, as she states:\n\n<blockquote>But it's not a secret in the sense that \"I'm about to disclose something you didn't know!\" Instead, it could be about \"me\" in my daily life, or it could be about you\u2026 Everyone keeps secrets; there is not one person on this planet who does not have at least one secret, nor is there a person who can tell others everything about him or herself. Even when you try to understand others (or to have a mutual understanding with others), there is always a \"you\" that only you know about. I have aspects that only certain people know about and aspects that everyone knows about. That's what I call a secret. And in this sense, there are secrets incorporated into this album.<ref>[http://avexnet.or.jp/ayu/en/special/secret/index.html Ayumi Hamasaki's official website]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Production==\nOriginally, ''Secret'' was announced to be a seven-track mini-album. After announcing that ''Secret'' was to become a full album on her official website, a message from Hamasaki on her TeamAyu fanclub website stated that she was doing overtime in the studio in order to complete the album on time.\n{{Listen\n|filename=AH_Jewel.ogg\n|title=\"Jewel\" (2006)\n|description=25 second sample from Ayumi Hamasaki's \"Jewel\", one of the slower songs on the album.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nHamasaki stated that \"Until that Day...\" was originally intended to be an instrumental track composed by CMJK.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} She loved the sound of the guitar and the b-melody and thus asked him to compose it into a full-length track.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} From the beginning, she knew just what she had in mind to write about. She admitted to having difficulty matching her emotions with the complex melody of the song so she sat down at home and compiled a list of synonyms of key words and eventually finished the song.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Although she tried to keep the song positive, it sparked feelings of heartbrokenness upon revealing it to her staff.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe third track, \"[[Startin' / Born to Be...|Startin']]\", was recorded in [[New York City]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} According to Hamasaki, the sound in the studio made it easy for her to sing despite the challenge in vocals that she gave herself by choosing to sing in this particular style.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Hamasaki stated that even though the song is generally perceived as a song for dancing on stage with dancers, it was originally intended to be a band-only song.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} She enjoyed her recording session, commenting that what really brought out the new vocal style was doing the recording in the New York studio with its great sound and atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n\"Momentum\", the eighth track on the album, took Hamasaki a total of four days to record.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This is the longest amount of time she has ever taken to record a song in her whole career.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Usually, she goes into the booth and records a song very quickly, but with \"Momentum\" she had been spending so much time in the recording booth that she felt like she might as well have slept there.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Hamasaki stated that listening to the song now makes her remember the strenuous recording and brings her to tears.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe album's title track, \"Secret\", was the last song to be recorded for the album.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Since she had so much strain with recording \"Momentum\", Ayumi vowed to complete the recording for \"Secret\" in one go.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, by doing this she put great pressure on herself and made herself quite nervous.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} She had considered forgetting the song and leaving the studio several times due to the stress from her pressure and the extreme time limit to have the song recorded, but she decided to simply give it her all and do her best.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nBy finishing this song, she had completed the recordings for the entire album. Hamasaki stated that she was almost in tears with the staff members because she actually managed to extend this album from a seven-track mini-album into a full length fourteen-track studio album in a matter of weeks.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2006, recording for the album was wrapped. On November 7, the track list and both the CD-only and CD+DVD covers were released. ''Secret'' is Hamasaki's first album to be produced and sold in [[Malaysia]].\n\n==Promotion==\nDuring November and December 2006, Hamasaki performed live on Japanese TV shows eleven times.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The main promotional track of the album was 'Jewel', which was performed live on Japanese TV eleven times, three times in which a special orchestra version of the song was performed. Jewel was also released as a ringtone, where it went on to be certified triple platinum, meaning it was downloaded over 750,000 times.<ref>{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/chart/w070620_3.html \u793e\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba \u65e5\u672c\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5354\u4f1a\uff5c\u5404\u7a2e\u7d71\u8a08<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \"1 Love\" was also performed once.

In order of release, they are \"Startin'\", \"Born to Be...\", \"Blue Bird\", \"Beautiful Fighters\", \"Jewel\", \"Momentum\", and \"1 Love\".\n\nThe PVs for Startin, Born to Be, Blue Bird, Beautiful Fighters and Momentum were all directed by [[Takahide Ishii]].\n\nThe video for Startin' has a lighter and comical tone than the other PVs of the album which have a consistently deeper tone. It starts off with two young male friends in a video store. They are conversing when suddenly, Hamasaki drills a hole through the brick wall and comes in. She dances and rejects one of them who makes an advance on her, and points a finger at the other man which shocks him. In the next scene, she is riding a motorcycle in a sports suit, and initiates a little \"race\" with a Hummer like vehicle with three passengers. She points a finger at them, which shocks the three passengers as well. She then stands up while driving her motorcycle and suddenly jumps off while the motorcycle crashes into a building, causing an explosion. The motorcycle scene has been criticised for being similar to the music video of Britney Spears' Toxic, but looks similar and her look is more recognizable to the brief motorcycle scene in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Hamasaki lands safely and walks away. In the end, it goes back to the video store (in the state before Hamasaki came in) with the two friends conversing. One complains that it is hot in the building and takes off a mask, revealing it to be Hamasaki. Segments of dancing are also present throughout the PV, in between scenes. One is on a platform, while the other dancing scenes are in a dark, desert like setting, similar to \"Work It\", and the style of dancing is also similar to the dancing in the \"Work It\" video. This song was used as the opening song for the videogame \"Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams\" of Capcom for the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PV for Born To Be... had thematic ties to the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, which TV channel Nittele promoted using \"Born To Be...\". Hamasaki is standing and singing in front of bright orange/yellow lights in a dark room which change brightness. In effect, sometimes the viewer cannot see much due to the brightness and sometimes they cannot see much due to the darkness. There is a band playing in the water (in the same setting), and an aerobic dancer also performs in the water. Later, people of all ethnicities around the world, mostly children, are individually projected against a white wall stating what they would like to be when they grow up. Since their voices are not heard due to the song, they have visual aids. (For example, a girl is speaking in an ice skating uniform, holding a pair of ice skates). Hamasaki also appears on this backdrop, saying something although it cannot be heard.\n\nThe \"Blue Bird\" [[Music video|PV]] (music video) officially aired on SpaceShower TV on June 9, 2006. In the first scene, she is singing on an empty beach. She is then seen on a boat with friends (many of whom are featured in her [[Fairyland (song)|Fairyland]] PV, while they are in fact her dance team members). Throughout the video, it switches between the first setting, the second setting, and a third setting in which she is feasting and having fun with the same friends. There is also a fourth setting where she sings on a cliff. The PV was filmed in [[Guam]].\n\nThe Beautiful Fighters PV officially aired on SpaceShower TV on June 12, 2006. In the first scene, fans anticipate entering what looks to be an arena, while three dancers stand outside the door. The fans rush in to watch Ayumi and a group of dancers atop a stage dancing and standing on multi-colored cars. The video switches between scenes of the five female dancers' stories of misfortune at different jobs. The dancers are shown as a delivery person, a waitress, a pool-cleaner, and a painter; Ayumi plays as a cashier at a mart. At the end, each person involved in the dancers' mess-up is shown dancing in the crowd and then each of the dancers, along with Ayumi, circles the stage in her own car.\n\nThe music video for \"Jewel\", directed by [[Wataru Takeishi]], is one of the most expensive music videos ever made, allegedly costing over 100 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] (nearly $1 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) to produce. It is basically composed by scenes featuring Hamasaki adorned in diamonds at a winter-like set. It was leaked online November 24, 2006.\n\nThe [[Music video|PV]] for \"Momentum\" first aired on MTV on November 28, 2006 in the morning and the music video shows ayumi as a ghost, but a ghost which people can see and in the music video she sings in the snow and cold, while people look at her through opened windows, In the end of the video, a man put flowers on her grave, ayumi then sees him and she melts away. There were also in-ter cut scenes of ayumi in a room full of candles.\n\nThe [[Music video|PV]] for \"1 Love\"  was first played on Headliner on November 27, 2006 and features an underground human bid, where rich people (covered with venetian masks) buy human beings who are slaves and supposedly have special abilities, like a monster, an eat-it-all man, a prostitute, an otaku, and Hamasaki herself, who appears singing and pole-dancing. She is also seen in a cage, and later on tries to escape, covering herself with one of the masks, just to be found by the owner of the bid, a circus-master like man.\n\n===Tour===\n[[Image:Ayumi Hamasaki in concert, April 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Ayumi Hamasaki performing in Shanghai during her ''Tour of Secret''.]]\n{{Main|Tour of Secret}}\nUpon her explosive release of Secret throughout Asia, Hamasaki launched her first ever international tour.

However, its first week sales are about 263,000 lower than her last studio album ''[[(Miss)understood]]'' showed. This is because the \"first week sales\" of ''(Miss)understood'' were actually the sales of two weeks, as [[Oricon]] blends the last week of a year with the first one of the following year, making an Oricon Year with 51 weeks only. The same rule applies for the first week sales of her ''[[I Am... (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|I Am...]]'' album. On the [[Oricon]] chart, ''Secret'' failed to surpass the one-million mark, making it her second album to not do so (the first being ''(Miss)understood''). However, while ''(Miss)understood'' still managed to surpass the one-million mark in accordance to Avex, ''Secret'' failed to do so, selling only 900,000 copies.\n\nThe singles of this album together sold a total of 447,177 copies. The sales of the singles and the album itself combined come to a sales revenue of 1,314,551 CDs sold.\n\n''Secret'' is also believed to be Ayu's most successful album yet in worldwide sales. Not only did ''Secret'' top the Japanese charts, the album was an instant number-1 hit in countries as Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong,<ref>http://www.hmv.com.hk/charts/japanese_ns.asp?w=LW</ref>  and China.\n\nIn Japan, ''Secret'' charted for 18 weeks.\n\n===Physical sales charts===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart\n!Peak position\n|-\n|Oricon Daily Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Oricon Weekly Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Oricon Monthly Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Oricon Yearly Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 <small>(2006)</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 <small>(2007)</small>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Soundscan Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 <small>(CD+DVD)</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 <small>(CD-Only)</small>\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Title\n!Peak position\n!Weeks\n!Sales\n|-\n||March 8, 2006\n|\"[[Startin' / Born to Be...]]\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|15 weeks\n|188,551\n|-\n|June 21, 2006\n|\"[[Blue Bird (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Blue Bird]]\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|13 weeks\n|258,566\n|}\n\n* '''Total Single Sales:''' 447,117\n* '''Total Album and Single Sales: ''' 1,122,414\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tour of Secret]]\n* [[Glitter / Fated]] (which contains title track \"Secret\", the B-side of the single)\n* [[Kiss or Kill (film)|Kiss or Kill]], the movie which the track \"Kiss o' Kill\" was named after.\n* [[List of most expensive music videos]] (For the music video of Jewel)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/39829/ Oricon]\n* [http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/061206_03.html Oricon Music Special]\n* [http://www.hmv.com.hk/charts/top_40_new.asp?subm=chart HMV Hong Kong Asian Chart]\n* [http://www.hmv.com.hk/charts/japanese.asp?subm=chart HMV Hong Kong Japanese Chart]\n* [http://www.g-music.com.tw/GMusicBillboard3.aspx g-music charts]\n\n{{Ayumi Hamasaki}}\n{{AyumiSingles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secret (Ayumi Hamasaki Album)}}\n[[Category:Ayumi Hamasaki albums]]\n[[Category:2006 albums]]\n[[Category:Avex Group albums]]\n[[Category:Japanese-language albums]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|1 Love (song)|other songs with similar titles|One Love (disambiguation)}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2010}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Secret\n| type       = studio\n| artist     = [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]\n| cover      = SecretCDOnlyAyumiHamasaki.jpg\n| alt        = On the right side, Ayumi Hamasaki is shown fully on her right side wearing a long bareback black dress with her arms up and a tattoo shown going from her upper right back to her right shoulder.

As with all of her previous works, Hamasaki wrote all of the lyrics on ''Secret''. The album's composition was handled largely by [[Dai Nagao]] and Tetsuya Yukumi, both of whom were frequent collaborators with Hamasaki. Generally a rock-pop influenced album, Hamasaki said that the meaning of the album was itself a secret, and that it incorporated secrets she was keeping about herself that the public did not know.\n\nSecret had been announced originally as a seven-track [[extended play|EP]]; however, it eventually evolved into a fourteen-track album. \"[[Startin'/Born to Be...]]\" was released as the lead single from ''Secret'' on March 8, 2006. It debuted at the number-one position in Japan, becoming Hamasaki's twenty-sixth chart topper; with this, she became the female singer with the most number-one singles in Japan, breaking [[Seiko Matsuda]]'s record. However, it would sell poorly thereafter, charting for fifteen weeks and selling under 200,000 copies. \"[[Blue Bird (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Blue Bird]]\" would have more success: it topped the charts in Japan and was certified Platinum for shipments of 250,000 copies. With \"Blue Bird\", which sold around 300,000 copies, Hamasaki became the first solo artist in Japan to sell over 20 million singles.\n\n''Secret'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised its rock influences and thought that every song stood well enough on its own, but felt that it \"failed to leave a clear impression\" as a cohesive record. The album won Album of the Year at the [[Japan Gold Disc Awards]]; its title track received \"Japanese Song of the Year\" at the RTHK International Awards in [[Hong Kong]]. ''Secret'' debuted at number one in Japan with first week sales of 386,280 copies. It would go on to become the 22nd best selling album of 2006 in Japan, and the 73rd best seller of 2007, selling 675,400 copies in its 15-week chart run and receiving a triple-platinum certification for having 750,000 copies shipped to stores. Despite this success, ''Secret'' would become her lowest-selling album at that point and her first to not to be certified Million. According to Avex, ''Secret'' has sold 900,000 copies worldwide.\n\n==Title==\nHamasaki on an interview stated that the reason behind naming the album 'Secret' was that the album literally was a secret.<ref name=\"Secret Interview\">{{in lang|ja}} [http://avexnet.or.jp/ayu/en/special/secret/index.html SPECIAL\uff5cayumi hamasaki official website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She said it was named so that people might think \"That's one of her secrets\". She also said she wanted to feel when they hear a song, they should think they knew her secret. The album's lyrics reinforce the understanding others, rather than just yourself, as she states:\n\n<blockquote>But it's not a secret in the sense that \"I'm about to disclose something you didn't know!\" Instead, it could be about \"me\" in my daily life, or it could be about you\u2026 Everyone keeps secrets; there is not one person on this planet who does not have at least one secret, nor is there a person who can tell others everything about him or herself. Even when you try to understand others (or to have a mutual understanding with others), there is always a \"you\" that only you know about. I have aspects that only certain people know about and aspects that everyone knows about. That's what I call a secret. And in this sense, there are secrets incorporated into this album.<ref>[http://avexnet.or.jp/ayu/en/special/secret/index.html Ayumi Hamasaki's official website]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Production==\nOriginally, ''Secret'' was announced to be a seven-track mini-album. After announcing that ''Secret'' was to become a full album on her official website, a message from Hamasaki on her TeamAyu fanclub website stated that she was doing overtime in the studio in order to complete the album on time.\n{{Listen\n|filename=AH_Jewel.ogg\n|title=\"Jewel\" (2006)\n|description=25 second sample from Ayumi Hamasaki's \"Jewel\", one of the slower songs on the album.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nHamasaki stated that \"Until that Day...\" was originally intended to be an instrumental track composed by CMJK.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} She loved the sound of the guitar and the b-melody and thus asked him to compose it into a full-length track.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} From the beginning, she knew just what she had in mind to write about. She admitted to having difficulty matching her emotions with the complex melody of the song so she sat down at home and compiled a list of synonyms of key words and eventually finished the song.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Although she tried to keep the song positive, it sparked feelings of heartbrokenness upon revealing it to her staff.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe third track, \"[[Startin' / Born to Be...|Startin']]\", was recorded in [[New York City]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} According to Hamasaki, the sound in the studio made it easy for her to sing despite the challenge in vocals that she gave herself by choosing to sing in this particular style.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Hamasaki stated that even though the song is generally perceived as a song for dancing on stage with dancers, it was originally intended to be a band-only song.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} She enjoyed her recording session, commenting that what really brought out the new vocal style was doing the recording in the New York studio with its great sound and atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n\"Momentum\", the eighth track on the album, took Hamasaki a total of four days to record.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This is the longest amount of time she has ever taken to record a song in her whole career.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Usually, she goes into the booth and records a song very quickly, but with \"Momentum\" she had been spending so much time in the recording booth that she felt like she might as well have slept there.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Hamasaki stated that listening to the song now makes her remember the strenuous recording and brings her to tears.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe album's title track, \"Secret\", was the last song to be recorded for the album.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Since she had so much strain with recording \"Momentum\", Ayumi vowed to complete the recording for \"Secret\" in one go.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, by doing this she put great pressure on herself and made herself quite nervous.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} She had considered forgetting the song and leaving the studio several times due to the stress from her pressure and the extreme time limit to have the song recorded, but she decided to simply give it her all and do her best.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nBy finishing this song, she had completed the recordings for the entire album. Hamasaki stated that she was almost in tears with the staff members because she actually managed to extend this album from a seven-track mini-album into a full length fourteen-track studio album in a matter of weeks.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2006, recording for the album was wrapped. On November 7, the track list and both the CD-only and CD+DVD covers were released. ''Secret'' is Hamasaki's first album to be produced and sold in [[Malaysia]].\n\n==Promotion==\nDuring November and December 2006, Hamasaki performed live on Japanese TV shows eleven times.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The main promotional track of the album was 'Jewel', which was performed live on Japanese TV eleven times, three times in which a special orchestra version of the song was performed. Jewel was also released as a ringtone, where it went on to be certified triple platinum, meaning it was downloaded over 750,000 times.<ref>{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/chart/w070620_3.html \u793e\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba \u65e5\u672c\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5354\u4f1a\uff5c\u5404\u7a2e\u7d71\u8a08<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \"1 Love\" was also performed once.

In order of release, they are \"Startin'\", \"Born to Be...\", \"Blue Bird\", \"Beautiful Fighters\", \"Jewel\", \"Momentum\", and \"1 Love\".\n\nThe PVs for Startin, Born to Be, Blue Bird, Beautiful Fighters and Momentum were all directed by [[Takahide Ishii]].\n\nThe video for Startin' has a lighter and comical tone than the other PVs of the album which have a consistently deeper tone. It starts off with two young male friends in a video store. They are conversing when suddenly, Hamasaki drills a hole through the brick wall and comes in. She dances and rejects one of them who makes an advance on her, and points a finger at the other man which shocks him. In the next scene, she is riding a motorcycle in a sports suit, and initiates a little \"race\" with a Hummer like vehicle with three passengers. She points a finger at them, which shocks the three passengers as well. She then stands up while driving her motorcycle and suddenly jumps off while the motorcycle crashes into a building, causing an explosion. The motorcycle scene has been criticised for being similar to the music video of Britney Spears' Toxic, but looks similar and her look is more recognizable to the brief motorcycle scene in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Hamasaki lands safely and walks away. In the end, it goes back to the video store (in the state before Hamasaki came in) with the two friends conversing. One complains that it is hot in the building and takes off a mask, revealing it to be Hamasaki. Segments of dancing are also present throughout the PV, in between scenes. One is on a platform, while the other dancing scenes are in a dark, desert like setting, similar to \"Work It\", and the style of dancing is also similar to the dancing in the \"Work It\" video. This song was used as the opening song for the videogame \"Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams\" of Capcom for the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PV for Born To Be... had thematic ties to the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, which TV channel Nittele promoted using \"Born To Be...\". Hamasaki is standing and singing in front of bright orange/yellow lights in a dark room which change brightness. In effect, sometimes the viewer cannot see much due to the brightness and sometimes they cannot see much due to the darkness. There is a band playing in the water (in the same setting), and an aerobic dancer also performs in the water. Later, people of all ethnicities around the world, mostly children, are individually projected against a white wall stating what they would like to be when they grow up. Since their voices are not heard due to the song, they have visual aids. (For example, a girl is speaking in an ice skating uniform, holding a pair of ice skates). Hamasaki also appears on this backdrop, saying something although it cannot be heard.\n\nThe \"Blue Bird\" [[Music video|PV]] (music video) officially aired on SpaceShower TV on June 9, 2006. In the first scene, she is singing on an empty beach. She is then seen on a boat with friends (many of whom are featured in her [[Fairyland (song)|Fairyland]] PV, while they are in fact her dance team members). Throughout the video, it switches between the first setting, the second setting, and a third setting in which she is feasting and having fun with the same friends. There is also a fourth setting where she sings on a cliff. The PV was filmed in [[Guam]].\n\nThe Beautiful Fighters PV officially aired on SpaceShower TV on June 12, 2006. In the first scene, fans anticipate entering what looks to be an arena, while three dancers stand outside the door. The fans rush in to watch Ayumi and a group of dancers atop a stage dancing and standing on multi-colored cars. The video switches between scenes of the five female dancers' stories of misfortune at different jobs. The dancers are shown as a delivery person, a waitress, a pool-cleaner, and a painter; Ayumi plays as a cashier at a mart. At the end, each person involved in the dancers' mess-up is shown dancing in the crowd and then each of the dancers, along with Ayumi, circles the stage in her own car.\n\nThe music video for \"Jewel\", directed by [[Wataru Takeishi]], is one of the most expensive music videos ever made, allegedly costing over 100 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] (nearly $1 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) to produce. It is basically composed by scenes featuring Hamasaki adorned in diamonds at a winter-like set. It was leaked online November 24, 2006.\n\nThe [[Music video|PV]] for \"Momentum\" first aired on MTV on November 28, 2006 in the morning and the music video shows ayumi as a ghost, but a ghost which people can see and in the music video she sings in the snow and cold, while people look at her through opened windows, In the end of the video, a man put flowers on her grave, ayumi then sees him and she melts away. There were also in-ter cut scenes of ayumi in a room full of candles.\n\nThe [[Music video|PV]] for \"1 Love\"  was first played on Headliner on November 27, 2006 and features an underground human bid, where rich people (covered with venetian masks) buy human beings who are slaves and supposedly have special abilities, like a monster, an eat-it-all man, a prostitute, an otaku, and Hamasaki herself, who appears singing and pole-dancing. She is also seen in a cage, and later on tries to escape, covering herself with one of the masks, just to be found by the owner of the bid, a circus-master like man.\n\n===Tour===\n[[Image:Ayumi Hamasaki in concert, April 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Ayumi Hamasaki performing in Shanghai during her ''Tour of Secret''.]]\n{{Main|Tour of Secret}}\nUpon her explosive release of Secret throughout Asia, Hamasaki launched her first ever international tour.

However, its first week sales are about 263,000 lower than her last studio album ''[[(Miss)understood]]'' showed. This is because the \"first week sales\" of ''(Miss)understood'' were actually the sales of two weeks, as [[Oricon]] blends the last week of a year with the first one of the following year, making an Oricon Year with 51 weeks only. The same rule applies for the first week sales of her ''[[I Am... (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|I Am...]]'' album. On the [[Oricon]] chart, ''Secret'' failed to surpass the one-million mark, making it her second album to not do so (the first being ''(Miss)understood''). However, while ''(Miss)understood'' still managed to surpass the one-million mark in accordance to Avex, ''Secret'' failed to do so, selling only 900,000 copies.\n\nThe singles of this album together sold a total of 447,177 copies. The sales of the singles and the album itself combined come to a sales revenue of 1,314,551 CDs sold.\n\n''Secret'' is also believed to be Ayu's most successful album yet in worldwide sales. Not only did ''Secret'' top the Japanese charts, the album was an instant number-1 hit in countries as Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong,<ref>http://www.hmv.com.hk/charts/japanese_ns.asp?w=LW</ref>  and China.\n\nIn Japan, ''Secret'' charted for 18 weeks.\n\n===Physical sales charts===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart\n!Peak position\n|-\n|Oricon Daily Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Oricon Weekly Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Oricon Monthly Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Oricon Yearly Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 <small>(2006)</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 <small>(2007)</small>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Soundscan Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 <small>(CD+DVD)</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 <small>(CD-Only)</small>\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Title\n!Peak position\n!Weeks\n!Sales\n|-\n||March 8, 2006\n|\"[[Startin' / Born to Be...]]\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|15 weeks\n|188,551\n|-\n|June 21, 2006\n|\"[[Blue Bird (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Blue Bird]]\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|13 weeks\n|258,566\n|}\n\n* '''Total Single Sales:''' 447,117\n* '''Total Album and Single Sales: ''' 1,122,414\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tour of Secret]]\n* [[Glitter / Fated]] (which contains title track \"Secret\", the B-side of the single)\n* [[Kiss or Kill (film)|Kiss or Kill]], the movie which the track \"Kiss o' Kill\" was named after.\n* [[List of most expensive music videos]] (For the music video of Jewel)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/39829/ Oricon]\n* [http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/061206_03.html Oricon Music Special]\n* [http://www.hmv.com.hk/charts/top_40_new.asp?subm=chart HMV Hong Kong Asian Chart]\n* [http://www.hmv.com.hk/charts/japanese.asp?subm=chart HMV Hong Kong Japanese Chart]\n* [http://www.g-music.com.tw/GMusicBillboard3.aspx g-music charts]\n\n{{Ayumi Hamasaki}}\n{{AyumiSingles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secret (Ayumi Hamasaki Album)}}\n[[Category:Ayumi Hamasaki albums]]\n[[Category:2006 albums]]\n[[Category:Avex Group albums]]\n[[Category:Japanese-language albums]]\n", "name_user": "115.132.174.6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Ayumi Hamasaki Secret Warner Music Malaysia VCD Kuala Lumpur.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_(Ayumi_Hamasaki_album)"}

His plan also includes two points to protect the physical and financial security of the elderly.

{"title_page": "Local School Councils", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}\nEvery [[Chicago Public Schools|Chicago public school]] has a '''Local School Council''' (LSC) which consists of parents, community members, teachers, and the [[School Principal|principal]] of the school. All members of the council are elected and conduct monthly meetings which the public can attend. LSCs are the site-based management team of each school. Their primary responsibility is to select the school's principal, renew the principal's contract, approve the School Improvement Plan for Advancing Academic Achievement and approve the school's budget for the school year. Some LSCs serve only in an advisory capacity, such as with low-performing schools undergoing turnarounds.\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Chicago]] School Reform Act of 1988 created local school councils for all [[Chicago Public Schools|Chicago public schools]]. The newly-formed councils consisted of the principal, two teachers, six parents, two community members, and a student representative on high school councils. The push for reform came from two sources. First, in September 1987, the [[Chicago Teachers Union]] went on strike for nineteen days.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/04/us/chicago-teachers-reach-accord-in-4-week-strike.html|title=Chicago Teachers Reach Accord in 4-Week Strike|last=AP|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}</ref> Second, in November 1987, [[William Bennett]], [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan's]] Secretary of Education, stated that Chicago public schools were the worst in the nation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-11-08-8703230953-story.html|title=Education chief: City schools worst|last=Banas|first=Casey|date=November 8, 1987|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=October 5, 2018|last2=Byers|first2=Devonda|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Reform Act was a product of [[Grassroots|grass roots]] work to improve Chicago public schools through decentralization. The Chicago School Reform Act was a state law directed only at changing the Chicago schools, which exercised much less local control than other school systems in the state. Many complained that the bureaucratic organization of the school system did not allow for parental or community input. The Reform Act put strong faith in the ability of parents, community members, and educators to govern their children's school. The Reform Act also ended principal tenure which had allowed principals to stay in their position for life. Principals were selected by the LSCs and were given four year contracts, after which they had to reapply. Members of LSCs were also given significant control over their school's use of funds by shaping and approving the budget. Curricular changes were also under the control of the councils, as they implemented the School Improvement Plans.\n\nSince the Reform Act, the Chicago schools have gone through more changes and reforms, but the basic structure of the local school councils are still in place. The 1995 Chicago School Reform Act gave the [[mayor of Chicago]] more control over the schools and the ability to appoint a five-member board of trustees and chief executive officer. The board of trustees was given the power to intervene in low-performing schools, which some critics felt took power away from the local school councils. Also, the CEO implemented citywide curriculum standards which took some policy control away from the school. The local school council still retains the ability to hire principals, but the principal is increasingly responsible to the district authority and an LSCs' decision to renew or not to renew the principals' contract can be challenged before an independent arbitration officer. Nevertheless, with most of the school-level authority left intact, Chicago remains the most decentralized big-city educational system in the nation.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n== Election process ==\nEveryone over the age of 18 may vote at all schools where they are eligible. Parents may vote at schools in their area and any school where they have a child in attendance. Voters do not need to be citizens and are eligible at the elementary and high school in their area. Voters can vote for any combination of community and parent representatives, but may only vote for five candidates.\n\nParents of students are eligible to run for parent representative on the LSC. Parents must pass a [[criminal background check]] and they cannot be employed by the [[Board of education|Board of Education]] to run for representative. Parents do not need a college or high school degree nor must they be a legal resident of the United States to run. All that is required of parents is an interest and willingness to participate in their child's education.\n\nCommunity representatives must live in the attendance area or voting district of that school, and do not have a child currently enrolled in that school. Community representatives may not be employed by the board. Similar to the parent representatives, there are no education or citizenship requirements.\n\nA teacher representative must be employed and assigned in a teaching position or in a position for which qualifications as a teacher are required, and employed to perform the majority of their employment duties at the school. Although principals are automatically a member of their school's LSC, assistant principals are not eligible to serve on an LSC.\n\nIn high schools, students elect their own representative. Students must be a full-time high school student to run for representative. Students serve one year terms, rather than two.\n\nAfter election, all new LSC members are required to complete an 18-hour training program within six months of taking office.\n\n== LSC members ==\nAll members of local school councils are elected at their school. Every member is elected to fill a two-year term and vacancies are filled through council appointments. Nearly 17,000 candidates ran for local school council in 1989, but numbers have decreased over the years despite major recruitment campaigns for parents and community members. In 2000, there were approximately 5,500 LSC seats and about 7,000 candidates, causing many candidates to go unchallenged. LSC elections occur every two years on the same day as spring report card pick up.\n\nCritics of LSCs have pointed to the fact that there is no education requirement for representatives and that most have no training in educational policy before being elected. However, according to the Designs for Change report, \u201cChicago\u2019s Local School Councils: What the Research Says,\u201d LSC members are significantly better educated than the average American. 63% of LSC members hold a bachelor's degree or have completed some college compared to only 48% of Americans and 41% of [[Chicagoan]]s. Only 13% of LSC members did not receive a high school diploma compared to 18% of Americans and 34% of Chicagoans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Donald R.|date=January 2002|title=Chicago's Local School Councils. What the Research Says.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED476943|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nLSC members also closely mirror the racial and ethnic make-up of the city of Chicago, although reflect the make-up of the school system less accurately. The Chicago population is 38% African American, 20% Latino, and 38% White. 55% of Chicago public school students are African American, but only 42% of parent and community representatives are African American. 31% of students are Latino, but only 14% of LSC members are Latino. Only 11% of students are white, but 40% of LSC members are white, thus there are a much higher percentage of white parent and community representatives than the percentage of students.\n\nAlthough there are a lower percentage of Latino and African American LSC representatives compared to the school's enrollment, Chicago's LSCs represent a major opportunity for [[African Americans|African American]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] leaders to serve their communities as elected officials. The African American and Latino LSC members represent the majority of elected minority officials in [[Illinois]].\n\n== Meeting Structure ==\nMost Local School Councils meet monthly. All LSC meetings must be posted with the time, date and location of the meeting and what will be on the agenda. Most LSC meetings are open to the public; the only closed meetings are those that discuss items exempt under the [[Open Meetings Act]] such as personnel, safety and discipline issues. LSCs must provide opportunity for public comment in at least two meetings per year; most LSCs take public comments at every meeting. LSCs must also convene at least two public meetings to present annual school improvement plan and budget proposals and to report on student and school progress.\n\nAs the primary policy-making body for their schools, LSCs deal with a wide range of issues in meetings; they may discuss busing, budgets, school improvements, curriculum changes, school events, and many other areas. Many LSCs have active advisory committees which may include non-LSC members.\n\n== LSCs record of clean government ==\nCritics predicted that there would be significant corruption in Local School Councils,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} but advocates for the Reform Act believed that corruption would be less likely if the decision-making authority was given to parents, because their primary desire would be to improve their children's education. Plus, reformers argued that sitting on the council of a single school would be less attractive to individuals planning to engage in corrupt behavior than serving on a large board that would govern many schools. In accordance with the reformers intention, Designs for Change have found evidence that corruption on Chicago's LSC is extremely rare.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nChicago's LSCs are placed under the strictest ethics and [[conflict of interest]] policy of any elected official in the state.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} They have strict rules restricting the hiring of relatives or business associates, rules not placed on state legislators or city council members. No LSC member has been convicted of corrupt activity related to their role on the council, although 12,000 Chicagoans have served on the LSC. In contrast, 15% of [[Chicago City Council]] members have been convicted of felonies since 1990.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cps.edu/pages/Localschoolcouncils.aspx Chicago Public School's Website about Local School Councils]\n\n[[Category:Chicago Public Schools]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}\nEvery [[Chicago Public Schools|Chicago public school]] has a '''Local School Council''' (LSC) which consists of parents, community members, teachers, and the [[School Principal|principal]] of the school.

In contrast, 15% of [[Chicago City Council]] members have been convicted of felonies since 1990.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cps.edu/pages/Localschoolcouncils.aspx Chicago Public School's Website about Local School Councils]\n\n[[Category:Chicago Public Schools]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "name_user": "Kmargarita97", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_School_Councils"}
