Its configuration is unique for this type of aircraft, with four [[podded engines]] underneath a [[low wing]]. It is the only airplane built by McDonnell to be marketed to civil rather than exclusively military buyers prior to the company's merger with [[Douglas Aircraft]] to form [[McDonnell Douglas]]. The jet could be outfitted for 10 passengers in a luxury executive configuration and could carry as many as 29.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Model 119 was designed in 1957 for the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s UCX (Utility-Cargo Experimental) contract announced in August 1956, competing with the [[Lockheed JetStar]]; the Air Force simultaneously announced the UTX (Utility-Trainer Experimental) competition, but McDonnell chose not to enter this contest, which was won by the smaller two-engined [[North American Sabreliner]].
