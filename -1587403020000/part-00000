Various transition metal complexes, namely those of Cu, Fe, Ru, Ni, and Os, have been employed as catalysts for ATRP. In an ATRP process, the dormant species is activated by the transition metal complex to generate radicals via one electron transfer process. Simultaneously the transition metal is oxidized to higher oxidation state. This reversible process rapidly establishes an equilibrium that is predominately shifted to the side with very low radical concentrations. The number of polymer chains is determined by the\nnumber of initiators. Each growing chain has the same probability to propagate with monomers to form living/dormant polymer chains (R-P<sub>n</sub>-X). As a result, polymers with similar molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distribution can be prepared.\n\nATRP reactions are very robust in that they are tolerant of many [[functional groups]] like allyl, amino, epoxy, hydroxy, and vinyl groups present in either the monomer or the initiator.<ref>Cowie, J.

They are the monomer, initiator, catalyst, ligand, and solvent. The following section breaks down the contributions of each component to the overall polymerization.\n\n===Monomer===\nMonomers typically used in ATRP are molecules with substituents that can stabilize the propagating radicals; for example, styrenes, (meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylamides, and acrylonitrile.<ref>{{cite journal\n|title = Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization and the Synthesis of Polymeric Materials\n|journal = [[Adv.

Yet, the propagating rate is unique to each individual monomer.

This equilibrium determines the polymerization rate. An equilibrium constant that is too small may inhibit or slow the polymerization while an equilibrium constant that is too large leads to a wide distribution of chain lengths.<ref name=\"Chem. Rev. 2001\"/>\n\nThere are several requirements for the metal catalyst: \n#There needs to be two accessible oxidation states that are differentiated by one electron\n#The metal center needs to have reasonable affinity for halogens\n#The coordination sphere of the metal needs to be expandable when it is oxidized as to accommodate the halogen\n#The transition metal catalyst should not lead to significant side reactions, such as irreversible coupling with the propagating radicals and catalytic radical termination\n\nThe most studied catalysts are those that include copper, which has shown the most versatility with successful polymerizations for a wide selection of monomers.\n\n===Ligand===\nOne of the most important aspects in an ATRP reaction is the choice of ligand which is used in combination with the traditionally copper halide catalyst to form the catalyst complex. The main function of the ligand is to solubilize the copper halide in whichever solvent is chosen and to adjust the redox potential of the copper.<ref name=\"Catalyst Complexes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/maty/chem/catalyst-development/structural-characterization.html |title=Structural Characterization of an ATRP Catalyst Complex|author=<!- -Not stated- ->|website=the Matyjaszewski Polymer Group|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|access-date=November 30, 2018}}</ref> This changes the activity and dynamics of the halogen exchange reaction and subsequent activation and deactivation of the polymer chains during polymerization, therefore greatly affecting the kinetics of the reaction and the degree of control over the polymerization. Different ligands should be chosen based on the activity of the monomer and the choice of metal for the catalyst. As copper halides are primarily used as the catalyst, amine based ligands are most commonly chosen. Ligands with higher activities are being investigated as ways to potentially decrease the concentration of catalyst in the reaction since a more active catalyst complex would lead to a higher concentration of deactivator in the reaction. However, a too active catalyst can lead to a loss of control and increase the polydispersity of the resulting polymer.\n\n===Solvents===\nToluene, 1,4-dioxane, xylene, anisole, DMF, DMSO, water, methanol, acetonitrile, or even the monomer itself (described as a bulk polymerization) are commonly used.\n\n==Kinetics of normal ATRP==\n\n* Reactions in atom transfer radical polymerization\n*; Initiation\n*: <math chem>\\begin{array}{ll}\n{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}{-}{\\color{Red}\\ce X} + {\\color{Green}\\ce{Cu^{I}}}{\\color{Red}\\ce X}/\\ce{L}\\ \\overset{k_{a,0}}\\underset{k_{d,0}}\\ce{<<=>}\\ {\\color{Green}\\ce{Cu^{II}}}{\\color{Red}\\ce{X2}}/\\ce{L} + {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}^\\cdot & K_\\ce{ATRP,0} = \\frac{k_{a,0}}{k_{d,0}}\\\\\n{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}^\\cdot \\ce{+ M ->[k_\\ce{add}]} {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P1^.}\\\\\n2{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}^\\cdot \\ce{->[k_{t,0}]} \\begin{Bmatrix} {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}{-}{\\color{Blue}\\ce R} \\\\ \\ce{or} \\\\ {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}^= + {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{H} \\end{Bmatrix}\n\\end{array}</math>\n*; Quasi-steady state\n*: <math chem>\\begin{array}{ll}\n{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}}{-}{\\color{Red}\\ce X} + {\\color{Green}\\ce{Cu^{I}}}{\\color{Red}\\ce X}/\\ce{L} \\ \\overset{k_{a}}\\underset{k_{d}}\\ce{<<=>}\\ {\\color{Green}\\ce{Cu^{II}}}{\\color{Red}\\ce{X2}}/\\ce{L} + {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}^.} \n& \\begin{array}{l} \\ce{ATRP} \\\\ \\ce{activation/deactivation} \\\\ \\ce{equilibrium} \\\\ K_\\ce{ATRP} = \\frac{k_a}{k_d} \\end{array}\\\\\n\\left.\\begin{align} \n{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}^.} + \\ce{M}\\ &\\ce{->[k_p]} {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P^._{\\mathit{n}+1}} \\\\ \n2{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}^.}\\ &\\ce{->[k_t]} \\begin{Bmatrix} {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}-P_\\mathit{n}}{-}{\\color{Blue}\\ce R} \\\\ \\ce{or} \\\\ {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}^=} + {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}-H} \\end{Bmatrix} \\quad\n\\end{align} \\right\\} \n& \\begin{array}{l} \\text{Same as conventional} \\\\ \\text{radical polymerization} \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n* Other chain breaking reactions (<math>k_{tx}</math>) should also be considered.\n\n===ATRP equilibrium constant===\nThe radical concentration in normal ATRP can be calculated via the following equation:\n\n:<math chem=\"\">[\\ce{R-P}_{n}^\\bullet] = K_\\ce{ATRP} \\cdot [\\ce{R-P}_{n} \\ce{-X}] \\cdot \\frac\\ce{[Cu^{I}X/L]}\\ce{[Cu^{II}X2/L]}</math>\n\nIt is important to know the ''K''<sub>ATRP</sub> value to adjust the radical concentration.

In principle, the total amount of Cu catalyst should not influence polymerization kinetics. However, the loss of chain end functionality slowly but irreversibly converts Cu<sup>I</sup> to Cu<sup>II</sup>. Thus initial [Cu<sup>I</sup>]/[I] ratios are typically 0.1 to 1. When very low concentrations of catalysts are used, usually at the ppm level, activator regeneration processes are generally required to compensate the loss of CEF and regenerate a sufficient amount of Cu<sup>I</sup> to continue the polymerization. Several activator regeneration ATRP methods were developed, namely ICAR ATRP, ARGET ATRP, SARA ATRP, ''e''ATRP, and photoinduced ATRP. The activator regeneration process is introduced to compensate the loss of chain end functionality, thus the cumulative amount of activator regeneration should roughly equal the total amount of the loss of chain end functionality.   \n[[File:Activator Regeneration Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization.svg|thumb|center|640px|Activator regeneration Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization]]\n\n====ICAR ATRP====\nInitiators for continuous activator regeneration (ICAR) is a technique that uses conventional radical initiators to continuously regenerate the activator, lowering its required concentration from thousands of ppm to <100 ppm; making it an industrially relevant technique.\n\n====ARGET ATRP====\nActivators regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) employs non-radical forming reducing agents for regeneration of Cu<sup>I</sup>. A good reducing agent (e.g. hydrazine, phenols, sugars, ascorbic acid) should only react with Cu<sup>II</sup> and not with radicals or other reagents in the reaction mixture.\n\n====SARA ATRP====\nA typical SARA ATRP employs Cu<sup>0</sup> as both supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA). Cu<sup>0</sup> can activate alkyl halide directly but slowly. Cu<sup>0</sup> can also reduce Cu<sup>II</sup> to Cu<sup>I</sup>. Both processes help to regenerate Cu<sup>I</sup> activator. Other zerovalent metals, such as Mg, Zn, and Fe, have also been employed for Cu-based SARA ATRP. \n \n====''e''ATRP====\nIn ''e''ATRP the activator Cu<sup>I</sup> is regenerated via electrochemical process. The development of ''e''ATRP enables precise control of the reduction process and external regulation of the polymerization. In an ''e''ATRP process, the redox reaction involves two electrodes. The Cu<sup>II</sup> species is reduced to Cu<sup>I</sup> at the cathode. The anode compartment is typically separated from the polymerization environment by a glass frit and a conductive gel. Alternatively, a sacrificial aluminum counter electrode can be used, which is directly immersed in the reaction mixture.\n\n====Photoinduced ATRP====\nThe direct photo reduction of transition metal catalysts in ATRP and/or photo assistant activation of alkyl halide is particularly interesting because such a procedure will allow performing of ATRP with ppm level of catalysts without any other additives.\n\n===Other ATRP methods===\n\n====Reverse ATRP====\nIn reverse ATRP, the catalyst is added in its higher oxidation state. Chains are activated by conventional radical initiators (e.g. AIBN) and deactivated by the transition metal. The source of transferable halogen is the copper salt, so this must be present in concentrations comparable to the transition metal.\n\n====SR&NI ATRP====\nA mixture of radical initiator and active (lower oxidation state) catalyst allows for the creation of block copolymers (contaminated with homopolymer) which is impossible using standard reverse ATRP.

Various transition metal complexes, namely those of Cu, Fe, Ru, Ni, and Os, have been employed as catalysts for ATRP. In an ATRP process, the dormant species is activated by the transition metal complex to generate radicals via one electron transfer process. Simultaneously the transition metal is oxidized to higher oxidation state. This reversible process rapidly establishes an equilibrium that is predominately shifted to the side with very low radical concentrations. The number of polymer chains is determined by the\nnumber of initiators. Each growing chain has the same probability to propagate with monomers to form living/dormant polymer chains (R-P<sub>n</sub>-X). As a result, polymers with similar molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distribution can be prepared.\n\nATRP reactions are very robust in that they are tolerant of many [[functional groups]] like allyl, amino, epoxy, hydroxy, and vinyl groups present in either the monomer or the initiator.<ref>Cowie, J.

Yet, the propagating rate is unique to each individual monomer. Therefore, it is important that the other components of the polymerization (initiator, catalyst, ligand, and solvent) are optimized in order for the concentration of the dormant species to be greater than that of the propagating radical while being low enough as to prevent slowing down or halting the reaction.<ref name=Odian>Odian, G.

This equilibrium determines the polymerization rate. An equilibrium constant that is too small may inhibit or slow the polymerization while an equilibrium constant that is too large leads to a wide distribution of chain lengths.<ref name=\"Chem. Rev. 2001\"/>\n\nThere are several requirements for the metal catalyst: \n#There needs to be two accessible oxidation states that are differentiated by one electron\n#The metal center needs to have reasonable affinity for halogens\n#The coordination sphere of the metal needs to be expandable when it is oxidized as to accommodate the halogen\n#The transition metal catalyst should not lead to significant side reactions, such as irreversible coupling with the propagating radicals and catalytic radical termination\n\nThe most studied catalysts are those that include copper, which has shown the most versatility with successful polymerizations for a wide selection of monomers.\n\n===Ligand===\nOne of the most important aspects in an ATRP reaction is the choice of ligand which is used in combination with the traditionally copper halide catalyst to form the catalyst complex. The main function of the ligand is to solubilize the copper halide in whichever solvent is chosen and to adjust the redox potential of the copper.<ref name=\"Catalyst Complexes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/maty/chem/catalyst-development/structural-characterization.html |title=Structural Characterization of an ATRP Catalyst Complex|author=<!- -Not stated- ->|website=the Matyjaszewski Polymer Group|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|access-date=November 30, 2018}}</ref> This changes the activity and dynamics of the halogen exchange reaction and subsequent activation and deactivation of the polymer chains during polymerization, therefore greatly affecting the kinetics of the reaction and the degree of control over the polymerization. Different ligands should be chosen based on the activity of the monomer and the choice of metal for the catalyst. As copper halides are primarily used as the catalyst, amine based ligands are most commonly chosen. Ligands with higher activities are being investigated as ways to potentially decrease the concentration of catalyst in the reaction since a more active catalyst complex would lead to a higher concentration of deactivator in the reaction. However, a too active catalyst can lead to a loss of control and increase the polydispersity of the resulting polymer.\n\n===Solvents===\nToluene, 1,4-dioxane, xylene, anisole, DMF, DMSO, water, methanol, acetonitrile, or even the monomer itself (described as a bulk polymerization) are commonly used.\n\n==Kinetics of normal ATRP==\n\n* Reactions in atom transfer radical polymerization\n*; Initiation\n*: <math chem>\\begin{array}{ll}\n{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}{-}{\\color{Red}\\ce X} + {\\color{Green}\\ce{Cu^{I}}}{\\color{Red}\\ce X}/\\ce{L}\\ \\overset{k_{a,0}}\\underset{k_{d,0}}\\ce{<<=>}\\ {\\color{Green}\\ce{Cu^{II}}}{\\color{Red}\\ce{X2}}/\\ce{L} + {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}^\\cdot & K_\\ce{ATRP,0} = \\frac{k_{a,0}}{k_{d,0}}\\\\\n{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}^\\cdot \\ce{+ M ->[k_\\ce{add}]} {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P1^.}\\\\\n2{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}^\\cdot \\ce{->[k_{t,0}]} \\begin{Bmatrix} {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}{-}{\\color{Blue}\\ce R} \\\\ \\ce{or} \\\\ {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}^= + {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{H} \\end{Bmatrix}\n\\end{array}</math>\n*; Quasi-steady state\n*: <math chem>\\begin{array}{ll}\n{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}}{-}{\\color{Red}\\ce X} + {\\color{Green}\\ce{Cu^{I}}}{\\color{Red}\\ce X}/\\ce{L} \\ \\overset{k_{a}}\\underset{k_{d}}\\ce{<<=>}\\ {\\color{Green}\\ce{Cu^{II}}}{\\color{Red}\\ce{X2}}/\\ce{L} + {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}^.} \n& \\begin{array}{l} \\ce{ATRP} \\\\ \\ce{activation/deactivation} \\\\ \\ce{equilibrium} \\\\ k_\\ce{ATRP} = \\frac{k_a}{k_d} \\end{array}\\\\\n\\left.\\begin{align} \n{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}^.} + \\ce{M}\\ &\\ce{->[k_p]} {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P^._{\\mathit{n}+1}} \\\\ \n2{\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}^.}\\ &\\ce{->[k_t]} \\begin{Bmatrix} {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}-P_\\mathit{n}}{-}{\\color{Blue}\\ce R} \\\\ \\ce{or} \\\\ {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}^=} + {\\color{Blue}\\ce R}\\ce{-P_\\mathit{n}-H} \\end{Bmatrix} \\quad\n\\end{align} \\right\\} \n& \\begin{array}{l} \\text{Same as conventional} \\\\ \\text{radical polymerization} \\end{array}\n\\end{array}</math>\n* Other chain breaking reactions (<math>k_{tx}</math>) should also be considered.\n\n===ATRP equilibrium constant===\nThe radical concentration in normal ATRP can be calculated via the following equation:\n\n:<math chem=\"\">[\\ce{R-P}_{n}^\\bullet] = K_\\ce{ATRP} \\cdot [\\ce{R-P}_{n} \\ce{-X}] \\cdot \\frac\\ce{[Cu^{I}X/L]}\\ce{[Cu^{II}X2/L]}</math>\n\nIt is important to know the ''K''<sub>ATRP</sub> value to adjust the radical concentration.

The halogen remaining at the end of the polymer chain after polymerization allows for facile post-polymerization chain-end modification into different reactive functional groups. The use of multi-functional initiators facilitates the synthesis of lower-arm [[Star-shaped polymer|star polymers]] and telechelic polymers.

This catalyst standardly consists of a copper halide and an amine-based ligand.

In principle, the total amount of Cu catalyst should not influence polymerization kinetics. However, the loss of chain end functionality slowly but irreversibly converts Cu<sup>I</sup> to Cu<sup>II</sup>. Thus initial [Cu<sup>I</sup>]/[I] ratios are typically 0.1 to 1. When very low concentrations of catalysts are used, usually at the ppm level, activator regeneration processes are generally required to compensate the loss of CEF and regenerate a sufficient amount of Cu<sup>I</sup> to continue the polymerization. Several activator regeneration ATRP methods were developed, namely ICAR ATRP, ARGET ATRP, SARA ATRP, ''e''ATRP, and photoinduced ATRP. The activator regeneration process is introduced to compensate the loss of chain end functionality, thus the cumulative amount of activator regeneration should roughly equal the total amount of the loss of chain end functionality.   \n[[File:Activator Regeneration Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization.svg|thumb|center|640px|Activator regeneration Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization]]\n\n====ICAR ATRP====\nInitiators for continuous activator regeneration (ICAR) is a technique that uses conventional radical initiators to continuously regenerate the activator, lowering its required concentration from thousands of ppm to <100 ppm; making it an industrially relevant technique.\n\n====ARGET ATRP====\nActivators regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) employs non-radical forming reducing agents for regeneration of Cu<sup>I</sup>. A good reducing agent (e.g. hydrazine, phenols, sugars, ascorbic acid) should only react with Cu<sup>II</sup> and not with radicals or other reagents in the reaction mixture.\n\n====SARA ATRP====\nA typical SARA ATRP employs Cu<sup>0</sup> as both supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA). Cu<sup>0</sup> can activate alkyl halide directly but slowly. Cu<sup>0</sup> can also reduce Cu<sup>II</sup> to Cu<sup>I</sup>. Both processes help to regenerate Cu<sup>I</sup> activator. Other zerovalent metals, such as Mg, Zn, and Fe, have also been employed for Cu-based SARA ATRP. \n \n====''e''ATRP====\nIn ''e''ATRP the activator Cu<sup>I</sup> is regenerated via electrochemical process. The development of ''e''ATRP enables precise control of the reduction process and external regulation of the polymerization. In an ''e''ATRP process, the redox reaction involves two electrodes. The Cu<sup>II</sup> species is reduced to Cu<sup>I</sup> at the cathode. The anode compartment is typically separated from the polymerization environment by a glass frit and a conductive gel. Alternatively, a sacrificial aluminum counter electrode can be used, which is directly immersed in the reaction mixture.\n\n====Photoinduced ATRP====\nThe direct photo reduction of transition metal catalysts in ATRP and/or photo assistant activation of alkyl halide is particularly interesting because such a procedure will allow performing of ATRP with ppm level of catalysts without any other additives.\n\n===Other ATRP methods===\n\n====Reverse ATRP====\nIn reverse ATRP, the catalyst is added in its higher oxidation state. Chains are activated by conventional radical initiators (e.g. AIBN) and deactivated by the transition metal. The source of transferable halogen is the copper salt, so this must be present in concentrations comparable to the transition metal.\n\n====SR&NI ATRP====\nA mixture of radical initiator and active (lower oxidation state) catalyst allows for the creation of block copolymers (contaminated with homopolymer) which is impossible using standard reverse ATRP. This is called SR&NI (simultaneous reverse and normal initiation ATRP).\n\n====AGET ATRP====\nActivators generated by electron transfer uses a reducing agent unable to initiate new chains (instead of organic radicals) as regenerator for the low-valent metal. Examples are metallic copper, tin(II), [[ascorbic acid]], or [[triethylamine]]. It allows for lower concentrations of transition metals, and may also be possible in aqueous or dispersed media.\n\n====Hybrid and bimetallic systems====\nThis technique uses a variety of different metals/oxidation states, possibly on solid supports, to act as activators/deactivators, possibly with reduced toxicity or sensitivity.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Xiong, De'an|author2=He, Zhenping\n|title=Modulating the catalytic activity of Au/micelles by tunable hydrophilic channels\n|journal= [[Journal of Colloid and Interface Science]]\n|date=15 January 2010|volume=341|issue=2|pages=273\u2013279|doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2009.09.045\n|pmid=19854448\n|bibcode=2010JCIS..341..273X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Chen, Xi|author2=He, Zhenping|title=Core-shell-corona Au-micelle composites with a tunable smart hybrid shell\n|journal=Langmuir|date=5 August 2008|volume=24|issue=15|pages=8198\u20138204|doi=10.1021/la800244g\n|display-authors=etal|pmid=18576675}}</ref> Iron salts can, for example, efficiently activate alkyl halides but requires an efficient Cu(II) deactivator which can be present in much lower concentrations (3\u20135&nbsp;mol%)\n\n====Metal-free ATRP====\nTrace metal catalyst remaining in the final product has limited the application of ATRP in biomedical and electronic fields.

It previously existed from 220\u2013222 as a [[vassal]] kingdom nominally under [[Cao Wei]], its rival state, but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222. It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler, [[Sun Quan]], declared himself [[Emperor of China|emperor]]. Its name was derived from the place it was based in \u2014 the [[Jiangnan]] ([[Yangtze River Delta]]) region, which was also historically known as \"[[Wu (region)|Wu]]\". It was referred to as \"Dong Wu\" (\"Eastern Wu\") or \"Sun Wu\" by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the [[Wu (state)|Wu state]] in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Wuyue]] kingdom in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. It was called \"Eastern Wu\" because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and \"Sun Wu\" because the family name of its rulers was \"[[Sun (surname)|Sun]]\". During its existence, Wu's capital was at [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (present-day [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]]), but at times it was also at Wuchang ({{lang|zh-hant|\u6b66\u660c}}; present-day [[Ezhou]], [[Hubei]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=3}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:WuJar.jpg|thumb|242px|A jar made in Eastern Wu dating to the [[Three Kingdoms]] period]]\n\n===Beginnings and founding===\n[[File:Chibi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Before the dynasty of Eastern Wu was established, the territory was defended by the Sun clan in the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].]]\n\nTowards the [[end of the Han dynasty]], [[Sun Ce]], the eldest son of the warlord [[Sun Jian]], and his followers borrowed troops from the warlord [[Yuan Shu]] and embarked on [[Sun Ce's conquests in Jiangdong|a series of military conquests]] in the [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] and [[Wu (region)|Wu]] regions between 194 and 199, seizing several territories previously occupied by warlords such as [[Liu Yao (warlord)|Liu Yao]], [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Wang Lang]]. Sun Ce broke off relations with Yuan Shu around 196-197 after the latter declared himself emperor \u2014 an act deemed as treason against [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]], the figurehead ruler of the Han dynasty. The warlord [[Cao Cao]], who was the ''de facto'' head of government in the Han imperial court, asked Emperor Xian to grant Sun Ce the title of \"Marquis of Wu\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5433\u4faf}}).\n\nSun Ce was assassinated in the summer of 200 and was succeeded by his younger brother, [[Sun Quan]]. Sun Quan, like his elder brother, also paid nominal allegiance to Emperor Xian while maintaining autonomous rule over the Wu territories. In 208, Sun Quan allied with the warlord [[Liu Bei]] and they combined forces to defeat Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]. Sun Quan and Liu Bei maintained their alliance against Cao Cao after the battle for the next ten years or so, despite having some territorial disputes over [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. In 219, Sun Quan severed ties with Liu Bei when he sent his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] to [[L\u00fc Meng's invasion of Jing Province|invade Liu's territories in Jing Province]]. [[Guan Yu]], who was defending Liu Bei's assets in Jing Province, was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces. After that, the boundaries of Sun Quan's domain extended from beyond the Jiangdong region to include the southern part of Jing Province, which covered roughly present-day [[Hunan]] and parts of [[Hubei]].\n\nIn 220, Cao Cao's son and successor, [[Cao Pi]], ended the Han dynasty by forcing Emperor Xian to abdicate in his favour and established the state of [[Cao Wei]]. Sun Quan agreed to submit to Wei and was granted the title of a vassal king, \"King of Wu\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5433\u738b}}), by Cao Pi. A year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of [[Shu Han]]. In 222, Liu Bei launched a military campaign against Sun Quan to take back Jing Province and avenge Guan Yu, leading to the [[Battle of Xiaoting]]. However, Liu Bei suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sun Quan's general [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] and was forced to retreat to [[Baidicheng]], where he died a year later.\n\nLiu Bei's successor, [[Liu Shan]], and his regent, [[Zhuge Liang]], made peace with Sun Quan later and reaffirmed their previous alliance. Sun Quan declared independence from Wei in 222, but continued to rule as \"King of Wu\" until 229, when he declared himself \"Emperor of Wu\". His legitimacy was recognised by Shu.\n\n===Sun Quan's reign===\nSun Quan ruled for over 30 years and his long reign resulted in stability in southern China. During his reign, Wu engaged Wei in numerous wars, including the battles of [[Battle of Ruxu (222\u2013223)|Ruxu]] (222\u2013223), [[Battle of Shiting|Shiting]] (228), and [[Battle of Hefei (234)|Hefei]] (234). However, Wu never managed to gain any territory north of the Yangtze River while Wei also never succeeded in conquering the lands south of the Yangtze.\n\nA succession struggle broke out between Sun Quan's sons in the later part of his reign \u2014 Sun Quan instated [[Sun He (Zixiao)|Sun He]] as the [[crown prince]] in 242 after his former heir apparent, [[Sun Deng (Eastern Wu)|Sun Deng]], died in 241, but Sun He soon became involved in a rivalry with his younger brother, [[Sun Ba]]. The conflict resulted in the emergence of two rivalling factions, each supporting either Sun He or Sun Ba, in Sun Quan's imperial court. Sun Quan eventually deposed Sun He and forced Sun Ba to commit suicide, while [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] and many other ministers who took either Sun He's or Sun Ba's side in the struggle met with unhappy ends. Sun Quan appointed his youngest son, [[Sun Liang]], as the crown prince after the incident.\n\n===Reigns of Sun Liang and Sun Xiu===\nSun Quan died in 252 and was succeeded by Sun Liang, with [[Zhuge Ke]] and [[Sun Jun (Three Kingdoms)|Sun Jun]] serving as regents. In 253, Zhuge Ke was assassinated in a coup launched by Sun Jun, and the state power of Wu fell into Sun Jun's hands and was passed on to his cousin, [[Sun Chen]], after his death. During Sun Liang's reign, [[Three Rebellions in Shouchun|two rebellions]] broke out in the Wei garrison at Shouchun (around present-day [[Shou County]], [[Anhui]]) in 255 and 257\u2013258. Sun Jun and Sun Chen led Wu forces to support the rebels in the first and second rebellions respectively in the hope of making some territorial gains in Wei, but both revolts were suppressed and the Wu forces retreated after suffering many losses.\n\nSun Liang was deposed in 258 by Sun Chen, who installed [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]], another son of Sun Quan, on the throne. Sun Xiu killed Sun Chen later in a coup with the help of [[Zhang Bu]] and [[Ding Feng (general)|Ding Feng]].\n\n===Fall of Wu===\nSun Xiu died of illness in 264, a year after [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|Shu was conquered by Wei]]. At the time, Wu was experiencing internal turmoil because rebellions had broken out in [[Jiaozhi#Three Kingdoms|Jiaozhi]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4ea4\u8dbe}}) in the south. The ministers [[Puyang Xing]], [[Wan Yu]] and [[Zhang Bu]] decided to install Sun He's son, [[Sun Hao]], on the throne.\n\nIn the beginning of Sun Hao's reign, the emperor reduced taxes, gave relief to the poor, and granted freedom to a large number of palace maids. However, Sun Hao gradually became more cruel and superstitious and started indulging in wine and women instead of finding ways to revive his declining state. Sun Hao's tyranny caused widespread anger and hatred towards him in Wu, but it was due to the efforts of officials such as [[Lu Kai]] and [[Lu Kang (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Kang]] that Wu was able to remain relatively stable and peaceful.\n\nIn February 266, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]] ended the state of Cao Wei by forcing its last ruler, [[Cao Huan]], to abdicate in his favour, and then established the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]]. In 279, Jin forces led by [[Du Yu]], [[Wang Jun (Jin dynasty)|Wang Jun]] and others attacked Wu from six directions. Sun Hao attempted to put up resistance by sending his armies to fight the Jin invaders, but the Wu forces suffered several consecutive defeats and even the Wu chancellor, [[Zhang Ti]], was killed in action. Seeing that Wu was doomed to fall, Sun Hao surrendered to the Jin dynasty on 31 May 280,<ref name=\"Dardess\"/> marking the end of Wu and the end of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\n==Government and military==\nDespite Sun Quan proclaiming himself emperor in 229, its politics reflected its warlord origins.  When Wu was initially founded its military was dominated by famed generals who had gained their positions through prowess and pluck.  These generals were celebrated for their [[individualism]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rafe de Crespigny|authorlink1=Rafe de Crespigny|title=Generals of the south : the foundation and early history of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu|date=1990|publisher=Australian National University, Faculty of Asian Studies|location=Cambera|isbn=0731509013|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/gos_ch8.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2015|chapter=Chapter 8 Empire in the South|quote=Though Sun Quan had claimed the imperial title in 229, and made some pretence of establishing the forms of an imperial court, the government of Wu continued to reflect the structure of a warlord state. In human terms, the time of the foundation of Wu was dominated by military commanders who held authority through their personal courage and energy, and were celebrated for their individualism, and it was no small achievement that Sun Quan was able to keep such a group under control.}}</ref>\n\nPolitics within the court were often influenced by conflicts between powerful families and individuals.  Positions within the court were inherited from one generation to the next unlike the Han dynasty's [[bureaucracy]].  However, over time, the influence ultimately would move away from the [[central government]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rafe de Crespigny|authorlink1=Rafe de Crespigny|title=Generals of the south : the foundation and early history of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu|date=1990|publisher=Australian National University, Faculty of Asian Studies |location=Cambera|isbn=0731509013|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/gos_ch8.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2015|chapter=Chapter 8 Empire in the South|quote=Politics at court were largely dominated by the intrigues and conflicts of powerful individuals and families. In particular, unlike the bureaucracy of Han, substantial official positions, and particularly those involving the command of troops, were regularly transferred by inheritance from one generation to the next. In the course of time, however, there was a shift of influence in the central government from the first generation of men who had risen to power in the early years of the state, many of them from the north and all chosen for their personal ability and loyalty, to men from south of the Yangzi, whose families had prospered under the Sun regime.}}</ref> Outside of the court, families displayed their own independent authority. Wu, at times, was to a certain extent run for the protection of particular families.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rafe de Crespigny|authorlink1=Rafe de Crespigny |title=Generals of the south : the foundation and early history of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu|date=1990|publisher=Australian National University, Faculty of Asian Studies |location=Cambera|isbn=0731509013|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/gos_ch8.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2015|chapter=Chapter 8 Empire in the South|quote=Outside the court and the capital, moreover, great independent authority was held by these local families, which consolidated their power through the acquisition of tenants and other dependents who sought protection from the uncertainty of the times and the demands of government. This development, already begun in the time of Han, meant that the power of the central government was limited, and its capacity to exploit the resources of the state was heavily restricted. To a degree, the state of Wu was run for the protection and the benefit of the great families who were its nominal subjects.}}</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Wu era was a formative period in [[Vietnamese history]]. The ruler of [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] (modern [[Vietnam]] and [[Guangzhou]]), [[Shi Xie]], is primarily remembered today in [[Vietnam]] as [[S\u0129 Nhi\u1ebfp]]. According to [[Stephen O'Harrow]], Shi Xie was essentially \"the first Vietnamese.\"{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=739}}Originally satisfied with [[Eastern Wu]]'s rule, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] opposed [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]]'s rebellion against Eastern Wu and attacked him for it. However, when the Wu general [[L\u00fc Dai]] betrayed Shi Hui and executed the entire Shi family, the Vietnamese became greatly upset. In 248, the people of [[Jiaozhi]] and [[Jiuzhen]] commanderies rebelled. Eastern Wu sent [[Lu Yin (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Yin]] to deal with the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. However the rebels regrouped under the leadership of [[Lady Tri\u1ec7u]] in Jiuzhen and renewed the rebellion with a march on Jiaozhi. According to the ''[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]]'' (Complete Annals of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t), Lady Tri\u1ec7u had long breasts that reached her shoulders and rode into battle on an elephant. After several months of warfare she was defeated and committed suicide.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\n==Culture and economy==\n[[File:CottonPlant.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Shu Han exported cotton into Eastern Wu.]]\n[[File:Celadon Storehouse and Courtyard, Ezhou.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Celadon Storehouse and Courtyard.

Migrations from the north and the needed settlement from the [[Shanyue]] barbarians made it possible for the increase in manpower, agriculture, and settling the lower most parts of Wu. Along with that, river transportation became a huge factor and flourished as the [[Jiangnan]] and Zhedong canals were finished with construction. After the [[Battle of Xiaoting]] and during the [[Cao Pi's invasions of Eastern Wu|invasions of Wu]] by [[Cao Wei|Wei]] in the 220s, Shu was able to reestablish their trade and relationships with Wu.

Sun Quan's prestige in dealing with hostiles and friendly relations called for the establishment of a controlled form of an imperial government for the empire of Wu. Sun Quan also created the opportunity for people residing within Wu to gain prestige and influence throughout the empire and the surrounding establishments with the duty of being an envoy.<ref name=\"cres4i-4\"/>\n\nFollowing the death of [[Cao Pi]] in 226, Sun Quan strongly promoted his kingdom to focus on agriculture because the threat from Wei was lifted.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=6}}.</ref> However, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] suggested to Sun Quan that military commanders should become involved in the colonization of land.

The achievements of Wu in the south marked the coming of Chinese civilization to the farthest southern reaches of the empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=1}}.</ref>\n\nIn 230, the island of [[Taiwan]] was reached by the Chinese during the Three Kingdoms period under the reign of Sun Quan.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=9\u201310}}.</ref> Contact with the native population and the dispatch of officials to an island named \"Yizhou\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5937\u5dde}}) by the Wu navy might have been to Taiwan, but the location of Yizhou is open to dispute; some historians believe it was Taiwan, while others believe it was the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. Wu merchants also may have reached [[Southern Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]]. Failed protection of [[Gongsun Yuan]] also was in existence when the latter [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|rebelled against Wei]]. This was because of the waterway's difficulties. Such things cost Wu, and the achievements supposedly gained within Taiwan did not cover this problem and Sun Quan lost his vassal.<ref name=\"de Crespigny 1990 loc=10\">{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=10}}.</ref>\n\nLater on in the existence of Wu, the once great military was turned to an unimpressive one. It was most likely an easy task to take [[Hefei]] from Wei, but Wu could not do so. Since the 230s, this task was made harder due to the \"New City\", a heavily fortified castle built at Hefei by Wei.<ref name=\"de Crespigny 1990 loc=10\"/> One of the greatest failures to accomplish something later on in Wu's reign was during 255 and during the last few years of the 250s. When [[Guanqiu Jian]] and [[Wen Qin]] [[Second Rebellion in Shouchun|rebelled]] against Wei, Wu promised to help the two in Shouchun (around present-day [[Shou County]], [[Anhui]]). However, the Wu forces never made it in time before the rebellion was quashed by [[Sima Shi]] and the Wei forces. When [[Zhuge Dan]] launched a [[Third Rebellion in Shouchun|massive full-scale rebellion]], the Wu forces suffered a great defeat as they lent a great quantity of manpower to Zhuge Dan's cause. Shouchun was quickly regained by Wei under [[Sima Zhao]]'s command.<ref name=\"de Crespigny 1990 loc=10\"/>\n\nDuring the [[conquest of Shu by Wei]] in 263, Wu could not fully lend support to their allies due to a revolt in Vietnam.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of Wu was long in existence since the death of [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] in 245 and the death of Sun Quan in 252. Sun Quan's successors could do little for the empire. [[Zhuge Ke]] was assassinated by [[Sun Jun (Three Kingdoms)|Sun Jun]] in 253 after a [[Battle of Hefei (253)|failed invasion of Hefei]] following the Wu victory over an invading Wei force at [[Battle of Dongxing|Dongxing]].<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=11}}.</ref> [[Ding Feng (general)|Ding Feng]] also ended up killing [[Sun Chen]] under orders from [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]].

It previously existed from 220\u2013222 as a [[vassal]] kingdom nominally under [[Cao Wei]], its rival state, but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222. It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler, [[Sun Quan]], declared himself [[Emperor of China|emperor]]. Its name was derived from the place it was based in \u2014 the [[Jiangnan]] ([[Yangtze River Delta]]) region, which was also historically known as \"[[Wu (region)|Wu]]\". It was referred to as \"Dong Wu\" (\"Eastern Wu\") or \"Sun Wu\" by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the [[Wu (state)|Wu state]] in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Wuyue]] kingdom in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. It was called \"Eastern Wu\" because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and \"Sun Wu\" because the family name of its rulers was \"[[Sun (surname)|Sun]]\". During its existence, Wu's capital was at [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (present-day [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]]), but at times it was also at Wuchang ({{lang|zh-hant|\u6b66\u660c}}; present-day [[Ezhou]], [[Hubei]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=3}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:WuJar.jpg|thumb|242px|A jar made in Eastern Wu dating to the [[Three Kingdoms]] period]]\n\n===Beginnings and founding===\n[[File:Chibi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Before the dynasty of Eastern Wu was established, the territory was defended by the Sun clan in the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].]]\n\nTowards the [[end of the Han dynasty]], [[Sun Ce]], the eldest son of the warlord [[Sun Jian]], and his followers borrowed troops from the warlord [[Yuan Shu]] and embarked on [[Sun Ce's conquests in Jiangdong|a series of military conquests]] in the [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] and [[Wu (region)|Wu]] regions between 194 and 199, seizing several territories previously occupied by warlords such as [[Liu Yao (warlord)|Liu Yao]], [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Wang Lang]]. Sun Ce broke off relations with Yuan Shu around 196-197 after the latter declared himself emperor \u2014 an act deemed as treason against [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]], the figurehead ruler of the Han dynasty. The warlord [[Cao Cao]], who was the ''de facto'' head of government in the Han imperial court, asked Emperor Xian to grant Sun Ce the title of \"Marquis of Wu\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5433\u4faf}}).\n\nSun Ce was assassinated in the summer of 200 and was succeeded by his younger brother, [[Sun Quan]]. Sun Quan, like his elder brother, also paid nominal allegiance to Emperor Xian while maintaining autonomous rule over the Wu territories. In 208, Sun Quan allied with the warlord [[Liu Bei]] and they combined forces to defeat Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]. Sun Quan and Liu Bei maintained their alliance against Cao Cao after the battle for the next ten years or so, despite having some territorial disputes over [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. In 219, Sun Quan severed ties with Liu Bei when he sent his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] to [[L\u00fc Meng's invasion of Jing Province|invade Liu's territories in Jing Province]]. [[Guan Yu]], who was defending Liu Bei's assets in Jing Province, was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces. After that, the boundaries of Sun Quan's domain extended from beyond the Jiangdong region to include the southern part of Jing Province, which covered roughly present-day [[Hunan]] and parts of [[Hubei]].\n\nIn 220, Cao Cao's son and successor, [[Cao Pi]], ended the Han dynasty by forcing Emperor Xian to abdicate in his favour and established the state of [[Cao Wei]]. Sun Quan agreed to submit to Wei and was granted the title of a vassal king, \"King of Wu\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5433\u738b}}), by Cao Pi. A year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of [[Shu Han]]. In 222, Liu Bei launched a military campaign against Sun Quan to take back Jing Province and avenge Guan Yu, leading to the [[Battle of Xiaoting]]. However, Liu Bei suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sun Quan's general [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] and was forced to retreat to [[Baidicheng]], where he died a year later.\n\nLiu Bei's successor, [[Liu Shan]], and his regent, [[Zhuge Liang]], made peace with Sun Quan later and reaffirmed their previous alliance. Sun Quan declared independence from Wei in 222, but continued to rule as \"King of Wu\" until 229, when he declared himself \"Emperor of Wu\". His legitimacy was recognised by Shu.\n\n===Sun Quan's reign===\nSun Quan ruled for over 30 years and his long reign resulted in stability in southern China. During his reign, Wu engaged Wei in numerous wars, including the battles of [[Battle of Ruxu (222\u2013223)|Ruxu]] (222\u2013223), [[Battle of Shiting|Shiting]] (228), and [[Battle of Hefei (234)|Hefei]] (234). However, Wu never managed to gain any territory north of the Yangtze River while Wei also never succeeded in conquering the lands south of the Yangtze.\n\nA succession struggle broke out between Sun Quan's sons in the later part of his reign \u2014 Sun Quan instated [[Sun He (Zixiao)|Sun He]] as the [[crown prince]] in 242 after his former heir apparent, [[Sun Deng (Eastern Wu)|Sun Deng]], died in 241, but Sun He soon became involved in a rivalry with his younger brother, [[Sun Ba]]. The conflict resulted in the emergence of two rivalling factions, each supporting either Sun He or Sun Ba, in Sun Quan's imperial court. Sun Quan eventually deposed Sun He and forced Sun Ba to commit suicide, while [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] and many other ministers who took either Sun He's or Sun Ba's side in the struggle met with unhappy ends. Sun Quan appointed his youngest son, [[Sun Liang]], as the crown prince after the incident.\n\n===Reigns of Sun Liang and Sun Xiu===\nSun Quan died in 252 and was succeeded by Sun Liang, with [[Zhuge Ke]] and [[Sun Jun (Three Kingdoms)|Sun Jun]] serving as regents. In 253, Zhuge Ke was assassinated in a coup launched by Sun Jun, and the state power of Wu fell into Sun Jun's hands and was passed on to his cousin, [[Sun Chen]], after his death. During Sun Liang's reign, [[Three Rebellions in Shouchun|two rebellions]] broke out in the Wei garrison at Shouchun (around present-day [[Shou County]], [[Anhui]]) in 255 and 257\u2013258. Sun Jun and Sun Chen led Wu forces to support the rebels in the first and second rebellions respectively in the hope of making some territorial gains in Wei, but both revolts were suppressed and the Wu forces retreated after suffering many losses.\n\nSun Liang was deposed in 258 by Sun Chen, who installed [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]], another son of Sun Quan, on the throne. Sun Xiu killed Sun Chen later in a coup with the help of [[Zhang Bu]] and [[Ding Feng (general)|Ding Feng]].\n\n===Fall of Wu===\nSun Xiu died of illness in 264, a year after [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|Shu was conquered by Wei]]. At the time, Wu was experiencing internal turmoil because rebellions had broken out in [[Jiaozhi#Three Kingdoms|Jiaozhi]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4ea4\u8dbe}}) in the south. The ministers [[Puyang Xing]], [[Wan Yu]] and [[Zhang Bu]] decided to install Sun He's son, [[Sun Hao]], on the throne.\n\nIn the beginning of Sun Hao's reign, the emperor reduced taxes, gave relief to the poor, and granted freedom to a large number of palace maids. However, Sun Hao gradually became more cruel and superstitious and started indulging in wine and women instead of finding ways to revive his declining state. Sun Hao's tyranny caused widespread anger and hatred towards him in Wu, but it was due to the efforts of officials such as [[Lu Kai]] and [[Lu Kang (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Kang]] that Wu was able to remain relatively stable and peaceful.\n\nIn February 266, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]] ended the state of Cao Wei by forcing its last ruler, [[Cao Huan]], to abdicate in his favour, and then established the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]]. In 279, Jin forces led by [[Du Yu]], [[Wang Jun (Jin dynasty)|Wang Jun]] and others attacked Wu from six directions. Sun Hao attempted to put up resistance by sending his armies to fight the Jin invaders, but the Wu forces suffered several consecutive defeats and even the Wu chancellor, [[Zhang Ti]], was killed in action. Seeing that Wu was doomed to fall, Sun Hao surrendered to the Jin dynasty on 31 May 280,<ref name=\"Dardess\"/> marking the end of Wu and the end of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\n==Government and military==\nDespite Wu and its court becoming imperial in 229, Sun Quan had kept Wu in a [[warlordism]] reflected state.  When Wu was initially founded its military was dominated by famed generals who had gained their positions through prowess and pluck.  These generals were celebrated for their [[individualism]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rafe de Crespigny|authorlink1=Rafe de Crespigny|title=Generals of the south : the foundation and early history of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu|date=1990|publisher=Australian National University, Faculty of Asian Studies|location=Cambera|isbn=0731509013|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/gos_ch8.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2015|chapter=Chapter 8 Empire in the South|quote=Though Sun Quan had claimed the imperial title in 229, and made some pretence of establishing the forms of an imperial court, the government of Wu continued to reflect the structure of a warlord state. In human terms, the time of the foundation of Wu was dominated by military commanders who held authority through their personal courage and energy, and were celebrated for their individualism, and it was no small achievement that Sun Quan was able to keep such a group under control.}}</ref>\n\nPolitics within the court were often influenced by conflicts between powerful families and individuals.  Positions within the court were inherited from one generation to the next unlike the Han dynasty's [[bureaucracy]].  However, over time, the influence ultimately would move away from the [[central government]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rafe de Crespigny|authorlink1=Rafe de Crespigny|title=Generals of the south : the foundation and early history of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu|date=1990|publisher=Australian National University, Faculty of Asian Studies |location=Cambera|isbn=0731509013|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/gos_ch8.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2015|chapter=Chapter 8 Empire in the South|quote=Politics at court were largely dominated by the intrigues and conflicts of powerful individuals and families. In particular, unlike the bureaucracy of Han, substantial official positions, and particularly those involving the command of troops, were regularly transferred by inheritance from one generation to the next. In the course of time, however, there was a shift of influence in the central government from the first generation of men who had risen to power in the early years of the state, many of them from the north and all chosen for their personal ability and loyalty, to men from south of the Yangzi, whose families had prospered under the Sun regime.}}</ref> Outside of the court, families displayed their own independent authority. Wu, at times, was to a certain extent run for the protection of particular families.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rafe de Crespigny|authorlink1=Rafe de Crespigny |title=Generals of the south : the foundation and early history of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu|date=1990|publisher=Australian National University, Faculty of Asian Studies |location=Cambera|isbn=0731509013|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/gos_ch8.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2015|chapter=Chapter 8 Empire in the South|quote=Outside the court and the capital, moreover, great independent authority was held by these local families, which consolidated their power through the acquisition of tenants and other dependents who sought protection from the uncertainty of the times and the demands of government. This development, already begun in the time of Han, meant that the power of the central government was limited, and its capacity to exploit the resources of the state was heavily restricted. To a degree, the state of Wu was run for the protection and the benefit of the great families who were its nominal subjects.}}</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Wu era was a formative period in [[Vietnamese history]]. The ruler of [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] (modern [[Vietnam]] and [[Guangzhou]]), [[Shi Xie]], is primarily remembered today in [[Vietnam]] as [[S\u0129 Nhi\u1ebfp]]. According to [[Stephen O'Harrow]], Shi Xie was essentially \"the first Vietnamese.\"{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=739}}Originally satisfied with [[Eastern Wu]]'s rule, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] opposed [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]]'s rebellion against Eastern Wu and attacked him for it. However, when the Wu general [[L\u00fc Dai]] betrayed Shi Hui and executed the entire Shi family, the Vietnamese became greatly upset. In 248, the people of [[Jiaozhi]] and [[Jiuzhen]] commanderies rebelled. Eastern Wu sent [[Lu Yin (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Yin]] to deal with the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. However the rebels regrouped under the leadership of [[Lady Tri\u1ec7u]] in Jiuzhen and renewed the rebellion with a march on Jiaozhi.

Migrations from the north and the needed settlement from the [[Shanyue]] barbarians made it possible for the increase in manpower, agriculture, and settling the lower most parts of Wu. Along with that, river transportation became a huge factor and flourished as the [[Jiangnan]] and Zhedong canals were finished with construction. After the [[Battle of Xiaoting]] and during the [[Cao Pi's invasions of Eastern Wu|invasions of Wu]] by [[Cao Wei|Wei]] in the 220s, Shu was able to reestablish their trade and relationships with Wu.

Sun Quan's prestige in dealing with hostiles and friendly relations called for the establishment of a controlled form of an imperial government for the empire of Wu. Sun Quan also created the opportunity for people residing within Wu to gain prestige and influence throughout the empire and the surrounding establishments with the duty of being an envoy.<ref name=\"cres4i-4\"/>\n\nFollowing the death of [[Cao Pi]] in 226, Sun Quan strongly promoted his kingdom to focus on agriculture because the threat from Wei was lifted.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=6}}.</ref> However, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] suggested to Sun Quan that military commanders should become involved in the colonization of land.

Wu merchants also may have reached [[Southern Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]]. Failed protection of [[Gongsun Yuan]] also was in existence when the latter [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|rebelled against Wei]]. This was because of the waterway's difficulties. Such things cost Wu, and the achievements supposedly gained within Taiwan did not cover this problem and Sun Quan lost his vassal.<ref name=\"de Crespigny 1990 loc=10\">{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=10}}.</ref>\n\nLater on in the existence of Wu, the once great military was turned to an unimpressive one. It was most likely an easy task to take [[Hefei]] from Wei, but Wu could not do so. Since the 230s, this task was made harder due to the \"New City\", a heavily fortified castle built at Hefei by Wei.<ref name=\"de Crespigny 1990 loc=10\"/> One of the greatest failures to accomplish something later on in Wu's reign was during 255 and during the last few years of the 250s. When [[Guanqiu Jian]] and [[Wen Qin]] [[Second Rebellion in Shouchun|rebelled]] against Wei, Wu promised to help the two in Shouchun (around present-day [[Shou County]], [[Anhui]]). However, the Wu forces never made it in time before the rebellion was quashed by [[Sima Shi]] and the Wei forces. When [[Zhuge Dan]] launched a [[Third Rebellion in Shouchun|massive full-scale rebellion]], the Wu forces suffered a great defeat as they lent a great quantity of manpower to Zhuge Dan's cause. Shouchun was quickly regained by Wei under [[Sima Zhao]]'s command.<ref name=\"de Crespigny 1990 loc=10\"/>\n\nDuring the [[conquest of Shu by Wei]] in 263, Wu could not fully lend support to their allies due to a revolt in Vietnam.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of Wu was long in existence since the death of [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] in 245 and the death of Sun Quan in 252. Sun Quan's successors could do little for the empire. [[Zhuge Ke]] was assassinated by [[Sun Jun (Three Kingdoms)|Sun Jun]] in 253 after a [[Battle of Hefei (253)|failed invasion of Hefei]] following the Wu victory over an invading Wei force at [[Battle of Dongxing|Dongxing]].<ref>{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1990|loc=11}}.</ref> [[Ding Feng (general)|Ding Feng]] also ended up killing [[Sun Chen]] under orders from [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]].

At the age of 5, she moved to the United States along with her parents. She spent her childhood and adolescence in [[Utah]] and [[Las Vegas]], where she finished high school. Antonia also began her modeling career in the United States, working alongside agencies such as [[Ford Models|Ford]] and Lenz. she also launched her own clothing line called ''MOJA'' in 2013.\n\nAntonia has been singing since she was 10 years old and attended music school in the United States. While she lived in Las Vegas and Utah, the American culture heavily influenced her musical style.\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of 18, Antonia returned to Romania alongside her family. There, she met Romanian producer [[Tom Boxer]], through a friend who had heard her singing. After the two met, Antonia and Tom created their first song known as \"Roses on Fire\". They also created a music video for the song, directed and filmed by Boxer. The song received major success abroad, being broadcast on radio stations and television channels in the Netherlands and Poland.\n\nAntonia released her second single \"[[Morena (song)|Morena]]\", produced by Tom Boxer which received critical acclaim due to its combination of a club dance rhythm and Antonia's sensual voice. According to radio-station listeners, it was the \"most played Romanian song of the moment\" in February 2010. Two months after its debut, \"Morena\" managed to climb music charts.\n\nAfter the birth of her first child, Antonia returned to music as a solo singer. She released a single called \"Marionette\", written by Dutch producer and DJ [[Afrojack]]. The song debuted at No. 96.\n\nOn April 17, 2015, Romanian record label Roton released Antonia's first studio album called ''This is Antonia''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discomania.ro/this-is-antonia-p-577.html|title=Under construction|website=Discomania.ro}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAntonia gave birth to her first child, Maya Rosaria Castellano, on August 28, 2010.<ref>[http://www.click.ro//vedete/romanesti/Antonia-Mi-e-frica-nasc-Romania_0_955704612.html \"Antonia: Mi-e fric\u0103 s\u0103 nasc \u00een Rom\u00e2nia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413183220/http://www.click.ro//vedete/romanesti/Antonia-Mi-e-frica-nasc-Romania_0_955704612.html |date=April 13, 2014 }} \u2013 Click.ro, (13 mai 2010)</ref> The child's father is Vincenzo Castellano, Antonia's husband.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://happyhour.protv.ro/video-antonia-este-frumoasa-si-insarcinata/33071 \"Antonia este frumoas\u0103 \u0219i \u00eens\u0103rcinat\u0103\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713142538/http://happyhour.protv.ro/video-antonia-este-frumoasa-si-insarcinata/33071 |date=July 13, 2012 }}, [[Happy Hour]] cu [[M\u0103ru\u021b\u0103]][http://www.click.ro//vedete/romanesti/Antonia-Mi-e-frica-nasc-Romania_0_955704612.html \"Antonia: Mi-e fric\u0103 s\u0103 nasc \u00een Rom\u00e2nia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413183220/http://www.click.ro//vedete/romanesti/Antonia-Mi-e-frica-nasc-Romania_0_955704612.html |date=April 13, 2014 }} \u2013 Click.ro, (13 mai 2010)</ref> They separated in 2011 and are  in the process of divorcing, including a custody case on behalf of their daughter Maya.

At the age of 5, she moved to the United States along with her parents. She spent her childhood and adolescence in [[Utah]] and [[Las Vegas]], where she finished high school. Antonia also began her modeling career in the United States, working alongside agencies such as [[Ford Models|Ford]] and Lenz. she also launched her own clothing line called ''MOJA'' in 2013.\n\nAntonia has been singing since she was 10 years old and attended music school in the United States. While she lived in Las Vegas and Utah, the American culture heavily influenced her musical style.\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of 18, Antonia returned to Romania alongside her family. There, she met Romanian producer [[Tom Boxer]], through a friend who had heard her singing. After the two met, Antonia and Tom created their first song known as \"Roses on Fire\". They also created a music video for the song, directed and filmed by Boxer. The song received major success abroad, being broadcast on radio stations and television channels in the Netherlands and Poland.\n\nAntonia released her second single \"[[Morena (song)|Morena]]\", produced by Tom Boxer which received critical acclaim due to its combination of a club dance rhythm and Antonia's sensual voice. According to radio-station listeners, it was the \"most played Romanian song of the moment\" in February 2010. Two months after its debut, \"Morena\" managed to climb music charts.\n\nAfter the birth of her first child, Antonia returned to music as a solo singer. She released a single called \"Marionette\", written by Dutch producer and DJ [[Afrojack]].

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]].

In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area.

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club.

Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]].

In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed \"The Glaziers\", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606051751/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=6 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club.

Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for the highest number of points for a relegated club.

The road forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroutes]] [[European route E24|E24]] and [[European route E30|E30]].\n\n==Route==\nFrom the [[Port of Felixstowe]] the road heads west, bypassing [[Ipswich]] to the south via the [[Orwell Bridge]] and to  [[Stowmarket]], [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] and [[Cambridge]] where it meets the [[M11 motorway|M11]], then past [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]], [[Huntingdon]] and the junction with the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], from there through [[Kettering]], [[Northamptonshire]], ending at junction 19 of the M1 and the start of the M6.\n\nThe road is a [[dual carriageway]], most with two lanes each way, but there are two dual three-lane sections: on the Newmarket bypass (between Junctions 36 and 38) where it [[Concurrency (road)|runs concurrent]] with the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11]], and a short stretch between the Girton Interchange and [[Bar Hill, Cambridgeshire|Bar Hill]]. There are three [[At-grade intersection|at-grade junctions]]: with the B663 at [[Bythorn]] in [[Cambridgeshire]] (junction 15); at the Leighton Bromswold turn a few miles to the east (junction 17); and at the Dockspur Roundabout at the edge of [[Felixstowe]] (junction 60).\n\nThere were two additional at-grade roundabouts along the former A14 main route, these being Brampton Hut Interchange (Junction 21) and Spittals Interchange (former Junction 23). However, these junctions are no longer part of the A14 since the opening of the new alignment south of Huntingdon in December 2019.\n\nThe old A14 from Huntingdon Spittals interchange to [[Godmanchester]] is now closed both ways, but it is planned to be reopened in 2022 as part of the A1307, once the Huntingdon railway viaduct has been dismantled. Link roads at Hinchingbrooke and Mill Common will connect the former A14 dual carriageway to the road network in Huntingdon.\n\n==History==\nThe current A14 includes parts of the former A45 between Felixstowe and Cambridge, the A604 between Cambridge and Kettering, a short stretch of the former A6 west of Kettering, plus a new link road which was constructed in the early 1990s between there and the M1/M6 interchange at Catthorpe, Leicestershire. Prior to the current A14, the main route from [[Birmingham]] to the [[Haven ports]] followed the M6, M1, the [[A428 road|A428]] and [[A45 road]] via Coventry, Rugby, Northampton, Bedford, St Neots, Cambridge and then through all the towns on the A14 to Felixstowe. Prior to its use for the current route the A14 designation had been used for a section of road between the [[A10 road (England)|A10]] at [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] and the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] at [[Alconbury]] following part of the route of [[Ermine Street]] which is now is designated the [[A1198 road|A1198]] to [[Godmanchester]] and the [[A1307 road|A1307]] to Alconbury. The section through Huntingdon is currently closed following the opening of the Huntingdon by-pass; Highways England plan to demolish a viaduct carrying the road over the River Great Ouse and the Great Northern railway and build junctions with local roads.\n\nThe [[M45 motorway]] was constructed in 1959 parallel to part of the old A45 in the Midlands. It opened on the same day as the [[M1 motorway]] and was soon one of the busiest sections of motorway. The M6 opened in the late 1960s and early 1970s, after which more traffic to the ports used the route from junction 1 of the M6 via the [[A427 road|A427]] to Market Harborough followed by a short section of the [[A6 road (England)|A6]] to Kettering and then the [[A604 road|A604]] to Cambridge before joining the old A45 to the ports as above.<ref>The Hamlin Road Atlas of Great Britain \u2013 1976</ref> The M45 now carries little traffic.\n\nThe sections from Huntingdon east to the ports were upgraded first, starting with the Huntingdon bypass in 1973, followed by the Girton to Bar Hill section in 1975/76 and the Cambridge northern bypass and Cambridge/Newmarket section in 1976/77.<ref name=dates>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/a14m1fstat.htm |title=A14.

From Ipswich to [[Felixstowe]] is part of [[European route E30|E&nbsp;30]].\n\nThe numbering of the A14 is [[Incorrectly numbered roads in Great Britain|inconsistent]] with the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|national road numbering scheme]], as it begins in zone 5 and crosses through zone 6 on the way to zone 1 east of Huntingdon to Felixstowe. The road is concurrent with the [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12 road]] from the Seven Hills Interchange to the Copdock Interchange which forms the Ipswich Southern bypass and with the A11 road between junctions 36 and 38.\n\nUntil the opening in 2019 of the Huntingdon by-pass, there was some confusion as to the identity of the section of road between the A141 junction at Stukeley and the A1(M). The Ordnance Survey 1:25000 map showed the A-road section as part of the A14 and the motorway section (between the B1043 junction and the A1(M)) as the A14(M). However, some official documents, including the 1993 statutory instrument which authorised the motorway upgrade, referred to it as the A604(M).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1993/Uksi_19932940_en_3.htm|title=Statutory Instrument 1993 No. 2940: The A604(M) Motorway (Alconbury to A1(M) Section) And Connecting Roads Scheme 1993}}</ref> The same confusion appeared on the former Highways Agency page about the 1996-8 upgrade to the A1(M) between Alconbury and Peterborough<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4442.aspx |title=A1(M) Alconbury to Peterborough |publisher=Highways Agency |quote=\"the remainder constructed to dual 3 lane motorway, except for the short length of A14(M) which is dual 2 lane motorway\" |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827095144/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4442.aspx |archivedate=27 August 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4444.aspx |title=A1(M) Alconbury to Peterborough |publisher=Highways Agency |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220050126/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4444.aspx |archivedate=20 December 2010 }}</ref>. The signs on entering the motorway section, unusually, showed a large motorway symbol with no number. Following the opening of the Huntingdon by-pass, however, the former A14 between the A1(M) and the Cambridge Services has been renumbered A1307, with the section through Huntingdon itself closed. The identity of the former A14(M) as of 2019 is now a spur off the A1(M).\n\nEast of the Girton Interchange with the [[M11 motorway|M11]] at [[Cambridge]], the A14 used to be the [[A45 road (Great Britain)|A45]], and much of the long-distance traffic further west had previously used the A45 route. The section between [[Cambridge]] and [[Kettering]] used to be the [[A604 road|A604]], apart from a short section near Kettering that used to be part of the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]]. The road which was the A14 until the late 1980s is now the [[A1198 road|A1198]] between [[Royston, Hertfordshire]] and [[Godmanchester]]. North of Godmanchester the route of the original A14 became part of the A604, itself now part of the new A14 until it meets the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]] near [[Alconbury]], thus forming a 'spur' off the A14 until the opening of the Huntingdon by-pass in 2019.\n\n==Longer term plans==\nThe Highways Agency has plans to increase capacity from Junctions 3 to 10 near Kettering 'in the longer term'<ref name=\"HA22936\">{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/22936.aspx |title=14 Kettering Bypass Widening |publisher=Highways Agency |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219100843/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/22936.aspx |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}</ref> and also to widen the road throughout [[Northamptonshire]] to \"help cut the number of accidents and cope with the likely growth in traffic\".<ref name=\"bbc4037663\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/4037663.stm|title=Traffic may force widening of A14|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2004-11-24|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==Coach services==\nThe A14 is no longer used by a coach service, [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] route 350 (Clacton on sea to Liverpool) between Copdock (J53) and Huntingdon (J26); \nNational Express 305 (Liverpool to Southend-on-sea) and route 314 (Southport to Cambridge) follow the old A45 between Cambridge and Birmingham.\n\n==Notable incidents==\n* 17 November 1998.

The road forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroutes]] [[European route E24|E24]] and [[European route E30|E30]].\n\n==Route==\nFrom the [[Port of Felixstowe]] the road heads west, bypassing [[Ipswich]] to the south via the [[Orwell Bridge]] and to  [[Stowmarket]], [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] and [[Cambridge]] where it meets the [[M11 motorway|M11]], then past [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]], [[Huntingdon]] and the junction with the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], from there through [[Kettering]], [[Northamptonshire]], ending at junction 19 of the M1 and the start of the M6.\n\nThe road is a [[dual carriageway]], most with two lanes each way, but there are two dual three-lane sections: on the Newmarket bypass (between Junctions 36 and 38) where it [[Concurrency (road)|runs concurrent]] with the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11]], and a short stretch between the Girton Interchange and [[Bar Hill, Cambridgeshire|Bar Hill]]. There are three [[At-grade intersection|at-grade junctions]]: with the B663 at [[Bythorn]] in [[Cambridgeshire]] (junction 15); at the Leighton Bromswold turn a few miles to the east (junction 17); and at the Dockspur Roundabout at the edge of [[Felixstowe]] (junction 60).\n\nThere were two additional at-grade roundabouts along the former A14 main route, these being Brampton Hut Interchange (Junction 21) and Spittals Interchange (Junction 23). However, these junctions are no longer part of the A14 since the opening of the new alignment south of Huntingdon in December 2019.\n\nThe old A14 from Huntingdon Spittals interchange to [[Godmanchester]] is now closed both ways, but it is planned to be reopened in 2022 as part of the A1307, once the Huntingdon railway viaduct has been dismantled. Link roads at Hinchingbrooke and Mill Common will connect the former A14 dual carriageway to the road network in Huntingdon.\n\n==History==\nThe current A14 includes parts of the former A45 between Felixstowe and Cambridge, the A604 between Cambridge and Kettering, a short stretch of the former A6 west of Kettering, plus a new link road which was constructed in the early 1990s between there and the M1/M6 interchange at Catthorpe, Leicestershire. Prior to the current A14, the main route from [[Birmingham]] to the [[Haven ports]] followed the M6, M1, the [[A428 road|A428]] and [[A45 road]] via Coventry, Rugby, Northampton, Bedford, St Neots, Cambridge and then through all the towns on the A14 to Felixstowe. Prior to its use for the current route the A14 designation had been used for a section of road between the [[A10 road (England)|A10]] at [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] and the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] at [[Alconbury]] following part of the route of [[Ermine Street]] which is now is designated the [[A1198 road|A1198]] to [[Godmanchester]] and the [[A1307 road|A1307]] to Alconbury. The section through Huntingdon is currently closed following the opening of the Huntingdon by-pass; Highways England plan to demolish a viaduct carrying the road over the River Great Ouse and the Great Northern railway and build junctions with local roads.\n\nThe [[M45 motorway]] was constructed in 1959 parallel to part of the old A45 in the Midlands. It opened on the same day as the [[M1 motorway]] and was soon one of the busiest sections of motorway. The M6 opened in the late 1960s and early 1970s, after which more traffic to the ports used the route from junction 1 of the M6 via the [[A427 road|A427]] to Market Harborough followed by a short section of the [[A6 road (England)|A6]] to Kettering and then the [[A604 road|A604]] to Cambridge before joining the old A45 to the ports as above.<ref>The Hamlin Road Atlas of Great Britain \u2013 1976</ref> The M45 now carries little traffic.\n\nThe sections from Huntingdon east to the ports were upgraded first, starting with the Huntingdon bypass in 1973, followed by the Girton to Bar Hill section in 1975/76 and the Cambridge northern bypass and Cambridge/Newmarket section in 1976/77.<ref name=dates>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/a14m1fstat.htm |title=A14.

From Ipswich to [[Felixstowe]] is part of [[European route E30|E&nbsp;30]].\n\nThe numbering of the A14 is [[Incorrectly numbered roads in Great Britain|inconsistent]] with the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|national road numbering scheme]], as it begins in zone 5 and crosses through zone 6 on the way to zone 1 east of Huntingdon to Felixstowe. The road is concurrent with the [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12 road]] from the Seven Hills Interchange to the Copdock Interchange which forms the Ipswich Southern bypass and with the A11 road between junctions 36 and 38.\n\nUntil the opening in 2019 of the Huntingdon by-pass, there was some confusion as to the identity of the section of road between the A141 junction at Stukeley and the A1(M). The Ordnance Survey 1:25000 map showed the A-road section as part of the A14 and the motorway section (between the B1043 junction and the A1(M)) as the A14(M). However, some official documents, including the 1993 statutory instrument which authorised the motorway upgrade, referred to it as the A604(M).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1993/Uksi_19932940_en_3.htm|title=Statutory Instrument 1993 No. 2940: The A604(M) Motorway (Alconbury to A1(M) Section) And Connecting Roads Scheme 1993}}</ref> The same confusion appeared on the former Highways Agency page about the 1996-8 upgrade to the A1(M) between Alconbury and Peterborough<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4442.aspx |title=A1(M) Alconbury to Peterborough |publisher=Highways Agency |quote=\"the remainder constructed to dual 3 lane motorway, except for the short length of A14(M) which is dual 2 lane motorway\" |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827095144/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4442.aspx |archivedate=27 August 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4444.aspx |title=A1(M) Alconbury to Peterborough |publisher=Highways Agency |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220050126/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4444.aspx |archivedate=20 December 2010 }}</ref>. The signs on entering the motorway section, unusually, showed a large motorway symbol with no number. Following the opening of the Huntingdon by-pass, however, the former A14 between the A1(M) and the Cambridge Services has been renumbered A1307, with the section through Huntingdon itself closed. The identity of the former A14(M) as of 2019 is now a spur off the A1(M).\n\nEast of the Girton Interchange with the [[M11 motorway|M11]] at [[Cambridge]], the A14 used to be the [[A45 road (Great Britain)|A45]], and much of the long-distance traffic further west had previously used the A45 route. The section between [[Cambridge]] and [[Kettering]] used to be the [[A604 road|A604]], apart from a short section near Kettering that used to be part of the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]]. The road which was the A14 until the late 1980s is now the [[A1198 road|A1198]] between [[Royston, Hertfordshire]] and [[Godmanchester]]. North of Godmanchester the route of the original A14 became part of the A604, itself now part of the new A14 until it meets the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]] near [[Alconbury]], thus forming a 'spur' off the A14 until the opening of the Huntingdon by-pass in 2019.\n\n==Longer term plans==\nThe Highways Agency has plans to increase capacity from Junctions 3 to 10 near Kettering 'in the longer term'<ref name=\"HA22936\">{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/22936.aspx |title=14 Kettering Bypass Widening |publisher=Highways Agency |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219100843/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/22936.aspx |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}</ref> and also to widen the road throughout [[Northamptonshire]] to \"help cut the number of accidents and cope with the likely growth in traffic\".<ref name=\"bbc4037663\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/4037663.stm|title=Traffic may force widening of A14|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2004-11-24|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==Coach services==\nThe A14 is no longer used by a coach service, [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] route 350 (Clacton on sea to Liverpool) between Copdock (J53) and Huntingdon (J26); \nNational Express 305 (Liverpool to Southend-on-sea) and route 314 (Southport to Cambridge) follow the old A45 between Cambridge and Birmingham.\n\n==Notable incidents==\n* 17 November 1998.

The song is in the style of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[neo soul]], and includes references to and samples of the songs \"[[Bennie and the Jets]]\" by [[Elton John]], \"[[Got to Give It Up]]\" by [[Marvin Gaye]], and \"[[Real Love (Mary J.
