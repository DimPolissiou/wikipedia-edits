James is Michelle's cousin; his mother Cathy left Derry for England to have an abortion but gave birth to him and raised him in London. She sends him back to Derry to live with Michelle and her mother Deirdre when she is going through a divorce.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- The cast section should include main cast only. Any recurring or guest cast should appear in a separate section -->\n\n===Main===\n* [[Saoirse-Monica Jackson]] as Erin Quinn. Erin is passionate and ambitious, but at times alternatively vain or overly concerned with how she is regarded by others. Her dark sense of humour and sarcastic nature often get her in trouble.\n* [[Louisa Harland]] as Orla McCool, Erin's maternal cousin. Orla is very detached and quiet. Unlike most of her friends, Orla does not care what anyone else thinks of her. She often amuses herself by invading Erin's privacy for fun.\n* [[Nicola Coughlan]] as Clare Devlin, one of Erin's best friends. Clare often acts as the voice of reason in the gang, as she is far more intimidated by authority figures than her friends. In the series one finale, Clare comes out to her friends and the school as a lesbian.\n* [[Jamie-Lee O'Donnell]] as Michelle Mallon, one of Erin's best friends. Michelle is the wild child of the group, and her troublemaking tendencies often get her and her friends into trouble. She is shown to have a very keen interest in sex, drugs and alcohol, and shows almost no respect to any figures of authority, including her own mother.\n* [[Dylan Llewellyn]] as James Maguire, Michelle's maternal cousin. English-born to an Irish mother, James is sent to live in Derry with his aunt Deirdre and cousin Michelle while his mother goes through a divorce. Due to his English accent, he is enrolled for his safety at an all-girls school.\n* [[Tara Lynne O'Neill]] as Ma/Mary, Erin's disciplinarian mother. She tolerates no attitude or trouble from her daughter, but is loving and usually only wants what is best for her family. She has been married to Gerry for 17 years.\n* Kathy Kiera Clarke as Aunt Sarah, Orla's mother and Mary's sister. Sarah is caring but dim-witted, and often points out things that are painfully obvious. Although caring towards Orla, she is an inattentive mother and takes little responsibility for raising her. Like Orla, Sarah spends most of her time in Mary's house, where Mary does all the work, rather than their own house next door, which is sometimes mentioned<!-- when? --> but not shown.\n* Siobh\u00e1n McSweeney as Sister Michael, the headmistress of the school that the girls attend. She rules the school with an iron fist, and responds to most events with eye-rolling or sarcasm. In series two, she admits she took holy orders for the free rent.\n* [[Tommy Tiernan]] as Da/Gerry, Erin's father. Gerry is relaxed and very loyal and protective of his family. He is from the Republic of Ireland and holds an unspecified job where he drives 8 hours a day, and has a very strained relationship with his father-in-law.\n* [[Ian McElhinney]] as Granda Joe, Mary and Sarah's father and Erin and Orla's grandfather. Joe moved in with the Quinns after his wife died.  Although on good terms with the rest of the family, Joe has nothing but contempt for Gerry, constantly criticising him and encouraging Mary to leave him.\n*Leah O'Rourke as Jenny Joyce, the prefect of the girls' school and a suck-up. Jenny and the gang detest each other, and she often flaunts her wealth and position of power. Incredibly sanctimonious, she is often called out by Sister Michael, who has no patience for her either.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Beccy Henderson as Aisling, Jenny's best friend and sidekick.\n* Claire Rafferty as Miss Mooney, Sister Michael's deputy.\n* Amelia Crowley as Deirdre Mallon, Michelle's mother and James' aunt, who is a nurse.\n* [[Kevin McAleer]] as Uncle Colm, Joe's brother, whom the family consider incredibly dull and boring.\n* Paul Mallon as Dennis, the aggressive proprietor of the corner shop which the girls frequent.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Derry Girls episodes}}\n{{#section:List of Derry Girls episodes|Overview}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[Northern Ireland]], with most scenes being shot in [[Derry]] and [[Belfast]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Where Is 'Derry Girls' Filmed?

James is Michelle's cousin; his mother Cathy left Derry for England to have an abortion but gave birth to him and raised him in London. She sends him back to Derry to live with Michelle and her mother Deirdre when she is going through a divorce.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- The cast section should include main cast only. Any recurring or guest cast should appear in a separate section -->\n\n===Main===\n* [[Saoirse-Monica Jackson]] as Erin Quinn. Erin is passionate and ambitious, but at times alternatively vain or overly concerned with how she is regarded by others. Her dark sense of humour and sarcastic nature often get her in trouble.\n* [[Louisa Harland]] as Orla McCool, Erin's maternal cousin. Orla is very detached and quiet. Unlike most of her friends, Orla does not care what anyone else thinks of her. She often amuses herself by invading Erin's privacy for fun.\n* [[Nicola Coughlan]] as Clare Devlin, one of Erin's best friends. Clare often acts as the voice of reason in the gang, as she is far more intimidated by authority figures than her friends. In the series one finale, Clare comes out to her friends and the school as a lesbian.\n* [[Jamie-Lee O'Donnell]] as Michelle Mallon, one of Erin's best friends. Michelle is the wild child of the group, and her troublemaking tendencies often get her and her friends into trouble. She is shown to have a very keen interest in sex, drugs and alcohol, and shows almost no respect to any figures of authority, including her own mother.\n* [[Dylan Llewellyn]] as James Maguire, Michelle's maternal cousin. English-born to an Irish mother, James is sent to live in Derry with his aunt Deirdre and cousin Michelle while his mother goes through a divorce. Due to his English accent, he is enrolled for his safety at an all-girls school.\n* [[Tara Lynne O'Neill]] as Ma/Mary, Erin's disciplinarian mother. She tolerates no attitude or trouble from her daughter, but is loving and usually only wants what is best for her family. She has been married to Gerry for 17 years.\n* Kathy Kiera Clarke as Aunt Sarah, Orla's mother and Mary's sister. Sarah is caring but dim-witted, and often points out things that are painfully obvious. Although caring towards Orla, she is an inattentive mother and takes little responsibility for raising her. Like Orla, Sarah spends most of her time in Mary's house, where Mary does all the work, rather than their own house next door, which is sometimes mentioned<!-- when? --> but not shown.\n* Siobh\u00e1n McSweeney as Sister Michael, the headmistress of the school that the girls attend. She rules the school with an iron fist, and responds to most events with eye-rolling or sarcasm. In series two, she admits she took holy orders for the free rent.\n* [[Tommy Tiernan]] as Da/Gerry, Erin's father. Gerry is relaxed and very loyal and protective of his family. He is from the Republic of Ireland and holds an unspecified job where he drives 8 hours a day, and has a very strained relationship with his father-in-law.\n* [[Ian McElhinney]] as Granda Joe, Mary and Sarah's father and Erin and Orla's grandfather. Joe moved in with the Quinns after his wife died.  Although on good terms with the rest of the family, Joe has nothing but contempt for Gerry, constantly criticising him and encouraging Mary to leave him.\n*Leah O'Rourke as Jenny Joyce, the prefect of the girls' school and a suck-up. Jenny and the gang detest each other, and she often flaunts her wealth and position of power. Incredibly sanctimonious, she is often called out by Sister Michael, who has no patience for her either.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Beccy Henderson as Aisling, Jenny's best friend and sidekick.\n* Claire Rafferty as Miss Mooney, Sister Michael's deputy.\n* Amelia Crowley as Deirdre Mallon, Michelle's mother and James' aunt, who is a nurse.\n* [[Kevin McAleer]] as Uncle Colm, Joe's brother, whom the family consider incredibly dull and boring.\n* Paul Mallon as Dennis, the aggressive proprietor of the corner shop which the girls frequent.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Derry Girls episodes}}\n{{#section:List of Derry Girls episodes|Overview}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[Northern Ireland]], with most scenes being shot in [[Derry]] and [[Belfast]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Where Is 'Derry Girls' Filmed?

The programs quickly became the highest rated wrestling shows in the markets of New York and Los Angeles and demonstrated ability regardless of the region, market size or time-period to grow each television stations audience.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The promotion aired about twenty four original one-hour episodes, fielding a single pay-per-view, [[#WOW Unleashed|Women of Wrestling Unleashed]]. With its headquarters in Los Angeles, WOW held its live events which were taped for broadcast from the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Great Western Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California]]. The organization's first live event attendance was a mere 400+, but its audience grew to over 5,000 customers over the period of only six events, and its website peaked in one month with slightly over 10 million unique visitors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe majority of WOW's performers were rookies to the business, recruited from backgrounds in modeling, acting, stunt work, and martial arts. [[Selina Majors]] (who wrestled as Bambi) and [[Peggy Lee Leather|Thug]] (who wrestled as Peggy Lee Leather) were the trainers for the company. Jeanie Buss appeared regularly on WOW programming, although not as an in-ring participant.\n\n=== Dormant (2001\u20132012) ===\n\nDue to the ever soft and declining advertising market during this time, WOW was not able to take advantage of its momentum and ceased production after completing 24 original episodes and one live pay-per-view event. WOW ceased television production by fall 2001. WOW, although off the air in the United States after 2001, continued to exist through international distribution deals with the markets of Israel, Russia, India, Canada, South Africa, Kenya, the Middle East, Turkey, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic and other countries airing the WOW shows.\n\nDavid McLane would attempt to relaunch the show again a few times over the next decade, with no success.

The programs quickly became the highest rated wrestling shows in the markets of New York and Los Angeles and demonstrated ability regardless of the region, market size or time-period to grow each television stations audience.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The promotion aired about twenty four original one-hour episodes, fielding a single pay-per-view, [[#WOW Unleashed|Women of Wrestling Unleashed]]. With its headquarters in Los Angeles, WOW held its live events which were taped for broadcast from the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Great Western Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California]]. The organization's first live event attendance was a mere 400+, but its audience grew to over 5,000 customers over the period of only six events, and its website peaked in one month with slightly over 10 million unique visitors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe majority of WOW's performers were rookies to the business, recruited from backgrounds in modeling, acting, stunt work, and martial arts. [[Selina Majors]] (who wrestled as Bambi) and [[Peggy Lee Leather|Thug]] (who wrestled as Peggy Lee Leather) were the trainers for the company. Jeanie Buss appeared regularly on WOW programming, although not as an in-ring participant.\n\n=== Dormant (2001\u20132012) ===\n\nDue to the ever soft and declining advertising market during this time, WOW was not able to take advantage of its momentum and ceased production after completing 24 original episodes and one live pay-per-view event. WOW ceased television production by fall 2001. WOW, although off the air in the United States after 2001, continued to exist through international distribution deals with the markets of Israel, Russia, India, Canada, South Africa, Kenya, the Middle East, Turkey, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic and other countries airing the WOW shows.\n\nDavid McLane would attempt to relaunch the show again a few times over the next decade, with no success. One attempt in 2002 included a partnership with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] frontman [[Gene Simmons]].<ref name=\"terrigoldint\">{{cite web|title=INTERACTIVE WRESTLING RADIO INTERVIEW - Terri Gold|url=http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/IWR/interviews/TerriGold41606.html|accessdate=18 February 2016}}</ref> Starting in July 2011, the [http://www.wowe.com WOW website] reported the WOW original shows started airing on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KTNV]] in Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wowe.com/ |title=Women of Wrestling - WOWE - New Website Coming Soon |publisher=WOWE |date= |accessdate=2012-01-24}}</ref> The series continues to be distributed internationally.

The factors making the consensus difficult are, among others, the difficult passage [[Behistun Inscription|DB]] (IV lines 88\u201392) from [[Darius the Great]] who speaks of a new \"form of writing\" being made by himself which is said to be \"in [[Iranian Languages|Aryan]]\":\n\n{{quote|King Darius says: By the grace of Ahuramazda this is the inscription which I have made.

Although it is true that the oldest attested Old Persian inscriptions are from Behistun monument from Darius, the creation of this \"new type of writing\" seems, according to Schmitt, \"to have begun already under [[Cyrus the Great]]\".<ref name=s2008-80-1>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|pp=80\u20131}}</ref>\n\nThe script shows a few changes in the shape of characters during the period it was used. This can be seen as a standardization of the heights of wedges, which in the beginning (i.e. in [[Behistun inscription|DB]]) took only half the height of a line.<ref>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|p=79}}</ref>\n\n==Letters==\n\n[[File:BehistunInscriptiondetail.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Close-up of the [[Behistun inscription]]]]\n[[File:Pers\u00e9polis. Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Old Persian inscription in [[Persepolis]]]]\nAlthough based on a logo-syllabic prototype, all vowels but short /a/ are written and so the system is essentially an [[alphabet]]. There are three vowels, long and short. Initially, no distinction is made for length: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} ''a'' or ''\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}} ''i'' or ''\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} ''u'' or ''\u016b.'' However, as in the Brahmic scripts, short ''a'' is not written after a consonant: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h'' or ''ha,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa0}} ''h\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa1}} ''hi'' or ''h\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa2}} ''hu'' or ''h\u016b.'' (Old Persian is not considered an [[abugida]] because vowels are represented as full letters.)\n\nThirteen out of twenty-two consonants, such as {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h(a),'' are invariant, regardless of the following vowel (that is, they are alphabetic), while only six have a distinct form for each consonant-vowel combination (that is, they are syllabic), and among these, only ''d'' and ''m'' occur in three forms for all three vowels: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} ''d'' or ''da,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa0}} ''d\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1}} ''di'' or ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2}} ''du'' or ''d\u016b.'' (''k, g'' do not occur before ''i,'' and ''j, v'' do not occur before ''u,'' so these consonants only have two forms each.)\n\nSometimes medial long vowels are written with a ''y'' or ''v,'' as in Semitic: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9}} ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfba}} ''d\u016b.'' Diphthongs are written by mismatching consonant and vowel: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa1}} ''dai'', or sometimes, in cases where the consonant does not differentiate between vowels, by writing the consonant and both vowel components: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfb1\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1}} ''ci\u0161pai\u0161'' (gen. of name Ci\u0161pi- '[[Teispes]]').\n\nIn addition, three consonants, ''t'', ''n'', and ''r'', are partially syllabic, having the same form before ''a'' and ''i'', and a distinct form only before ''u'': {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} ''n'' or ''na,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa0}} ''n\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa1}} ''ni'' or ''n\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5\ud800\udfa2}} ''nu'' or ''n\u016b.''\n\nThe effect is not unlike the English {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} sound, which is typically written ''g'' before ''i'' or ''e'', but ''j'' before other vowels (''gem'', ''jam''), or the [[Castilian Spanish]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} sound, which is written ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e'' and ''z'' before other vowels (''cinco, zapato''): it is more accurate to say that some of the Old Persian consonants are written by different letters depending on the following vowel, rather than classifying the script as syllabic. This situation had its origin in [[Cuneiform script#Assyrian cuneiform|Assyrian cuneiform]], where several syllabic distinctions had been lost and were often clarified with explicit vowels. However, in the case of Assyrian, the vowel was not always used, and was never used where not needed, so the system remained (logo-)syllabic.\n\nFor a while it was speculated that the alphabet could have had its origin in such a system, with a leveling of consonant signs a millennium earlier producing something like the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], but today it is generally accepted that the Semitic alphabet arose from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], where vowel notation was not important. (See [[Proto-Sinaitic script]].)\n\nMost scholars consider the writing system to be an independent invention because it has no obvious connections with other writing systems at the time, such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], Akkadian, [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiforms.<ref>Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 1. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> While Old Persian's basic strokes are similar to those found in cuneiform scripts, Old Persian texts were engraved on hard materials, so the engravers had to make cuts that imitated the forms easily made on clay tablets.<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\" />  The signs are composed of horizontal, vertical, and angled wedges.  There are four basic components and new signs are created by adding wedges to these basic components.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\">Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 2. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> These four basic components are two parallel wedges without angle, three parallel wedges without angle, one wedge without angle and an angled wedge, and two angled wedges.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\" /> The script is written from left to right.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 134.

Old Persian contains two sets of consonants: those whose shape depends on the following vowel and those whose shape is independent of the following vowel.  The consonant symbols that depend on the following vowel act like the consonants in [[Devanagari]].  Vowel diacritics are added to these consonant symbols to change the inherent vowel or add length to the inherent vowel.  However, the vowel symbols are usually still included so [di] would be written as [di] [i] even though [di] already implies the vowel.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 136. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref> For the consonants whose shape does not depend on the following vowels, the vowel signs must be used after the consonant symbol.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 135. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref>\n\nCompared to the [[Avestan alphabet]] Old Persian notably lacks voiced fricatives, but includes the sign ''\u00e7'' (of uncertain pronunciation) and a sign for the non-native ''l''. Notably, in common with the [[Brahmic scripts]], there appears to be no distinction between a consonant followed by an ''a'' and a consonant followed by nothing.\n\n{{Main|Old Persian (Unicode block)}}\n\nOld Persian cuneiform was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in March 2005 with the release of version 4.1.\n\nThe Unicode block for Old Persian cuneiform is U+103A0&ndash;U+103DF and is in the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]]:\n\n{{Unicode chart Old Persian|Old Persian Cuneiform Unicode Font Download = http://www.fontspace.com/download/22120/bdca919040e54ed8aed4b0b525902023/fereydoun_behistun.zip}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|  ||  || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">k-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">g-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">c-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u00e7-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">j-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">t-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u03b8-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">d-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">p-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">f-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">n-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">m-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">y-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">v-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">r-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">l-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">s-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">z-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0161-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">h-</span>\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-(a)</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa3}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa7}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa5}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc2}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa9}}  || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfab}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb0}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb1}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb3}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb2}} || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb6}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb9}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfba}} || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbc}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbe}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbf}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc0}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc1}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}}\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-i</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}}\n! <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u2014</span> !! \u2014 \n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaa}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb7}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbb}}\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-u</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa4}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa6}}\n! \u2014\n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfac}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb8}}\n! \u2014 \n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbd}}\n|-\n|}\n\n*logograms:\n**''[[Ahura Mazda|Auramazd\u0101]]'': {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc8}}, {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc9}}, {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfca}} (genitive)\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya</span>'' \"king\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcb}}\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">dahy\u0101u\u0161-</span>'' \"country\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcc}}, {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcd}}</span>\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">baga-</span>'' \"god\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfce}}\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b\u016bmi\u0161-</span>'' \"earth\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcf}}\n*[[word divider]]: <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfd0}}</span>\n*numerals:<ref>Unattested numbers are not listed.

The factors making the consensus difficult are, among others, the difficult passage [[Behistun Inscription|DB]] (IV lines 88\u201392) from [[Darius the Great]] who speaks of a new \"form of writing\" being made by himself which is said to be \"in [[Iranian Languages|Aryan]]\":\n\n{{quote|King Darius says: By the grace of Ahuramazda this is the inscription which I have made.

Although it is true that the oldest attested Old Persian inscriptions are from Behistun monument from Darius, the creation of this \"new type of writing\" seems, according to Schmitt, \"to have begun already under [[Cyrus the Great]]\".<ref name=s2008-80-1>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|pp=80\u20131}}</ref>\n\nThe script shows a few changes in the shape of characters during the period it was used. This can be seen as a standardization of the heights of wedges, which in the beginning (i.e. in [[Behistun inscription|DB]]) took only half the height of a line.<ref>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|p=79}}</ref>\n\n==Letters==\n\n[[File:BehistunInscriptiondetail.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Close-up of the [[Behistun inscription]]]]\n[[File:Pers\u00e9polis. Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Old Persian inscription in [[Persepolis]]]]\nAlthough based on a logo-syllabic prototype, all vowels but short /a/ are written and so the system is essentially an [[alphabet]]. There are three vowels, long and short. Initially, no distinction is made for length: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} ''a'' or ''\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}} ''i'' or ''\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} ''u'' or ''\u016b.'' However, as in the Brahmic scripts, short ''a'' is not written after a consonant: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h'' or ''ha,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa0}} ''h\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa1}} ''hi'' or ''h\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa2}} ''hu'' or ''h\u016b.'' (Old Persian is not considered an [[abugida]] because vowels are represented as full letters.)\n\nThirteen out of twenty-two consonants, such as {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h(a),'' are invariant, regardless of the following vowel (that is, they are alphabetic), while only six have a distinct form for each consonant-vowel combination (that is, they are syllabic), and among these, only ''d'' and ''m'' occur in three forms for all three vowels: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} ''d'' or ''da,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa0}} ''d\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1}} ''di'' or ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2}} ''du'' or ''d\u016b.'' (''k, g'' do not occur before ''i,'' and ''j, v'' do not occur before ''u,'' so these consonants only have two forms each.)\n\nSometimes medial long vowels are written with a ''y'' or ''v,'' as in Semitic: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9}} ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfba}} ''d\u016b.'' Diphthongs are written by mismatching consonant and vowel: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa1}} ''dai'', or sometimes, in cases where the consonant does not differentiate between vowels, by writing the consonant and both vowel components: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfb1\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1}} ''ci\u0161pai\u0161'' (gen. of name Ci\u0161pi- '[[Teispes]]').\n\nIn addition, three consonants, ''t'', ''n'', and ''r'', are partially syllabic, having the same form before ''a'' and ''i'', and a distinct form only before ''u'': {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} ''n'' or ''na,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa0}} ''n\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa1}} ''ni'' or ''n\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5\ud800\udfa2}} ''nu'' or ''n\u016b.''\n\nThe effect is not unlike the English {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} sound, which is typically written ''g'' before ''i'' or ''e'', but ''j'' before other vowels (''gem'', ''jam''), or the [[Castilian Spanish]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} sound, which is written ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e'' and ''z'' before other vowels (''cinco, zapato''): it is more accurate to say that some of the Old Persian consonants are written by different letters depending on the following vowel, rather than classifying the script as syllabic. This situation had its origin in [[Cuneiform script#Assyrian cuneiform|Assyrian cuneiform]], where several syllabic distinctions had been lost and were often clarified with explicit vowels. However, in the case of Assyrian, the vowel was not always used, and was never used where not needed, so the system remained (logo-)syllabic.\n\nFor a while it was speculated that the alphabet could have had its origin in such a system, with a leveling of consonant signs a millennium earlier producing something like the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], but today it is generally accepted that the Semitic alphabet arose from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], where vowel notation was not important. (See [[Proto-Sinaitic script]].)\n\nMost scholars consider the writing system to be an independent invention because it has no obvious connections with other writing systems at the time, such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], Akkadian, [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiforms.<ref>Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 1. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> While Old Persian's basic strokes are similar to those found in cuneiform scripts, Old Persian texts were engraved on hard materials, so the engravers had to make cuts that imitated the forms easily made on clay tablets.<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\" />  The signs are composed of horizontal, vertical, and angled wedges.  There are four basic components and new signs are created by adding wedges to these basic components.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\">Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 2. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> These four basic components are two parallel wedges without angle, three parallel wedges without angle, one wedge without angle and an angled wedge, and two angled wedges.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\" /> The script is written from left to right.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 134.

Old Persian contains two sets of consonants: those whose shape depends on the following vowel and those whose shape is independent of the following vowel.  The consonant symbols that depend on the following vowel act like the consonants in [[Devanagari]].  Vowel diacritics are added to these consonant symbols to change the inherent vowel or add length to the inherent vowel.  However, the vowel symbols are usually still included so [di] would be written as [di] [i] even though [di] already implies the vowel.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 136. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref> For the consonants whose shape does not depend on the following vowels, the vowel signs must be used after the consonant symbol.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 135. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref>\n\nCompared to the [[Avestan alphabet]] Old Persian notably lacks voiced fricatives, but includes the sign ''\u00e7'' (of uncertain pronunciation) and a sign for the non-native ''l''. Notably, in common with the [[Brahmic scripts]], there appears to be no distinction between a consonant followed by an ''a'' and a consonant followed by nothing.\n\n{{Main|Old Persian (Unicode block)}}\n\nOld Persian cuneiform was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in March 2005 with the release of version 4.1.\n\nThe Unicode block for Old Persian cuneiform is U+103A0&ndash;U+103DF and is in the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]]:\n\n{{Unicode chart Old Persian|Old Persian Cuneiform Unicode Font Download = http://www.fontspace.com/download/22120/bdca919040e54ed8aed4b0b525902023/fereydoun_behistun.zip}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|  ||  || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">k-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">g-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">c-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u00e7-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">j-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">t-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u03b8-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">d-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">p-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">f-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">n-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">m-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">y-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">v-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">r-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">l-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">s-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">z-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0161-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">h-</span>\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-(a)</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa3}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa7}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa5}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc2}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa9}}  || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfab}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb0}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb1}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb3}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb2}} || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb6}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb9}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfba}} || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbc}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbe}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbf}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc0}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc1}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}}\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-i</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}}\n! <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u2014</span> !! \u2014 \n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaa}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb7}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbb}}\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-u</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa4}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa6}}\n! \u2014\n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfac}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb8}}\n! \u2014 \n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbd}}\n|-\n|}\n\n*logograms:\n**''[[Ahura Mazda|Auramazd\u0101]]'': {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc8}}, {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc9}}, {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfca}} (genitive)\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya</span>'' \"king\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcb}}\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">dahy\u0101u\u0161-</span>'' \"country\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcc}}, {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcd}}</span>\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">baga-</span>'' \"god\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfce}}\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b\u016bmi\u0161-</span>'' \"earth\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcf}}\n*[[word divider]]: <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfd0}}</span>\n*numerals:<ref>Unattested numbers are not listed.

{"title_page": "Medigap", "text_new": "{{expert needed|ex2=United States|date=February 2009}}\n'''Medigap''' (also called '''Medicare supplement insurance''' or '''Medicare supplemental insurance''') refers to various private [[health insurance]] plans sold to supplement [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the [[United States]]. Medigap insurance provides coverage for many of the co-pays and some of the co-insurance related to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]-covered hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health care, ambulance, durable medical equipment, and doctor charges. Medigap's name is derived from the notion that it exists to cover the difference or \"gap\" between the expenses reimbursed to providers by Medicare Parts A and B for the preceding named services and the total amount allowed to be charged for those services by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)]].  As of 2016, 34% of Medicare beneficiaries were covered by a Medigap policy.<ref name=\"AHIP 2018\">[https://www.ahip.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/State_of_Medigap18_FINAL.pdf \"State of Medigap 2018: Trends in Enrollment and Demographics\"] [[America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans]], June 2018</ref> Public-option Part C [[Medicare Advantage]] health plans and private employee retiree insurance provides a similar supplemental role for almost all other Medicare beneficiaries not dual eligible for Medicaid.\n\n==Eligibility==\n\nMedicare eligibility can start for Americans when they turn at least 64 years & 9 months old or upon retirement. Those with an disability, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), ALS or on Social Security disability for 24 months in a row may also qualify for early Medicare benefits. A person must be enrolled in both Part A and B of Medicare before they can enroll in a Medigap plan. Upon enrollment, Medicare enrollees become eligible for Medigap Open Enrollment. This period starts on the first day of the month one turns 65 & enrolled in Medicare Part B and lasts for 6 months. During this period, a person can buy any Medigap plan regardless of their health status (called \"Guaranteed Issue Rights\").\n\nThis is different than if someone is losing group coverage or retiring. When this occurs, the person is eligible to exercise his or her \"Guarantee Issue\" right. With a Medigap guarantee issue right, a person can buy a Medigap Plan A, B, C, F, K, or L that's sold by any insurance company in their state. In addition, the insurance company cannot deny or raise the premium due to past or current health conditions. Also, the insurance company must cover any pre-existing conditions. Instead of exercising the guarantee issue right, a person can opt to go through the underwriting process in order to buy a plan G or N. Once a person is outside their open enrollment period and or guarantee issue, they can change their Medigap plan, but they will be subject to health underwriting by the insurance company they are applying with.\nIt is also important to know that monthly [[insurance premium|premiums]] apply, and plans may not be cancelled by the insurer for any reason other than non-payment of premiums/membership dues.  Furthermore, a single Medigap plan may cover only one person but may offer spousal discounts. Finally, Medigap insurance is not compatible with a [[Medicare (United States)#Part C: Medicare Advantage plans|Medicare Advantage]] plan. You cannot have both a Medicare Supplement and a Medicare Advantage plan at the same time. You can only have a Medigap plan if you are still on Medicare Part A and Part B and have not replaced your coverage with a Medicare Advantage Part C coverage.\n\n==Medicare recipients under age 65==\n\nRecipients of [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI) benefits or patients with [[end-stage renal disease]] (ESRD) are entitled to Medicare coverage regardless of age, but ''are not'' automatically entitled to purchase Medigap policies unless they are at least 65. Under federal law, insurers are not required to sell Medigap policies to people under 65, and even if they do, they may use medical screening. However, a slight majority of states require insurers to offer at least one kind of Medigap policy to at least some Medicare recipients in that age group. Of these states, 25 require that Medigap policies be offered to all Medicare recipients. In [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Vermont]], Medigap policies are not available to [[End Stage Renal Disease Program|end-stage ESRD patients]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/02110.pdf |title=Section 6: Medigap Policies for People with a Disability or ESRD |work=Choosing a Medigap Policy: A Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare |publisher=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services |format=PDF |pages=39\u201340 |year=2011 |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085139/http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/02110.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> Part D deductible will go up for about 20% of Americans to over $150.00 a year. That's close to a 50% increase in 2016.\n\n==Products available==\nMedigap offerings have been standardized by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) into ten different plans, labeled A through N, sold and administered by private companies. Each Medigap plan offers a different combination of benefits. The coverage provided is roughly proportional to the premium paid. However, many older Medigap plans (these 'older' plans are no longer marketed) offering minimal benefits will cost more than current plans offering full benefits. The reason behind this is that older plans have an older average age per person enrolled in the plan, causing more claims within the group and raising the premium for all members within the group. Since Medigap is private insurance and not government sponsored, the rules governing the sale and offerings of a Medigap insurance policy can vary from state to state. Some states such as Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin require Medigap insurance to provide additional coverage than what is defined in the standardized Medigap plans.\n\nSome employers may provide Medigap coverage as a benefit to their [[retirement|retirees]]. While Medigap offerings have been standardized since 1992, some seniors who had Medigap plans prior to 1992 are still on non-standard plans. Those plans are no longer eligible for new policies.\nOver the years, new laws have brought many changes to Medigap Policies. For example, marketing for plans E, H, I, and J has been stopped as of May 31, 2010. But, if you were already covered by plan E, H, I, or J before June 1, 2010, you can keep that plan. Medigap plans M and N took effect on June 1, 2010, bringing the number of offered plans down to ten from twelve.\n\nCongress passed the bill H.R. 2 on April 14, 2015, which will eliminate plans that cover the part B deductible for new Medicare beneficiaries starting Jan. 1st, 2020. Those who enroll in to Medicare after Jan. 1st, 2020 will not be able to purchase plans F or C; however, those people who enrolled onto Medicare prior to Jan. 1st, 2020 will still be able to purchase plans F or C. Congress believes eliminating first dollar coverage plans will save Medicare money.\n\n==Drug coverage==\nSome Medigap policies sold before January 1, 2006 may include prescription drug coverage, but after that date, no new Medigap policies could be sold with drug coverage. This time frame coincides with the introduction of the [[Medicare Part D]] benefit.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries who enroll in a Standalone Part D plan may not retain the drug coverage portion of their Medigap policy. People with Medigap policies that include drug coverage who enrolled in Medicare Part D by May 15, 2006 had a guaranteed right to switch to another Medigap policy that has no prescription drug coverage. Beneficiaries choosing to retain a Medigap policy with drug coverage after that date have no such right; in that case, the opportunity to switch to a Medigap policy without drug coverage is solely at the discretion of the private insurance company issuing the replacement policy, but the beneficiary may choose to remove drug coverage from their current Medigap policy and retain all other benefits.\n\nThe vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries who hold a Medigap policy with drug coverage and then enroll in a Part D Plan after May 15, 2006 will have to pay a late enrollment penalty. The only exception is for the few beneficiaries holding a Medigap policy with a drug benefit that is considered \"creditable coverage\" (i.e. that it meets four criteria defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services); a Medigap policy with prescription drug coverage bought before mid-1992 may pay out as much as or more than a Medicare Part D plan. Medigap policies sold in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin with prescription coverage may also pay out as much as or more than Part D.\n\nThus, individuals who qualify for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program generally also do not need, and should not pay for, Medicare Supplement Insurance. Some employers offer health insurance coverage to their retirees. Retirees who are covered by such group plans may not need to purchase an individual policy. While a retiree may choose to switch to an individual plan, this may not be a good choice because group retiree plans usually do not cost anything to the individual and the group coverage is often as good or better than most individual Medigap policies. Thus, the individual should compare his company's policy costs and coverage with the ten Medigap policies. The retiree should also consider the stability of his company. If it is conceivable that the company will falter, that his costs will rise, or that coverage will diminish, the individual may wish to purchase an independent policy. Remember, however, that if a new policy is purchased, the old policy must be dropped.

This elite unit brings to bear all their talents, intellect, and technical expertise on major cases in order to keep New York and the country safe. Born into a multi-generational law enforcement family, Special Agent Maggie Bell commits deeply to the people she works with as well as those she protects. Her partner is Special Agent Omar Adom \"O.{{nbsp}}A.\" Zidan, a West Point graduate from Bushwick who spent two years undercover for the DEA before being cherry-picked by the FBI. Overseeing them is Special Agent in Charge Dana Mosier, who operates under intense pressure and has undeniable command authority. The team also includes Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine, the nerve center of the office whose ability to easily relate to and engage with both superiors and subordinates makes him a master motivator.

Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.
