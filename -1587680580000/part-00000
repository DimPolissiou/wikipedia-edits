He was known for his portrayals of worldly, often somewhat gruff characters.\n\nBorn in [[Spokane, Washington]], McGavin claimed to have been a child runaway who spent his later childhood [[squatting]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. He began his film career while working as a set painter for [[Columbia Pictures]], appearing in uncredited roles, and also starred in a regional Chicago production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' in 1950. He subsequently originated roles in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[My 3 Angels]]'' and ''[[The Rainmaker (play)|The Rainmaker]]'' (both 1954), and went on to star in a further four Broadway productions before the end of the decade.\n\nSimultaneous to his stage career, McGavin also forged a career in film, starring in [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Summertime (1955 film)|Summertime]]'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (both 1955). From 1958 to 1959, he played the [[Mike Hammer|title character]] in the 1950s television series ''[[Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer (1958 TV series)|Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer]]'', and subsequently starred in the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] series ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', first with [[Burt Reynolds]] and then with [[Noah Beery Jr.]] \n\nMcGavin went on to have a prolific career in television, appearing in numerous guest-starring roles throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He starred in the successful TV movie ''[[The Night Stalker (1972 film)|The Night Stalker]]'' and its 1973 sequel, ''[[The Night Strangler (film)|The Night Strangler]]'', playing reporter Carl Kolchak. Subsequently, he played Kolchak in the short-lived television [[horror film|horror]] series ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' (1974\u20131975). \n\nAdditional film credits in the '70s include ''[[Airport '77]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\nIn 1983, McGavin starred in [[Bob Clark]]'s seasonal comedy ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', portraying Mr. Parker, the father of Ralphie Parker. \n\nFrom 1989 to 1992, he had a recurring role opposite [[Candace Bergen]] on the sitcom ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', playing the title character's father, for which he was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series]]. He had supporting roles in the horror film ''[[Happy Hell Night]]'' (1992) and the comedy ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995), playing the father of the title character, opposite [[Adam Sandler]]. McGavin died in Los Angeles on February 25, 2006 of cardiovascular disease, aged 83.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Lyle Richardson was born in [[Spokane, Washington]], the only child of Reed D.

McGavin reportedly entered into a verbal agreement with [[Sid Sheinberg]] (President of MCA and Universal TV) to produce ''The Night Stalker'' as a TV series as a co-production between Universal and McGavin's Taurean Productions. Early promises were never fulfilled, and McGavin expressed concern over script quality and lack of network commitment toward promoting the show.

He was known for his portrayals of worldly, often somewhat gruff characters.\n\nBorn in [[Spokane, Washington]], McGavin claimed to have been a child runaway who spent his later childhood [[squatting]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. He began his film career while working as a set painter for [[Columbia Pictures]], appearing in uncredited roles, and also starred in a regional Chicago production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' in 1950. He subsequently originated roles in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[My 3 Angels]]'' and ''[[The Rainmaker (play)|The Rainmaker]]'' (both 1954), and went on to star in a further four Broadway productions before the end of the decade.\n\nSimultaneous to his stage career, McGavin also forged a career in film, starring in [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Summertime (1955 film)|Summertime]]'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (both 1955). From 1958 to 1959, he played the [[Mike Hammer|title character]] in the 1950s television series ''[[Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer (1958 TV series)|Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer]]'', and subsequently starred in the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] series ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', first with [[Burt Reynolds]] and then with [[Noah Beery Jr.]] \n\nMcGavin went on to have a prolific career in television, appearing in numerous guest-starring roles throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He starred in the successful TV movie ''[[The Night Stalker (1972 film)|The Night Stalker]]'' and its 1973 sequel, ''[[The Night Strangler (film)|The Night Strangler]]'', playing reporter Carl Kolchak. Subsequently, he played Kolchak in the short-lived television [[horror film|horror]] series ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' (1974\u20131975). \n\nAdditional film credits in the '70s include ''[[Airport '77]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\nIn 1983, McGavin starred in [[Bob Clark]]'s seasonal comedy ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', portraying Mr. Parker, the father of Ralphie Parker. \n\nFrom 1989 to 1992, he had a recurring role opposite [[Candace Bergen]] on the sitcom ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', playing the title character's father, for which he was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series]]. He had supporting roles in the horror film ''[[Happy Hell Night]]'' (1992) and the comedy ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995), playing the father of the title character, opposite [[Adam Sandler]]. McGavin died in Los Angeles on February 25, 2006 of cardiovascular disease, aged 83.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Lyle Richardson was born in [[Spokane, Washington]], the only child of Reed D.

McGavin reportedly entered into a verbal agreement with [[Sid Sheinberg]] (President of MCA and Universal TV) to produce ''The Night Stalker'' as a TV series as a co-production between Universal and McGavin's Taurean Productions. Early promises were never fulfilled, and McGavin expressed concern over script quality and lack of network commitment toward promoting the show.
