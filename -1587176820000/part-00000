The species is also known from [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]].<ref name=Muller/>\n\n''G.&nbsp;rosea'' is a common pet of tarantula hobbyists. Females have been known to live as long as 20 years, but due to the limited time they have been available on the market (and hence for extensive study), they may live considerably longer than 20 years. Considerable confusion exists between this species and ''[[Grammostola porteri]]'', with some arguing that many of the \"''G.&nbsp;rosea''\" in the pet trade actually are ''G.&nbsp;porteri''.\n\n==Habitat==\nThe  natural habitat of ''Grammostola rosea'' is the desert and scrub regions of northern Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina.<ref name=Muller>Muller-Esnault, Susan, DVM. \"Rose Hair Tarantulas or Chilean Rose Hair\" (2008). http://www.critterology.com/rose_hair_tarantulas_or_chilean_rose_hair-192.html</ref> While previously thought to be wanderers in nature, large numbers have been observed living in burrows in their natural habitat. They generally do not burrow in captivity. They are usually active in the evening or at night.\n\n==Diet==\nThis tarantula has a diverse diet, including grasshoppers, crickets, moths, beetles, cockroaches, mealworms, small lizards, and mammals. When tarantulas are kept as pets, the best food that can be provided for them are crickets that have been gut loaded on vegetables, as this is the best source of hydrated nutrition for the tarantula.\n\n==Reproduction==\n''Grammostola rosea'' has been bred in captivity for years either for research purposes or for trade, and the females profit from a 'cooling period' of a few months preceding the introduction of a male for mating. Once a male has reached sexual maturity, he will create a sperm web before he is introduced to the female's terrarium.  He eventually approaches the female's burrow with caution, tapping and vibrating his legs to attract her out of her shelter. At the opportune moment, the male lunges himself forward and using his hooks, holds the female's chelicerae, pushing his mate into a vertical position, giving him access to the female's epigyne (external genitalia). The male inserts one (or even both left and right) pedipalp into the female's epigyne and injects the fertilizing fluid.\nIn the weeks following fertilization, the female produces a large egg sac (usually containing around 500 spiderlings).<ref name=\"gur\" >*{{cite web |last1=Gurley |first1=Russ |last2=Brough |first2=Clarice |title=Rose-haired Tarantula: Chilean Rose-haired Tarantula |publisher=Animal World |accessdate=21 May 2010 |url=http://animal-world.com/encyclo/reptiles/spiders/rosehairtarantula.php}}\n</ref>\n\n==As pets==\n''Grammostola rosea'' is relatively docile, low-maintenance, and inexpensive, so they are popular as pets, kept in [[terrariums]].

They can be kept at temperatures around 25\u201330&nbsp;\u00b0C (77\u201386&nbsp;\u00b0F), on a diet of [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]] or [[locust]]s.

The original rail ancestor of the B&LE, the Shenango and Allegheny Railroad, began operation in October 1869.<ref>Drury, George: \"Historical Guide to North American Railroads\" Kalmbach Publishing, WI. {{ISBN|0890240728}},</ref>\n\nRail operations were maintained continuously by various corporate descendants on the growing system that ultimately became the B&LE in 1900. In 2004 B&LE came under the ownership of the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) as part of CN's larger purchase of holding company [[Great Lakes Transportation]]. B&LE is operated by CN as their '''Bessemer Subdivision'''. As a subsidiary of CN, B&LE has been largely unchanged (though repainting of B&LE locomotives into CN paint with \"BLE\" sub-lettering began in April 2015<ref>http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2015/04/cn-begins-repainting-bessemer--lake-erie-motive-power</ref>) and still does business as B&LE. B&LE locomotives, especially the former [[Southern Pacific]] SD40T-3 \"Tunnel Motors\", have been scattered across the CN system; many are being used in the line that feeds most of B&LE's traffic, the former Duluth, Missabe, and Iron Range lines in Minnesota. The iron ore that originates on these lines is transloaded to ships at [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]], then sent by ship to [[Conneaut, Ohio]], where it is again transloaded to B&LE trains. It is then taken down to steel mills in the Pittsburgh region, mainly to the blast furnaces at US Steel's Edgar Thomson Plant in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania]], part of the Mon Valley Works. As of Fall 2018, the active locomotives on B&LE are former Illinois Central SD70's, 1028 & 1022, CN 5422 (SD60), 5291, 5346( SD40-2Ws), and B&LE 867, 868(SD38AC), 905 (SD40T-3).\n\n==History==\n{{Rail freight\n|title=Revenue freight traffic, in millions of net ton-miles\n|float=left\n|1925|2045\n|1933|807\n|1944|2675\n|1960|1318\n|1970|2462\n}}\n\nThe Pittsburgh, Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Company was founded in 1897 by [[Andrew Carnegie]] to haul [[iron]] ore and other products from the port at [[Conneaut, Ohio]] on the [[Great Lakes]] to [[Carnegie Steel Company]] plants in Pittsburgh and the surrounding region.  On the return trip, Pennsylvania [[coal]] was hauled north to Conneaut Harbor. The company was created largely out of a series of small predecessor companies including the [[Pittsburgh, Shenango and Lake Erie Railroad]], and the Butler and Pittsburgh Railroad Company.  The company was renamed the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad in 1900. Carnegie Steel had an exclusive 99-year lease to the PS&LE. This lease was acquired by [[United States Steel Corporation|US Steel]] when that company acquired Carnegie Steel in 1901.\n\nAt the end of 1925 B&LE operated 228 miles of road on 631 miles of track; at the end of 1970 mileages were 220 and 489.\n\nIn 1988 the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad became part of [[Transtar, Inc.]], a privately held transportation holding company with principal operations in railroad freight transportation, dock operations, Great Lakes shipping, and inland river barging that were formerly subsidiaries of USX, the holding company that owns U.S. Steel. In 2001 the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad became part of [[Great Lakes Transportation, LLC]].  On May 10, 2004 [[Canadian National Railway]] acquired the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad. Iron ore and coal are still the route's major freight commodities.\n\n==Route notes==\n[[File:Bessemer rail logo.JPG|thumb|B&LE logo on a hopper at [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] ]]\nThe B&LE connects with the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] at Wallace Junction, near [[Girard, Pennsylvania]], and at the Shenango Yard in [[Greenville, Pennsylvania]].  The [[Union Railroad (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Union Railroad]] connects at the B&LE's southern terminus at Penn Hills' North Bessemer Yard.  [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] (formerly the [[Erie-Lackawanna Railroad]]) connects at Shenango Yard (the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] may have connected here, too), and the [[Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad]] connects at Calvin Yard in [[Butler, Pennsylvania]].  The B&LE formerly interchanged at Osgood, Pennsylvania with the [[New York Central System]], later [[Penn Central Railroad]] and then [[Conrail]], until the latter abandoned the line in 1988.\n\nThe main rail yard and locomotive and car shops are in [[Greenville, Pennsylvania]]. Although the B&LE acquired some early diesel-electric switching locomotives painted black with yellow trim, in 1950 the company adopted a locomotive color scheme of bright orange and black which is still in use. Because the B&LE's primary traffic is iron ore, it adopted rust-colored hoppers so the ore wouldn't produce noticeable stains on its cars.\n[[File:BLE 1593.JPG|thumb|left|B&LE 1593]]\n\nThe B&LE carried passengers many years ago, and indeed kept a [[spur line]] from its main line east to [[Conneaut Lake Park]] [[amusement park]] for dropping off and picking up excursionists visiting the park.\n\nThe B&LE main line divides around Greenville, between a waypoint north of the Village of Osgood called 'KO' and another waypoint near the Village of Kremis that used the telegraph call name 'KY', for the \"Osgood-Kremis\" cut-off (\"K-O\") that joined the original \"Old Line\" there. The latter still winds down along the Little Shenango and Shenango Rivers into downtown Greenville (where the B&LE shops are located), and then climbs back up to Kremis, en route to Fredonia and North Bessemer.  The B&LE constructed the shortcut K-O Line in 1901-02 to bypass the steep, winding route through Greenville.  From 'KO Junction', it runs south over a long ({{convert|1724|ft}}) viaduct above the Little Shenango River, the original B&LE Old Line, the former NYC RR's JF&C Branch and the former Erie RR's Chicago\u2014New York main line at Osgood. It then passes east of downtown Greenville at a relatively high elevation, and rejoins the original line at KY, near Kremis. The K-O Line cut-off shortened KO to KY run by 3.1 miles vs. the Old Line. Except for the Osgood Viaduct, this cut-off was double-tracked for many years but, since the arrival of [[Centralized traffic control|CTC]] signaling in the Fifties, is now entirely single track.<ref>Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad (2009) Kenneth C. Springirth Fonthill Media</ref>\n\nThe B&LE operated a line from Queen Junction (near Butler, PA) to [[Brady's Bend, PA]]. It was known as the Western Allegheny Division, and it was known as the last line that the B&LE's F-Units ran on. F-unit service on the line ended in 1992, and the last train, which was pulled by [[EMD SD-9]] ran in November of 1994. The line sat out of service until 2000, when it was abandoned. The tracks were removed in 2002, and today, the right of way is barely visible.\n\nThere was originally one [[tunnel]] on the B&LE mainline at Culmerville, but it was dug out or \"daylighted\" in 1922, converting it to an open cut through a hill.\n\nAs it approaches Bessemer, the B&LE is also noticeable where it crosses the [[Allegheny River]] on the {{convert| 2327|ft}} [[Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad Bridge]] immediately east of and parallel to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].\n\n==Locomotives==\n[[File:B&LESD38AC869.jpg|thumb|Bessemer & Lake Erie SD38AC #869.]]\nIn the steam era, B&LE had a fleet of 2-8-0 \"Consolidation\" types, classes C1 through C4; 2-10-2 \"Santa Fe\" types, classes D1 and D2; and 2-10-4 \"Texas\" type locomotives, class H1.

Bessemer and Lake Erie's locomotives, especially the SD40T-3 \"Tunnel Motors,\" have been scattered across the CN system in the mid-late 2000s with the majority leaving the B&LE Property in March, 2015. Many of these SD40T-3s are being used on the line that feeds most of B&LE's traffic, the former Duluth, Missabe, and Iron Range Railroad in Minnesota. The iron ore that originates on these lines is transloaded to ships at Two Harbors, Minnesota; then sent by ship to Conneaut, Ohio, where it is again transloaded to B&LE trains. It is then taken down to steel mills in the Pittsburgh area, mainly to the blast furnaces at US Steel's Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania, part of the Mon Valley Works. Since 2015, IC SD70s have been the most common power with SD60 5422 also commonly being spotted on the main iron ore power set. B&LE Tunnel Motor 905 and a few SD38's, still in B&LE orange, are being kept on the line for use in P&C docks and on locals with one of them making a rare appearance on the ore line at times.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Portal|Railways}}\nTrain Pictures by Charles B.

On the return trip, Pennsylvania [[coal]] was hauled north to Conneaut Harbor. The company was created largely out of a series of small predecessor companies including the [[Pittsburgh, Shenango and Lake Erie Railroad]], and the Butler and Pittsburgh Railroad Company.  The company was renamed the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad in 1900. Carnegie Steel had an exclusive 99-year lease to the PS&LE.

He adopted the stage name \"Joseph Estrada\", as his mother objected to his chosen career and his decision to quit schooling multiple times.

Singson's allegation caused controversy across the nation, which culminated in the House of Representatives' filing of an impeachment case against Estrada on November 13, 2000. House Speaker [[Manny Villar]] fast-tracked the impeachment complaint. The impeachment suit was brought to the Senate and an impeachment court was formed, with Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] as presiding officer. Estrada pleaded \"not guilty\".\n\nThis was the first time the Filipino public witnessed, through radio and television, an elected president stand in trial and face possible impeachment with full media coverage. During the trial, the prosecution presented witnesses and alleged pieces of evidence to the impeachment court regarding Estrada's alleged involvement in jueteng. The existence of secret bank accounts which he allegedly uses for receiving payoffs was also brought to the fore.\n\nIn the 2004 Global Transparency Report, Estrada made into the list of the World's All-Time Most Corrupt Leaders in the World. He was listed tenth and he was said to have amassed between $78&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |title=World's Ten Most Corrupt Leaders1 |publisher=Infoplease.com Source: Transparency International Global Corruption Report 2004. |accessdate=August 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726142725/http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |archive-date=July 26, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report |publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=August 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327002359/http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Also making it to the list from the [[Philippines]] is [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who ended up second in the list as he was said to have embezzled between $5&nbsp;billion to $10&nbsp;billion during his 21 years as President from 1965 to 1986.\n\n=== EDSA II ===\n{{Main|EDSA Revolution of 2001}}\n\n==== Protests ====\nOn the evening of January 16, 2001, the impeachment court voted not to open an envelope that allegedly contained incriminating evidence against Estrada simply because it was not part of the impeachment complaint. The final vote was 11\u201310, in favor of keeping the envelope closed. The prosecution panel (of congressmen and lawyers) walked out of the impeachment court in protest of this vote. The 11 senators who voted not to open the envelope are known as the \"Craven Eleven\". That night, anti-Estrada protesters gathered in front of the [[Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish|EDSA Shrine]] at [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]], not too far away from the site of the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nOn January 19, 2001, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff [[Angelo Reyes]], seeing the political upheaval throughout the country, decided to \"withdraw his support\" of the president and pay his allegiance to the vice president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\n==== Resignation ====\nThe following day, the Supreme Court declared the presidency vacant, saying that Estrada had resigned the office. At noon, the Chief Justice swore in Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as president of the Philippines. Before Estrada's departure from [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace|Malaca\u00f1ang]], he issued the following press release:\n\n{{cquote|At twelve o'clock noon today, Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took her oath as President of the Republic of the Philippines.

He maintained that he never resigned, implying that Arroyo's government was illegitimate.\n\nThe new government created a special court and charged him with plunder and had him arrested in April. His supporters marched to the [[Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish|EDSA Shrine]] demanding Estrada's release and his reinstatement as president but were dispersed by high-grade teargas and warning shots from automatic rifles. On the morning of May 1, the protesters marched straight to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]]. Violence erupted and the government declared a [[State of Rebellion]]. Many Filipino protesters were badly injured and arrested, including politicians. The government called out the military and was able to quell the demonstration with teargas and automatic rifles. The bloody uprising came to be known as [[EDSA III]].\n\nEstrada was initially detained at the Veterans' Memorial Medical Center in [[Quezon City]] and then transferred to a military facility in [[Tanay, Rizal]], but he was later transferred to a nearby vacation home, virtually in house arrest. Under Philippine law, plunder had the maximum penalty of death; however the death penalty was eventually repealed.\n\n=== Trial ===\n{{Main|Trial of Joseph Estrada}}\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan finally gave its decision, finding Estrada not guilty on his perjury case but guilty of plunder \"beyond reasonable doubt\".

He belonged to a wealthy family, and was the eighth of ten children of Emilio Ejercito Sr. (1898\u20131977) and his wife, Maria Marcelo (1905\u20132009). After graduating from the Ateneo elementary school in 1951, he was expelled during his second year of secondary studies at the Ateneo High School for disciplinary conduct. Later during college he enrolled in a Bachelor of Sciencs in Civil Engineering course at the Map\u00faa Institute of Technology in an effort to please his father. However, he would leave once again and later transferred to Central Colleges of the Philippines College of Engineering but dropped out.\n\nIn his twenties, he began a career as a drama actor, usually playing the role of the villain/antagonist. He adopted the stage name \"Joseph Estrada\", as his mother objected to his chosen career and his decision to quit schooling multiple times.

The MILF leader Hashim Salamat fled to [[Malaysia]]. The MILF later declared a [[Jihad]] on the government. On July 10 of the same year, the President went to Minadanao and raised the Philippine flag symbolizing victory. After the war the President said, \"...&nbsp;will speed up government efforts to bring genuine and lasting peace and development in Mindanao\". In the middle of July the president ordered the military to arrest top MILF leaders.<ref name=\"peopledaily1\">{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200007/10/eng20000710_45067.html |title=Philippine Military Takes Moro Headquarters |website=People's Daily |date=July 10, 2000 |accessdate=March 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813104359/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200007/10/eng20000710_45067.html |archive-date=August 13, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nIn his [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|state of the nation address]], popularly called \"SONA\", the president highlighted his vision for Mindanao:\n* The first is to restore and maintain peace in Mindanao\u2014because without peace, there can be no development.\n* The second is to develop Mindanao\u2014because without development, there can be no peace.\n* The third is to continue seeking peace talks with the MILF within the framework of the Constitution\u2014because a peace agreed upon in good faith is preferable to a peace enforced by force of arms.\n* And the fourth is to continue with the implementation of the peace agreement between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF\u2014because that is our commitment to our countrymen and to the international community.\n\nIn addition to this the president said his administration can move with more speed in transforming Mindanao into a progressive economic center.<ref name=\"peopledaily1\" /> High on the list of priorities was the plight of MILF guerrillas who were tired of fighting and had no camps left to which to report.

Singson's allegation caused controversy across the nation, which culminated in the House of Representatives' filing of an impeachment case against Estrada on November 13, 2000. House Speaker [[Manny Villar]] fast-tracked the impeachment complaint. The impeachment suit was brought to the Senate and an impeachment court was formed, with Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] as presiding officer. Estrada pleaded \"not guilty\".\n\nThis was the first time the Filipino public witnessed, through radio and television, an elected president stand in trial and face possible impeachment with full media coverage. During the trial, the prosecution presented witnesses and alleged pieces of evidence to the impeachment court regarding Estrada's alleged involvement in jueteng. The existence of secret bank accounts which he allegedly uses for receiving payoffs was also brought to the fore.\n\nIn the 2004 Global Transparency Report, Estrada made into the list of the World's All-Time Most Corrupt Leaders in the World. He was listed tenth and he was said to have amassed between $78&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |title=World's Ten Most Corrupt Leaders1 |publisher=Infoplease.com Source: Transparency International Global Corruption Report 2004. |accessdate=August 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726142725/http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |archive-date=July 26, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report |publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=August 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327002359/http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Also making it to the list from the [[Philippines]] is [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who ended up second in the list as he was said to have embezzled between $5&nbsp;billion to $10&nbsp;billion during his 21 years as President from 1965 to 1986.\n\n=== EDSA II ===\n{{Main|EDSA Revolution of 2001}}\n\n==== Protests ====\nOn the evening of January 16, 2001, the impeachment court voted not to open an envelope that allegedly contained incriminating evidence against Estrada simply because it was not part of the impeachment complaint. The final vote was 11\u201310, in favor of keeping the envelope closed. The prosecution panel (of congressmen and lawyers) walked out of the impeachment court in protest of this vote. The 11 senators who voted not to open the envelope are known as the \"Craven Eleven\". That night, anti-Estrada protesters gathered in front of the [[Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish|EDSA Shrine]] at [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]], not too far away from the site of the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nOn January 19, 2001, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff [[Angelo Reyes]], seeing the political upheaval throughout the country, decided to \"withdraw his support\" of the president and pay his allegiance to the vice president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\n==== Resignation ====\nThe following day, the Supreme Court declared the presidency vacant, saying that Estrada had resigned the office. At noon, the Chief Justice swore in Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as president of the Philippines. Before Estrada's departure from [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace|Malaca\u00f1ang]], he issued the following press release:\n\n{{cquote|At twelve o'clock noon today, Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took her oath as President of the Republic of the Philippines.

He maintained that he never resigned, implying that Arroyo's government was illegitimate.\n\nThe new government created a special court and charged him with plunder and had him arrested in April. His supporters marched to the [[Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish|EDSA Shrine]] demanding Estrada's release and his reinstatement as president but were dispersed by high-grade teargas and warning shots from automatic rifles. On the morning of May 1, the protesters marched straight to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]]. Violence erupted and the government declared a [[State of Rebellion]]. Many Filipino protesters were badly injured and arrested, including politicians. The government called out the military and was able to quell the demonstration with teargas and automatic rifles. The bloody uprising came to be known as [[EDSA III]].\n\nEstrada was initially detained at the Veterans' Memorial Medical Center in [[Quezon City]] and then transferred to a military facility in [[Tanay, Rizal]], but he was later transferred to a nearby vacation home, virtually in house arrest. Under Philippine law, plunder had the maximum penalty of death; however the death penalty was eventually repealed.\n\n=== Trial ===\n{{Main|Trial of Joseph Estrada}}\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan finally gave its decision, finding Estrada not guilty on his perjury case but guilty of plunder \"beyond reasonable doubt\".

A more recent candidate is [[Paliki]], which may have been an island separated from the rest of [[Kefalonia]], as argued by Bittlestone, Diggle and Underhill in [[Odysseus Unbound]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Green|first=Peter|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2006/11/30/finding-ithaca/|title=Finding Ithaca|date=2006-11-30|access-date=2020-03-26|language=en|issn=0028-7504}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/May-2018/Ithaca-the-story-continues|title=The Geological Society of London - Ithaca the story continues|last=Underhill|first=John|last2=Styles|first2=Peter|date=2018-05-01|website=www.geolsoc.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27|last3=Pavlopoulos|first3=Kosmas|last4=Apostolopoulos|first4=George}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/odysseys-end-the-search-for-ancient-ithaca-112739669/|title=Odyssey's End?: The Search for Ancient Ithaca|last=Bordewich|first=Fergus M.|date=April 2006|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nThe central characters of the epic such as [[Odysseus]], [[Achilles]], [[Agamemnon]] and [[Hector]] are generally believed to be fictional characters.{{Citation needed}} Yet there are many claims that some Homeric hero long ago had inhabited a particular contemporary region or village.  This, and the extremely detailed geographic descriptions in the epic itself, have invited investigation of the possibility that Homer's heroes might have existed and that the location of the sites described therein might be found.\n\n[[Heinrich Schliemann]] believed he tracked down several of the more famous traditions surrounding these heroes.  Many locations around the [[Mediterranean]] were claimed to have been the heroes' \"homes\", such as the ruins at [[Mycenae]] and the little hill near the western Turkish town of [[Hissarlik]].  Schliemann's work and excavations proposed, to a very sceptical world, that Homer's [[Agamemnon]] had lived at [[Mycenae]], and that \"Troy\" itself indeed had existed at Hisarlik. Much work has been done to identify other Homeric sites such as the palace of [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] at [[Pylos]].  These attempts have been the subject of much scholarly research, archaeological work, and controversy.\n\nTheories on the location of \"Homer's 'Ithaca'\" were formulated as early as the 2nd century BC to as recently as AD 2005.  Each approach to identifying a location has been different, varying in degrees of scientific procedure, empirical investigation, informed hypothesis, wishful thinking, fervent belief, and sheer fantasy. Each investigator and each investigation merits interest, as an indicator both of the temper of the times in which a particular theory was developed, and of the perennial interest in Odysseus and the possible facts of his life. Some of the latest \"Homer's 'Ithaca'\" approaches resemble some of the earliest.\n\n== Leading precursors ==\n\nTheorists, and excavations elsewhere, on the location of \"Homer's 'Ithaca'\"\n\n* [[Eratosthenes]] (276 BC &ndash; 194 BC).\n* Demetrius of Scepsis (near Troy) -- writing mid-2nd century BC (near Troy) -- source used by [[Strabo]] (below).\n**{{cite book | first= R. | last= Pfeiffer | authorlink= | year= 1968 | title= History of Classical Scholarship: From the Beginnings to the End of the Hellenistic Age | edition= | publisher= Oxford University Press | location= Oxford | id= }} pp.&nbsp;249\u201351.

In accordance with the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand]], the [[Senate]] is a [[non-partisan]] legislative chamber, composed of 250 members. All 250 Senators are appointed by the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|Royal Thai Military]]. The Senate operates under fixed terms of six years.\n\nBoth the Senate and the [[House of Representatives (Thailand)|House of Representatives]] were abolished as a result of the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]]. These were replaced with the [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Legislative Assembly of Thailand (2014)|National Legislative Assembly]], a body of 250 members, selected by the [[National Council for Peace and Order]].

For the first time, an [[upper house]] came into existence in Thailand. The Senate was to be fully elected, however, the elections would be indirect, as the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]] would elect the senators, for six-year terms. The 1946 Constitution was soon abrogated in a military coup. Subsequent constitutions saw only occasional bicameralism, and when it did exist, the Senate was always filled with appointees from the military and the elite. The 1997 Constitution saw a return to a fully elected Senate. That constitution was abrogated after the [[2006 Thailand coup|2006 coup]], and replaced with one calling for a half-elected/half-appointed Senate.\n\n* 1947 \u2013 First Thai Senate established with 100 members, all royally appointed.\n* 1952 \u2013 Establishment of a [[unicameral]] National Assembly with 123 members.\n* 1968 \u2013 Re-establishment of the Senate with 164 royally-appointed members.\n* 1972 - The Thai Legislature is banned by [[Thanom Kittikachorn]].\n* 1974 \u2013 Return of the royally-appointed Senate.\n* 1976 \u2013 Re-establishment of a [[unicameral]] National Assembly with 360 members, all royally appointed.\n* 1978 \u2013 Return of a Senate with 225 royally-appointed members.\n* 1991 \u2013 Establishment of a unicameral National Assembly with 292 royally-appointed members.\n* 1997 \u2013 Establishment for the first time of a fully and directly elected Senate with 200 members for a 6-year term.\n* 2006 \u2013 Following the [[September 2006 Thailand coup|military coup]], an interim charter was signed establishing a 250-member National Legislative Assembly.\n* 2007 \u2013 Half of the Senate is appointed, half is elected as established by referendum under the [[2007 constitution of Thailand|2007 Constitution]]. \n* 2014 \u2013 Following the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]], an interim constitution was passed establishing a 220-member National Legislative Assembly.\n* 2018 \u2013 After the signing of the [[Constitution of Thailand#2017 Constitution|2017 Constitution]], the National Assembly was reestablished and the NLA was dissolved, with the Senate to be composed of 250 military-appointed members following the [[2019 Thai general election|2019 general elections]].\n\n==Qualifications==\nThe qualifications for the membership of the Senate could be found in section 115, Part 3, Chapter 6 of the 2007 Constitution. A candidate intent on being a member of the Senate had to be a [[Natural-born citizen|natural born citizen]] of [[Thailand]] as well as being 40 years or older on the year of election or selection. The candidate must have graduated with at least a [[bachelor's degree]] or an equivalent. If the candidate was to be elected, he or she must have been born, must have had a home and had to be registered to vote in the province which the candidate intended to represent. The candidate must not have been an ascendant, spouse or a child of a member of the House of Representatives or any person holding a political position and must not have been a member of a [[List of political parties in Thailand|political party]] for at least five years.\n\nAll other disqualifications were similar to that of the House, the individual must not have been: addicted to drugs, been [[bankrupt]], a convicted felon, a member of a local administration, a [[Civil service|civil servant]], a member of the judiciary or any other government agency. Being disenfranchised (being a member of the [[clergy]], [[felony|felon]], or mentally infirm). If the candidate was a member of a local administration or a [[Cabinet of Thailand|Minister]] he must have left his post for a period of at least five years before being eligible.\n\n==Appointment==\nDepending on the situation in each constitution.<ref name=\"BP-20190128\" />\n==Term==\nThe term of the Senate is six years. The term is fixed; therefore, the Senate can not be dissolved under any circumstances and would be re-elected in accordance with a [[Royal Decree]] issued thirty days after the expiration of the term.\n\n==Membership==\nMembers of the Senate are entitled use the title ''Senator'' in front of their names ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e01\u0e27\u0e38\u0e12\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32 or \u0e2a.\u0e27.)}}. Membership of an elected Senator began on the senate election day, while an appointed senator became a member after the publication of the election result by the [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Electoral Commission]]. Senators could not hold more than one consecutive term, therefore senators could not be re-elected. A Senator whose membership expired before a new Senator could be named continued his or her duties until such seats were occupied. If there was a vacancy the seat was immediately filled either by election or appointment.\n\n==Powers ==\nThe Senate shares many powers with the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]]; these include:\n\n*Legislation\n*Scrutiny\n*Passing of annual Appropriations Bills\n*Constitutional Amendments\n\nExclusive Powers:\n\n*Creating and appointing committee to examine and investigate affairs.\n*Passing approval resolutions advising the King in certain appointments.\n**Judges of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand]]\n**[[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commissioners]]\n**[[Office of the Ombudsman (Thailand)|Ombudsmen]]\n**Members of the [[National Anti-Corruption Commission (Thailand)|National Anti-Corruption Commission]], [[State Audit Commission (Thailand)|State Audit Commission]] (including the Auditor General) and [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]].\n*The Senate also advised the selection and the actual selection of certain members of the [[Judiciary of Thailand|Judiciary]].\n*Selection of its Officers.\n*Expulsion of members.\n*Determination of its own rules and procedures.\n\n==Leadership==\n{{See also|List of Presidents of the Senate of Thailand}}\nThe Senate elected three presiding officers; one [[President (government title)|President]] and two [[Vice President]]s.

In accordance with the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand]], the [[Senate]] is a [[non-partisan]] legislative chamber, composed of 250 members. All 250 Senators are appointed by the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|Royal Thai Military]]. The Senate operates under fixed terms of six years.\n\nBoth the Senate and the [[House of Representatives (Thailand)|House of Representatives]] were abolished as a result of the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]]. These were replaced with the [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Legislative Assembly of Thailand (2014)|National Legislative Assembly]], a body of 250 members, selected by the [[National Council for Peace and Order]]. However, the new 2017 constitution, which was approved by a referendum in 2016, re-established the Senate.

For the first time, an [[upper house]] came into existence in Thailand. The Senate was to be fully elected, however, the elections would be indirect, as the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]] would elect the senators, for six-year terms. The 1946 Constitution was soon abrogated in a military coup. Subsequent constitutions saw only occasional bicameralism, and when it did exist, the Senate was always filled with appointees from the military and the elite. The 1997 Constitution saw a return to a fully elected Senate. That constitution was abrogated after the [[2006 Thailand coup|2006 coup]], and replaced with one calling for a half-elected/half-appointed Senate.\n\n* 1947 \u2013 First Thai Senate established with 100 members, all royally appointed.\n* 1952 \u2013 Establishment of a [[unicameral]] National Assembly with 123 members.\n* 1968 \u2013 Re-establishment of the Senate with 164 royally-appointed members.\n* 1972 - The Thai Legislature is banned by [[Thanom Kittikachorn]].\n* 1974 \u2013 Return of the royally-appointed Senate.\n* 1976 \u2013 Re-establishment of a [[unicameral]] National Assembly with 360 members, all royally appointed.\n* 1978 \u2013 Return of a Senate with 225 royally-appointed members.\n* 1991 \u2013 Establishment of a unicameral National Assembly with 292 royally-appointed members.\n* 1997 \u2013 Establishment for the first time of a fully and directly elected Senate with 200 members for a 6-year term.\n* 2006 \u2013 Following the [[September 2006 Thailand coup|military coup]], an interim charter was signed establishing a 250-member National Legislative Assembly.\n* 2007 \u2013 Half of the Senate is appointed, half is elected as established by referendum under the [[2007 constitution of Thailand|2007 Constitution]]. \n* 2014 \u2013 Following the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]], an interim constitution was passed establishing a 220-member National Legislative Assembly.\n* 2018 \u2013 After the signing of the [[Constitution of Thailand#2017 Constitution|2017 Constitution]], the National Assembly was reestablished and the NLA was dissolved, with the Senate to be composed of 250 military-appointed members following the [[2019 Thai general election|2019 general elections]].\n\n==Qualifications==\nThe qualifications for the membership of the Senate could be found in section 115, Part 3, Chapter 6 of the 2007 Constitution.

Membership of an elected Senator began on the senate election day, while an appointed senator became a member after the publication of the election result by the [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Electoral Commission]]. Senators could not hold more than one consecutive term, therefore senators could not be re-elected. A Senator whose membership expired before a new Senator could be named continued his or her duties until such seats were occupied. If there was a vacancy the seat was immediately filled either by election or appointment.\n\n==Powers ==\nThe Senate shares many powers with the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]]; these include:\n\n*Legislation\n*Scrutiny\n*Passing of annual Appropriations Bills\n*Constitutional Amendments\n\nExclusive Powers:\n\n*Creating and appointing committee to examine and investigate affairs.\n*Passing approval resolutions advising the King in certain appointments.\n**Judges of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand]]\n**[[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commissioners]]\n**[[Office of the Ombudsman (Thailand)|Ombudsmen]]\n**Members of the [[National Anti-Corruption Commission (Thailand)|National Anti-Corruption Commission]], [[State Audit Commission (Thailand)|State Audit Commission]] (including the Auditor General) and [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]].\n*The Senate also advised the selection and the actual selection of certain members of the [[Judiciary of Thailand|Judiciary]].\n*Selection of its Officers.\n*Expulsion of members.\n*Determination of its own rules and procedures.\n\n==Leadership==\n{{See also|List of Presidents of the Senate of Thailand}}\nThe Senate elected three presiding officers; one [[President (government title)|President]] and two [[Vice President]]s.
