They then picked the best-performing stocks and used them to create bogus \"baskets\" of stocks as the basis for false trading records, which Madoff claimed were generated from his supposed \"[[collar (finance)|split-strike conversion]]\" strategy, in which he bought blue-chip stocks and took options contracts on them.

On occasion, they slipped up and dated trades as taking place on weekends and federal holidays, though this was never caught.<ref name=MadoffChronicles/>\n\nOver the years, Madoff admonished his investors to keep quiet about their relationship with him. This was because he was well aware of the finite limits that existed for a legitimate split-strike conversion.

The style was most prominently used in the construction of cathedrals. Its defining features are [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]], [[rib vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, and an extensive use of [[stained glass]]. Combined, these features allowed the creation of buildings of unprecedented height and grandeur, filled with light from large stained glass windows. Important examples include [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Salisbury Cathedral]].  The English Gothic style endured in England until the early sixteenth century \u2013 much longer than in Continental Europe. It was succeeded by [[Tudor architecture]] and [[Renaissance architecture]].  \n\nThe Gothic style was introduced from France, where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] of the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]] north of Paris, completed in 1094.<ref name=HF>{{cite book |last1=Honour |first1=Hugh |author-link1=Hugh Honour |last2=Fleming |first2=John |author-link2=John Fleming (art historian) |date=2009 |title=A World History of Art |edition=7th |location=London |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |isbn=9781856695848 |page=376}}</ref> The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England were [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]].  Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from [[Romanesque architecture]] (often known in England as [[Norman architecture]]).  Other features were imported from the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]], had been built in 1135\u20131164.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mignon |first=Olivier |date=2015 |title=Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques |location= |publisher= |pages=10\u201311 |isbn=}}</ref>  After a fire destroyed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174, the French architect [[William of Sens]] rebuilt the choir in the new Gothic style between 1175 and 1180.  \n\nThe transition can also be seen at [[Durham Cathedral]], a Norman building which was remodeled with the earliest [[rib vault]] known. Besides cathedrals, the style appeared in university buildings,  [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[great house]]s, and many smaller secular buildings, including [[almshouse]]s and [[parish church]]es.\n\nHistorians traditionally divide English Gothic into three periods: [[Early English (architecture)|Early English]] (c. 1180\u20131275),  [[Decorated Gothic]] (c. 1275\u20131380), and [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520).<ref>This scheme uses the labels coined by the antiquary [[Thomas Rickman]] in his ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315).</ref>  The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals, abbey churches and collegiate buildings.  With the exception of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], English cathedrals show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years.\n<!---\n==Background== \n===Historical=== \n*Edward the Confessor fostered monasticism and founds Westminster Abbey\n*1066 and all that.

(A. Freeman Smith (1922), ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages''. pp. 35\u201345.)</ref>  It succeeded [[Norman Architecture]], which had introduced early great cathedrals, built of stone instead of timber, and saw the construction of remarkable abbeys throughout England. The Normans had introduced the three classical orders of architecture, and created massive walls for their buildings, with thin pilaster-like buttresses. The transition from Norman to Gothic lasted from about 1145 until 1190. in the reigns of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and [[Richard I]]. The style changed from the more massive severe Norman style to the more delicate and refined Gothic.<ref>A. Freeman Smith (1922), ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'', pp. 35\u201345.</ref>  \n\nEarly English Gothic was particularly influenced by what was called in English \"The French style\". The style was imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also imported cut stones from Normandy for their construction.  It was also influenced by the architecture of the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]] had been constructed.  The nave of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], one of the first early English Gothic structures in England, was rebuilt in the new style by a French architect, [William of Sens]]. \n\nThe Early English style particularly featured more strongly-constructed walls with stone vaulted roofs, to resist fire. The weight of these vaults was carried downwards and outwards by arched ribs. This feature, the early [[rib vault]], was used at [[Durham Cathedral]], the first time it was used this way in Europe. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnother important innovation introduced in this early period was the [[buttress]], a stone column outside the structure which reinforced the walls against the weight pressing outward and downward from the vaults.  This evolved into the [[flying buttress]], which carried the thrust from the from the wall of the nave over the roof of the aisle. The buttress was given further support by a heavy stone pinnacle. Butressses were an early feature of the chapter house of [[Lichfield Cathedral]].<ref>A. Freeman Smith (1922), ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'', pp. 35\u201345.</ref>  \n\nAnother innovation introduced in early English Gothic was the [[Lancet window]], a tall narrow window with a pointed arch on top.  They were grouped together side by side under a single arch and decorated with mullions in tracery patterns, such as ''cusps'', or spear-points.  Lancet windows were combined similarly pointed arches and the ribs of the vaults overhead, giving a harmonious and unified style.  The first English Cathedral tbe be built entirely in the Gothic style was [[Wells Cathedral]].   By 1175, with the completion of the Choir at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]], the style was firmly established in England.\n\n===Characteristics  ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] rebuilt by [[William of Sens]] (1174\u20131184)\nFile:Wells cathedral nave clerestory.JPG|The three levels of the nave of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1176\u20131450), the first in England to use the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] exclusively in the ceiling vaults, the windows of the [[clerestory]] and arcades of the [[triforium]], and the arcades on the ground floor. \nFile:Lincoln Cathedral, Dean's Eye window (N.31) (21975539699).jpg|The Dean's Eye Window, a rare English [[rose window]], at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220\u20131235)\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Detail Bosses.jpg|Early four-part [[rib vault]]s at [[Salisbury Cathedral]], with a simple carved stone [[boss (architecture)|boss]] at the meeting point of the ribs (1220\u20131258)\nFile:Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG|Lancet windows in the north transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131258)\n</gallery>\n\n* The '''vertical plan''' of  early Gothic Cathedrals had three levels, each of about equal height;  the [[clerestory]], with arched windows which admitted light on top, under the roof vaults;  the [[triforium]] a wider covered arcade, in the middle; and, on the ground floor, on either side of the [[nave]], wide arcades of columns and pillars, which supported the weight of the ceiling vaults through the ribs.\n* The most distinctive element of this period was the '''[[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]''', (also known as the [[lancet arch]], which was the key feature of the Gothic [[rib vault]],   The original purpose of rib vault was to allow a heavier stone ceiling, to replace the wooden roofs of the earlier Norman churches, which frequently caught fire.   They also had the benefit of allowing the construction of higher and thinner walls.   They appeared first in an early form in [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Gradually, pointed arches were used not only for rib vaults, but also for all of the arcades and for [[lancet windows]]s,  giving the nave its unified appearance. The first structure in England to be built entirely with the pointed arch was [[Wells Cathedral]] (1175-1260), but they were soon used in all Cathedrals.<ref>Bechmann (2017), p. 295</ref>  \n* The Early English '''[[rib vault]]s''' were usually quadripartite, each having four compartments divided by ribs, , with each covering one bay of the ceiling.  The horizontal ridge ribs intersected the summits of the cross ribs and diagonal ribs, and carried the weight outwards and downwards to pillars or columns of the triforium and arcades, and, in later cathedrals, outside the walls to the buttresses. <ref>A. Freeman Smith (1922), pp. 71\u201373.</ref>\n* The '''[[lancet window]]''', narrow and tall with a point at the top, became a common feature of English architecture.   For this reason Early English Gothic is sometimes known as the Lancet style.  The Lancet openings of windows and decorative arcading are often grouped in twos or threes. This characteristic is seen throughout [[Salisbury Cathedral]], where groups of two lancet windows line the nave and groups of three line the clerestory. At [[York Minster]] the north transept has a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters; each is 50 feet tall and still retains its original glass.\n* [[Stained glass]] windows began to be widely used in the windows of the [[clerestory]], [[transept]] and especially west facade.   Many were elaborately decorated with [[tracery]]; that is, thin [[mullions]] or ribs of stone which divided the windows into elaborate geometric patterns.   as at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220). \n* '''[[Rose window |Rose Windows]]''' were relatively rare in England, but [[Lincoln Cathedral]] has two notable examples from this period. The oldest is the Dean's Window in the north transept, which dates to 1220-1235. It is an example of an Early English plate-tracery rose window. The geometric design, with concentric tiers of circular window lights, predates the geometric tracery of the later decorated style of Gothic architecture.  The principal theme of the window is the second coming of Christ and the last judgement. Some scenes are associated with death and resurrection, such as the funeral of Saint Hugh, the founder of the Cathedral, and the death of the Virgin. <ref> [http://www.lincolncathedral.com/ Lincoln Cathedral Official Website]</ref>\n* '''Sculptural  decoration'''. Unlike the more somber and heavy Norman churches, the Gothic churches began to have  elaborate sculptural decoration. The arches of the arcades and triforium were sometimes decorated with dog tooth patterns, cusps, carved circles, and with [[trefoil]]s, [[quatrefoil]]s, as well as floral and vegetal designs. Simple floral motifs also often appeared on the capitals, the [[spandrels]], the [[roof boss]] that joined the ribs of the vaults.<ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n* The '''clustered column'''. Instead of being massive, solid pillars, early Gothic columns were often composed of clusters of slender, detached shafts, which descended the vaults above.  These were often made of dark, polished [[Purbeck Marble|Purbeck \"marble\"]], surrounding a central pillar, or [[pier (architecture)|pier]], to which they are attached by circular moulded shaft-rings. One characteristic of Early Gothic in England is the great depth given to the hollows of the [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]] with alternating fillets and rolls, and by the decoration of the hollows with the dog-tooth [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] and by the circular [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] or tops of the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns.<ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n===Notable Early Gothic structures===\n* [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1185\u20131311)\n* Nave and transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], without tower (1220\u20131258)\n* Transept of [[Westminster Abbey]]\n* [[Whitby Abbey]] \n* [[Rievaulx Abbey]]\n* The Galilee Porch of [[Ely Cathedral]]\n* Nave and transept of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1225\u20131240)\n* West front of [[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n* South transept of [[York Cathedral]]\n\n{{anchor|Decorated Gothic|Geometric Decorated}}\n==Decorated Gothic (mid 13th to mid 14th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nYork Minster - panoramio - PJMarriott (1).jpg|The west facade of [[York Minster]] (1338), showing the elaborate [[tracery]] in the main window.\nFile:Ely Cathedral Choir, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The choir of [[Ely Cathedral]], rebuilt in Decorated Gothic beginning in 1321\n</gallery>\n\nThe second period of English Gothic architecture is generally termed '''Decorated Gothic''', because the amount of ornament and decoration increased dramatically.  It was a period of growing prosperity in England, and this was expressed in the decoration of Cathedrals.  Almost every feature of the interiors and facades was decorated.\n\nHistorians sometimes subdivide this style into two periods, based on the predominant motifs of the designs.   The first, the '''Geometric''' style, lasted (about 1245 or 50 until 1315 or 1360), where ornament tended to be based on straight lines, cubes and circles, followed by the '''Curvilinear''' style (from about 1290 or 1315 until 1350 or 1360)  which used gracefully curving lines.  <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 45-47 </ref>\n\nAdditions in the Decorated style were often added to earlier cathedrals.  One striking example is found at [[Ely Cathedral]], The architect [[Thomas Witney]] built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in Decorated style. Soon afterwards another architect, William Joy, added curving arches to strengthen the structure, and made further extensions to join the Lady Chapel to the Choir. In 1329-45 he created an extraordinary double arch in the decorated style. <ref>|Harvey (1987), pg.163</ref> \n\n===Characteristics===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ely Cathedral Lady Chapel, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]] of the Lady Chapel of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral Vaulted Ceiling.jpg|Lierne vault of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1351-1377)\nFile:The Cloisters at Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|[[Fan vault]]s in cloisters of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1373)\nFile:West porch Lichfield by Francis Frith.jpeg|Decorated ornament on the west porch of [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 002.jpg|[[Tracery]], [[diapering]] and sculptural decoration on [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\nFile:Chapter House, Lichfield Cathedral (exterior 5).JPG|Early buttresses, topped by pinnacles, at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:26-Ely-005.jpg|[[Pinnacles]] on the roof of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Carlisle Cathedral Tracery, Cumbria, UK - Diliff.jpg|East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], with curvilinear tracery (about 1350)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 010.jpg|Floral [[boss (architecture)|boss]] joining the ribs of the vaults of [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n</gallery>\n\n*  The '''[[Lierne (vault)|Lierne Vault]]''' .   [[Vault (architecture)|Vaulting]] became much more elaborate in this period. The  [[rib vault]] of earlier Early Gothic usually had just four compartments, with a minimum number of ribs which were all connected to the columns below, and all played a role in distributing the weight and outwards and downwards. In the Decorated architecture period, additional ribs were added to the vaulted ceilings which were purely decorative. They created very elaborate star patterns and other geometric designs.  [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Ely Cathedral]] have notable Lierne vaults from this period. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nThe [[buttress]] became more common in this period, as at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. These were stone columns outside the walls which supportsd them, allowing thinner and high walls between the buttresses, and larger windows. The buttresses wee often topped by ornamental stone pinnacles to give them greater weight.   \n\n* The '''[[Fan vault]]''', An even more eleborate form, appeared late in the Decorative.   Unlike the Lierne vault, the fan vault had no functional ribs; the visible \"ribs\" are mouldings on the masonry imitating ribs. The structure is composed of slabs of stone joined together into half-cones, whose vertices are the springers of the vault. The earliest example, from 1373, is found in the cloisters of  [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. It made a notable backdrop in some of the [[Harry Potter]] films. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n* '''[[Tracery]]'''. Decorated architecture is particularly characterised by the elaborate [[tracery]]  within the stained glass windows. The elaborate windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel [[mullion]]s (vertical bars of stone), usually up to the level at which the arched top of the window begins. The mullions then branch out and cross, intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called [[tracery]], typically including [[trefoil]]s and [[quatrefoil]]s. The style was [[Geometry|geometrical]] at first and [[curvilinear]], or curving and serpentine, in the later period,  This curvilinear element was introduced in the first quarter of the 14th century and lasted about fifty years.<ref name=\"EB1911DP\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Decorated Period|volume=7|page=915|first=Richard Phen\u00e9|last=Spiers|authorlink=Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers}}</ref>. A notable example of the curvilinear style is the East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], (about 1350).\n\n* '''Sculpture''' also became more ornate and decorative. The [[ball flower]] and a four-leaved flower motif took the place of the earlier [[dog-tooth]]. The foliage in the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] was less conventional than in Early English and more flowing, Another decorative feature of the period was [[diapering]], or creating multicolour geometric patterns on walls or panels made with different colours of stone or brick.  <ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n===Notable examples===\n*[[Lincoln Cathedral]] (west facade and Angel Choir)\n*[[Carlisle Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[York Minster]] (West facade) \n*[[Lichfield Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n*[[Ely Cathedral]] (Portions including Galilee porch, lady chapel and choir (1322-28)\n*[[Melrose Abbey]] (The Lady Chapel) [[Scotland]],<ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Perpendicular Gothic}}\n==Perpendicular Gothic  (late 13th to mid 16th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The interior of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] conveys an impression of a \"cage\" of stone and glass, typical of Perpendicular architecture.

A notable early example is the  [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], built by the royal architect [[William Ramsey (architect)|William Ramsey]] in 1332. <ref> John Harvey (historian)|Harvey]] (1978) puts the earliest example of a fully formed Perpendicular style at the [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], in 1332 </ref>  The early style was also practiced by Ramsey and another royal architect,  [[John Sponlee]], and fully developed in the works of [[Henry Yevele]] and [[William Wynford]].\n\nWalls were built much higher than in earlier periods, and stained glass windows became very large, so that the space around them was reduced to simple piers. Horizontal transoms sometimes had to be introduced to strengthen the vertical [[mullions]]. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 53-62</ref>  \n\nMany of the cathedrals and churches were built with magnificent towers ([[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[Worcester Cathedral]], and Boston Church (Lincolnshire), Wrexham Church, Taunton Church, and others. Other Notable examples include [[Kings College, Cambridge|Kings College Chapel, Cambridge]]  <ref name=\"harvey1978\">{{Cite book| title=The Perpendicular Style| first=John| last=Harvey| publisher=Batsford| year=1978}}</ref> \n\nThe interiors of Perpendicular churches were filled with lavish ornamental woodwork, including choir seats with lifting seats (''Misereres''), under which were grotesque carvings;; \"Poppy heads\", or carved figures in foliage on the ends of benches; and elaborate multicoloured decoration, usually in floral patterns, on panels or cornices called ''[[brattishing]]''. <ref>{Smith (1922) pp. 53-62 </ref>   The sinuous lines of the tracery in the Decorated style wee replaced by more geometric forms and [[perpendicular]] lines. <ref name=\"EB1911PP\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Perpendicular Period|volume=21|pages=179\u2013180|first=Richard Phen\u00e9|last=Spiers|authorlink=Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers}}</ref> \n\nThe style was also affected by the tragic history of the period, particuarly  [[Black Death]] which killed an estimated third of England's population in 18 months between June 1348 and December 1349 and returned in 1361\u201362 to kill another fifth. This had a great effect on the arts and culture, which took a more sober direction.<ref>This figure has recently been disputed and is now thought to be closer to 20%.

Gradually, near the end of the period, Renaissance forms began to appear in the English Gothic. A [[rood screen]], a Renaissance ornament, was installed in the chapel of [[King's College Chapel]], Cambridge.  During the [[Elizabethan Period]] (1558-1603), the classical details, including the five orders of classical architecture, were gradually introduced. Carved ornament with Italian Renaissance motifs began to be used in decoration, including on the tomb of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  The pointed arch gradually gave way to the Roman rounded arch, brick began to replace masonry, the roof construction was concealed, and the Gothic finally gave way to an imitation of Roman and Greek styles. <ref>Smith, A.

Important towers were built at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[York Minster]], [[Worcester Cathedral]], and on many smaller churches.  Decorative [[Battlements]] were a popular decoration of towers in smaller churches.  \n\n* '''Windows''' became very large, sometimes of immense size, with slimmer stone [[mullion]]s than in earlier periods, allowing greater scope for [[stained glass]] craftsmen. The mullions of the windows are carried vertically up into the [[arch]] moulding of the windows, and the upper portion is subdivided by additional mullions (supermullions) and [[transom (architectural)|transom]]s, forming rectangular compartments, known as panel tracery.   The [[Tudor Arch]] window was a particular feature of English Gothic. \n\n* '''[[Buttress]]es''' and wall surfaces were divided into vertical panels.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> \n\n* '''Doorways''' were frequently enclosed within a square head over the arch mouldings, the [[spandrel]]s being filled with [[quatrefoil]]s or tracery.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> Pointed arches were still used throughout the period, but [[ogee]] and four-centred [[Tudor arch]]es were also introduced.\n\n* Inside the church the [[triforium]] disappeared, or its place was filled with panelling, and greater importance was given to the [[clerestory]] windows, which often were the finest features in the churches of this period. The mouldings were  flatter than those of the earlier periods, and one of the chief characteristics is the introduction of large [[elliptical]] hollows.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/>\n\n* '''Flint architecture'''.

It had to be able to resist rain, snow and high winds of the English climate, and to preserve the integrity of the structure.  A pitched roof was a common feature of all the Gothic periods. During the Norman period, the roofs normally were pitched forty-five degrees, with the apex forming a right angle, which harmonised with the rounded arches of the gables.  With the arrival of the pointed [[rib vault]], the roofs became steeper, up to sixty degrees. In the late perpendicular period, the angle declined to twenty degrees or even less. The roofs were usually made of boards overlaid with tiles or sheet-lead, which was commonly used on low-pitched roofs. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>\n\nThe simpler Gothic roofs were supported by long [[rafter]]s of light wood, resting on wooden [[trusses]] set into the walls. The rafters were supported by more solid beams, called ''purlins'', which were carried at their ends by the roof [[truss]]es.  The ''tie-beam'' is the chief beam of the truss.  Later, the roof was supported by structures called a King-point-truss and Queen-post truss, where The principal rafters are connected with the tie beam by head of the truss. The King-Point truss has a vertical beam with connects the centre of the rafter to the ridge of the roof, supported by diagonal struts, while a  Queen-Post truss has a wooden collar below the pointed arch which united the posts and was supported by struts and cross-braces. A Queen-Post truss could span w width of forty feet. Both of these forms created greater stability, but the full weight of the roof still came down directly onto the walls. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71</ref> \n\nGothic architects did not like the roof truss systems, because the numerous horizontal beams crossing the nave obstructed  the view of the soaring height. They came up with an ingenious solution,  the [[Hammerbeam roof]].  In this system, the point  of the roof is supported by the collar and trusses, but from the collar curved beams reach well downward on the walls, and carry the weight downward and outwards, to the walls and buttresses, without obstructing the view.  The oldest existing roof of this kind is found in [[Winchester Cathedral]]. The most famous example of the   [[Hammerbeam roof]] is the roof of [[Westminster Hall]] (1395), the largest timber roof of its time, built for royal ceremonies such as the banquets following the coronation of the King.  Other notable wooden roofs included those of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and [[Crosby Hall, Liverpool|Crosby Hall]].  A similar system, with a arched trusses, was used in the roof of Wexham Cathedral.<ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>  \n\n\n<!---NOTE:Collected these pics to use in expansion of article.

The style was most prominently used in the construction of cathedrals. Its defining features are [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]], [[rib vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, and an extensive use of [[stained glass]]. Combined, these features allowed the creation of buildings of unprecedented height and grandeur, filled with light from large stained glass windows. Important examples include [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Salisbury Cathedral]].  The English Gothic style endured in England until the early sixteenth century \u2013 much longer than in Continental Europe. It was succeeded by [[Tudor architecture]] and [[Renaissance architecture]].  \n\nThe Gothic style was introduced from France, where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] of the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]] north of Paris, completed in 1094.<ref name=HF>{{cite book |last1=Honour |first1=Hugh |author-link1=Hugh Honour |last2=Fleming |first2=John |author-link2=John Fleming (art historian) |date=2009 |title=A World History of Art |edition=7th |location=London |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |isbn=9781856695848 |page=376}}</ref> The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England were [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]].  Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from [[Romanesque architecture]] (often known in England as [[Norman architecture]]).  Other features were imported from the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]], had been built in 1135\u20131164.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mignon |first=Olivier |date=2015 |title=Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques |location= |publisher= |pages=10\u201311 |isbn=}}</ref>  After a fire destroyed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174, the French architect [[William of Sens]] rebuilt the choir in the new Gothic style between 1175 and 1180.  \n\nThe transition can also be seen at [[Durham Cathedral]], a Norman building which was remodeled with the earliest [[rib vault]] known. Besides cathedrals, the style appeared in university buildings,  [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[great house]]s, and many smaller secular buildings, including [[almshouse]]s and [[parish church]]es.\n\nHistorians traditionally divide English Gothic into three periods: [[Early English (architecture)|Early English]] (c. 1180\u20131275),  [[Decorated Gothic]] (c. 1275\u20131380), and [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520).<ref>This scheme uses the labels coined by the antiquary [[Thomas Rickman]] in his ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315).</ref>  The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals, abbey churches and collegiate buildings.  With the exception of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], English cathedrals show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years.\n<!---\n==Background== \n===Historical=== \n*Edward the Confessor fostered monasticism and founds Westminster Abbey\n*1066 and all that.

(A. Freeman Smith (1922), ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages''. pp. 35\u201345.)</ref>  It succeeded [[Norman Architecture]], which had introduced early great cathedrals, built of stone instead of timber, and saw the construction of remarkable abbeys throughout England. The Normans had introduced the three classical orders of architecture, and created massive walls for their buildings, with thin pilaster-like buttresses. The transition from Norman to Gothic lasted from about 1145 until 1190. in the reigns of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and [[Richard I]]. The style changed from the more massive severe Norman style to the more delicate and refined Gothic.<ref>A. Freeman Smith (1922), ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'', pp. 35\u201345.</ref>  \n\nEarly English Gothic was particularly influenced by what was called in English \"The French style\". The style was imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also imported cut stones from Normandy for their construction.  It was also influenced by the architecture of the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]] had been constructed.  The nave of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], one of the first early English Gothic structures in England, was rebuilt in the new style by a French architect, [William of Sens]]. \n\nThe Early English style particularly featured more strongly-constructed walls with stone vaulted roofs, to resist fire. The weight of these vaults was carried downwards and outwards by arched ribs. This feature, the early [[rib vault]], was used at [[Durham Cathedral]], the first time it was used this way in Europe. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnother important innovation introduced in this early period was the [[buttress]], a stone column outside the structure which reinforced the walls against the weight pressing outward and downward from the vaults.  This evolved into the [[flying buttress]], which carried the thrust from the from the wall of the nave over the roof of the aisle. The buttress was given further support by a heavy stone pinnacle. Butressses were an early feature of the chapter house of [[Lichfield Cathedral]].<ref>A. Freeman Smith (1922), ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'', pp. 35\u201345.</ref>  \n\nAnother innovation introduced in early English Gothic was the [[Lancet window]], a tall narrow window with a pointed arch on top.  They were grouped together side by side under a single arch and decorated with mullions in tracery patterns, such as ''cusps'', or spear-points.  Lancet windows were combined similarly pointed arches and the ribs of the vaults overhead, giving a harmonious and unified style.  The first English Cathedral tbe be built entirely in the Gothic style was [[Wells Cathedral]].   By 1175, with the completion of the Choir at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]], the style was firmly established in England.\n\n===Characteristics  ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] rebuilt by [[William of Sens]] (1174\u20131184)\nFile:Wells cathedral nave clerestory.JPG|The three levels of the nave of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1176\u20131450), the first in England to use the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] exclusively in the ceiling vaults, the windows of the [[clerestory]] and arcades of the [[triforium]], and the arcades on the ground floor. \nFile:Lincoln Cathedral, Dean's Eye window (N.31) (21975539699).jpg|The Dean's Eye Window, a rare English [[rose window]], at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220\u20131235)\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Detail Bosses.jpg|Early four-part [[rib vault]]s at [[Salisbury Cathedral]], with a simple carved stone [[boss (architecture)|boss]] at the meeting point of the ribs (1220\u20131258)\nFile:Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG|Lancet windows in the north transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131258)\n</gallery>\n\n* The '''vertical plan''' of  early Gothic Cathedrals had three levels, each of about equal height;  the [[clerestory]], with arched windows which admitted light on top, under the roof vaults;  the [[triforium]] a wider covered arcade, in the middle; and, on the ground floor, on either side of the [[nave]], wide arcades of columns and pillars, which supported the weight of the ceiling vaults through the ribs.\n* The most distinctive element of this period was the '''[[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]''', (also known as the [[lancet arch]], which was the key feature of the Gothic [[rib vault]],   The original purpose of rib vault was to allow a heavier stone ceiling, to replace the wooden roofs of the earlier Norman churches, which frequently caught fire.   They also had the benefit of allowing the construction of higher and thinner walls.   They appeared first in an early form in [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Gradually, pointed arches were used not only for rib vaults, but also for all of the arcades and for [[lancet windows]]s,  giving the nave its unified appearance. The first structure in England to be built entirely with the pointed arch was [[Wells Cathedral]] (1175-1260), but they were soon used in all Cathedrals.<ref>Bechmann (2017), p. 295</ref>  \n* The Early English '''[[rib vault]]s''' were usually quadripartite, each having four compartments divided by ribs, , with each covering one bay of the ceiling.  The horizontal ridge ribs intersected the summits of the cross ribs and diagonal ribs, and carried the weight outwards and downwards to pillars or columns of the triforium and arcades, and, in later cathedrals, outside the walls to the buttresses. <ref>A. Freeman Smith (1922), pp. 71\u201373.</ref>\n* The '''[[lancet window]]''', narrow and tall with a point at the top, became a common feature of English architecture.   For this reason Early English Gothic is sometimes known as the Lancet style.  The Lancet openings of windows and decorative arcading are often grouped in twos or threes. This characteristic is seen throughout [[Salisbury Cathedral]], where groups of two lancet windows line the nave and groups of three line the clerestory. At [[York Minster]] the north transept has a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters; each is 50 feet tall and still retains its original glass.\n* [[Stained glass]] windows began to be widely used in the windows of the [[clerestory]], [[transept]] and especially west facade.   Many were elaborately decorated with [[tracery]]; that is, thin [[mullions]] or ribs of stone which divided the windows into elaborate geometric patterns.   as at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220). \n* '''[[Rose window |Rose Windows]]''' were relatively rare in England, but [[Lincoln Cathedral]] has two notable examples from this period. The oldest is the Dean's Window in the north transept, which dates to 1220-1235. It is an example of an Early English plate-tracery rose window. The geometric design, with concentric tiers of circular window lights, predates the geometric tracery of the later decorated style of Gothic architecture.  The principal theme of the window is the second coming of Christ and the last judgement. Some scenes are associated with death and resurrection, such as the funeral of Saint Hugh, the founder of the Cathedral, and the death of the Virgin. <ref> [http://www.lincolncathedral.com/ Lincoln Cathedral Official Website]</ref>\n* '''Sculptural  decoration'''. Unlike the more somber and heavy Norman churches, the Gothic churches began to have  elaborate sculptural decoration. The arches of the arcades and triforium were sometimes decorated with dog tooth patterns, cusps, carved circles, and with [[trefoil]]s, [[quatrefoil]]s, as well as floral and vegetal designs. Simple floral motifs also often appeared on the capitals, the [[spandrels]], the [[roof boss]] that joined the ribs of the vaults.<ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n* The '''clustered column'''. Instead of being massive, solid pillars, early Gothic columns were often composed of clusters of slender, detached shafts, which descended the vaults above.  These were often made of dark, polished [[Purbeck Marble|Purbeck \"marble\"]], surrounding a central pillar, or [[pier (architecture)|pier]], to which they are attached by circular moulded shaft-rings. One characteristic of Early Gothic in England is the great depth given to the hollows of the [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]] with alternating fillets and rolls, and by the decoration of the hollows with the dog-tooth [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] and by the circular [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] or tops of the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns.<ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n===Notable Early Gothic structures===\n* [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1185\u20131311)\n* Nave and transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], without tower (1220\u20131258)\n* Transept of [[Westminster Abbey]]\n* [[Whitby Abbey]] \n* [[Rievaulx Abbey]]\n* The Galilee Porch of [[Ely Cathedral]]\n* Nave and transept of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1225\u20131240)\n* West front of [[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n* South transept of [[York Cathedral]]\n\n{{anchor|Decorated Gothic|Geometric Decorated}}\n==Decorated Gothic (mid 13th to mid 14th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nYork Minster - panoramio - PJMarriott (1).jpg|The west facade of [[York Minster]] (1338), showing the elaborate [[tracery]] in the main window.\nFile:Ely Cathedral Choir, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The choir of [[Ely Cathedral]], rebuilt in Decorated Gothic beginning in 1321\n</gallery>\n\nThe second period of English Gothic architecture is generally termed '''Decorated Gothic''', because the amount of ornament and decoration increased dramatically.  It was a period of growing prosperity in England, and this was expressed in the decoration of Cathedrals.  Almost every feature of the interiors and facades was decorated.\n\nHistorians sometimes subdivide this style into two periods, based on the predominant motifs of the designs.   The first, the '''Geometric''' style, lasted (about 1245 or 50 until 1315 or 1360), where ornament tended to be based on straight lines, cubes and circles, followed by the '''Curvilinear''' style (from about 1290 or 1315 until 1350 or 1360)  which used gracefully curving lines.  <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 45-47 </ref>\n\nAdditions in the Decorated style were often added to earlier cathedrals.  One striking example is found at [[Ely Cathedral]], The architect [[Thomas Witney]] built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in Decorated style. Soon afterwards another architect, William Joy, added curving arches to strengthen the structure, and made further extensions to join the Lady Chapel to the Choir. In 1329-45 he created an extraordinary double arch in the decorated style. <ref>|Harvey (1987), pg.163</ref> \n\n===Characteristics===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ely Cathedral Lady Chapel, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]] of the Lady Chapel of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral Vaulted Ceiling.jpg|Lierne vault of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1351-1377)\nFile:The Cloisters at Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|[[Fan vault]]s in cloisters of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1373)\nFile:West porch Lichfield by Francis Frith.jpeg|Decorated ornament on the west porch of [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 002.jpg|[[Tracery]], [[diapering]] and sculptural decoration on [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\nFile:Chapter House, Lichfield Cathedral (exterior 5).JPG|Early buttresses, topped by pinnacles, at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:26-Ely-005.jpg|[[Pinnacles]] on the roof of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Carlisle Cathedral Tracery, Cumbria, UK - Diliff.jpg|East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], with curvilinear tracery (about 1350)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 010.jpg|Floral [[boss (architecture)|boss]] joining the ribs of the vaults of [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n</gallery>\n\n*  The '''[[Lierne (vault)|Lierne Vault]]''' .   [[Vault (architecture)|Vaulting]] became much more elaborate in this period. The  [[rib vault]] of earlier Early Gothic usually had just four compartments, with a minimum number of ribs which were all connected to the columns below, and all played a role in distributing the weight and outwards and downwards. In the Decorated architecture period, additional ribs were added to the vaulted ceilings which were purely decorative. They created very elaborate star patterns and other geometric designs.  [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Ely Cathedral]] have notable Lierne vaults from this period. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nThe [[buttress]] became more common in this period, as at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. These were stone columns outside the walls which supportsd them, allowing thinner and high walls between the buttresses, and larger windows. The buttresses wee often topped by ornamental stone pinnacles to give them greater weight.   \n\n* The '''[[Fan vault]]''', An even more eleborate form, appeared late in the Decorative.   Unlike the Lierne vault, the fan vault had no functional ribs; the visible \"ribs\" are mouldings on the masonry imitating ribs. The structure is composed of slabs of stone joined together into half-cones, whose vertices are the springers of the vault. The earliest example, from 1373, is found in the cloisters of  [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. It made a notable backdrop in some of the [[Harry Potter]] films. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n* '''[[Tracery]]'''. Decorated architecture is particularly characterised by the elaborate [[tracery]]  within the stained glass windows. The elaborate windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel [[mullion]]s (vertical bars of stone), usually up to the level at which the arched top of the window begins. The mullions then branch out and cross, intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called [[tracery]], typically including [[trefoil]]s and [[quatrefoil]]s. The style was [[Geometry|geometrical]] at first and [[curvilinear]], or curving and serpentine, in the later period,  This curvilinear element was introduced in the first quarter of the 14th century and lasted about fifty years.<ref name=\"EB1911DP\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Decorated Period|volume=7|page=915|first=Richard Phen\u00e9|last=Spiers|authorlink=Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers}}</ref>. A notable example of the curvilinear style is the East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], (about 1350).\n\n* '''Sculpture''' also became more ornate and decorative. The [[ball flower]] and a four-leaved flower motif took the place of the earlier [[dog-tooth]]. The foliage in the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] was less conventional than in Early English and more flowing, Another decorative feature of the period was [[diapering]], or creating multicolour geometric patterns on walls or panels made with different colours of stone or brick.  <ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n===Notable examples===\n*[[Lincoln Cathedral]] (west facade and Angel Choir)\n*[[Carlisle Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[York Minster]] (West facade) \n*[[Lichfield Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n*[[Ely Cathedral]] (Portions including Galilee porch, lady chapel and choir (1322-28)\n*[[Melrose Abbey]] (The Lady Chapel) [[Scotland]],<ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Perpendicular Gothic}}\n==Perpendicular Gothic  (late 13th to mid 16th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The interior of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] conveys an impression of a \"cage\" of stone and glass, typical of Perpendicular architecture.

A notable early example is the  [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], built by the royal architect [[William Ramsey (architect)|William Ramsey]] in 1332. <ref> John Harvey (historian)|Harvey]] (1978) puts the earliest example of a fully formed Perpendicular style at the [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], in 1332 </ref>  The early style was also practiced by Ramsey and another royal architect,  [[John Sponlee]], and fully developed in the works of [[Henry Yevele]] and [[William Wynford]].\n\nWalls were built much higher than in earlier periods, and stained glass windows became very large, so that the space around them was reduced to simple piers. Horizontal transoms sometimes had to be introduced to strengthen the vertical [[mullions]]. <ref>Smith, A.

Gradually, near the end of the period, Renaissance forms began to appear in the English Gothic. A [[rood screen]], a Renaissance ornament, was installed in the chapel of [[King's College Chapel]], Cambridge.  During the [[Elizabethan Period]] (1558-1603), the classical details, including the five orders of classical architecture, were gradually introduced. Carved ornament with Italian Renaissance motifs began to be used in decoration, including on the tomb of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  The pointed arch gradually gave way to the Roman rounded arch, brick began to replace masonry, the roof construction was concealed, and the Gothic finally gave way to an imitation of Roman and Greek styles. <ref>Smith, A.

Important towers were built at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[York Minster]], [[Worcester Cathedral]], and on many smaller churches.  Decorative [[Battlements]] were a popular decoration of towers in smaller churches.  \n\n* '''Windows''' became very large, sometimes of immense size, with slimmer stone [[mullion]]s than in earlier periods, allowing greater scope for [[stained glass]] craftsmen. The mullions of the windows are carried vertically up into the [[arch]] moulding of the windows, and the upper portion is subdivided by additional mullions (supermullions) and [[transom (architectural)|transom]]s, forming rectangular compartments, known as panel tracery.   The [[Tudor Arch]] window was a particular feature of English Gothic. \n\n* '''[[Buttress]]es''' and wall surfaces were divided into vertical panels.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> \n\n* '''Doorways''' were frequently enclosed within a square head over the arch mouldings, the [[spandrel]]s being filled with [[quatrefoil]]s or tracery.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> Pointed arches were still used throughout the period, but [[ogee]] and four-centred [[Tudor arch]]es were also introduced.\n\n* Inside the church the [[triforium]] disappeared, or its place was filled with panelling, and greater importance was given to the [[clerestory]] windows, which often were the finest features in the churches of this period. The mouldings were  flatter than those of the earlier periods, and one of the chief characteristics is the introduction of large [[elliptical]] hollows.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/>\n\n* '''Flint architecture'''.  In areas of [[Southern England]] using [[flint]] architecture, elaborate [[flushwork]] decoration in flint and [[ashlar]] was used, especially in the [[wool church]]es of [[East Anglia]].\n\n===Notable examples===\n* [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]] (1446\u20131515)<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20121130024710/http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/</ref>\n* [[Eton College Chapel, Eton]] (1448\u20131482)<ref>http://www.etoncollege.com/OurHistory.aspx</ref>\n* late 15th-century tower, [[New College, Oxford]] (1380\u201386, [[Henry Yevele]])\n* [[Divinity School, Oxford]] (1427\u201383)\n* [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick|Beauchamp Chapel, Warwick]] (1381\u201391)\n* Quire and tower of [[York Minster]] (1389\u20131407)\n* remodelling of the nave and aisles of [[Winchester Cathedral]] (1399\u20131419)\n* transept and tower of [[Merton College, Oxford]] (1424\u201350)\n* [[Manchester Cathedral]] (1422)\n* central tower of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1454\u201357)\n* central tower of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1475\u201380)\n* choir of [[Sherborne Abbey]] (1475 \u2013 c. 1580)\n* Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity, [[Tattershall]], Lincolnshire ({{circa|1490{{snd}}1500}})<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120415064111/http://www.httf.org/</ref>)\n* [[Charterhouse School]], Surrey, main buildings and chapel\n* [[Bath Abbey]] ({{circa|lk=no|1501|1537}})\n* [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s [[Henry VII Lady Chapel|Lady Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] (1503\u20131519; heavily restored in the 1860s)\n* Towers of [[St Giles' Church, Wrexham]], and [[St Mary Magdalene, Taunton]] (1503\u20131508)\n\n==The Gothic roof==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Trad-queen-post.png|A Queen-post truss\nFile:Westminster Hall edited.jpg|[[Hammerbeam roof|Hammerbeam timber roof]] of [[Westminster Hall]] (1395)\nFile:Chambers 1908 Hammerbeam.png|Section of a Hammerbeam timber roof. \nFile:Kings dining hall.JPG|Dining Hall of [[King's College, Oxford]], with a [[hammerbeam roof]] \n</gallery>\nThe pitched Gothic '''timber roof'''  was a distinctive feature of the style, both in religious and domestic architecture. It had to be able to resist rain, snow and high winds of the English climate, and to preserve the integrity of the structure.  A pitched roof was a common feature of all the Gothic periods. During the Norman period, the roofs normally were pitched forty-five degrees, with the apex forming a right angle, which harmonised with the rounded arches of the gables.  With the arrival of the pointed [[rib vault]], the roofs became steeper, up to sixty degrees. In the late perpendicular period, the angle declined to twenty degrees or even less. The roofs were usually made of boards overlaid with tiles or sheet-lead, which was commonly used on low-pitched roofs. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>\n\nThe simpler Gothic roofs were supported by long [[rafter]]s of light wood, resting on wooden [[trusses]] set into the walls. The rafters were supported by more solid beams, called ''purlins'', which were carried at their ends by the roof [[truss]]es.  The ''tie-beam'' is the chief beam of the truss.  Later, the roof was supported by structures called a King-point-truss and Queen-post truss, where The principal rafters are connected with the tie beam by head of the truss. The King-Point truss has a vertical beam with connects the centre of the rafter to the ridge of the roof, supported by diagonal struts, while a  Queen-Post truss has a wooden collar below the pointed arch which united the posts and was supported by struts and cross-braces. A Queen-Post truss could span w width of forty feet. Both of these forms created greater stability, but the full weight of the roof still came down directly onto the walls. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71</ref> \n\nGothic architects did not like the roof truss systems, because the numerous horizontal beams crossing the nave obstructed  the view of the soaring height. They came up with an ingenious solution,  the [[Hammerbeam roof]].  In this system, the point  of the roof is supported by the collar and trusses, but from the collar curved beams reach well downward on the walls, and carry the weight downward and outwards, to the walls and buttresses, without obstructing the view.  The oldest existing roof of this kind is found in [[Winchester Cathedral]]. The most famous example of the   [[Hammerbeam roof]] is the roof of [[Westminster Hall]] (1395), the largest timber roof of its time, built for royal ceremonies such as the banquets following the coronation of the King.  Other notable wooden roofs included those of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and [[Crosby Hall, Liverpool|Crosby Hall]].  A similar system, with a arched trusses, was used in the roof of Wexham Cathedral.<ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>  \n\n\n<!---NOTE:Collected these pics to use in expansion of article.

NSBM artists typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with [[Paganism#Historical paganism|ethnic European paganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[Nazism and occultism|Nazi occultism]], and vehemently oppose [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a [[neo-v\u00f6lkisch movements|neo-v\u00f6lkisch movement]] within black metal. According to [[Mattias Gardell]], NSBM musicians see this ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\".<ref name=\"Gardell\">Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307</ref>\n\nAlthough there is an undercurrent of ethnic nationalism in black metal,{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=349-355}}<ref name=\"Gardell\"/><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Trafford |first1=Simon |last2=Pluskowski |first2=Aleks |editor-last=Marshall |editor-first=David W. |year=2007 |title=Antichrist Superstars: The Vikings in Hard Rock and Heavy Metal |url=https://www.academia.edu/521897/Antichrist_Superstars_The_Vikings_in_hard_rock_and_heavy_metal |journal=Mass Market Medieval: Essays on the Middle Ages in Popular Culture |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |pages=64 |isbn=978-0-7864-2922-6 }}</ref> NSBM artists are a small minority within the genre.<ref name=\"Gardell\"/>{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=123f}} NSBM artists are not always explicit with their political beliefs in the music, instead expressing their beliefs offstage.<ref name=reichsrock>{{cite book|last1=Dyck|first1=Kirsten|title=Reichsrock: The International Web of White-Power and Neo-Nazi Hate Music|date=2016|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=New Brunswick|isbn=9780813574738|pages=58\u201361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sREVDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Artists who hold [[Far-right politics|far-right]] or [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] beliefs but do not express these in their music are not often deemed NSBM by the greater black metal scene, but may be labelled as such by outside analysts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html |title=Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im \"SO 36\" |publisher=BIFFF ...|language=de}}</ref> Some black metal bands have also made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}} According to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss's 2005 book ''Unheilige Allianzen'', v\u00f6lkisch [[pagan metal]] and neo-Nazism were the current trends in black metal, and in turn were affecting the broader metal scene.<ref>''Unheilige Allianzen'', p. 290. {{ISBN|3-89771-817-0}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of NSBM coincided with the rise of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] in the early 1990s, particularly through the band [[Burzum]], whose sole member, [[Varg Vikernes]], developed his [[Satanism|Satanist]] beliefs and antagonism to Christianity into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]]. The German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes.  The movement became especially popular in Eastern Europe, where it was developed by bands such as the Polish groups [[Graveland]] and [[Infernum]] and the Ukrainian band [[Hate Forest]]. The United States bands [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement. As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing white supremacist and neo-Nazi musical forms such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-fight faction of [[Oi!]]. The Canadian neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]] started releasing NSBM recordings, and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. The United States white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]] and his political organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik M\u00f6bus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany. In the early 2000s, bands such the Ukrainian [[Drudkh]] and [[Kroda]] and the Russian \u041c8\u041b8\u0422\u0425 continued the scene's popularity in Eastern Europe. In 2012, the NSBM [[Asgardsrei festival]] was established in [[Moscow]], Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to [[Kiev]], Ukraine, where it is closely linked to the activities of the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] network [[Azov Battalion]] and functions as an international hub for neo-Nazism and other far-right politics.\n\n==Black metal==\n{{Main|Black metal}}\nBlack metal is a style of [[extreme metal]] music.

Black metal originated with the band [[Venom (band)|Venom]] out of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[England]]. Their debut album ''[[Welcome to Hell|Welcome To Hell]]'' released in 1981 and was followed by 1982's ''[[Black metal|Black Metal]]''. Venom's image lyrics and musical style were copied and inspired by bands such as [[Slayer]], [[Hellhammer]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], and [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]]. In the early 1990s, the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] developed the style into a distinct genre. The scene members were fiercely [[Criticism of Christianity|anti-Christian]] and generally presented themselves as [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] [[Theistic Satanism|Devil-worshipers]] who wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. However, some bands wrote about pre-Christian Scandinavia and its folklore. In 1992, members of the scene burnt down a number of churches. In August of the same year, [[Faust (musician)|Faust]] of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] killed a gay man who had propositioned him in [[Lillehammer]]. In August 1993, [[Varg Vikernes]] of [[Burzum]] killed fellow musician [[Euronymous]] \u2013 a well-known figure in the scene \u2013 and was arrested shortly after. Euronymous was said to be a [[communism|communist]], but Vikernes denies killing him over ideology. Although Vikernes's music was never explicitly political, he began to express neo-Nazi views in writings and interviews after his arrest.\n\nVikernes is generally seen as being responsible for popularizing such views in the black metal scene. According to an interview in ''Blood & Honour'' magazine, he contacted neo-Nazi organization Zorn 88 (later called the [[National Socialist Movement of Norway]]) in 1992<ref name=\"Unheiligepage277\">''Unheilige Allianzen'', p. 277.</ref> and joined White Aryan Resistance before he killed Euronymous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/1996/0902/reporter/0002/?subnav=Spezial|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723205956/http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/1996/0902/reporter/0002/?subnav=Spezial|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 July 2012|title=Aktuell|website=www.berlinonline.de|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> While in prison, \"Vikernes began to formulate his nationalist heathen ideology\"<ref>Goodrick-Clarke, p. 204.</ref> and wrote a manifesto called ''Vargsm\u00e5l''.

He claims the industry made it into another tool with which to destroy Europe, by promoting bands who embraced \"everything sick and anti-European on this planet, from porn and promiscuity to drugs and homosexuality\".<ref>Vikernes, Varg.

It was released in 1994 with ''Norsk Arisk Black Metal'' ('Norwegian Aryan Black Metal') printed on the back cover.

NSBM artists typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with [[Paganism#Historical paganism|ethnic European paganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[Nazism and occultism|Nazi occultism]], and vehemently oppose [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a [[neo-v\u00f6lkisch movements|neo-v\u00f6lkisch movement]] within black metal. According to [[Mattias Gardell]], NSBM musicians see this ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\".<ref name=\"Gardell\">Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307</ref>\n\nAlthough there is an undercurrent of ethnic nationalism in black metal,{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=349-355}}<ref name=\"Gardell\"/><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Trafford |first1=Simon |last2=Pluskowski |first2=Aleks |editor-last=Marshall |editor-first=David W. |year=2007 |title=Antichrist Superstars: The Vikings in Hard Rock and Heavy Metal |url=https://www.academia.edu/521897/Antichrist_Superstars_The_Vikings_in_hard_rock_and_heavy_metal |journal=Mass Market Medieval: Essays on the Middle Ages in Popular Culture |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |pages=64 |isbn=978-0-7864-2922-6 }}</ref> NSBM artists are a small minority within the genre.<ref name=\"Gardell\"/>{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=123f}} NSBM artists are not always explicit with their political beliefs in the music, instead expressing their beliefs offstage.<ref name=reichsrock>{{cite book|last1=Dyck|first1=Kirsten|title=Reichsrock: The International Web of White-Power and Neo-Nazi Hate Music|date=2016|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=New Brunswick|isbn=9780813574738|pages=58\u201361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sREVDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Artists who hold [[Far-right politics|far-right]] or [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] beliefs but do not express these in their music are not often deemed NSBM by the greater black metal scene, but may be labelled as such by outside analysts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html |title=Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im \"SO 36\" |publisher=BIFFF ...|language=de}}</ref> Some black metal bands have also made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}} According to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss's 2005 book ''Unheilige Allianzen'', v\u00f6lkisch [[pagan metal]] and neo-Nazism were the current trends in black metal, and in turn were affecting the broader metal scene.<ref>''Unheilige Allianzen'', p. 290. {{ISBN|3-89771-817-0}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of NSBM coincided with the rise of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] in the early 1990s, particularly through the band [[Burzum]], whose sole member, [[Varg Vikernes]], developed his [[Satanism|Satanist]] beliefs and antagonism to Christianity into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]]. The German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes.  The movement became especially popular in Eastern Europe, where it was developed by bands such as the Polish groups [[Graveland]] and [[Infernum]] and the Ukrainian band [[Hate Forest]]. The United States bands [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement. As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing white supremacist and neo-Nazi musical forms such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-fight faction of [[Oi!]]. The Canadian neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]] started releasing NSBM recordings, and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. The United States white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]] and his political organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik M\u00f6bus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany. In the early 2000s, bands such the Ukrainian [[Drudkh]] and [[Kroda]] and the Russian \u041c8\u041b8\u0422\u0425 continued the scene's popularity in Eastern Europe. In 2012, the NSBM [[Asgardsrei festival]] was established in [[Moscow]], Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to [[Kiev]], Ukraine, where it is closely linked to the activities of the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] network [[Azov Battalion]] and functions as an international hub for neo-Nazism and other far-right politics.\n\n==Black metal==\n{{Main|Black metal}}\nBlack metal is a style of [[extreme metal]] music.

In the early 1990s, the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] developed the style into a distinct genre. The scene members were fiercely [[Criticism of Christianity|anti-Christian]] and generally presented themselves as [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] [[Theistic Satanism|Devil-worshipers]] who wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. However, some bands wrote about pre-Christian Scandinavia and its folklore. In 1992, members of the scene burnt down a number of churches. In August of the same year, [[Faust (musician)|Faust]] of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] killed a gay man who had propositioned him in [[Lillehammer]]. In August 1993, [[Varg Vikernes]] of [[Burzum]] killed fellow musician [[Euronymous]] \u2013 a well-known figure in the scene \u2013 and was arrested shortly after. Euronymous was said to be a [[communism|communist]], but Vikernes denies killing him over ideology. Although Vikernes's music was never explicitly political, he began to express neo-Nazi views in writings and interviews after his arrest.\n\nVikernes is generally seen as being responsible for popularizing such views in the black metal scene. According to an interview in ''Blood & Honour'' magazine, he contacted neo-Nazi organization Zorn 88 (later called the [[National Socialist Movement of Norway]]) in 1992<ref name=\"Unheiligepage277\">''Unheilige Allianzen'', p. 277.</ref> and joined White Aryan Resistance before he killed Euronymous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/1996/0902/reporter/0002/?subnav=Spezial|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723205956/http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/1996/0902/reporter/0002/?subnav=Spezial|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 July 2012|title=Aktuell|website=www.berlinonline.de|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> While in prison, \"Vikernes began to formulate his nationalist heathen ideology\"<ref>Goodrick-Clarke, p. 204.</ref> and wrote a manifesto called ''Vargsm\u00e5l''.

His colourful and extrovert personality often overshadowed his genuine talent. After fighting in, and surviving the [[Second World War]], he vowed to live life to the full and took up motor sport. Although adept in [[Open-wheel|single-seaters]], sportscars was where he enjoyed most success, winning the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans|1953 24 Heures du Mans]], two Coupe de Paris events, and the [[12 Hours of Reims|12 heures internationals Reims]] race in 1956. He retired in 1958 and ran a garage in [[Bagshot]], [[Surrey]] for many years. He died from [[lung cancer]] in 1994.\n\n==Early years==\n\nBorn in County Cork, Hamilton was brought up in relative obscurity. Prior to his 20th birthday, Europe was already embroiled in the [[Second World War]]. As a result, he would spend the war years as part of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] flying [[Westland Lysander|Lysanders]]. After the war ended, he opened a car garage. During the years between the war ending and the start of the 1950s, Duncan started racing in local events. He cut his teeth in such pre-wars as the [[MG R-type]] and the [[Bugatti Type 35]]B. After racing a [[Maserati 6CM]] in 1948, Duncan graduated to a [[Talbot-Lago]] Grand Prix car.<ref name=\"conceptcarz.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/view/racing/driver.aspx?driverID=40&dtaID=21 |title=Duncan Hamilton - 1951 Formula One Season |last=McMullen |first=Jeremy |publisher=conceptcarz |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Formula One career==\n\nHe participated in five World Championship Grands Prix and 18 non-Championship [[Formula One]] races. His best results in the non-Championship events were fourth place in the 1948 Zandvoort Grand Prix with a [[Maserati 6CM]], third in the 1951 Richmond Trophy ([[English Racing Automobiles|ERA]] B-Type), second in the [[BRDC International Trophy|1951 BRDC International Trophy]] ([[Talbot-Lago]] T26C), third in the 1952 Richmond Trophy (Talbot-Lago T26C) and fourth in the 1952 Internationales ADAC Eifelrennen ([[Hersham and Walton Motors|HWM]]-[[Alta Car and Engineering Company|Alta]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Darren Galpin |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/title.html |title=The Formula One Archives |publisher=Silhouet.com |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThat fourth place at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]], showed that he was right at home in the upper level of Grand Prix racing, especially as this was his debut at this level. After that impressive debut, things soon turned sour for Hamilton, at his last race of 1948, the [[1948 British Grand Prix|RAC International Grand Prix]], the first official post-WW2 British Grand Prix, he retired with oil pressure problems.<ref name=\"conceptcarz.com\"/><ref name=\"f1-images.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.f1-images.de/009900/nowm/481002.htm |title=f1-images.de |publisher=f1-images.de |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1949 Grand Prix season, he only suffered one retirement, however he did not finish higher than ninth, which he managed twice, both times at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]]. The following season, he competed in fewer Grand Prix races, while he expanded his racing experience by racing sportscars. He won the Wakefield Trophy, a minor [[Formula Libre]] race, held at [[Curragh]] in the Republic of Ireland. Hamilton performed beautifully before the Irish crowd.<ref name=\"conceptcarz.com\"/><ref name=\"f1-images.de\"/>\n\nIn the wet, Hamilton had few peers. In his Talbot-Lago, he eclipsed even [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] at the soaking BRDC International Trophy race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in 1951, when he finished second to [[Reg Parnell]], but a long way ahead of Fangio who went on to win the World Championship that season.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">{{cite news|author=David Tremayne |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-duncan-hamilton-1416114.html |title=Obituary: Duncan Hamilton &#124; People &#124; News |publisher=The Independent |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==24 Hours of Le Mans==\n\nHe was best known for his success in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] endurance race, which he took part in nine times, most famously in partnership with [[Tony Rolt]]. The pair finished fourth at their first attempt in the [[1950 24 Hours of Le Mans|1950 race]] and sixth in [[1951 24 Hours of Le Mans|1951]], both times in a special-bodied [[Nash-Healey]] coupe. Their [[Jaguar C-Type]] did not finish in [[1952 24 Hours of Le Mans|1952]], but they returned with a C-Type to win in [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans|1953]]. They were second with a [[Jaguar D-Type]] in [[1954 24 Hours of Le Mans|1954]], losing to a much larger-engined V12 Ferrari \u2013 and by the narrowest margin in years. They came within two miles of victory, Hamilton driving a storming race in the closing stages to halve the lead of the [[Scuderia Ferrari]] of [[Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]], as the track was awash following a cloudburst. When the track started to dry out, the Ferrari hung on for a narrow triumph. He failed to finish in [[1955 24 Hours of Le Mans|1955]]. For [[1956 24 Hours of Le Mans|1956]] Hamilton partnered [[Alfonso de Portago]] in a [[Ferrari]] but again did not finish. In [[1957 24 Hours of Le Mans|1957]] he reverted to a Jaguar D-Type: partnered by the American driver [[Masten Gregory]] he came sixth. His last Le Mans appearance was in [[1958 24 Hours of Le Mans|1958]], when the D-Type he shared with [[Ivor Bueb]] failed to finish.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2007/04/stories/07/1.html |title=CAMRRAD: Duncan Hamilton |work=topgear.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712042621/http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2007/04/stories/07/1.html |archivedate=12 July 2007 |accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nHamilton also won the 1956 [[Reims-Gueux|Rheims]] 12-hour race for Jaguar with a D-Type co-driven by Ivor Bueb. Despite the win, the factory dropped him from their 1956 Le Mans roster for speeding up and passing team-mate [[Paul Fr\u00e8re]]'s car at Rheims when Lofty England had ordered the entire team to slow down, hence his switch to a Ferrari that year. In 1957 Jaguar did not enter Le Mans&nbsp;\u2013 cars and equipment had been destroyed by a fire at the factory&nbsp;\u2013 and Hamilton used his privately owned D-Type.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mike-hawthorn.org.uk/d-type.php |title=Mike Hawthorn's Tribute Site - the Jaguar D-Type |website=mike-hawthorn.org.uk |accessdate=10 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203093050/http://www.mike-hawthorn.org.uk/d-type.php |archivedate=3 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Called from the bar===\n\n[[File:1953JaguarC-Type.jpg|thumb|[[Jaguar C-Type]], similar to which Hamilton and Rolt drove to victory at Le Mans]]\nHamilton famously won the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans|1953 event]] in a Jaguar C-Type shared with Rolt. Initially, the pairing were disqualified for practising in a Jaguar that had the same racing number as another on the circuit at the same time, but they were reinstated. Hamilton's account has become a motor racing legend: when Jaguar team manager [[Lofty England]] persuaded the organisers to let them race, both drivers were already drunk in a local bar.  England said: \"Of course I would never have let them race under the influence. I had enough trouble when they were sober!\"<ref name=\"Rolt obit\" />\n\nWhen the race was under way the team tried to sober Hamilton up by giving him coffee during the pit stops but he refused it, saying it made his arms twitch; instead he was given brandy. The alcohol must have helped when he struck a bird face first at 130&nbsp;mph and broke his nose. Despite the bizarre circumstances, the duo went on to win the race and recorded the first 100&nbsp;mph average speed at Le Mans, a record pace.<ref name=\"Drunken Tale\" />\n\nBoth England and Rolt have denied that they were drunk.<ref name=\"Rolt obit\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1577975/Tony-Rolt.html |title=Tony Rolt |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/news/2008/02/08/db0801.xml |title=News - Latest breaking UK news |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Henry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/feb/09/motorsports.sportobituaries |title=Obituary: Tony Rolt &#124; Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/le-mans-winner-tony-rolt-dies-aged-89 |title=Le Mans winner, Tony Rolt, dies aged 89 |publisher=Autocar |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Drunken Tale\">{{cite web|url=http://vennmotorsport.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/the-drunken-tale-of-duncan-hamilton/ |title=The Drunken Tale Of Duncan Hamilton &#124; Venn Motor Sport |publisher=Vennmotorsport.wordpress.com |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"classicdriver.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/classic-life/duncan-hamilton-gentleman-driver |title=Duncan Hamilton, Gentleman Driver &#124; Classic Driver Magazine |publisher=Classicdriver.com |date=31 August 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Lucky escapes==\n\nOn one occasion in 1947, he was transporting his MG R-type to the [[Brighton Speed Trials]], when going down a hill near [[Guildford]], he \"saw the splendid honeycomb radiator of a Bugatti in the outside rear-view mirror\", so he moved over and waved it past, but the car hung back. Further down the hill, the Bugatti accelerated and drew level with Hamilton, at which point he saw there was no one in it: \"The awful truth dawned on me \u2013 it was my own car, gathering speed fast.\" Hamilton had forgotten he was towing the Bugatti, and the story ends with a lamppost snapped in two.<ref name=\"classicdriver.com\"/><ref name=\"petergiddings.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.petergiddings.com/Peter_articles/hamilton.html |title=Duncan Hamilton |publisher=Petergiddings.com |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nA week after the 1953 Le Mans win, Hamilton drove to [[Porto|Oporto]] to prepare for the [[Portuguese Grand Prix]]. Held on the [[Circuito da Boavista]], he was leading into the first corner of the race when he crashed his Jaguar heavily into an [[Transmission tower|electricity pylon]]. The Jaguar cartwheeled, throwing him out of the car and into a tree. He hung there for about a minute, before falling down on the side of the circuit. Barely conscious, he moved his legs just as a Ferrari raced by, nearly taking Hamilton's left boot with it. He was taken to hospital for an emergency operation, though the medical facilities did not extend to [[anaesthetic]]; as the surgeon leant over him, Duncan was mesmerised by the increasing length of cigarette ash, as it hovered above his open chest cavity. The accident cut off the power supply to Oporto for several hours.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"petergiddings.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vennmotorsport.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/the-drunken-tale-of-duncan-hamilton |title=The Drunken Tale Of Duncan Hamilton &#124; Venn Motor Sport |publisher=Vennmotorsport.wordpress.com |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"oldbrightonians.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldbrightonians.com/notable-obs/sport/duncan-hamilton-s.-1934-36.html |title=Duncan Hamilton (S. 1934-36) &#124; Old Brightonians - The Alumni of Brighton College |publisher=Old Brightonians |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\n\nHamilton sustained unpleasant injuries during the 1958 24 Hours of Le Mans, while contesting the lead in his Jaguar D-Type, and then he was shattered by the death of his friend [[Mike Hawthorn]] in early 1959. That tragedy finally prompted him to hang up his racing helmet and gloves in 1959, and concentrated on his garage business in Bagshot. His love and passion for the finest classic motor cars led Hamilton to establish his own company back in 1948. Since then, Duncan Hamilton & Co Limited has become an international recognised for being one of the most respected and well-connected specialists in historic cars.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"oldracingcars.com\">{{cite web|author=Allen Brown |url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/driver/Duncan_Hamilton |title=Duncan Hamilton \u00ab |publisher=Oldracingcars.com |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duncanhamilton.com/our-heritage/ |title=Our Heritage |publisher=Duncan Hamilton |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n \nHe co-wrote an autobiography called ''Touch Wood!''.

Duncan's grandson [[Archie Hamilton (racing driver)|Archie Hamilton]] is also a racing driver.<ref name=\"oldracingcars.com\"/>\n\nAs [[Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe|Earl Howe]] wrote in the original autobiography foreword in 1960, though the drivers of his age were fiercely competitive, there were also \"friends to meet, stories to tell and almost certainly a party to be enjoyed.\". Duncan was certainly larger than life, he wasn\u2019t just one of the most successful drivers of the 1950s, but also the man who trespassed at [[Brooklands]], who spent the war in the Fleet Air Arm accidentally trying to drown American Admirals and who was once stopped for speeding whilst rushing to take part in a TV programme on road safety.<ref name=\"oldbrightonians.com\"/><ref name=Hamilton>Duncan Hamilton, \u201cTouch Wood \u2013 The Autobiography of the 1953 Le Mans Winner\u201d (John Blake Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1782197737}}, 2014)</ref>\n\nHamilton is regarded as the epitome of the old school English competitor.

His colourful and extrovert personality often overshadowed his genuine talent. After fighting in, and surviving the [[Second World War]], he vowed to live life to the full and took up motor sport. Although adept in [[Open-wheel|single-seaters]], sportscars was where he enjoyed most success, winning the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans|1953 24 Heures du Mans]], two Coupe de Paris events, and the [[12 Hours of Reims|12 heures internationals Reims]] race in 1956. He retired in 1958 and ran a garage in [[Bagshot]], [[Surrey]] for many years. He died from [[lung cancer]] in 1994.\n\n==Early years==\n\nBorn in County Cork, Hamilton was brought up in relative obscurity. Prior to his 20th birthday, Europe was already embroiled in the [[Second World War]]. As a result, he would spend the war years as part of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] flying [[Westland Lysander|Lysanders]]. After the war ended, he opened a car garage. During the years between the war ending and the start of the 1950s, Duncan started racing in local events. He cut his teeth in such pre-wars as the [[MG R-type]] and the [[Bugatti Type 35]]B. After racing a [[Maserati 6CM]] in 1948, Duncan graduated to a [[Talbot-Lago]] Grand Prix car.<ref name=\"conceptcarz.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/view/racing/driver.aspx?driverID=40&dtaID=21 |title=Duncan Hamilton - 1951 Formula One Season |last=McMullen |first=Jeremy |publisher=conceptcarz |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Formula One career==\n\nHe participated in five World Championship Grands Prix and 18 non-Championship [[Formula One]] races. His best results in the non-Championship events were fourth place in the 1948 Zandvoort Grand Prix with a [[Maserati 6CM]], third in the 1951 Richmond Trophy ([[English Racing Automobiles|ERA]] B-Type), second in the [[BRDC International Trophy|1951 BRDC International Trophy]] ([[Talbot-Lago]] T26C), third in the 1952 Richmond Trophy (Talbot-Lago T26C) and fourth in the 1952 Internationales ADAC Eifelrennen ([[Hersham and Walton Motors|HWM]]-[[Alta Car and Engineering Company|Alta]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Darren Galpin |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/title.html |title=The Formula One Archives |publisher=Silhouet.com |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThat fourth place at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]], showed that he was right at home in the upper level of Grand Prix racing, especially as this was his debut at this level. After that impressive debut, things soon turned sour for Hamilton, at his last race of 1948, the [[1948 British Grand Prix|RAC International Grand Prix]], the first official post-WW2 British Grand Prix, he retired with oil pressure problems.<ref name=\"conceptcarz.com\"/><ref name=\"f1-images.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.f1-images.de/009900/nowm/481002.htm |title=f1-images.de |publisher=f1-images.de |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1949 Grand Prix season, he only suffered one retirement, however he did not finish higher than ninth, which he managed twice, both times at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]]. The following season, he competed in fewer Grand Prix races, while he expanded his racing experience by racing sportscars. He won the Wakefield Trophy, a minor [[Formula Libre]] race, held at [[Curragh]] in the Republic of Ireland. Hamilton performed beautifully before the Irish crowd.<ref name=\"conceptcarz.com\"/><ref name=\"f1-images.de\"/>\n\nIn the wet, Hamilton had few peers. In his Talbot-Lago, he eclipsed even [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] at the soaking BRDC International Trophy race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in 1951, when he finished second to [[Reg Parnell]], but a long way ahead of Fangio who went on to win the World Championship that season.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">{{cite news|author=David Tremayne |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-duncan-hamilton-1416114.html |title=Obituary: Duncan Hamilton &#124; People &#124; News |publisher=The Independent |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==24 Hours of Le Mans==\n\nHe was best known for his success in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] endurance race, which he took part in nine times, most famously in partnership with [[Tony Rolt]]. The pair finished fourth at their first attempt in the [[1950 24 Hours of Le Mans|1950 race]] and sixth in [[1951 24 Hours of Le Mans|1951]], both times in a special-bodied [[Nash-Healey]] coupe. Their [[Jaguar C-Type]] did not finish in [[1952 24 Hours of Le Mans|1952]], but they returned with a C-Type to win in [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans|1953]]. They were second with a [[Jaguar D-Type]] in [[1954 24 Hours of Le Mans|1954]], losing to a much larger-engined V12 Ferrari \u2013 and by the narrowest margin in years. They came within two miles of victory, Hamilton driving a storming race in the closing stages to halve the lead of the [[Scuderia Ferrari]] of [[Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]], as the track was awash following a cloudburst. When the track started to dry out, the Ferrari hung on for a narrow triumph. He failed to finish in [[1955 24 Hours of Le Mans|1955]]. For [[1956 24 Hours of Le Mans|1956]] Hamilton partnered [[Alfonso de Portago]] in a [[Ferrari]] but again did not finish. In [[1957 24 Hours of Le Mans|1957]] he reverted to a Jaguar D-Type: partnered by the American driver [[Masten Gregory]] he came sixth. His last Le Mans appearance was in [[1958 24 Hours of Le Mans|1958]], when the D-Type he shared with [[Ivor Bueb]] failed to finish.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2007/04/stories/07/1.html |title=CAMRRAD: Duncan Hamilton |work=topgear.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712042621/http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2007/04/stories/07/1.html |archivedate=12 July 2007 |accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nHamilton also won the 1956 [[Reims-Gueux|Rheims]] 12-hour race for Jaguar with a D-Type co-driven by Ivor Bueb. Despite the win, the factory dropped him from their 1956 Le Mans roster for speeding up and passing team-mate [[Paul Fr\u00e8re]]'s car at Rheims when Lofty England had ordered the entire team to slow down, hence his switch to a Ferrari that year. In 1957 Jaguar did not enter Le Mans&nbsp;\u2013 cars and equipment had been destroyed by a fire at the factory&nbsp;\u2013 and Hamilton used his privately owned D-Type.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mike-hawthorn.org.uk/d-type.php |title=Mike Hawthorn's Tribute Site - the Jaguar D-Type |website=mike-hawthorn.org.uk |accessdate=10 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203093050/http://www.mike-hawthorn.org.uk/d-type.php |archivedate=3 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Called from the bar===\n\n[[File:1953JaguarC-Type.jpg|thumb|[[Jaguar C-Type]], similar to which Hamilton and Rolt drove to victory at Le Mans]]\nHamilton famously won the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans|1953 event]] in a Jaguar C-Type shared with Rolt. Initially, the pairing were disqualified for practising in a Jaguar that had the same racing number as another on the circuit at the same time, but they were reinstated. Hamilton's account has become a motor racing legend: when Jaguar team manager [[Lofty England]] persuaded the organisers to let them race, both drivers were already drunk in a local bar.  England said: \"Of course I would never have let them race under the influence. I had enough trouble when they were sober!\"<ref name=\"Rolt obit\" />\n\nWhen the race was under way the team tried to sober Hamilton up by giving him coffee during the pit stops but he refused it, saying it made his arms twitch; instead he was given brandy. The alcohol must have helped when he struck a bird face first at 130&nbsp;mph and broke his nose. Despite the bizarre circumstances, the duo went on to win the race and recorded the first 100&nbsp;mph average speed at Le Mans, a record pace.<ref name=\"Drunken Tale />\n\nBoth England and Rolt have denied that they were drunk.<ref name=\"Rolt obit\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1577975/Tony-Rolt.html |title=Tony Rolt |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/news/2008/02/08/db0801.xml |title=News - Latest breaking UK news |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Henry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/feb/09/motorsports.sportobituaries |title=Obituary: Tony Rolt &#124; Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/le-mans-winner-tony-rolt-dies-aged-89 |title=Le Mans winner, Tony Rolt, dies aged 89 |publisher=Autocar |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Drunken Tale>{{cite web|url=http://vennmotorsport.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/the-drunken-tale-of-duncan-hamilton/ |title=The Drunken Tale Of Duncan Hamilton &#124; Venn Motor Sport |publisher=Vennmotorsport.wordpress.com |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"classicdriver.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/classic-life/duncan-hamilton-gentleman-driver |title=Duncan Hamilton, Gentleman Driver &#124; Classic Driver Magazine |publisher=Classicdriver.com |date=31 August 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Lucky escapes==\n\nOn one occasion in 1947, he was transporting his MG R-type to the [[Brighton Speed Trials]], when going down a hill near [[Guildford]], he \"saw the splendid honeycomb radiator of a Bugatti in the outside rear-view mirror\", so he moved over and waved it past, but the car hung back. Further down the hill, the Bugatti accelerated and drew level with Hamilton, at which point he saw there was no one in it: \"The awful truth dawned on me \u2013 it was my own car, gathering speed fast.\" Hamilton had forgotten he was towing the Bugatti, and the story ends with a lamppost snapped in two.<ref name=\"classicdriver.com\"/><ref name=\"petergiddings.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.petergiddings.com/Peter_articles/hamilton.html |title=Duncan Hamilton |publisher=Petergiddings.com |date= |accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nA week after the 1953 Le Mans win, Hamilton drove to [[Porto|Oporto]] to prepare for the [[Portuguese Grand Prix]]. Held on the [[Circuito da Boavista]], he was leading into the first corner of the race when he crashed his Jaguar heavily into an [[Transmission tower|electricity pylon]]. The Jaguar cartwheeled, throwing him out of the car and into a tree. He hung there for about a minute, before falling down on the side of the circuit. Barely conscious, he moved his legs just as a Ferrari raced by, nearly taking Hamilton's left boot with it. He was taken to hospital for an emergency operation, though the medical facilities did not extend to [[anaesthetic]]; as the surgeon leant over him, Duncan was mesmerised by the increasing length of cigarette ash, as it hovered above his open chest cavity.

That tragedy finally prompted him to hang up his racing helmet and gloves in 1959, and concentrated on his garage business in Bagshot. His love and passion for the finest classic motor cars led Hamilton to establish his own company back in 1948.

Duncan was certainly larger than life, he wasn\u2019t just one of the most successful drivers of the 1950s, but also the man who trespassed at [[Brooklands]], who spent the war in the Fleet Air Arm accidentally trying to drown American Admirals and who was once stopped for speeding whilst rushing to take part in a TV programme on road safety.<ref name=\"oldbrightonians.com\"/><ref name=Hamilton>Duncan Hamilton, \u201cTouch Wood \u2013 The Autobiography of the 1953 Le Mans Winner\u201d (John Blake Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1782197737}}, 2014)</ref>\n\nHamilton is regarded as the epitome of the old school English competitor.

It currently includes the localities of [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Carlton North, Victoria|North Carlton]], [[Melbourne city centre|Melbourne]], [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]], [[West Melbourne, Victoria|West Melbourne]], [[North Melbourne]], [[Parkville, Victoria|Parkville]], Newmarket, [[Kensington, Victoria|Kensington]] and [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], and includes [[Melbourne University]]. The district has been in existence since 1856 (it was abolished in 1859 and reestablished in 1889).\n\n[[File:Melbourne_map_1855.jpeg|thumb|Melbourne, 1855]]\n\nThe electorate was won in [[2014 Victorian state election|2014]] for the first time by [[Australian Greens Victoria|Greens]] candidate [[Ellen Sandell]].\n\n==History==\nMelbourne was one of the inaugural districts of the first Assembly in 1856.<ref name=1855Act>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/vic5_doc_1855.pdf\n |title=Victoria Constitution Act 1855\n |accessdate=3 January 2014\n}}\n</ref> Its area was defined by the 1855 Act as: {{cquote|''Commencing at a Point in the [[Yarra River|Yarra Yarra River]] due South from the South-western Angle of Gisborne Street, thence to Gisborne Street, and by the Western Side of that Street to [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria Parade]], thence by the South Side of Victoria Parade to the Western Side of [[Nicholson Street, Melbourne|Nicholson Street]], thence by the said Western Side of Nicholson Street Northwards to the Boundary Line of the Corporate Limits of Melbourne, thence by the last-mentioned Boundary Line bearing West to the [[Moonee Ponds Creek|Moonee Ponds]], by the said Moonee Ponds downwards to the Site of Main\u2019s Bridge,{{ref label|a|a}} thence by a Line bearing South to the Yarra Yarra River, and on the South by the Yarra Yarra River to the commencing Point.''<ref name=1855Act/>}}\n:{{note label|a|a}} <small>now Flemington Bridge</small>\n\nMelbourne was abolished in 1859, its area was split into the new electoral districts of [[Electoral district of East Melbourne|East Melbourne]] and [[Electoral district of West Melbourne|West Melbourne]], each having two members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/aatatedovatitnomotlat1066.pdf |title=An Act to alter the Electoral Districts of Victoria and to increase the number of Members of the Legislative Assembly thereof. |year=1858 |accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne was re-created as a single-member electorate by the Electoral Act Amendment Act 1888<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/teaaa1888234/ |title=The Electoral Act Amendment Act 1888 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |type=pdf }}</ref> which took effect at the 1889 elections.\n\nSince 1908 the seat had been traditional [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor]] territory since 1908, but had become increasingly marginal against the [[Australian Greens Victoria|Greens]] since 2002. Senior Labor minister [[Bronwyn Pike]] successfully held the seat against strong Greens challenges at three subsequent elections, defeating future Greens Senator [[Richard Di Natale]] in 2002 and 2006, and prominent lawyer [[Brian Walters]] in 2010. Pike resigned in 2012, and Labor candidate and [[City of Melbourne]] councillor [[Jennifer Kanis]] retained the seat after a [[2012 Melbourne state by-election|closely contested by-election]], which saw her finish second on primary votes to Greens candidate Cathy Oke but win on preferences. Kanis lost the seat to Greens candidate [[Ellen Sandell]] at the [[2014 Victorian state election|2014 election]]. Along with the seat of [[Electoral district of Prahran|Prahran]] it was the first win for the Greens in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]].\n\n==Members==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=20 style=\"border-right:0px;\"; | First incarnation (1856\u20131859, 5 members)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49758939 |title=The Victorian Parliament |work=South Australian Register |publisher=Trove |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|'''Member 1'''\n!

The district has been in existence since 1856 (it was abolished in 1859 and reestablished in 1889).\n\n[[File:Melbourne_map_1855.jpeg|thumb|Melbourne, 1855]]\n\nThe electorate was won in [[2014 Victorian state election|2014]] for the first time by [[Australian Greens Victoria|Greens]] candidate [[Ellen Sandell]].\n\n==History==\nMelbourne was one of the inaugural districts of the first Assembly in 1856.<ref name=1855Act>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/vic5_doc_1855.pdf\n |title=Victoria Constitution Act 1855\n |accessdate=3 January 2014\n}}\n</ref> Its area was defined by the 1855 Act as: {{cquote|''Commencing at a Point in the [[Yarra River|Yarra Yarra River]] due South from the South-western Angle of Gisborne Street, thence to Gisborne Street, and by the Western Side of that Street to [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria Parade]], thence by the South Side of Victoria Parade to the Western Side of [[Nicholson Street, Melbourne|Nicholson Street]], thence by the said Western Side of Nicholson Street Northwards to the Boundary Line of the Corporate Limits of Melbourne, thence by the last-mentioned Boundary Line bearing West to the [[Moonee Ponds Creek|Moonee Ponds]], by the said Moonee Ponds downwards to the Site of Main\u2019s Bridge,{{ref label|a|a}} thence by a Line bearing South to the Yarra Yarra River, and on the South by the Yarra Yarra River to the commencing Point.''<ref name=1855Act/>}}\n:{{note label|a|a}} <small>now Flemington Bridge</small>\n\nMelbourne was abolished in 1859, its area was split into the new electoral districts of [[Electoral district of East Melbourne|East Melbourne]] and [[Electoral district of West Melbourne|West Melbourne]], each having two members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/aatatedovatitnomotlat1066.pdf |title=An Act to alter the Electoral Districts of Victoria and to increase the number of Members of the Legislative Assembly thereof. |year=1858 |accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne was re-created as a single-member electorate by the Electoral Act Amendment Act 1888<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/teaaa1888234/ |title=The Electoral Act Amendment Act 1888 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |type=pdf }}</ref> which took effect at the 1889 elections.\n\nSince 1908 the seat had been traditional [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor]] territory since 1908, but had become increasingly marginal against the [[Australian Greens Victoria|Greens]] since 2002. Senior Labor minister [[Bronwyn Pike]] successfully held the seat against strong Greens challenges at three subsequent elections, defeating future Greens Senator [[Richard Di Natale]] in 2002 and 2006, and prominent lawyer [[Brian Walters]] in 2010. Pike resigned in 2012, and Labor candidate and [[City of Melbourne]] councillor [[Jennifer Kanis]] retained the seat after a [[2012 Melbourne state by-election|closely contested by-election]], which saw her finish second on primary votes to Greens candidate Cathy Oke but win on preferences. Kanis lost the seat to Greens candidate [[Ellen Sandell]] at the [[2014 Victorian state election|2014 election]]. Along with the seat of [[Electoral district of Prahran|Prahran]] it was the first win for the Greens in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]].\n\n==Members==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=20 style=\"border-right:0px;\"; | First incarnation (1856\u20131859, 5 members)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49758939 |title=The Victorian Parliament |work=South Australian Register |publisher=Trove |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|'''Member 1'''\n!
