During the Mahabharata period, it was known as [[Matsya Kingdom]] and extended to the [[Sarasvati River]]. This was because the first clan ruling this region, in the Mahabharata period, were descendants of fishermen. So the [[Veda]]s were supposed to be written and compiled on this very land.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sahiram: Ek adh\u016br\u012b kr\u0101nti, Shekhawati k\u0101 kis\u0101n \u0101ndolan (1922-1952), page-2</ref><ref>Satapatha Brahman 13/5/9</ref> During ancient times this region was divided into several [[janapada]]s.

It is used, for example, in [[garden]]s, [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], [[urban agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In [[ecosystems]], compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]).\n\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called [[green waste]]), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into [[humus]] after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The [[decomposition]] process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. [[Fungus|Fungi]], [[earthworm]]s and other [[detritivore]]s further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function ([[aerobic bacteria]]) and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonium]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|thumb|Home compost barrel]]\n[[File:Compost pile.JPG|thumb|Materials in a compost pile]]\n[[File:Food-scraps-compost.jpg|thumb|Food scraps compost heap]]\n\nComposting is an ''aerobic method'' (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3BhSAAAAMAAJ&q=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&dq=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material|title=Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science|last=Masters|first=Gilbert M.|date=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131553842|language=en}}</ref> It can therefore be used to recycle organic material.

However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that, in fact, modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are skeptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly. {{citation needed|reason=Very old reference, find a better one|date=May 2015}}\n\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating [[phytotoxic]] substances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nAn alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation, known as [[#Bokashi|bokashi]].

Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]].\n\n===Animal manure and bedding===\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal [[manure]] generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.<ref>Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.</ref>\n\n=== Human waste and sewage sludge ===\n{{Further|Reuse of human waste}}\n[[Human waste]] can  be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, as in [[composting toilets]], or indirectly (as [[sewage sludge]]), after it has undergone treatment in a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]].  Feces contain a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms and its use in home composting can pose significant health risks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Domestic waste composting facilities: a review of human health risks.|journal = Environment International|volume = 35|issue = 2|pages = 382\u20139|date = August 2012|pmid = 18701167|last1 = Domingo|first1 = J.

Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as [[Housefly|houseflies]] or [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]]), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Main|Uses of compost}}\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'' as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and [[nutrient]]s. Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, bark chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]]. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/rrr/greenscapes/pubs/asla-soil.pdf|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|website=US EPA|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of [[phytotoxin]]s in immature compost that may inhibit germination,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morel | first1 = P. | last2 = Guillemain | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Assessment of the possible phytotoxicity of a substrate using an easy and representative biotest | url = | journal = Acta Horticulturae | volume = | issue = 644| pages = 417\u2013423 | doi = 10.17660/ActaHortic.2004.644.55 }}</ref><ref>It\u00e4vaara et al.

It [[Homolactic fermentation|ferments]] (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the [[soil food web]] (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding [[Lactobacillus|''Lactobacilli'']] to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s to [[lactic acid]], which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to [[pyruvate]], which enables soil life to consume the result.\n\nBokashi is typically applied to [[food waste]] from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers (\"bokashi bins\") typically give a batch size of {{convert|5\u201310|kg}}, accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.[[File:Bokashi bin - inside.JPG|thumb|Inside a recently started bokashi bin. Food scraps are raised on a perforated plate (to drain runoff) and are partly covered by a layer of bran inoculated with ''Lactobacilli'']]\n\nBokashi offers several advantages:\n* Fermentation retains all the original carbon and energy. (In comparison, composting loses at least 50% of these and 75% or more in amateur use; composting also loses nitrogen, a [[Plant nutrition|macronutrient]] of plants, by emitting ammonia and the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Practical Handbook of Compost Engineering|last=Haug|first=Roger Tim|publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-87371-373-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Virtually the full range of food waste is accepted, without the exclusions of composting. The exception is large bones.\n* Being airtight, the container inherently traps smells, and when opened the smell of fermentation is far less offensive than decomposition. Hence bokashi bins usually operate indoors, in or near kitchens.\n* Similarly the container neither attracts insect pests nor allows them ingress.\n* The process is inherently hygienic because lactic acid is a natural [[bactericide]] and anti-[[pathogen]]; even its own fermentation is self-limiting.\n* Both preservation and consumption complete within a few weeks rather than months.\n* The preserve can be stored until needed, for example if ground is frozen or waterlogged.\n* The increased activity of the soil food web improves the soil texture, especially by worm action - in effect this is in-soil [[vermicomposting]].\n\nThe importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any [[ecosystem]] depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within [[Soil#Water|soil water]]. Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).\n\n=== Other systems at household level===\n==== {{anchor|H\u00fcgelkultur}}H\u00fcgelkultur (raised garden beds or mounds) ====\n[[File:End point (4315712587).jpg|thumb|upright|An almost completed H\u00fcgelkultur bed; the bed does not have soil on it yet.]]\n{{Main|H\u00fcgelkultur}}\nThe practice of making raised garden beds or mounds filled with rotting wood is also called ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' in German.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ |title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds |publisher=Richsoil.com |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref><ref name=\"permaculture.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2010/08/03/the-art-and-science-of-making-a-hugelkultur-bed-transforming-woody-debris-into-a-garden-resource/ |title=The Art and Science of Making a Hugelkultur Bed - Transforming Woody Debris into a Garden Resource Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2010-08-03|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> It is in effect creating a [[nurse log]] that is covered with soil.\n\nBenefits of ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' garden beds include water retention and warming of soil.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 |title=Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2012-01-04|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> Buried wood acts like a [[sponge (material)|sponge]] as it decomposes, able to capture water and store it for later use by crops planted on top of the ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' bed.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009).

This process [[Recycling|recycles]] various [[Organic matter|organic materials]] otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a [[soil conditioner]] (the ''compost'').\n\nCompost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in [[garden]]s, [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], [[urban agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In [[ecosystems]], compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]).\n\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called [[green waste]]), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into [[humus]] after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The [[decomposition]] process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. [[Fungus|Fungi]], [[earthworm]]s and other [[detritivore]]s further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function ([[aerobic bacteria]]) and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonium]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|thumb|Home compost barrel]]\n[[File:Compost pile.JPG|thumb|Materials in a compost pile]]\n[[File:Food-scraps-compost.jpg|thumb|Food scraps compost heap]]\n\nComposting is an ''aerobic method'' (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3BhSAAAAMAAJ&q=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&dq=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material|title=Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science|last=Masters|first=Gilbert M.|date=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131553842|language=en}}</ref> It can therefore be used to recycle organic material.

Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf|title=The Rapid Compost Method by Robert Raabe, Professor of Plant Pathology, Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that, in fact, modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are skeptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly. {{citation needed|reason=Very old reference, find a better one|date=May 2015}}\n\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating [[phytotoxic]] substances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nAn alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation, known as [[#Bokashi|bokashi]]. It retains carbon bonds, is faster than decomposition, and for application to soil requires only rapid but thorough aeration rather than curing. It depends on sufficient carbohydrates in the treated material.\n\n===Pathogen removal===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nComposting can destroy [[pathogen]]s or unwanted [[seed]]s. Unwanted living plants (or [[weed]]s) can be discouraged by [[Mulch#Mulching (composting) over unwanted plants|covering with mulch/compost]]. The \"[[biopesticide|microbial pesticides]]\" in compost may include [[thermophile]]s and [[mesophile]]s.\n\nThermophilic (high-temperature) composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens (exceptions may include [[prion]]s). The [[Disinfection|sanitizing]] qualities of ([[thermophilic]]) composting are desirable where there is a high likelihood of pathogens, such as with [[manure]].\n\n== Materials that can be composted ==\nComposting is a process used for [[resource recovery]]. It can [[recycle]] an unwanted by-product from another process (a [[waste]]) into a useful new product.\n\n=== Organic solid waste (green waste) ===\n[[File:Spontaneous combustion of compost pile.jpg|thumb|A large compost pile that is steaming with the heat generated by [[thermophile|thermophilic]] microorganisms.]]\n\nComposting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore, valuable [[landfill]] space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from [[municipal solid waste]].\n\nCo-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered [[fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]].<ref name=\"tilley2\" />\n\nIndustrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an [[advanced waste processing systems|advanced waste processing system]]. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] digestion or in-vessel composting is called [[mechanical biological treatment]]. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]].\n\n===Animal manure and bedding===\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal [[manure]] generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.<ref>Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.</ref>\n\n=== Human waste and sewage sludge ===\n{{Further|Reuse of human waste}}\n[[Human waste]] can  be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, as in [[composting toilets]], or indirectly (as [[sewage sludge]]), after it has undergone treatment in a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]].  Feces contain a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms and its use in home composting can pose significant health risks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Domestic waste composting facilities: a review of human health risks.|journal = Environment International|volume = 35|issue = 2|pages = 382\u20139|date = August 2012|pmid = 18701167|last1 = Domingo|first1 = J.

Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as [[Housefly|houseflies]] or [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]]), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Main|Uses of compost}}\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'' as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and [[nutrient]]s. Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, bark chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]]. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil.

It [[Homolactic fermentation|ferments]] (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the [[soil food web]] (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding [[Lactobacillus|''Lactobacilli'']] to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s to [[lactic acid]], which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to [[pyruvate]], which enables soil life to consume the result.\n\nBokashi is typically applied to [[food waste]] from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers (\"bokashi bins\") typically give a batch size of {{convert|5\u201310|kg}}, accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.[[File:Bokashi bin - inside.JPG|thumb|Inside a recently started bokashi bin. Food scraps are raised on a perforated plate (to drain runoff) and are partly covered by a layer of bran inoculated with ''Lactobacilli'']]\n\nBokashi offers several advantages:\n* Fermentation retains all the original carbon and energy. (In comparison, composting loses at least 50% of these and 75% or more in amateur use; composting also loses nitrogen, a [[Plant nutrition|macronutrient]] of plants, by emitting ammonia and the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Practical Handbook of Compost Engineering|last=Haug|first=Roger Tim|publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-87371-373-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Virtually the full range of food waste is accepted, without the exclusions of composting. The exception is large bones.\n* Being airtight, the container inherently traps smells, and when opened the smell of fermentation is far less offensive than decomposition. Hence bokashi bins usually operate indoors, in or near kitchens.\n* Similarly the container neither attracts insect pests nor allows them ingress.\n* The process is inherently hygienic because lactic acid is a natural [[bactericide]] and anti-[[pathogen]]; even its own fermentation is self-limiting.\n* Both preservation and consumption complete within a few weeks rather than months.\n* The preserve can be stored until needed, for example if ground is frozen or waterlogged.\n* The increased activity of the soil food web improves the soil texture, especially by worm action - in effect this is in-soil [[vermicomposting]].\n\nThe importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any [[ecosystem]] depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within [[Soil#Water|soil water]]. Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).\n\n=== Other systems at household level===\n==== {{anchor|H\u00fcgelkultur}}H\u00fcgelkultur (raised garden beds or mounds) ====\n[[File:End point (4315712587).jpg|thumb|upright|An almost completed H\u00fcgelkultur bed; the bed does not have soil on it yet.]]\n{{Main|H\u00fcgelkultur}}\nThe practice of making raised garden beds or mounds filled with rotting wood is also called ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' in German.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ |title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds |publisher=Richsoil.com |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref><ref name=\"permaculture.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2010/08/03/the-art-and-science-of-making-a-hugelkultur-bed-transforming-woody-debris-into-a-garden-resource/ |title=The Art and Science of Making a Hugelkultur Bed - Transforming Woody Debris into a Garden Resource Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2010-08-03|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> It is in effect creating a [[nurse log]] that is covered with soil.\n\nBenefits of ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' garden beds include water retention and warming of soil.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 |title=Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2012-01-04|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> Buried wood acts like a [[sponge (material)|sponge]] as it decomposes, able to capture water and store it for later use by crops planted on top of the ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' bed.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009).

The advantage of this method is that little working time or effort is required from the composter and it fits in naturally with agricultural practices in temperate climates. Disadvantages (from the modern perspective) are that space is used for a whole year, some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall, and disease-producing organisms and insects may not be adequately controlled.\n\nComposting was somewhat modernized beginning in the 1920s in Europe as a tool for [[organic farming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/history.cfm|title=History of Composting|publisher=illinois.edu|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in [[Wels]], Austria in the year 1921.<ref>Welser Anzeiger vom 05.

Fredericks declares: \"Nowhere are we given to believe that there are some respects in which Buddhists and Christians are simply baffling to one another because their religious visions are incompatible. I also worry that the more Buddhism is enlisted into service of Christian faith as an ''ancilla theologiae'' [handmaid to theology], the less it seems like Buddhism.\"<ref>J. Fredericks' pertaining review entitled \"The Lotus Position,\" ''Commonweal Magazine'', April 5th, 2010.</ref>\n\nIn reference to ''Without Buddha I Could Not Be a Christian'', [[Robert Magliola]] asserts, in the ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' (''JAAR'')<ref>R. Magliola's pertaining review in ''JAAR'', Vol. 78, No. 4 (Dec., 2010), pp. 1215-1218.</ref> that Paul Knitter \"is not Catholic enough because he is not Buddhist enough and vice versa.\" Quoting [Rev.] Francis X. Clooney, S.J.'s assertion, in Clooney's ''Jesuit Postmodern'' (2006, p. 165) that comparisons \"seem not to fit into a single, coherent view,\" Magliola points out that Knitter's proposed \"one universal Spirit\" perpetuates the outdated modernist notion of \"equable holism\" or \"openness\" (the \"modern idol\") rather than the \"jagged, asymmetrical\" nature of reality.<ref>P. 1218.</ref>   \n\n\n\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Religion}}\n* [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Union Theological Seminary (New York City)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Knitter, Paul F.}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Pontifical Gregorian University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Marburg alumni]]\n[[Category:Union Theological Seminary (New York City) faculty]]\n[[Category:1939 births]]\n[[Category:People from Chicago]]\n\n\n{{US-theologian-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox academic\n| name               = Paul F.

Fredericks declares: \"Nowhere are we given to believe that there are some respects in which Buddhists and Christians are simply baffling to one another because their religious visions are incompatible. I also worry that the more Buddhism is enlisted into service of Christian faith as an ''ancilla theologiae'' [handmaid to theology], the less it seems like Buddhism.\"<ref>J. Fredericks' pertaining review entitled \"The Lotus Position\", ''Commonweal Magazine'', April 5th, 2010.</ref>\n\nIn reference to ''Without Buddha I Could Not Be a Christian'', [[Robert Magliola]] asserts, in the ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' (''JAAR'')<ref>R. Magliola's pertaining review in ''JAAR'', Vol. 78, No. 4 (Dec., 2010), pp. 1215-1218.</ref> that Paul Knitter \"is not Catholic enough because he is not Buddhist enough and vice versa.\" Quoting [Rev.] Francis X. Clooney, S.J.'s assertion, in Clooney's ''Jesuit Postmodern'' (2006, p. 165) that comparisons \"seem not to fit into a single, coherent view,\" Magliola points out that Knitter's proposed \"one universal Spirit\" perpetuates the outdated modernist notion of \"equable holism\" or \"openness\" (the \"modern idol\") rather than the \"jagged, asymmetrical\" nature of reality.<ref>P. 1218.</ref>   \n\n\n\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Religion}}\n* [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Union Theological Seminary (New York City)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Knitter, Paul F.}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Pontifical Gregorian University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Marburg alumni]]\n[[Category:Union Theological Seminary (New York City) faculty]]\n[[Category:1939 births]]\n[[Category:People from Chicago]]\n\n\n{{US-theologian-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Grignotageallemand", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed punctuation error.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_F._Knitter"}
