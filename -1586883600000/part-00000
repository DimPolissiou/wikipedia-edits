They gave much of their financial support for initiatives in the field of culture. Their father, \u0110or\u0111e Simi\u0107 was a captain of the Rasina under [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] during the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. \n\nHe acquisitioned ''chrysobull' of the [[Ravanica]] monastery, which he brought from [[Walachia]], and his activity for the organization of the Belgrade's [[Grandes \u00e9coles]]. He also had a palace built in the present center of Belgrade, which housed the Serbian court between 1842 and 1903 (the year of the assassination of King Alexander and Queen Draga). In 1903, the building was demolished and a few years later, the New Royal Palace was built on the same site.

They are remanded to Wilton Reform School, where Muggs, the wise-cracking leader of the gang, is dubbed \"Mr. Wise Guy\" by the brutal guard Jed Miller (Dick Ryan).\n\nJim Barnes ([[Jack Mulhall]]), the new warden, reassures Danny's older brother Bill ([[Douglas Fowley]]), who has bad memories of the school from when he served as a guard there, that his testimony describing the place's cruelty eventually resulted in the dismissal of the former warden and the adoption of gentler rules. Bill is given a tour of the school by Barnes's secretary, Ann Mitchell ([[Joan Barclay]]), and later takes her out to dinner.\n\nThat night, while Bill buys cigarettes in a drugstore, escaped convict Luke Manning ([[Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams|Guinn Williams]]) robs the place and murders the clerk. Manning takes Bill hostage in his car and forces him to lead the police on a chase. Manning escapes when Bill crashes the car, and Bill is later convicted of robbery and murder and sentenced to execution.\n\nIn the reform school, the boys have been battling with two toughs, \"Rice Pudding\" Charlie([[Gabriel Dell]]) and Chalky Jones ([[Bobby Stone]]), but when Barnes witnesses Miller encouraging a fistfight, he demands Miller's resignation. Chalky tries to get the kids in trouble by informing Barnes of their plans to run away, but in an effort to establish a code of honor, Barnes punishes Chalky for being an informer.\n\nWhen Muggs and his pals see newsreel footage of a man and woman accepting the winnings from a lottery, they recognize the man as Knobby ([[Billy Gilbert]]), the driver of the stolen truck. They link Knobby to Manning based on information given to them by Charlie, who is Manning's nephew. Armed with information that could prove Bill's innocence, the boys escape from the reform school and go to the apartment of Dorothy Melton ([[Ann Doran]]), the woman from the newsreel. The kids hold the pair, who had been planning to leave town with the lottery money which actually belongs to Manning, who was afraid of being seen. Manning appears at Dorothy's apartment to demand his money and hits Dorothy for double-crossing him with Knobby. Before the situation can worsen, the police arrive and arrest the criminals. Bill gets a reprieve from the governor, and Ann and the boys see him off as he reports for active military duty.

It opened in 1938 as one of the most modern cinemas of its type at the time with seating for 2200 people. The cinema officially closed in 1988 but has held numerous events since including being used as a nightclub, however the building had fallen into disrepair and in 2019 was undergoing conversion into a pub.\n\n==History==\n[[File:State cinema grays logo.jpg|left|thumb|State Cinema logo]]The building itself was designed by architect Frederick Chancellor of Frank Matcham & Co and owned by Frederick's Electric Theatres Company.  It was built at a cost of \u00a3100,000 and twenty houses in George Street were demolished to make room for it. Once complete it was one of the largest cinemas in Essex, it featured air conditioning and an illuminated Compton Organ.  It also had full stage facilities enable it to change into a fully functioning theatre or live entertainment venue.  The cinema opened its doors at 7:30pm on Monday 5 September 1938 showing the film [[The Hurricane (1937 film)|The Hurricane]].\n\nIn the 1970s the first signs of possible closure reared its head, the stalls were closed off, cuts to staffing were made and the organ fell silent. A campaign was launched to keep the cinema open and the then owners, [[Mecca Leisure Group]], decided to spend \u00a320,000 on improvements to bring audiences back to the old cinema.\n\nIn 1982 work began to restore the old organ by a group of volunteers who later became known as \"Friends of the State\", eight weeks later music was again heard in the building and a series of Sunday afternoon concerts were held, many of which were attended by recording enthusiasts who wanted to capture the sounds of the unique organ.<ref>[http://www.statecinema.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=24.msg106#msg106 When did the State originally close?]</ref>\n\nThe building remained unaltered throughout its life as a cinema, perhaps due in part to its location or not demanding further screens. Once again falling audiences, possibly due to the development of multi-screen cinemas and the rising popularity of video film rental saw the State threatened with closure in the mid 1980s. Owners Mecca eventually left the building, a closing night event was held on 5 September 1988 and the film that opened the cinema 50 years ago to the day was shown once more.<ref>[http://www.statecinema.co.uk/history.htm State Cinema History]</ref>\n\nThe land and the cinema were earmarked for redevelopment and bulldozers were soon brought in, however a preservation order was quickly sought and the State became a Grade II listed building preventing its demolition.\n\nAfter the closure the cinema was handed over to a small independent operator who in 1989 rebadged the building \"The Grays State Theatre\". Films continued to be shown and organ concerts were once again a feature of the programme as was the \u00a31 entry ticket. Alas, the business model didn't provide enough income to sustain the cinema and it closed again soon after.\n\n[[File:Charlestons downstairs bar2.jpg|left|thumb|Charlestons nightclub bar]]In 1991 the building again came back into use, this time as a wine bar and nightclub called Charlestons.  It opened at 8:30pm on Thursday 28 January and included live music from [[The Merseybeats]] and [[Dave Berry (musician)|Dave Berry and the Cruisers]].  More live music, a number of variety and film shows plus several boxing matches were held at the venue, and the club also saw the return of the Sunday organ concerts.  The club lasted for seven years before closing in 1998.\n\nThe local council received a planning application in August 1998 from the [[Peniel Pentecostal Church]] to establish a church in the now disused building.

The Melotone sounds were fed through a large [[horn loudspeaker]] which is still present in the organ chambers at the State\n\n<br />Cinemas of the 1920s and 30s usually had pipe organs installed, originally as a means of accompanying silent films but then to provide musical entertainment before and after the film shows and during intervals.\n\nIn the UK there were nearly 500 such organs in cinemas by 1939, however fewer than 80 now survive in one form or another and only a handful of these are still in their original buildings.\n\nIn July 2011, the State Cinema was broken into and a significant number of metal fixtures and fittings was taken.
