The canal fell into disrepair in the late 20th century, but much of the canal has since been restored for navigation. The length of the canal to the [[River Shannon]] was reopened on 1 October 2010, but the final spur branch of the canal to Longford Town remains closed.\n\n==History==\nIn 1755, Thomas Williams and John Cooley made a survey to find a suitable route for a man-made waterway across north Leinster from Dublin to the Shannon. They originally planned to use a series of rivers and lakes, including the Boyne, Blackwater, Deel, Yellow, Camlin and Inny and Lough Derravaragh. A disgruntled director of the Grand Canal Company sought support to build a canal from Dublin to Cloondara, on the Shannon in West County Longford.\n\nWork on this massive project commenced in 1790 and lasted 27 years before finally reaching the Shannon in 1817, at a total cost of \u00a31,421,954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~rcag/history/canal.html|publisher=Royal Canal Action Group|title=History|accessdate=14 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003055953/http://homepage.eircom.net/~rcag/history/canal.html|archivedate=3 October 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Building was unexpectedly expensive and the project was riven with problems; in 1794 the Royal Canal Company was declared bankrupt. The Duke of Leinster, a board member, insisted that the new waterway take in his local town of [[Maynooth]]. The builders had to deviate from the planned route and necessitated the construction of a 'deep sinking' between Blanchardstown and Clonsilla.\nThe diversion also called for the building of the Ryewater Aqueduct, at Leixlip.<ref>http://www.irishidentity.com/extras/places/stories/canal.htm</ref>\n\nThe original 1796 fare from Dublin to Kilcock was 1/1, much cheaper than the stagecoach.\n\nThe canal passes through [[Maynooth]], [[Kilcock]], [[Enfield, County Meath|Enfield]], [[Mullingar]] and [[Ballymahon]] has a spur to [[Longford Town, Longford|Longford]]. The total length of the main navigation is {{convert|145|km|mi}}, and the system has 46 locks. There is one main feeder (from [[Lough Owel]]), which enters the canal at Mullingar.\n\nIn 200 years it has been maintained by eight successive agencies: the Royal Canal Company, the Commissioners of Inland Navigation, the New Royal Canal Company, Midland Great Western Railway Company, Great Southern Railways, CI\u00c9, and (from 1986) the Office of Public Works.\n\nDuring the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Famine]], \u201cthe missing 1,490\u201d starving tenants of Denis Mahon in [[Strokestown Park|Strokestown House]], Roscommon, set out on foot from the estate in May 1847. Major Mahon had offered them the choice of emigration through \u201cassisted passage\u201d, starvation on their blighted potato patch farms or a place in the terrifying local workhouse. These families weakened by starvation walked for days along the towpaths of the Royal Canal to Dublin, where they were put on boats to Liverpool, and from there to Quebec aboard four \u201ccoffin ships\u201d \u2013 cargo ships, ironically loaded with grain from Ireland, and unsuitable for passengers. It is estimated that half died before reaching Grosse \u00cele in Canada. It was the largest single disposal of inconvenient tenants during the Famine. Major Mahon was shot dead that November after news had got back to Roscommon about the fate of his former tenants. An annual walk on the canal banks commemorates the events.\n\nBy the 1830s the canal carried 80,000 tons of freight and 40,000 passengers a year.[[File:William Rowan Hamilton Plaque - geograph.org.uk - 347941.jpg|right|thumb|[[Quaternion]] plaque on [[Broom Bridge|Brougham (Broom) Bridge]], Dublin]]\n[[File:Ferns' Lock - about 3 Km west of Kilcock, Co. Kildare..jpg|right|thumb|Ferns' Lock]] In 1843, while walking with his wife along the Royal Canal, Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]] realised the formula for [[quaternion]]s and carved his initial thoughts into a stone on the [[Broom Bridge]] over the canal.  The annual [[Hamilton Walk]] commemorates this event. In 1845 the canal was bought by the Midland Great Western Railway Company. They considered draining the canal and building a new railway along its bed but decided instead to build the railway beside the canal. The two run side by side from Dublin to Mullingar. Competition from the railways gradually eroded the canal's business and by the 1880s annual tonnage was down to about 30,000 and the passenger traffic had all but disappeared.\n\nIt had a brief resurgence during [[World War II]], when horses and barges returned to the canal. CI\u00c9 took over the canal in 1944. As rail and road traffic increased, the canal fell into disuse. In 1974, volunteers from the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland formed the Royal Canal Amenity Group to save the canal. By 1990 they had 74 kilometres of canal, from the 12th lock in Blanchardstown to Mullingar, open again for navigation. In 2000, the canal was taken over by Waterways Ireland, a cross-border body charged with administering Ireland's inland navigations. On 1 October 2010, the whole length of the canal was formally reopened.\n\n[[File:New Famine Way memorial, the Mills, Talbot Bridge, 12thLock, Royal Canal, Castleknock Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|Famine Way memorial, 12th Lock]]\n\n== Transport links ==\n\nThe Royal Canal was originally planned to terminate in Dublin at [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]], to serve the then fashionable area of residence, as well as [[King's Inns]] and the nearby markets, but it was extended so that now, at the Dublin end, the canal reaches the Liffey through a wide sequence of dock and locks at Spencer Dock, with a final sea lock to manage access to the river and sea.\n\nThe Dublin \u2013 Mullingar railway line was built alongside the canal for much of its length.

The canal fell into disrepair in the late 20th century, but much of the canal has since been restored for navigation. The length of the canal to the [[River Shannon]] was reopened on 1 October 2010, but the final spur branch of the canal to Longford Town remains closed.\n\n==History==\nIn 1755, Thomas Williams and John Cooley made a survey to find a suitable route for a man-made waterway across north Leinster from Dublin to the Shannon. They originally planned to use a series of rivers and lakes, including the Boyne, Blackwater, Deel, Yellow, Camlin and Inny and Lough Derravaragh. A disgruntled director of the Grand Canal Company sought support to build a canal from Dublin to Cloondara, on the Shannon in West County Longford.\n\nWork on this massive project commenced in 1790 and lasted 27 years before finally reaching the Shannon in 1817, at a total cost of \u00a31,421,954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~rcag/history/canal.html|publisher=Royal Canal Action Group|title=History|accessdate=14 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003055953/http://homepage.eircom.net/~rcag/history/canal.html|archivedate=3 October 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Building was unexpectedly expensive and the project was riven with problems; in 1794 the Royal Canal Company was declared bankrupt. The Duke of Leinster, a board member, insisted that the new waterway take in his local town of Maynooth. The builders had to deviate from the planned route and necessitated the construction of a 'deep sinking' between Blanchardstown and Clonsilla.\nThe diversion also called for the building of the Ryewater Aqueduct, at Leixlip.<ref>http://www.irishidentity.com/extras/places/stories/canal.htm</ref>\n\nThe original 1796 fare from Dublin to Kilcock was 1/1, much cheaper than the stagecoach.\n\nThe canal passes through [[Maynooth]], [[Kilcock]], [[Enfield, County Meath|Enfield]], [[Mullingar]] and [[Ballymahon]] has a spur to [[Longford Town, Longford|Longford]]. The total length of the main navigation is {{convert|145|km|mi}}, and the system has 46 locks. There is one main feeder (from [[Lough Owel]]), which enters the canal at Mullingar.\n\nIn 200 years it has been maintained by eight successive agencies: the Royal Canal Company, the Commissioners of Inland Navigation, the New Royal Canal Company, Midland Great Western Railway Company, Great Southern Railways, CI\u00c9, and (from 1986) the Office of Public Works.\n\nDuring the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Famine]], \u201cthe missing 1,490\u201d starving tenants of Denis Mahon in [[Strokestown Park|Strokestown House]], Roscommon, set out on foot from the estate in May 1847. Major Mahon had offered them the choice of emigration through \u201cassisted passage\u201d, starvation on their blighted potato patch farms or a place in the terrifying local workhouse. These families weakened by starvation walked for days along the towpaths of the Royal Canal to Dublin, where they were put on boats to Liverpool, and from there to Quebec aboard four \u201ccoffin ships\u201d \u2013 cargo ships, ironically loaded with grain from Ireland, and unsuitable for passengers. It is estimated that half died before reaching Grosse \u00cele in Canada. It was the largest single disposal of inconvenient tenants during the Famine. Major Mahon was shot dead that November after news had got back to Roscommon about the fate of his former tenants. An annual walk on the canal banks commemorates the events.\n\nBy the 1830s the canal carried 80,000 tons of freight and 40,000 passengers a year.[[File:William Rowan Hamilton Plaque - geograph.org.uk - 347941.jpg|right|thumb|[[Quaternion]] plaque on [[Broom Bridge|Brougham (Broom) Bridge]], Dublin]]\n[[File:Ferns' Lock - about 3 Km west of Kilcock, Co. Kildare..jpg|right|thumb|Ferns' Lock]] In 1843, while walking with his wife along the Royal Canal, Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]] realised the formula for [[quaternion]]s and carved his initial thoughts into a stone on the [[Broom Bridge]] over the canal.  The annual [[Hamilton Walk]] commemorates this event. In 1845 the canal was bought by the Midland Great Western Railway Company. They considered draining the canal and building a new railway along its bed but decided instead to build the railway beside the canal. The two run side by side from Dublin to Mullingar. Competition from the railways gradually eroded the canal's business and by the 1880s annual tonnage was down to about 30,000 and the passenger traffic had all but disappeared.\n\nIt had a brief resurgence during [[World War II]], when horses and barges returned to the canal. CI\u00c9 took over the canal in 1944. As rail and road traffic increased, the canal fell into disuse. In 1974, volunteers from the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland formed the Royal Canal Amenity Group to save the canal. By 1990 they had 74 kilometres of canal, from the 12th lock in Blanchardstown to Mullingar, open again for navigation. In 2000, the canal was taken over by Waterways Ireland, a cross-border body charged with administering Ireland's inland navigations. On 1 October 2010, the whole length of the canal was formally reopened.\n\n[[File:New Famine Way memorial, the Mills, Talbot Bridge, 12thLock, Royal Canal, Castleknock Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|Famine Way memorial, 12th Lock]]\n\n== Transport links ==\n\nThe Royal Canal was originally planned to terminate in Dublin at [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]], to serve the then fashionable area of residence, as well as [[King's Inns]] and the nearby markets, but it was extended so that now, at the Dublin end, the canal reaches the Liffey through a wide sequence of dock and locks at Spencer Dock, with a final sea lock to manage access to the river and sea.\n\nThe Dublin \u2013 Mullingar railway line was built alongside the canal for much of its length. The meandering route of the canal resulted in many speed-limiting curves on the railway. The canal was bought by the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] to provide a route to the West of Ireland, the original plan being to close the canal and build the railway along its bed.\n\nThe canal travels across one of the major junctions on the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]]/[[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] in a specially constructed aqueduct.\n\n== Present day ==\n\nToday [[Waterways Ireland]] is responsible for the canal, and it was under their stewardship, in association with the Royal Canal Amenity Group, that the Royal Canal was officially reopened from Dublin to the Shannon on 2 October 2010.<ref name=\"indo\">{{cite news|last=Ellis|first=Fiona|title=Crowds gather to push boat out for reopening of restored Royal Canal|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/crowds-gather-to-push-boat-out-for-reopening-of-restored-royal-canal-2361813.html|accessdate=2 October 2010|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=2 October 2010}}</ref> Access points currently exist near [[Leixlip]] and at [[Maynooth]], [[Enfield, County Meath|Enfield]], Thomastown, Mullingar, Ballinea Bridge and [[Ballynacargy]].\n\nIn 2006, a commemoration marker was erected at Piper's Boreen, Mullingar, to mark the 200 years since the canal reached Mullingar in 1806.\n\n==Royal Canal Way==\n[[File:EuroVelo Route 2.svg|thumb|Map of the [[EV2 The Capitals Route|EuroVelo 2]] route.]]\nThe Royal Canal Way is a {{convert|144|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[long-distance trail]] that follows the towpath of the canal from [[Ashtown, Dublin]] to [[Cloondara]], County Longford.<ref name=\"Trails\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtrails.ie/trail/Royal-Canal-Way/28/ |title=Royal Canal Way |work=IrishTrails |publisher=[[Irish Sports Council]] |accessdate=8 August 2011 }}</ref> It is typically completed in three days.<ref name=\"Trails\" /> It is designated as a [[Long-distance trails in the Republic of Ireland|National Waymarked Trail]] by the National Trails Office of the [[Irish Sports Council]] and is managed by Waterways Ireland.<ref name=\"Trails\" /> In 2015, Dublin City Council began extending the walking and cycling route along the Royal Canal from Ashtown to [[Sheriff Street|Sheriff Street Upper]].

It is among the poshest and popular districts of Delhi. The Locality falls under Category 'A' of residential colonies in Delhi alongside other Category 'A' colonies like [[Greater Kailash]], Defense Colony, and [[Gulmohar Park]]. The neighbourhood registered a 4.4% growth in residential sales and was recently featured alongside [[Greater Kailash]] , Defense Colony, [[Vasant Vihar]] and Anand Niketan in the 2019 edition of [[Knight Frank]] 's quarterly report on prime luxury residential properties in various megacities around the globe. \n\nThe locality is divided into two parts i.e. Main and Extension.\n\n==Real Estate==\nEstablished in the early 1960's, Green Park today is among the most desired neighborhoods in the capital city. The Locality not only has its very own metro station on the yellow line but also has numerous professionally maintained parks in each block. It has its own prime market which hosts numerous chic salons, boutiques and eating joints. It also borders the famous Deer Park which is known to be among the very few large green spaces left in today's heavily urbanized Delhi. The real estate market however has been witnessing a downturn due to the increased circle rates of the colony. This has discouraged fresh purchases of builder floors and independent villas in the colony which now cost anywhere between INR 6-50 crores (US $800,000 - $7,000,000). The plot sizes are plenty and range from 200 sq. yards to 1500 sq.yards. Rental values have however witnessed a constant increase due to the direct metro connectivity and plenty of other facilities which other colonies of New Delhi lack. To address the parking problems in the colony due to the heavy footfall, two multilevel parking towers are being built near the metro station which will accommodate 60-70 cars at a given time. \n\n==History==\nIt was established in the early 1960's and today has all the amenities of a rich cosmopolitan culture along with large residential and commercial areas and many religious places. Green Park is considered by some as the \"lungs\" of Delhi, as it is near one of the largest green areas in the city. It is also believed to be an upscale residential area with real estate prices soaring as high as \u20b9100 crore (US $14.5 million). It is part of the [[New Delhi (Lok Sabha constituency)]], and its current electorate member is [[Meenakshi Lekhi]] of [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]]\n\nIt is divided into two parts : Green Park Main and Green Park Extension. The Main hosts a medium-sized market with several restaurants and a shopping complex. The Extension mostly consists of residential areas.\nIt has a number of open and wooded spaces in its vicinity - Deer Park, District Park and Rose Garden. These are very popular areas with morning walkers and laughter clubs.\n\nThe [[Uphaar Cinema fire]], one of the worst fire tragedies in recent Indian history, occurred on Friday, 13 June 1997 at Uphaar Cinema, near Green Park Extension Block A, Delhi, during the premiere screening of [[Border (1997 film)|Border]], a Hindi movie. 59 people died and 103 were seriously injured in the subsequent stampede; most of the victims were trapped on the balcony and were asphyxiated as they tried to reach dimly marked exits to escape the smoke and fire, and found the doors locked.\n\nThe fire broke out at 5:10 pm, after the transformer at the parking level burst, and 20 cars in the parking lot caught fire, eventually leading to a large scale fire in the five-storey building which housed the cinema hall and several offices. The cinema hall was situated in one of the busiest areas of South Delhi and the fire services were delayed owing to the heavy evening traffic. At least 48 fire tenders were pressed into service at 5.20 p.m. and it took them over an hour to put out the fire. Later the dead and the injured were rushed to the nearby All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Safdarjung Hospital, where scenes of chaos and pandemonium followed, as relatives and family members of the victims scurried around to look for known faces.\n\nThe victims of the tragedy and the families of the deceased later formed 'The Association of Victims of Uphaar Fire Tragedy' (AVUT), which filed the landmark Civil compensation case and won Rs 25 crore (Rs 250 million) in civil compensation for the relatives and families of victims, the judgment is now considered a breakthrough in Compensation Law in India; today they meet at every anniversary at 'Smriti Upavan' memorial, outside the hall, where a prayer meeting is held. However the Supreme Court on 13/10/2011 nearly halved the sum of compensation awarded to them by the Delhi high court and slashed punitive damages to be paid by cinema owners Ansal brothers from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 25 lakh.\nContents\n\n==Geography==\nIt is bounded on the 4 sides by major avenues: Inner Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, Aurobindo Marg and Africa Avenue.
