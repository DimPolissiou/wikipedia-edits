For example, a 2009 survey conducted by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) revealed that substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was higher than children raised by their biological parents. However, the percentage of substance abuse amongst children raised by single-mothers was not only remarkably low (5.4%), but also only 1.2% higher than children raised by both their parents.<ref name=\"National Survey on Drug Use and Health\">{{cite web|url=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|title=National Survey on Drug Use and Health|website=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|date=2009}}</ref> Those rates reveal to be even smaller when compared to other demographics of the same time period. According surveys commissioned by to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] between 20%\u201330% of teenagers used/abused illicit substances, a much higher rate than single-mother households.<ref name=\"Youth Substance Abuse, NIDA\">{{cite web|url=https://drugabuse.com/library/drug-abuse-statistics/|title=Drug Abuse Statistics, NIDA|date=1997\u20132014}}</ref> Another example of poorly cited statistics to further this narrative can be found in children who have lost at least one parent. In the U.S., the rate of parental death before age 16 is 8%. The rate of parental death is disproportionately high for prisoners (30%\u201350%), however, it is also disproportionately high for high-performing scientists (26%) and US presidents (34%). Harvard's Baker Foundation Professor, Emerita, Dr. Teresa M. Amabile states, \"Those kinds of events can crush a child, they can lead to a lot of problems; they can lead to substance abuse, they can lead to various forms of emotional illness.

However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.\n\nData from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative. Since 1999, out of 145 US school shootings committed by children/adolescents, 80% of the guns used were taken from their homes or relative's home.<ref name=\"The gun\u2019s not in the closet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/08/01/feature/school-shootings-should-parents-be-charged-for-failing-to-lock-up-guns-used-by-their-kids/|title=The gun's not in the closet|date=Aug 2018}}</ref> The availability of firearms has direct effect on the probability of initiating a school shooting. This has led many to question whether parents should be held criminally negligent for their children's gun-related crimes. By 2018, a total of four parents were convicted of failing to lock up the guns that were used to shoot up US schools by their children.<ref name=\"The gun\u2019s not in the closet\"/> Such incidents may also lead to nationwide discussion on gun laws.<ref>{{cite web|title=Government Vows to Take Action Following Kauhajoki Shootings |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/govt_promises_action_following_kauhajoki_shootings/6112199 |accessdate=September 23, 2008 |work=YLE}}</ref>\n\nThe [[FBI]] offer a guide for helping to identify potential school shooters, ''The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective''.<ref name=\"The School Shooter, 1999\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/stats-services-publications-school-shooter-school-shooter/view|title=The School Shooter|date=1999}}</ref>\n\n'''\"Student 'Rules the Roost'\"'''\n\"The parents set few or no limits on the child's conduct, and regularly give in to his demands. The student insists on an inordinate degree of privacy, and parents have little information about his activities, school life, friends, or other relationships. The parents seem intimidated by their child. They may fear he will attack them physically if they confront or frustrate him, or they may be unwilling to face an emotional outburst, or they may be afraid that upsetting the child will spark an emotional crisis. Traditional family roles are reversed: for example, the child acts as if he were the authority figure, while parents act as if they were the children.\"\n\n'''\"No Limits or Monitoring of TV and Internet\"'''\n\"Parents do not supervise, limit or monitor the student's television watching or his use of the Internet. The student may have a TV in his own room or is otherwise free without any limits to spend as much time as he likes watching violent or otherwise inappropriate shows. The student spends a great deal of time watching television rather than in activities with family or friends. Similarly, parents do not monitor computer use or Internet access. The student may know much more about computers than the parents do, and the computer may be considered off limits to the parents while the student is secretive about his computer use, which may involve violent games or Internet research on violence, weapons, or other disturbing subjects.\"\n\nThis last passage includes the archaic notion that violent video games leads to school shootings. The FBI offer three cautions with their guide, 1) No trait or characteristic should be considered in isolation or given more weight than the others, 2) One bad day may not reflect a student's real personality or usual behavior, and 3) Many of these traits and behaviors are seen in adolescents with other, non-violent, issues.\n \n[[Daniel Schechter]], Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is \"every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=30762|title=Forecasting Aggression: Toward a New Interdisciplinary Understanding of What Makes Some Troubled Youth Turn Violent|website=Dana.org|date=Feb 2011}}</ref> Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from \"bad\" parents. No more than they could come from attentive, educated, negligent, single, married, abusive, or loving parents.\n\n===Younger age===\nAccording to [[Adrian Raine|Raine]] (2002), [[Developmental age|immaturity]] is one of many identified factors increasing the likelihood of an individual committing criminal acts of [[violence]] and outbursts of [[aggression]].<ref>Raine, A (2002) \u2013 [https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_13840000000000001/attachments/280145/Issue%202-%20Criminal%20Behavior%20Biological.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Issue%202-%20Criminal%20Behavior%20Biological.pdf%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Issue%25202%252D%2520Criminal%2520Behavior%2520Biological.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJFNFXH2V2O7RPCAA%2F20180220%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20180220T005116Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=23f428ae1771a265c3e52655a7f89c172460554591678d83000da681f239993e Biological Basis for Crime in Crime: Public Policies for Crime control (J.Q.

While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the [[nervous system]] in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, [[axons]], [[neurons]], and [[synapses]], to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. ''pruning'' (or [[apoptosis]], otherwise known as ''cell death'').<ref>Feinberg, Irwin \u2013 [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-synaptic-pruning-important-for-the-developing-brain/ Why synaptic pruning is important for the developing brain] ''[[Scientific American]]'' Accessed February 15, 2018</ref> These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the [[pre-frontal cortex]], the brain location where [[decision-making]] occurs, is the concluding area for development. While the pre-frontal cortex is developing, children and teenagers might possibly rely more on the brain part known as the [[amygdala]]; involving thinking that is more emotionally active, including [[aggression]] and [[impulsiveness]].

Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines. This suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse. However, the link is unclear since research has shown that violence in mentally ill people occurs more in interpersonal environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Jessica|title=Mass Shootings and Mental Health Policy|journal=Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare|date=Mar 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=107\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n\nIt is also mentionable that school size contributes to the presence of School Shootings. In an article by Baird, Roellke & Zeifman from the Social Science Journal, it is presented that students who commit mass shootings in larger schools are significantly more likely to have transitioned from relatively smaller, more supportive schools. This adds important nuance to the idea that larger schools are more prone to mass violence by demonstrating that it may not be size alone, but rather the stress associated with losing the interpersonal connections and social support provided in smaller school settings that best predicts mass school shootings. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baird|first=Abigail A.|last2=Roellke|first2=Emma V.|last3=Zeifman|first3=Debra M.|date=2017-09-01|title=Alone and adrift: The association between mass school shootings, school size, and student support|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2017.01.009|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=54|issue=3|pages=261\u2013270|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2017.01.009|issn=0362-3319}}</ref>\n\nA 2016 opinion piece concluded that 22% of mass murders are committed by people who suffer from a serious mental illness, and 78% do not.

A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.\n\nThe idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person's aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis (Ferguson, 2009) but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.\n\nA summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression (Anderson, 2004; Ferguson, 2007 & Spencer, 2009). Again, this supports the idea that although it is a popular opinion to link school shooters to being violent video gamers; this misconception is often attributable to third variables and has not been supported by research on the connection between aggression and gaming.\n\n==Frequency trends==\nSchool shootings are a \"modern phenomenon\". There were scattered instances of gunmen or bombers attacking schools in the years before the [[Frontier Middle School shooting]] in [[Moses Lake, Washington]] in 1996, \"but they were lower profile\", according to journalist [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in 2015.<ref name=nyr20151019/> Beginning in the late 1990s, there has been a steep increase in the frequency of school shootings across the globe.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robertz|first1=Frank|title=Deadly Dreams|journal=Scientific American Mind|volume=18|issue=4|pages=52\u201359|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0807-52|year=2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} In the United States specifically, the most recent trend has been downward following the spikes of the 1990s, yet at the same time they are trending towards a higher likelihood of being premeditated and executed with a strict plan in mind.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robertz|first1=Frank|title=Deadly Dreams|journal=Scientific American Mind|volume=18|issue=4|pages=52\u201359|publisher=Scientific American|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0807-52|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nA study by [[Northeastern University]] found that \"four times the number of children were killed in schools in the early 1990s than today\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/02/26/schools-are-still-one-of-the-safest-places-for-children-researcher-says/|title=Schools are safer than they were in the 90s, and school shootings are not more common than they used to be, researchers say|access-date=March 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 27, 2018, [[NPR]] reported that a U.S. Education Department report, released earlier in the year, for the 2015\u20132016 school year said \"nearly 240 schools ... reported at least 1 incident involving a school-related shooting\".

One suggestion that has come up is the idea to allow firearms in the classroom. \"Since the issue of arming teachers is a relatively new topic, it has received little empirical study. Therefore, most of the literature does not come from peer reviewed sources but rather published news reports. In addition, most of these reports are not objective and clearly appear to support a specific side of the debate.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=Teachers with Guns: Firearms Discharges by School teachers, 1980\u20132012 |url= http://homicidecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Teachers-with-Guns-RESEARCH-REPORT-FINAL.pdf|website=Homicidecenter.org|accessdate=May 21, 2018 |page=3 |date=2013}}</ref> So far, data has been inconclusive as to whether or not arming teachers would have any sort of benefit for schools. For years, some areas in the US have allowed \"armed classrooms\" to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.\n\nMany teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. \"One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students.\" Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. \"They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do.\"\n\nTo diminish school shootings all together there are many preventative measures that can be taken such as: \n* Installing wireless panic alarms to alert law enforcement. \n* Limiting points of entry with security guarding them. \n* Strategically placing telephones for emergencies so police are always reachable at any point in the campus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Robert|last2=Duplechain|first2=Rosalind|title=New Ways To Stop Bullying|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=2002|volume=33|issue=9|pages=64}}</ref>\n* Employing school psychologists to monitor and provide mental health services for those that need help.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf|title=Now Is The Time|website=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n* Coordinating a response plan between local police and schools in the event of a threat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Deadly Dreams|last=Robertz|first=Frank|date=August 1, 2007|work=Scientific American|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 research report published by the Center for Homicide Research, they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the \"[[weapons effect]]\", which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. \"In Berkowitz & LaPage's (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students' performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks.

According to Katherine A. Fowler, PhD, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average 1,297 children die (two children per 100,000) and 5,790 are treated for injuries caused by guns each year, the study reported. Six percent of these deaths were accidental, 38% were suicides, 53% were homicides and the remaining 3% were from legal intervention or undetermined reasons. Guns injured children at a rate of 8 per 100,000 children, but this rate is likely considerably higher because of unreported injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/06/19/american-denial-about-facts-on-guns-continues-to-kill-children/#38cd87354a9a|title=Children Are Dying Because Of Americans' Denial About Guns|last=Tara|first=Haelle|date=Jun 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA preventive measure proposed for stopping school shooting has been focused on securing firearms in the home. A shooting in [[Sparks, Nevada]] on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter's home. [[Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in Newtown, [[Red Lake High School]] in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.\n\nA 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that \"from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place\". 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place. In 2005 a study was done on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents' firearms.<ref>\"Preventing school shootings starts with gun safety at home\". ''Christian Science Monitor''. October 31, 2013.</ref>\n\nMost states have Child Access Prevention Laws \u2013 laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms. Each state varies in the degree of the severity of these laws. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. There is also a wide range of laws that fall in between the two extremes. One example is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury. An example of a weaker law is a law that enforces liability only in the event of reckless, knowing or deliberate behavior by the adult.<ref>{{cite web|author=Randich, Cheri|title=Description of State Child Access Prevention Laws.|publisher=Law & Justice|date=December 10, 2012|url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/LAW/Documents/SummaryOfStateChildAccessPreventionLaws.pdf|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}<</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the [[United States Secret Service]] released an analysis of targeted school violence, concluding the best practice for prevention was forming a \"multidisciplinary [[threat assessment]] team, in conjunction with the appropriate policies, tools, and training\".<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/data/protection/ntac/usss-analysis-of-targeted-school-violence.pdf |title=Protecting America's Schools: A U.S. Secret Service Analysis of Targeted School Violence |date=November 2019 |publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security |author=National Threat Assessment Center, United States Secret Service |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> An earlier report published in 2018 concluded there was no single profile of a student attacker, and emphasized the importance of the threat assessment process instead.

For example, a 2009 survey conducted by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) revealed that substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was higher than children raised by their biological parents. However, the percentage of substance abuse amongst children raised by single-mothers was not only remarkably low (5.4%), but also only 1.2% higher than children raised by both their parents.<ref name=\"National Survey on Drug Use and Health\">{{cite web|url=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|title=National Survey on Drug Use and Health|website=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|date=2009}}</ref> Those rates reveal to be even smaller when compared to other demographics of the same time period.

In the U.S., the rate of parental death before age 16 is 8%. The rate of parental death is disproportionately high for prisoners (30%\u201350%), however, it is also disproportionately high for high-performing scientists (26%) and US presidents (34%). Harvard's Baker Foundation Professor, Emerita, Dr. Teresa M.

However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.\n\nData from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative.

The student insists on an inordinate degree of privacy, and parents have little information about his activities, school life, friends, or other relationships. The parents seem intimidated by their child. They may fear he will attack them physically if they confront or frustrate him, or they may be unwilling to face an emotional outburst, or they may be afraid that upsetting the child will spark an emotional crisis. Traditional family roles are reversed: for example, the child acts as if he were the authority figure, while parents act as if they were the children.\"\n\n'''\"No Limits or Monitoring of TV and Internet\"'''\n\"Parents do not supervise, limit or monitor the student's television watching or his use of the Internet. The student may have a TV in his own room or is otherwise free without any limits to spend as much time as he likes watching violent or otherwise inappropriate shows. The student spends a great deal of time watching television rather than in activities with family or friends. Similarly, parents do not monitor computer use or Internet access. The student may know much more about computers than the parents do, and the computer may be considered off limits to the parents while the student is secretive about his computer use, which may involve violent games or Internet research on violence, weapons, or other disturbing subjects.\"\n\nThis last passage includes the archaic notion that violent video games leads to school shootings. The FBI offer three cautions with their guide, 1) No trait or characteristic should be considered in isolation or given more weight than the others, 2) One bad day may not reflect a student's real personality or usual behavior, and 3) Many of these traits and behaviors are seen in adolescents with other, non-violent, issues.\n \n[[Daniel Schechter]], Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is \"every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=30762|title=Forecasting Aggression: Toward a New Interdisciplinary Understanding of What Makes Some Troubled Youth Turn Violent|website=Dana.org|date=Feb 2011}}</ref> Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from \"bad\" parents.

Another group read about the shooting in an article that suggested the proposal to ban large-capacity magazines, which acted to advocate that shootings could stem from a societal problem rather than an individual problem. The control group did not read anything. Participants were then all asked to fill in a questionnaire asking about their views on gun control and whether they thought there should be restrictions on high-capacity magazines. 71% of the control group thought that gun restrictions should be applied to people with mental illness, and nearly 80% of participants who read the articles agreed. Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines. This suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse.

A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.\n\nThe idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person's aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis (Ferguson, 2009) but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.\n\nA summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression (Anderson, 2004; Ferguson, 2007 & Spencer, 2009).

For years, some areas in the US have allowed \"armed classrooms\" to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.\n\nMany teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. \"One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students.\" Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. \"They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do.\"\n\nTo diminish school shootings all together there are many preventative measures that can be taken such as: \n* Installing wireless panic alarms to alert law enforcement. \n* Limiting points of entry with security guarding them. \n* Strategically placing telephones for emergencies so police are always reachable at any point in the campus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Robert|last2=Duplechain|first2=Rosalind|title=New Ways To Stop Bullying|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=2002|volume=33|issue=9|pages=64}}</ref>\n* Employing school psychologists to monitor and provide mental health services for those that need help.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf|title=Now Is The Time|website=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n* Coordinating a response plan between local police and schools in the event of a threat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Deadly Dreams|last=Robertz|first=Frank|date=August 1, 2007|work=Scientific American|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 research report published by the Center for Homicide Research, they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the \"[[weapons effect]]\", which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. \"In Berkowitz & LaPage's (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students' performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks.

According to Katherine A. Fowler, PhD, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average 1,297 children die (two children per 100,000) and 5,790 are treated for injuries caused by guns each year, the study reported. Six percent of these deaths were accidental, 38% were suicides, 53% were homicides and the remaining 3% were from legal intervention or undetermined reasons. Guns injured children at a rate of 8 per 100,000 children, but this rate is likely considerably higher because of unreported injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/06/19/american-denial-about-facts-on-guns-continues-to-kill-children/#38cd87354a9a|title=Children Are Dying Because Of Americans' Denial About Guns|last=Tara|first=Haelle|date=Jun 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA preventive measure proposed for stopping school shooting has been focused on securing firearms in the home. A shooting in [[Sparks, Nevada]] on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter's home. [[Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in Newtown, [[Red Lake High School]] in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.\n\nA 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that \"from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place\". 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place. In 2005 a study was done on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents' firearms.<ref>\"Preventing school shootings starts with gun safety at home\". ''Christian Science Monitor''. October 31, 2013.</ref>\n\nMost states have Child Access Prevention Laws \u2013 laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms. Each state varies in the degree of the severity of these laws. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. There is also a wide range of laws that fall in between the two extremes. One example is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury.

Some Latin American fusion bands broke up, like Los Blop's, while others fled abroad, like [[Los Jaivas]], who emigrated to Argentina.

The repressive military regime prohibited all manifestations of rock music, along with many other forms of culture (see [[Military government of Chile (1973\u20131990)#Cultural life|Military government of Chile (1973-1990): cultural life]]). This brought about a decline of the music industry in Chile and a deterioration of the Chilean rock scene. Some Latin American fusion bands broke up, like Los Blop's, while others fled abroad, like [[Los Jaivas]], who emigrated to Argentina. Others, like [[Congreso]], were forced to radically change their music to a progressive rock style. By the late 1970s, an underground scene gradually began to emerge with [[punk rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and later [[new wave music]] becoming increasingly popular.\n\n[[File:Los Prisioneros in 2001.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (musician)|Los Prisioneros]] became the most important band of this period and very influential across latinamerica due to [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (musician)|Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez]] lyrics.]]\nHowever, one of the most well-known and influential bands since the 1980s, and from all history of chilean rock, was ''[[Los Prisioneros]]'', who were especially known for their outspoken songwriter and lead vocalist, [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (musician)|Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez]].

The PCA emerged in 1920 as an extension the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) and eventually became a separate entity in 1936 (Gilberg, 1988, p.&nbsp;242), despite this it was recognized by the [[Comintern]] in 1935. Its first congress was in [[Algiers]] in July 1936, where it was the PCA's headquarter.\n\nIn 1955 the party was banned by the French authorities. The party then oriented itself towards the national liberation movement.\n\nPCA obtained legal status in 1962, and in the same year, it was banned and dissolved.

That is attributed to the majority of its members (between 12,000 and 15,000) being [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]. The PCA supported the [[Blum-Viollette]] law and [[Setif]]\u00b4s repression of 1945.\n\nHowever, some Muslims were attracted to the PCA. Some of them were: [[Ben Ali Boukurt]], [[Ahmed Akkache]] and the general secretary [[Bachir Hadj Ali]]. The PCA additionally had trouble gaining traction since it had lost most of its proletariat base. During the first world war, as France's men were mostly employed along the western front, tens of thousands of Algerians, displaced from the countryside moved to France to take advantage of the labor shortage.<ref>Drew, Allison. 2003. \"Bolshevizing Communist Parties: The Algerian and South African Experiences.\" International Review of Social History 48 (2): 167-202. doi:10.1017/S0020859003001007.</ref> A saying emerged that \"l\u2019Algerie est une societe dont le proletariat est en France.\"<ref>ibid.</ref> Essentially, Algeria's proletariat was in France.

This only continued as the ranks of displaced workers flooded Algeria's cities from the countryside. However, ties remained with the rural communities in which they had lived for generations. As these people joined the communist party, their networks allowed the party to expand into areas not typically considered its territory. Yet the division that dominated Algerian Society also affected the supposedly egalitarian Communist Party, the division of ethnicity effected the Algerian communist party as well. Additionally, since the party was so tied to France, there were different ideas about how to pursue the Comintern's call for peoples to free themselves around the world. A major part of the Algerian communist party believed that first a revolution must take place in France, and then Algeria could have hers. Leon Trotsky, as well as many other notable internationalists called this a continuation of the slave mentality.<ref>\u2018This land is not for sale\u2019:; communists, nationalists and the popular front. In 2014. We are no longer in france., ed. Allison Drew, 81-109 Manchester University Press.</ref>\n\n== The PCA during the Algerian Independence war (1954\u20131962) ==\nAt the beginning of the Independence War, the PCA was damaged. The Muslim members wanted to join the nationalists, but not the Europeans. That ambiguity was due to the PCF's equivocal positions.\n\nIn 1956 the Central Committee of the PCA voted to join the Revolution maintaining its independent internal administration.\n\nDuring the War, some members of the PCA distinguished themselves. [[Henri Maillot]] was killed while providing arms to the Nationalists and serving the ''[[Maquis Rouges]]''. [[Henri Alleg]], as many others, was arrested and tortured, he was the editor of the ''[[Alger Republicain]]''.\n \nThe PCA collaborated with the ''[[Front de lib\u00e9ration nationale (Alg\u00e9rie)|Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale]]'' (FLN), and there were accusations from the communists of discrimination and to put them in more dangerous situations by purpose.\n\n== The PCA after the Algerian Independence war (1962\u20131966) ==\nThe PCA did not adopt a position in the postwar conflict between the ''[[Gouvernement provisional de la R\u00e9publique alg\u00e9rienne]]'' (GPRA)  and the Political Bureau. By 1962 the PCA and its newspaper ''[[al-Hurriya]]'' were suppressed and banned .\n\nAt the beginning of [[Ben Bella]]\u00b4s government the Algerian communists still exercised influence through  publications such as ''[[R\u00e9volution africaine]]''. During the military coup of [[Houari Boumedi\u00e8ne|Boumediene]] in 1965 the remnents of the PCA were eliminated. Communists later reorganized during 1966 as the ''[[Parti de l\u00b4Avant-Garde Socialiste]]'' (PAGS).\n\n== Relation with the FLN ==\nDuring the liberation war, in 1955 the PCA created combatant units called ''[[Combattants de la Lib\u00e9ration]]''. At 1956 the PCA and the FLN made an agreement in which it integrated the PCA combatant force to the [[Arm\u00e9e de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale|National Liberation Army]] (ALN), separating from the leadership of the party that remained in [[Algiers]]. By 1962, after finished the independence war, Communist were attracting members to the party and publishing ''[[Alger R\u00e9publicain]]'', so the FLN with fear about this, banned the PCA, but they tolerated the communists themselves.\n\n[[Ben Bella]]'s constitution of 1963 put the FLN as the only legal party. A curious fact is that FLN took people from the PCA later to work on state, because they were prepared and educated. At 1965 some of the leaders of the PCA, with the left wing of the FLN created an Organization to combat the military coup of Boumediene, the ''[[Organization de la r\u00e9sistance populaire]]'' (OPR).\n\n== Relation with the PCF ==\nPCA appeared at 1920 as an extension of the PCF. PCF was mainly French, European. PCA was against French domination, and it tried to be more Arab by his separation, at least in the wish. Comintern supported the anti-imperialist fights on that times. However, PCA followed the political leadership of the PCF, what it made turn back on the demands of independence. By 1939 both PCA and PCF were banned, damaging the space for communism.\n\nWith the massacres of 1945 by the settlers, the PCA and PCF weren't quick to condemn the massacre. However, the fight against Fascism gave the PCF a good status.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]] and the massacre, the PCA started a campaign against the state repression, because of nationalists in the party, sometimes radicalized. This make the PCA takes politics more autonomous to the PCF. At the Cold War, the PCF put the focus on the North American imperialism, while the PCA focused on the French imperialism. When liberation war started, the PCA was banned again in 1955 and repressed.\n\n== Notable members of the PCA ==\n*[[Henri Maillot]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bouhamidimohamed.over-blog.com/2019/05/l-oued-en-crue-roman-de-la-moudjahida-baya-jurquet-bouhoune-et-le-colonialisme-de-reve-de-yasmina-khadra.html|title=&quot;L'oued en crue&quot;, roman de la moudjahida Baya Jurquet-Bouhoune et le colonialisme de r\u00eave de yasmina Khadra.|last=mohamed|first=bouhamidi|website=bouhamidimohamed|language=fr|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n*[[Baya Jurquet]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://maitron-en-ligne.univ-paris1.fr/spip.php?article151714|title=BOUHOUNE Baya plus connue en Alg\u00e9rie sous le nom ALLAOUCHICHE Baya (...) - Maitron|website=maitron-en-ligne.univ-paris1.fr|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n*[[Henri Alleg]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Gilberg, Trond (Ed.).
