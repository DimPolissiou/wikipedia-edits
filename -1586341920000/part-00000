Darwen workers walk out. The team refuses to train or play in matches while on strike. Suter fails to convince Walsh to go against the guild. Workers go to the guild to demand a 5% wage cut and fewer hours to help fight the oversupply that has caused the price of goods to fall. The guild refuses. Workers riot. Kinnaird is saved from the riot by Stokes. Against Kinnaird\u2019s wishes, Stokes goes in his place to warn Col. Jackson (the guild leader) that the mob is coming for him. Police show up and arrest Stokes and kill his dog. Stokes is put on trial and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Kinnaird testifies on behalf of Stokes and saves him from prison and gives him his loan. Walsh agrees to the 5% wage cut and to work 5 days a week if the team plays their upcoming match. While waiting on the team at the match, Suter is approached by the manager of Blackburn FC and is offered \u00a3100 upfront and a \u00a36 weekly wage increase.

While the gentleman scoff at the conditions of the working poor, Kinnaird comes to their defense. The Darwen team are out celebrating Jimmy\u2019s stag party. Mr. Walsh tells Suter that he\u2019s proud of his decision to bring Suter on to the team. Suter thanks him but doesn\u2019t mention the deal with Blackburn. Clearly drunk, Suter gets in a fight with another Blackburn player recently hired from Partick when he compares Suter to his drunken father. The following day, at the match between Darwen and St. Luke\u2019s, Suter arrives late and plays terribly. Darwen lose 3-0 and are out of the FA Cup. Suter storms off the pitch. At home, Suter tells Doris about the deal with Blackburn and says that he\u2019ll tell Jimmy after the wedding. Jimmy practices his vows and Doris overhears. At the wedding, Jimmy tells all that he finally feels like he has a home in Darwen.

He shows off new teammates, including Jack Hunter from Sheffield, and tells Suter he\u2019s assembling a team of the best players north of Eton. Cartwright asks Walsh for his discretion regarding Suter\u2019s professionalism and offers him \u00a3100 for Blackburn to play Darwen the next week in an exhibition match. After being seen talking familiarly with Mr. Cartwright (with whom she previously had a child), Martha is fired from her job at the Cotton Master\u2019s club. Mr. Cartwright offers her money to help but Martha refuses saying she needs to find her own way. At the Blackburn v. Druids match, Suter struggles to mesh with his new teammates. Hunter is hailed the hero. Suter talks with Jimmy who calls him a Judas. Suter tells Jimmy he\u2019s trying to get his family away from his father. Suter again asks Jimmy to join Blackburn. Later, Jimmy stands up for Suter against the Darwen team and tells them he\u2019s joining Blackburn. On the way to the match between the Old Etonians and Preston, the Etonians discuss how football is becoming a booming business and is no longer just a game. The FA President complains that if it continues, only the richest teams will win and is planning to watch the exhibition match between Darwen and Blackburn to find evidence to expel them from the FA cup.

After Mr. Cartwright tells his wife about the affair, she goes to Martha\u2019s house and offers to care for her daughter, Jenie. Martha refuses. Martha tells Suter about Cartwright and Jenie. Martha goes back to talk with Mrs. Cartwright and apologizes for the affair with her husband. Suter and Martha kiss. Tommy, the player who hurt Jimmy, visits and to apologizes. Suter arrives and tells Jimmy the team will support him financially and they are struggling to replace him. Later, Suter pushes Jimmy in a cart to the pub to cheer him up. Darwen teammates start to reconcile with Suter. Stokes talks about his business success making football kits. Doris asks after a job for Jimmy. Kinnaird has a falling out with his friend over the true reason behind missing the quarter-final match. After some tense discussions with his father about his football career, Kinnaird uses his football contacts to help save a vital investment.

Darwen workers walk out. The team refuses to train or play in matches while on strike. Suter fails to convince Walsh to go against the guild. Workers go to the guild to demand a 5% wage cut and fewer hours to help fight the oversupply that has caused the price of goods to fall. The guild refuses. Workers riot. Kinnaird is saved from the riot by Stokes. Against Kinnaird\u2019s wishes, Stokes goes in his place to warn Col. Jackson (the guild leader) that the mob is coming for him.

While the gentleman scoff at the conditions of the working poor, Kinnaird comes to their defense. The Darwen team are out celebrating Jimmy\u2019s stag party. Mr. Walsh tells Suter that he\u2019s proud of his decision to bring Suter on to the team. Suter thanks him but doesn\u2019t mention the deal with Blackburn.

At home, Suter tells Doris about the deal with Blackburn and says that he\u2019ll tell Jimmy after the wedding. Jimmy practices his vows and Doris overhears.

He shows off new teammates, including Jack Hunter from Sheffield, and tells Suter he\u2019s assembling a team of the best players north of Eton. Cartwright asks Walsh for his discretion regarding Suter\u2019s professionalism and offers him \u00a3100 for Blackburn to play Darwen the next week in an exhibition match. After being seen talking familiarly with Mr. Cartwright (with whom she previously had a child), Martha is fired from her job at the Cotton Master\u2019s club. Mr. Cartwright offers her money to help but Martha refuses saying she needs to find her own way. At the Blackburn v. Druids match, Suter struggles to mesh with his new teammates. Hunter is hailed the hero. Suter talks with Jimmy who calls him a Judas. Suter tells Jimmy he\u2019s trying to get his family away from his father. Suter again asks Jimmy to join Blackburn. Later, Jimmy stands up for Suter against the Darwen team and tells them he\u2019s joining Blackburn. On the way to the match between the Old Etonians and Preston, the Etonians discuss how football is becoming a booming business and is no longer just a game. The FA President complains that if it continues, only the richest teams will win and is planning to watch the exhibition match between Darwen and Blackburn to find evidence to expel them from the FA cup.

Martha goes back to talk with Mrs. Cartwright and apologizes for the affair with her husband. Suter and Martha kiss. Tommy, the player who hurt Jimmy, visits and to apologizes.
