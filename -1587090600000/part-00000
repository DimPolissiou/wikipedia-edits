He proposed that Cheonrye be moved to his residence, where the man could be questioned.<ref name=seongjong62>Veritable Records of Seongjong, volume 62</ref> One official reported that his son travelling from [[Gwangju]] had heard rumours of an aristocratic lady who was liaising with a slave, while another official said that his servant had observed Cheonrye sleeping and eating in the room next to his mistress' bedchamber. [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]], however, refused to arrest Yi based on gossip alone.<ref>{{lang|zh-hant|\u98a8\u805e\u64e7\u52be\u4e0d\u53ef}}</ref><ref name=seongjong62/> This caused much dispute amongst officials on the policy of 'arresting regardless of suspicion',<ref>{{lang|zh-hant|\u975e\u5978\u6240\u6355\u7372\u4e4b\u6cd5}}</ref> which some argued should apply only to common people and not the private affairs of an aristocratic lady.<ref name=seongjong62/>\n\nIn 1489, the [[Saheonbu]] reported that Yi Guji had mothered a daughter by her slave, who had married the previous year. The officials now argued that, though any previous investigation had been dismissed, this was a case of public morality. Seongjong ordered that all servants be tortured to investigate the claim.<ref name=seongjong218>Veritable Records of Seongjong, volume 218</ref> Chunrye died during the interrogation and more than 40 people were arrested.<ref name=seongjong221>Veritable Records of Seongjong, volume 221</ref> Though some members of the government argued that death was too strong a punishment for a woman of the royal clan,<ref>Veritable Records of Seongjong, volume 225</ref> it was agreed that death was more respectful than torture, and Yi was condemned.<ref>Veritable Records of Seongjong, volume 226</ref>\n\n== Posthumous ==\nYi was deleted from the royal family lineage (Sunwonrok) and her name remained taboo until the end of the Joseon Dynasty. In the 1970s, her name was found in the [[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty]] during the production of a new [[Hangul]] version.{{Citation needed|reason=statement unverified|date=March 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Uhwudong]]\n* [[Hwang Jini]]\n* [[Shin Saimdang]]\n* [[Heo Nanseolheon]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*{{cite book\n|script-title=ko:\uc131\uc885\uc2e4\ub85d (\u6210\u5b97\u5be6\u9304) |trans-title=Veritable Records of Seongjong\n|language=ko|date=1499\n}}\n*{{cite article\n|title=The Invention of Chaste Motherhood: A Feminist Reading of the Remarriage Ban in the Chosun Era\n|last1=Uhn |first1=Cho\n|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies\n|volume=5 |issue=3\n|pages=45-63\n|doi=10.1080/12259276.1999.11665854\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://sillok.history.go.kr/inspection/inspection.jsp?mState=2&mTree=0&clsName=&searchType=a&query_ime=%EA%B6%8C%EB%8D%95%EC%98%81&keyword=%EA%B6%8C%EB%8D%95%EC%98%81 \uc870\uc120\uc655\uc870\uc2e4\ub85d] {{in lang|ko}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yi, Guji}}\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:1489 deaths]]\n[[Category:Korean writers]]\n[[Category:Korean female dancers]]\n[[Category:15th-century Korean poets]]\n[[Category:Korean artists]]\n[[Category:Joseon Dynasty people]]\n[[Category:15th-century Korean women writers]]\n[[Category:15th-century Korean writers]]\n[[Category:15th-century Korean people]]\n[[Category:People from North Chungcheong Province]]\n[[Category:Joseon Dynasty painters]]\n[[Category:House of Yi|Guji]]\n[[Category:Korean women poets]]\n[[Category:15th-century dancers]]\n[[Category:Korean princesses]]\n", "name_user": "Kor Ph", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Guji"}

Legend of the Phantosaur''''' is a 2011 [[direct-to-DVD]] [[animation|animated]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[mystery film]]; the sixteenth direct-to-video movie based upon the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s, the film was released on September 6, 2011.<ref name=\"amazon.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055HK7D8|title=Amazon.com: Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur|author=|date=|work=amazon.com}}</ref> It premiered on Cartoon Network on September 3, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Mystery Inc. gang travels to a remote town to stay at the La Serena Spa in New Mexico, to relax Shaggy after a scary experience in a haunted mansion left him screaming for a few hours afterward. There, they meet Mr. Hubley, who works at the spa. When Shaggy asks if there is anything to eat, Hubley says no, but there is a barbecue in town.\n\nThe gang goes to the barbecue, and all but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo go off to see the paleontological dig of Professor Svankmajer. Shaggy and Scooby are too full to walk right away. When they set out, a [[gila monster]] steals a biscuit from them, causing Scooby to go after it. He meets the Phantosaur (described as somewhat resembling an ''[[Appalachiosaurus]]'' by Professor Svankmajer) and runs away. Later, Shaggy and Scooby are chased by the Phantosaur and narrowly escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Svankmajor shows the rest of the gang over the dig, and Velma meets Svankmajor's student, Winsor. She instantly sees him as a soul mate and they plan to go out on a date, to which Fred replies to Daphne, \"On our own for clue searching then.\"\n\nBack at the spa, Shaggy is in terrible shape after a fright. Mr. Hubley helps with aromatherapy, assisted by Scooby-Doo adding a Scooby Snack to the aromas. Shaggy becomes more calm, but freaks out again when Mr. Hubley tells them the legend of the Phantosaur, the ghost of a predatory dinosaur. The legend says the Phantosaur was summoned by Native Americans to drive out Spanish conquistadors, but it turned on them instead.\n\nHubley has an advanced hypnosis machine with a hologram projector. He hypnotizes Shaggy to become fearless and unstoppable when he heard the word \"bad,\" and to switch back to normal when he hears it again. Then he orders Shaggy to forget everything; unfortunately, Hubley himself is affected by the hypnosis and he can't remember the key word for Shaggy.\n\nDaphne, Fred, and Velma go back to the dig to look for clues, but Velma is so love struck that she's not much use. She misses an obvious clue about many footprints going to a part of the cave where Winsor says they never go because of the snakes that lurk in the lower cave levels.\n\nMeanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy go to an all-you-can-eat restaurant and start to eat it out of business. Then a biker gang comes in. Shaggy accidentally squirts the contents of a [[hot dog bun]] on one of the bikers, who angrily grabs him and tells him, \"Little buddy, this is gonna be bad.\" Suddenly, Shaggy is fearless. He knocks out the whole motorcycle gang and repels all their assaults on him. Then the gang leader, a large, muscly man named Tex, arrives and, taking an admitted liking to Shaggy, challenges him to a motorcycle race on Dead Man's curve. Shaggy confidently accepts, even though he's never ridden a motorcycle before. As Tex leaves the restaurant, he tells Shaggy that he won't kill Shaggy \"too bad.\". Suddenly back to normal, Shaggy is terrified of the challenge he has just accepted, and by what he has just done to the rest of the gang.\n\nThat night, Daphne decides to give him motorcycling lessons, because she drove a motorcycle when she was five. Shaggy and Tex have their motorcycle race as planned, and Shaggy hears \"bad\" just in time and almost wins, until a Phantosaur shows up and he thinks in his mind that the monster must think it's so \"bad,\" which is enough to make him cowardly again and get chased, but still miraculously wins the race.\n\nEventually, they figure out that there were two phantosaurs and they were robots. The culprits were two mining engineers who wanted the silver they found in the area, which they couldn't get to because of the paleontologists.\n\nOnce back at Hubley's they find the hologram projector gone and they get attacked by a pack of ''[[Velociraptor]]'' and a ghostly fire-breathing ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. They learn that it was Professor Svankmajer and Winsor, much to Velma's dismay. They had found a complete ''[[Allosaurus]]'' encased in quartz crystal, a beautiful and priceless find, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. They wanted to scare everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away. They disguised three other graduate students in velociraptor costumes, and created an original red Phantosaur with an advanced holographic projector (stolen from Hubley's hypnotism room) and paint-stripper devices that blasted super-heated air for the fire effects.\n\nWhile they are underground, the dynamite charges Svankmajor set to blast free the dinosaur crystal go off (because Daphne left a paint-stripper on and the heat lit the fuses). Shaggy's hypnotic bravery comes in again when Svankmejer comments on how \"bad\" the lower caverns are, and he flawlessly leads them toward the exit until Daphne praises him that he's \"not bad.\"  Scooby realizes the keyword but is unable to tell the rest of the gang (who misunderstand his \"rad\" as other words). Shaggy has to complete the rest of the escape on sheer guts, and with some help from Tex and his biker friends. The remorseful Svankmajer and Winsor are arrested, but Velma says she will date Winsor again when he gets out of jail, which he happily agrees with.\n\nThey then go back to La Serena Spa and Mr. Hubley tries to un-hypnotize Shaggy, but accidentally makes the entire gang turn into him. The end of the movie shows them driving away in the \"Mustard\" Machine. A post-credits scene reveals the \"Mustard\" Machine wearing a wig that looks like Shaggy's hairstyle. The GPS inside the van says aloud that if it had hands, it would remove the wig, but as such, it has none.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers]] and Shaky Joe\n* [[Mindy Cohn]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Cathy Cavadini]] as Faith\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as Fritz, GPS and misc. bikers\n* [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as Mr. Babbit, Blair, Grad Student #1 and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Winsor\n* [[Finola Hughes]] as Professor Svankmajer\n* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as Doctor\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Tex, Cop #2, Grad Student #3 and misc. bikers\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Hubley\n* [[Dave Wittenberg]] as Cop #1, Grad Student #2, Policeman and misc. bikers\n* [[Gwendoline Yeo]] as Ms. Fetich\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|1777608}}\n\n{{Scooby-Doo}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n[[Category:2011 television films]]\n[[Category:2011 animated films]]\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:Scooby-Doo direct-to-video animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:2010s American animated films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ethan Spaulding]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Internet memes introduced in 2017]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Scooby-Doo!

The video earned millions of views and spawned the \"Ultra Instinct Shaggy\" meme depicting Shaggy Rogers as an omnipotent power, with subsequent fan art showing him beating other fictional characters such as [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thanos]] and [[Goku]] from the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise, as well as using still images and footage of the behind the scenes look at the [[Scooby-Doo (film)|2002 ''Scooby-Doo'' film]] with fake subtitles to make it seem as if Shaggy is a powerful being.\n\nAt the same time as the meme gained popularity in January 2019, the then-upcoming video game ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' was being marketed and thus a petition was made on [[Change.org]] by Woken News Network to include the character as [[Downloadable content|DLC]]. The petition received hundreds of thousands of signatures even gaining attention of ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' co-creator [[Ed Boon]], and Shaggy's voice actor [[Matthew Lillard]].

These dates, however, are not absolute, since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century.{{sfn|Torp|Vik\u00f8r|1993}}\n\nOld Norse was divided into three [[dialect]]s: [[Old West Norse]], [[Old East Norse]], and [[Old Gutnish]]. Old West and East Norse formed a [[dialect continuum]], with no clear geographical boundary between them. For example, Old East Norse traits were found in eastern [[Norway]], although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse, and Old West Norse traits were found in western [[Sweden]]. Most speakers spoke Old East Norse in what is present-day [[Denmark]] and Sweden. Old Gutnish, the more obscure dialectal branch, is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations. It developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches.\n\nThe 12th-century Icelandic ''[[Gray Goose Laws]]'' state that Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, ''d\u01ebnsk tunga'' (\"Danish tongue\"; speakers of Old East Norse would have said ''dansk tunga''). Another term, used especially commonly with reference to West Norse, was ''norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l'' or ''norr\u01ffnt m\u00e1l'' (\"Nordic/Northern speech\"). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (both inherited cases from the language), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable [[mutual intelligibility]].\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\n{{Old Norse language map}}\n[[Old Norse#Old Icelandic|Old Icelandic]] was very close to [[Old Norwegian]], and together they formed the Old West Norse dialect, which was also spoken in settlements in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and northwest England, and in Norse settlements in [[Normandy]].<ref name=\"JohnsonEcyc\">{{harvnb|Adams|1899|loc= \"Scandinavian Languages\", pp. 336\u2013338}}</ref> The Old East Norse dialect was spoken in Denmark, Sweden, settlements in [[Kievan Rus']],<ref name=\"Nationalencyklopedin\">{{citation| title = Nordiska spr\u00e5k| at = \u00a7 ''Historia'', \u00a7\u00a7 ''Omkring 800\u20131100''| work = [[Nationalencyklopedin]]| language = Swedish | year = 1994}}</ref> eastern England, and Danish settlements in [[Normandy]]. The [[Old Gutnish]] dialect was spoken in [[Gotland]] and in various settlements in the East. In the 11th century, Old Norse was the most widely spoken European language, ranging from [[Vinland]] in the West to the [[Volga River]] in the East. In [[Kievan Rus']], it survived the longest in [[Veliky Novgorod]], probably lasting into the [[13th century]] there.<ref name=\"Nationalencyklopedin\" /> The age of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]] is strongly contested, but at latest by the time of the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in the 13th century, Swedish settlement had spread the language into the region.\n\n== Modern descendants ==\n{{Main|North Germanic languages}}\nThe modern descendants of the Old West Norse dialect are the West Scandinavian languages of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and the extinct [[Norn language]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]; the descendants of the Old East Norse dialect are the East Scandinavian languages of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Norwegian is descended from Old West Norse, but over the centuries it has been heavily influenced by East Norse, particularly during the [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] union.\n\nAmong these, the grammar of Icelandic and the Faroese have changed the least from Old Norse in the last thousand years. In contrast, the pronunciation of both Icelandic and Faroese have changed considerably from Old Norse. With Danish rule of the Faroe Islands, Faroese has also been influenced by Danish. Old Norse also had an influence on [[English language|English]] dialects and [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]], which contain many Old Norse [[loanword]]s. It also influenced the development of the [[Norman language]], and through it and to a smaller extent, that of modern [[French language|French]].\n\nOf the modern languages, Icelandic is the closest to Old Norse seen to grammar and vocabulary. Written modern Icelandic derives from the Old Norse [[phoneme|phonemic]] writing system. Contemporary Icelandic-speakers can read Old Norse, which varies slightly in spelling as well as semantics and word order. However, pronunciation, particularly of the vowel phonemes, has changed at least as much in Icelandic as in the other North Germanic languages.\n\nFaroese retains many similarities but is influenced by Danish, Norwegian, and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] ([[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and/or [[Irish language|Irish]]).{{sfn|van der Auwera|K\u00f6nig|1994|loc = \"Faroese\" (Barnes & Weyhe), p. 217}} Although Swedish, Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most, they still retain [[mutual intelligibility]].{{sfn|Moberg|Gooskens|Nerbonne|Vaillette|2007}} Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by [[Middle Low German]].<ref>''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Harbert|2007|pp=7\u201310}}</ref>\n\n===Other influenced languages===\nVarious other languages, which are not closely related, have been heavily influenced by Norse, particularly the [[Norman language]]. [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] also have a number of Norse loanwords; the words ''Rus'' and ''Russia'', according to one theory, may be named after the [[Rus' people]], a Norse tribe; ''see [[Rus (name)]]'', probably from present-day east-central Sweden. The current Finnish and Estonian words for Sweden are ''Ruotsi'' and ''Rootsi'', respectively.\n\nA number of loanwords have been introduced into the  [[Irish language]] \u2013 many but not all are associated with fishing and sailing.<ref>{{citation| title = Old Norse loanwords in modern Irish | first = Robert| last = Farren | type = thesis | year = 2014 | publisher = Lund University | url  =http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=4861711&fileOId=4861798 }}</ref><ref>{{citation| title = Norse loanwords in Old and Middle Irish | type=  thesis | first = Aukje | last = Borkent |  publisher = Utrecht University | year = 2014  | hdl= 1874/296646 }}</ref><ref>{{citation| url =http://irisharchaeology.ie/2013/11/some-irish-words-with-norse-origins/| title = Some Irish words with Norse Origins | date = 21 Nov 2013 | work = irisharchaeology.ie }}</ref><ref>{{citation| url = | title = The influence of Scandinavian on Irish | editor-first =Bo | editor-last= Almqvist | editorlink= Bo Almqvist | editor-first2= David | editor-last2= Greene | work = Proceedings of the Seventh Viking Congress | publisher = Dundalgan Press, Dundalk | pages =75\u201382 | last = Greene | first = D. | year = 1973 }}</ref> A similar influence is found in [[Scottish Gaelic]], with over one hundred loanwords estimated to be in the language, many of which, but not all, are related to fishing and sailing.<ref>{{citation| title = Lexical imposition: Old Norse vocabulary in Scottish Gaelic | first = Thomas W.

The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized orthography]] marks the long vowels with an acute accent. In medieval manuscripts, it is often unmarked but sometimes marked with an accent or through [[gemination]].\n\nOld Norse had nasalized versions of all ten vowel places.<ref name=\"CleasbyA\" group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson|1874|loc= p.1, \"A\"}}</ref> These occurred as allophones of the vowels before nasal consonants and in places where a nasal had followed it in an older form of the word, before it was absorbed into a neighboring sound. If the nasal was absorbed by a stressed vowel, it would also lengthen the vowel. These nasalizations also occurred in the other Germanic languages, but were not retained long. They were noted in the [[First Grammatical Treatise]], and otherwise might have remained unknown. The First Grammarian marked these with a dot above the letter.<ref name=\"CleasbyA\" group=\"cv\" /> This notation did not catch on, and would soon be obsolete. Nasal and oral vowels probably merged around the 11th century in most of Old East Norse.{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch.

The {{IPA|/\u0261/}} phoneme was pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0261]}} after an ''n'' or another ''g'' and as {{IPA|[k]}} before {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}. Some accounts have it a voiced velar fricative {{IPA|[\u0263]}} in all cases, and others have that realisation only in the middle of words and between vowels (with it otherwise being realised {{IPA|[\u0261]}}).<ref>{{citation| first = Orrin W. |last = Robinson | title = Old English and Its Closest Relatives| page =83| year = 1993}}</ref><ref name=\"Sweet\">{{harvnb|Sweet|1895|p=5}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}<!-- reason=Scope of source in regards to {{IPA|/k/}} before {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}; In general or in OIC?

It is unclear whether they were sequences of two consonants (with the first element realised as {{IPA|/h/}} or perhaps {{IPA|/x/}}) or as single voiceless sonorants {{IPA|/l\u0325/}}, {{IPA|/r\u0325/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0325/}} respectively. In Old Norwegian, Old Danish and later Old Swedish, the groups ''hl'', ''hr'', ''hn'' were reduced to plain ''l'', ''r'', ''n'', which suggests that they had most likely already been pronounced as voiceless sonorants by Old Norse times.\n\nThe pronunciation of ''hv'' is unclear, but it may have been {{IPA|/x\u02b7/}} (the Proto-Germanic pronunciation), {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}} or the similar phoneme {{IPA|/\u028d/}}. Unlike the three other digraphs, it was retained much longer in all dialects. Without ever developing into a voiceless sonorant in Icelandic, it instead underwent [[fortition]] to a plosive {{IPA|/kv/}}, which suggests that instead of being a voiceless sonorant, it retained a stronger frication.\n\n=== Orthography ===\n{{Main|Old Norse orthography}}\nUnlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]], runic Old Norse was originally written with the [[Younger Futhark]], which had only 16 letters. Because of the limited number of runes, several runes were used for different sounds, and long and short vowels were not distinguished in writing. [[Medieval runes]] came into use some time later.\n\nAs for the [[Latin alphabet]], there was no standardized orthography in use in the Middle Ages. A modified version of the letter [[wynn]] called [[vend (letter)|vend]] was used briefly for the sounds {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}. Long vowels were sometimes marked with acutes but also sometimes left unmarked or geminated. The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized Old Norse spelling]] was created in the 19th century and is, for the most part, phonemic. The most notable deviation is that the nonphonemic difference between the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced]] and the [[voiceless dental fricative]] is marked. The oldest texts and [[runic inscriptions]] use [[thorn (letter)|''\u00fe'']] exclusively. Long vowels are denoted with [[acute accent|acutes]]. Most other letters are written with the same glyph as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phoneme, except as shown in the table below.\n\n=== Accent ===\n{{See also|St\u00f8d|Norwegian phonology#Accent|Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|l1=Danish st\u00f8d|l2=Norwegian tonal stress|l3=Swedish tonal stress}}\n{{Expand section|Dating, etc.|date=April 2010}}\n\nPrimary [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] in Old Norse falls on the [[word stem]], so that ''hyrjar'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8hyr.jar/}}. In compound words, secondary stress falls on the second stem (e.g. ''[[wikt:l\u00e6risveinn#Old Norse|l\u00e6risveinn]]'', {{IPA|/\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0\u027e.i\u02ccsw\u025bin\u02d0/}}).<ref name=\"ProseReader\">{{harvnb|Vigf\u00fasson|Powell|1879|loc=  Ch. 1}}</ref>\n\n== Phonological processes ==\n=== Ablaut ===\n[[Indo-European ablaut|Ablaut]] patterns are groups of vowels which are swapped, or ''ablauted,'' in the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of a word. [[Old Norse morphology#Strong verbs|Strong verbs]] ablaut the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]'s nucleus to derive the past forms of the verb. This parallels English conjugation, where, e.g., the nucleus of ''sing'' becomes ''sang'' in the past tense and ''sung'' in the past participle. Some verbs are derived by ablaut, as the [[Old Norse morphology#Present-preterite verbs|present-in-past verbs]] do by consequence of being derived from the past tense forms of strong verbs.\n\n=== Umlaut ===\n{{See also|Germanic umlaut|Old Norse morphology#Before Old Norse|l2=Old Norse morphophonology}}\n\nUmlaut or mutation is an [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] process acting on vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel of a different [[vowel backness]]. In the case of ''i-umlaut'' and ''\u0280-umlaut'', this entails a fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of ''u-umlaut'', this entails [[labialization]] of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and in many situations grammatically significant as a side effect of losing the [[Proto-Germanic language#Morphology|Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes]] whose vowels created the umlaut [[allophones]].\n\nSome {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8y/}},<ref name=\"FromOldNordic\" /> and all {{IPA|/\u025bi/}} were obtained by [[i-mutation|i-umlaut]] from {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/au/}}, and {{IPA|/ai/}} respectively. Others were formed via \u0280-umlaut from {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, and {{IPA|/au/}}.<ref name=\"JohnsonEcyc\" />\n\nSome {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}}, and all {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} were obtained by u-umlaut from {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} respectively. See [[#Old Icelandic|Old Icelandic]] for information on {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}.\n\n{{IPA|/\u0153/}} was obtained through a simultaneous u- and i-umlaut of {{IPA|/a/}}. It appears in words like ''[[wikt:gera|g\u00f8ra]]'' (''gj\u01ebra'', ''geyra''), from Proto-Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/garwijanan|*garwijan\u0105]]'', and commonly in verbs with a velar consonant before the suffix like ''[[wikt:s\u00f8kkva|s\u00f8kkva]]'' < ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sankwijanan|*sankwijan\u0105]]''.<ref name=\"CleasbyOE\" group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson|1874|loc = pp.&nbsp;761\u2013762 (Introduction to Letter \u00d6 (\u00d8))}}</ref>\n\nOEN often preserves the original value of the vowel directly preceding runic ''\u0280'' while OWN receives \u0280-umlaut. Compare runic OEN ''gla\u0280, ha\u0280i, hrau\u0280'' with OWN ''gler, heri'' (later ''h\u00e9ri''), ''hr\u00f8yrr/hreyrr'' (\"glass\", \"hare\", \"pile of rocks\").\n\n==== U-umlaut ====\nU-umlaut is more common in Old West Norse in both phonemic and allophonic positions, while it only occurs sparsely in post-runic Old East Norse and even in runic Old East Norse. Compare West Old Norse ''[[wikt:fa\u00f0ir#Old Norse|f\u01eb\u00f0ur]]'' (accusative of ''fa\u00f0ir'', 'father'), ''[[wikt:v\u01ebr\u00f0r#Old Norse|v\u01ebr\u00f0r]]'' (guardian/caretaker), ''[[wikt:\u01ebrn#Old Norse|\u01ebrn]]'' (eagle), ''[[wikt:j\u01ebr\u00f0#Old Norse|j\u01ebr\u00f0]]'' ('earth', Modern Icelandic: ''[[wikt:j\u00f6r\u00f0#Icelandic|j\u00f6r\u00f0]]''), ''[[wikt:mj\u01eblk#Old Norse|mj\u01eblk]]'' ('milk', Modern Icelandic: ''[[wikt:mj\u00f3lk#Icelandic|mj\u00f3lk]]'') with Old Swedish ''fa\u00f0ur'', ''var\u00f0er'', ''\u00f8rn'', ''jor\u00f0'', ''miolk'' and Modern Swedish ''[[wikt:fader#Swedish|fader]]'', ''[[wikt:v\u00e5rd|v\u00e5rd]]'', ''[[wikt:\u00f6rn#Swedish|\u00f6rn]]'', ''[[wikt:jord#Swedish|jord]]'', ''[[wikt:mj\u00f6lk|mj\u00f6lk]]'' with the latter two demonstrating the u-umlaut found in Swedish.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Benediktsson | first1 = H. | title = Some Aspects of Nordic Umlaut and Breaking | journal = Language | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 409\u2013431 | doi = 10.2307/411124 | year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 411124 }}</ref><ref name=Iversen>{{harvnb|Iversen|1961|pp=24-}}</ref>\n\nThis is still a major difference between Swedish and Faroese and Icelandic today.

Most of the fused [[morpheme]]s are retained in modern Icelandic, especially in regard to noun case declensions, whereas modern Norwegian in comparison has moved towards more analytical word structures.\n\n=== Gender ===\n{{Further|Grammatical gender}}\nOld Norse had three [[grammatical gender]]s \u2013 masculine, feminine and neuter. Adjectives or pronouns referring to a noun must [[Agreement (linguistics)|mirror the gender of that noun]], so that one says, \"heill ma\u00f0r!\" but, \"heilt barn!\" As in other languages, the grammatical gender of an impersonal noun is generally unrelated to an expected natural gender of that noun. While indeed ''karl'', \"man\" is masculine, ''kona'', \"woman\", is feminine, and ''h\u00fas'', house, is neuter, so also are ''hrafn'' and ''kr\u00e1ka'', for \"raven\" and \"crow\", masculine and feminine respectively, even in reference to a female raven or a male crow.\n\nAll neuter words have identical nominative and accusative forms,{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc = [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/neutern.php Neuter nouns]}} and all feminine words have identical nominative and accusative plurals.{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc =  [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/femininen.php Feminine nouns]}}\n\nThe gender of some words' plurals does not agree with that of their singulars, such as ''lim'' and ''mund''.<ref group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson |1874|loc= p.&nbsp;389 col.1, \"LIM\"; p.&nbsp;437, col.1 \"MUND\"}}</ref> Some words, such as ''hungr'', have multiple genders, evidenced by their [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] being declined in different genders within a given sentence.{{sfn|''The Menota handbook''|loc=Ch. 8 \u00a73.2.1 \"Gender\"}}{{sfn|Zo\u00ebga|1910|loc = H: ''hungr''}}\n\n=== Morphology ===\n{{Main|Old Norse morphology}}\nNouns, adjectives and pronouns were [[declension|declined]] in four grammatical cases{{snd}}[[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]]{{snd}}in singular and plural numbers. Adjectives and pronouns were additionally declined in three grammatical genders. Some pronouns (first and second person) could have [[dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] in addition to singular and plural. The genitive was used [[partitive case|partitively]] and in compounds and [[kenning]]s (e.g., ''[[Ur\u00f0arbrunnr]]'', the well of Ur\u00f0r; ''[[Lokasenna]]'', the [[gibing]] of Loki).\n\nThere were several classes of nouns within each gender. The following is an example of the \"strong\" [[inflectional paradigm]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | The strong masculine noun '''armr''' (English '''arm''')\n|-\n! Case !! '''Singular''' !! '''Plural'''\n|-\n| '''Nominative''' || armr || armar\n|-\n| '''Accusative''' || arm || rowspan=\"2\" | arma\n|-\n| '''Genitive''' || arms\n|-\n| '''Dative''' || armi ||  \u01ebrmum/armum\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | The feminine noun '''h\u01ebll''' (OWN), '''hall''' (OEN) (English '''hall''')\n|-\n!

'''Plural'''\n|-\n| '''Nominative-Accusative''' || troll || troll\n|-\n| '''Genitive''' || trolls || trolla\n|-\n| '''Dative''' || trolli || trollum\n|}\n\nThe numerous \"weak\" noun paradigms had a much higher degree of syncretism between the different cases; i.e., they had fewer forms than the \"strong\" nouns.\n\nA definite article was realised as a suffix that retained an independent declension; e.g., '''troll''' (''a troll'') \u2013 '''trollit''' (''the troll''), '''h\u01ebll''' (''a hall'') \u2013 '''h\u01ebllin''' (''the hall''), '''armr''' (''an arm'') \u2013 '''armrinn''' (''the arm''). This definite article, however, was a separate word and did not become attached to the noun before later stages of the Old Norse period.\n\n== Texts ==\n{{Commons category|Old Norse manuscripts}}\nThe earliest inscriptions in Old Norse are [[runic alphabet|runic]], from the 8th century. Runes continued to be commonly used until the 15th century and have been recorded to be in use in some form as late as the 19th century in some parts of Sweden. With the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|conversion to Christianity]] in the 11th century came the [[Latin alphabet]]. The oldest preserved texts in Old Norse in the Latin alphabet date from the middle of the 12th century. Subsequently, Old Norse became the vehicle of a large and varied body of vernacular literature, unique in medieval Europe. Most of the surviving literature was written in Iceland. Best known are the [[Norse saga]]s, the [[Icelanders' sagas]] and the mythological literature, but there also survives a large body of religious literature, translations into Old Norse of [[courtly romance]]s, classical mythology, and the Old Testament, as well as instructional material, [[First Grammatical Treatise|grammatical treatises]] and a large body of letters and official documents.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2004|p=22\u2013102}}\n\n== Dialects ==\nMost of the innovations that appeared in Old Norse spread evenly through the Old Norse area. As a result, the dialects were very similar and considered to be the same language, a language that they sometimes called the Danish tongue (''D\u01ebnsk tunga''), sometimes Norse language (''Norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l''), as evidenced in the following two quotes from [[Heimskringla]] by [[Snorri Sturluson]]:\n\n{{Verse translation|M\u00f3\u00f0ir Dyggva var Dr\u00f3tt, d\u00f3ttir Danps konungs, sonar R\u00edgs er fyrstr var konungr kalla\u00f0r \u00e1 danska tungu.\n|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Ynglinga saga \u00a7 20. ''Dau\u00f0i Dyggva''\n|Dyggvi's mother was Drott, the daughter of king Danp, R\u00edg's son, who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue.\n}}\n\n{{Verse translation|...stirt var honum norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l, ok kylfdi m\u1d0a\u01ebk til or\u00f0anna, ok h\u01ebf\u00f0u margir menn \u00feat m\u1d0a\u01ebk at spotti.\n|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Saga Sigur\u00f0ar J\u00f3rsalafara, Eysteins ok \u00d3lafs \u00a7 35(34). ''Fr\u00e1 ve\u00f0jan Haralds ok Magn\u00fas''\n|...the Norse language was hard for him, and he often fumbled for words, which amused people greatly.\n}}\n\nHowever, some changes were geographically limited and so created a dialectal difference between Old West Norse and Old East Norse.\n\nAs Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse, in the 8th century, the effects of the [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] seem to have been very much the same over the whole Old Norse area. But in later dialects of the language a split occurred mainly between west and east as the use of umlauts began to vary. The typical umlauts (for example ''fylla'' from *''fullijan'') were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed (many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse).\n\nAll the while, the changes resulting in [[breaking (linguistics)|breaking]] (for example ''hiarta'' from *''hert\u014d'') were more influential in the East probably once again due to generalizations within the inflectional system. This difference was one of the greatest reasons behind the dialectalization that took place in the 9th and 10th centuries, shaping an Old West Norse dialect in Norway and the Atlantic settlements and an Old East Norse dialect in Denmark and Sweden.\n\nOld West Norse and Old Gutnish did not take part in the monophthongization which changed ''\u00e6i'' (''ei'') into ''\u0113'', ''\u00f8y'' (''ey'') and ''au'' into ''\u00f8\u0304'', nor did certain peripheral dialects of Swedish, as seen in modern [[Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia|Ostrobothnian dialects]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://aveneca.com/westeast.html|title=The Old Norse dialect areas| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707195311/http://aveneca.com/westeast.html| archivedate = 7 Jul 2011| year =2009 | work = aveneca.com}}</ref> Another difference was that Old West Norse lost certain combinations of consonants. The combinations -''mp''-, -''nt''-, and -''nk''- were assimilated into -''pp''-, -''tt''- and -''kk''- in Old West Norse, but this phenomenon was limited in Old East Norse.\n\nHere is a comparison between the two dialects as well as Old Gutnish. It is a transcription from one of the [[Funbo Runestones]] (U 990) from the eleventh century (translation: 'Ve\u00f0r and Thane and Gunnar raised this stone after Haursi, their father. God help his spirit'):\n{{block indent|Ve\u00f0r ok \u00deegn ok Gunnarr reistu stein \u00feenna at Haursa, f\u01eb\u00f0ur sinn. Gu\u00f0 hjalpi \u01ebnd hans.

Gu\u00f0 hialpi and hans (OG)}}\n\nThe OEN original text above is transliterated according to traditional scholarly methods, wherein u-umlaut is not regarded in runic Old East Norse. Modern studies{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} have shown that the positions where it applies are the same as for runic Old West Norse. An alternative and probably more accurate transliteration would therefore render the text in OEN as such:\n{{block indent|Ve\u00f0r ok \u00deegn ok Gunnarr r\u00e6istu st\u00e6in \u00feenna at Haursa, f\u01eb\u00f0ur sinn. Gu\u00f0 hialpi \u01ebnd hans (OEN)}}\n\nSome [[past participle]]s and other words underwent i-umlaut in Old West Norse but not in Old East Norse dialects. Examples of that are Icelandic slegi\u00f0/sleginn and teki\u00f0/tekinn, which in Swedish are [[:wikt:slagit|slagit]]/[[:wikt:slagen|slagen]] and [[:wikt:tagit|tagit]]/[[:wikt:tagen|tagen]]. This can also be seen in the Icelandic and Norwegian words [[:wikt:sterkur|sterkur]] and [[:wikt:sterk|sterk]] (\"strong\"), which in Swedish is [[:wikt:stark|stark]] as in Old Swedish.<ref>{{citation| url = http://runeberg.org/svetym/0950.html | title = stark | page = 862 |work = Svensk etymologisk ordbok [Swedish etymological dictionary]|language = Swedish | year = 1922 | editor-first = Elof| editor-last = Hellquist | editorlink =Elof Hellquist }}</ref> These differences can also be seen in comparison between Norwegian and Swedish.\n\n=== Old West Norse ===\nThe combinations ''-mp-'', ''-nt-'', and ''-nk-'' mostly merged to ''-pp-'', ''-tt-'' and ''-kk-'' in Old West Norse around the 7th century, marking the first distinction between the Eastern and Western dialects.{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch.

Old West Norse was also characterized by the preservation of ''u''-umlaut, which meant that, for example, [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] *''tan\u00feu'', \"tooth\", was pronounced ''t\u01ebnn'' and not ''tann'' as in post-runic Old East Norse; OWN ''g\u01eb\u0301s'' and runic OEN ''g\u01eb\u0301s'', while post-runic OEN ''g\u00e1s'' \"goose\".\n\nThe earliest body of text appears in [[runic inscriptions]] and in poems composed c. 900 by [[\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir]] (although the poems are not preserved in contemporary sources, but only in much later manuscripts). The earliest manuscripts are from the period 1150\u20131200 and concern both legal, religious and historical matters. During the 12th and 13th centuries, [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] and [[Western Norway]] were the most important areas of the Norwegian kingdom and they shaped Old West Norse as an archaic language with a rich set of declensions. In the body of text that has survived into the modern day from until c. 1300, Old West Norse had little dialect variation, and [[Old Icelandic]] does not diverge much more than the [[Old Norwegian]] dialects do from each other.\n\nOld Norwegian differentiated early from Old Icelandic by the loss of the consonant ''h'' in initial position before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r''; thus whereas Old Icelandic manuscripts might use the form ''hnefi'', \"fist\", Old Norwegian manuscripts might use ''nefi''.\n\nFrom the late 13th century, Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian started to diverge more. After c. 1350, the [[Black Death]] and following social upheavals seem to have accelerated language changes in Norway. From the late 14th century, the language used in Norway is generally referred to as [[Old Norwegian#Middle Norwegian|Middle Norwegian]].\n\nOld West Norse underwent a lengthening of initial vowels at some point, especially in Norwegian, so that OWN ''eta'' became ''\u00e9ta,'' ONW ''akr'' > ''\u00e1kr'', OIC ''ek'' > ''\u00e9k''.<ref>{{citation |title=Further Old Norse Secondary Formations |first=Albert Morey |last=Sturtevant |journal=Language |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=457\u2013462 |year=1953  |jstor=409955 |doi=10.2307/409955 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Icelandic ====\nIn Iceland, initial {{IPA|/w/}} before {{IPA|/\u027e/}} was lost:<ref group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson |1874|loc = p.&nbsp;481 \"R\"}}</ref> compare Icelandic ''[[wikt:rangur#Icelandic|rangur]]'' with Norwegian ''vrangr'', OEN ''vrang\u0280''.

It is inscribed on both sides.]]\nOld East Norse, between 800 and 1100, is called ''Runic Swedish'' in Sweden and ''Runic Danish'' in Denmark, but for geographical rather than linguistic reasons. Any differences between the two were minute at best during the more ancient stages of this dialect group. Changes had a tendency to occur earlier in the Danish region. Even today many Old Danish changes have still not taken place in modern Swedish. Swedish is therefore the more [[Linguistic conservatism|conservative]] of the two in both the ancient and the modern languages, sometimes by a profound margin but in general, differences are still minute. The language is called \"runic\" because the body of text appears in [[runes]].\n\nRunic Old East Norse is characteristically conservative in form, especially Swedish (which is still true for modern Swedish compared to Danish). In essence it matches or surpasses the conservatism of post-runic Old West Norse, which in turn is generally more conservative than post-runic Old East Norse. While typically \"Eastern\" in structure, many later post-runic changes and trademarks of OEN had yet to happen.\n\nThe phoneme ''\u0280'', which evolved during the Proto-Norse period from ''z'', was still clearly separated from ''r'' in most positions, even when being geminated, while in OWN it had already merged with ''r''.\n\nMonophthongization of ''\u00e6i > \u0113'' and ''\u00f8y, au > \u00f8\u0304'' started in mid-10th-century Denmark.<ref name=\"FromOldNordic\" /> Compare runic OEN: ''f\u00e6ig\u0280'', ''g\u00e6i\u0280\u0280'', ''haug\u0280'', ''m\u00f8yd\u014dm\u0280'', ''di\u016b\u0280''; with Post-runic OEN: ''f\u0113gher'', ''g\u0113r'', ''h\u00f8\u0304gher'', ''m\u00f8\u0304d\u014dmber'', ''di\u016br''; OWN: ''[[wikt:feigr|feigr]]'', ''[[wikt:geirr|geirr]]'', ''[[wikt:howe|haugr]]'', ''meyd\u00f3mr'', ''d\u00fdr''; from PN *faigiaz, *gaizaz, *haugaz, *mawi- + d\u014dmaz 'maidendom; virginity', *diuza '(wild) animal'.\n\nFeminine o-stems often preserve the plural ending -a\u0280, while in OWN they more often merge with the feminine i-stems: (runic OEN) ''*s\u014dla\u0280'', ''*hafna\u0280''/''*hamna\u0280'', ''*v\u0101ga\u0280'' versus OWN ''s\u00f3lir'', ''hafnir'' and ''v\u00e1gir'' (modern Swedish ''solar'', ''hamnar'', ''v\u00e5gar'' (\"suns, havens, scales\"); Danish has mainly lost the distinction between the two stems, with both endings now being rendered as ''-er'' or ''-e'' alternatively for the o-stems).\n\nVice versa, masculine i-stems with the root ending in either ''g'' or ''k'' tended to shift the plural ending to that of the ja-stems while OEN kept the original: ''dr\u00e6ngia\u0280'', ''*\u00e6lgia\u0280'' and ''*b\u00e6nkia\u0280'' versus OWN ''[[wikt:drengr#Old Norse|drengir]]'', ''elgir'' (\"elks\") and ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 1|bekkir]]'' (modern Danish ''[[wikt:dreng|drenge]]'', ''[[wikt:elg|elge]]'', ''[[wikt:b\u00e6nk|b\u00e6nke]]'', modern Swedish ''[[wikt:dr\u00e4ng|dr\u00e4ngar]]'', ''\u00e4lgar'', ''b\u00e4nkar'').\n\nThe plural ending of ja-stems were mostly preserved while those of OEN often acquired that of the i-stems: ''*b\u00e6\u00f0ia\u0280'', ''*b\u00e6kkia\u0280'', ''*v\u00e6fia\u0280'' versus OWN ''be\u00f0ir'' (\"beds\"), ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 2|bekkir]]'', ''[[wikt:vefr#Old Norse|vefir]]'' (modern Swedish ''b\u00e4ddar'', ''b\u00e4ckar'', ''v\u00e4var'').\n\n==== Old Danish ====\n{{Further|History of Danish}}\nUntil the early 12th century, Old East Norse was very much a uniform dialect. It was in Denmark that the first innovations appeared that would differentiate Old Danish from Old Swedish ({{harvnb|Bandle|2005|loc = ''Old East Nordic'', pp.&nbsp;1856, 1859}}) as these innovations spread north unevenly (unlike the earlier changes that spread more evenly over the East Norse area), creating a series of [[isogloss]]es going from [[Zealand]] to [[Svealand]].\n\nIn Old Danish, {{IPA|/h\u027e/}} merged with {{IPA|/\u027e/}} during the 9th century.<ref>{{citation| first = Tarrin | last =  Wills | title = The Anonymous Verse in the Third Grammatical Treatise| url  =https://sro.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/10765/54631 | year = 2006 | isbn = | publisher = The Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Durham University }}</ref> From the 11th to 14th centuries, the unstressed vowels -''a'', -''o'' and -''e'' ([[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standard normalization]] -''a'', -''u'' and -''i'') started to merge into -''\u0259'', represented with the letter ''e''. This vowel came to be [[epenthesis|epenthetic]], particularly before ''-\u0280'' endings.<ref name=\"TheNordicLanguages\" /> At the same time, the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' became voiced plosives and even [[fricative consonant]]s. Resulting from these innovations, Danish has ''kage'' (cake), ''tunger'' (tongues) and ''g\u00e6ster'' (guests) whereas (Standard) Swedish has retained older forms, ''kaka'', ''tungor'' and ''g\u00e4ster'' (OEN ''kaka'', ''tungur'', ''g\u00e6stir'').\n\nMoreover, the Danish [[pitch accent]] shared with Norwegian and Swedish changed into ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' around this time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==== Old Swedish ====\n{{Further|Old Swedish}}\nAt the end of the 10th and early 11th century initial ''h-'' before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r'' was still preserved in the middle and northern parts of Sweden, and is sporadically still preserved in some northern dialects as ''g-'', e.g. ''gly'' (lukewarm), from ''hl\u00fd\u0280''. The [[Dalecarlian dialects]] developed independently from Old Swedish<ref name=Kroonen>{{citation|last1=Kroonen|first1=Guus|title=On the origins of the Elfdalian nasal vowels from the perspective of diachronic dialectology and Germanic etymology|url=http://inss.ku.dk/ansatte/?pure=files/35220983/elfdalian.pdf|work = inss.ku.dk | type = Presentation |accessdate=27 January 2016 |quote = (Slide 26) \u00a77.2 quote: \"In many aspects, Elfdalian, takes up a middle position between East and West Nordic.

It is the oldest text written as a manuscript found in Sweden and from the 13th century. It is contemporaneous with most of the Icelandic literature. The text marks the beginning of [[Old Swedish]] as a distinct dialect.\n{{Verse translation|\nDr\u00e6p\u00e6r ma\u00fear sv\u00e6nskan man eller smalensk\u00e6n, innan konongsrikis man, eigh v\u00e6stg\u00f8skan, b\u00f8te firi atta \u00f8rtogher ok \u00ferettan mark\u00e6r ok \u00e6nga \u00e6tar bot.

For example, the diphthong ''ai'' in ''aigu'', ''\u00feair'' and ''waita'' was not retroactively{{clarify|date=June 2019}} umlauted to ''ei'' as in e.g. Old Icelandic ''eigu'', ''\u00feeir'' and ''veita''. Gutnish also shows dropping of {{IPA|/w/}} in initial {{IPA|/w\u027e/}}, which it shares with the Old West Norse dialects (except Old East Norwegian<ref>{{cite book |last=Noreen |first=Adolf |title=Altnordische Grammatik I: Altisl\u00e4ndische und altnorwegische Grammatik  |url=http://www.arnastofnun.is/solofile/1016380 |publisher= |page=211 (\u00a7 288, note 1)}}</ref>), but which is otherwise abnormal. Breaking was also particularly active in Old Gutnish, leading to e.g. ''biera'' versus mainland ''bera''.<ref name=\"TheNordicLanguages\" />\n\n==== Text example ====\nThe [[Gutasaga]] is the longest text surviving from [[Old Gutnish]]. It was written in the 13th century and dealt with the early history of the Gotlanders. This part relates to the agreement that the Gotlanders had with the Swedish king sometime before the 9th century:\n\n{{Verse translation|\nSo gingu gutar sielfs wiliandi vndir suia kunung \u00fey at \u00feair mattin frir Oc frelsir sykia suiariki j huerium sta\u00fe. vtan tull oc allar utgiftir.

Likewise, the Swedes had the right to go to Gotland without corn restrictions or other prohibitions. The king was to provide protection and help, when they needed it and asked for it. The king and the jarl shall send emissaries to the Gutnish ''thing'' to receive the taxes. These emissaries shall declare free passage for the Gotlanders to all locations in the sea of the king at Uppsala and likewise for everyone who wanted to travel to Gotland.\n|attr1={{harvnb|Gutasaga|loc= \u00a7 ''Intr\u00e4det i Sverige''}}\n|attr2=\n}}\n\n== Relationship to other languages ==\n=== Relationship to English ===\n{{See also|History of English#Scandinavian influence|List of English words of Old Norse origin}}\n[[Old English]] and Old Norse were related languages.

This is because both [[English language|English]] and Old Norse stem from a [[Proto-Germanic]] mother language.

In the mainland Scandinavian languages, double consonants were reduced to single consonants, making the new vowel length phonemic.</ref> || {{IPA|a/\u025ba\u02d0}}<ref group=\"n\" name=\"vowel-length\" /> || {{IPA|a/\u0251\u02d0}}<ref group=\"n\" name=\"vowel-length\" /> {{angbr|a}};<br /> {{IPA|\u0254/o\u02d0}} {{angbr|\u00e5}} (+ld,rd,ng) || {{angbr|a}};<br /> {{IPA|\u0254/\u0254\u02d0}} {{angbr|\u00e5}} (+rd) || ON ''[[wikt:land|land]]'' \"land\": Ic/Fa/Sw/Da/No ''[[wikt:land|land]]'';<br /> ON ''[[wikt:dagr|dagr]]'' \"day\": Ic/Fa ''[[wikt:dagur|dagur]]'', Sw/Da/No ''[[wikt:dag|dag]]'';<br />ON ''[[wikt:har\u00f0r|har\u00f0r]]'' \"hard\": Ic/Fa ''[[wikt:har\u00f0ur|har\u00f0ur]]'', Sw/Da ''[[wikt:h\u00e5rd|h\u00e5rd]]'', No ''[[wikt:hard|hard]]'';<br />ON ''[[wikt:langr|langr]]'' \"long\": Ic/Fa ''[[wikt:langur|langur]]'', Sw ''[[wikt:l\u00e5ng|l\u00e5ng]]'', Da/No ''[[wikt:lang|lang]]''\n|-\n!

These dates, however, are not absolute, since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century.{{sfn|Torp|Vik\u00f8r|1993}}\n\nOld Norse was divided into three [[dialect]]s: [[Old West Norse]], [[Old East Norse]], and [[Old Gutnish]]. Old West and East Norse formed a [[dialect continuum]], with no clear geographical boundary between them. For example, Old East Norse traits were found in eastern [[Norway]], although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse, and Old West Norse traits were found in western [[Sweden]]. Most speakers spoke Old East Norse in what is present-day [[Denmark]] and Sweden. Old Gutnish, the more obscure dialectal branch, is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations. It developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches.\n\nThe 12th-century Icelandic ''[[Gray Goose Laws]]'' state that Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, ''d\u01ebnsk tunga'' (\"Danish tongue\"; speakers of Old East Norse would have said ''dansk tunga''). Another term, used especially commonly with reference to West Norse, was ''norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l'' or ''norr\u01ffnt m\u00e1l'' (\"Nordic/Northern speech\"). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (both inherited cases from the language), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable [[mutual intelligibility]].\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\n{{Old Norse language map}}\n[[Old Norse#Old Icelandic|Old Icelandic]] was very close to [[Old Norwegian]], and together they formed the Old West Norse dialect, which was also spoken in settlements in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and northwest England, and in Norse settlements in [[Normandy]].<ref name=\"JohnsonEcyc\">{{harvnb|Adams|1899|loc= \"Scandinavian Languages\", pp. 336\u2013338}}</ref> The Old East Norse dialect was spoken in Denmark, Sweden, settlements in [[Kievan Rus']],<ref name=\"Nationalencyklopedin\">{{citation| title = Nordiska spr\u00e5k| at = \u00a7 ''Historia'', \u00a7\u00a7 ''Omkring 800\u20131100''| work = [[Nationalencyklopedin]]| language = Swedish | year = 1994}}</ref> eastern England, and Danish settlements in [[Normandy]]. The [[Old Gutnish]] dialect was spoken in [[Gotland]] and in various settlements in the East. In the 11th century, Old Norse was the most widely spoken European language, ranging from [[Vinland]] in the West to the [[Volga River]] in the East. In [[Kievan Rus']], it survived the longest in [[Veliky Novgorod]], probably lasting into the [[13th century]] there.<ref name=\"Nationalencyklopedin\" /> The age of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]] is strongly contested, but at latest by the time of the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in the 13th century, Swedish settlement had spread the language into the region.\n\n== Modern descendants ==\n{{Main|North Germanic languages}}\nThe modern descendants of the Old West Norse dialect are the West Scandinavian languages of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and the extinct [[Norn language]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]; the descendants of the Old East Norse dialect are the East Scandinavian languages of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Norwegian is descended from Old West Norse, but over the centuries it has been heavily influenced by East Norse, particularly during the [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] union.\n\nAmong these, the grammar of Icelandic and the Faroese have changed the least from Old Norse in the last thousand years. In contrast, the pronunciation of both Icelandic and Faroese have changed considerably from Old Norse. With Danish rule of the Faroe Islands, Faroese has also been influenced by Danish. Old Norse also had an influence on [[English language|English]] dialects and [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]], which contain many Old Norse [[loanword]]s. It also influenced the development of the [[Norman language]], and through it and to a smaller extent, that of modern [[French language|French]].\n\nOf the modern languages, Icelandic is the closest to Old Norse seen to grammar and vocabulary. Written modern Icelandic derives from the Old Norse [[phoneme|phonemic]] writing system. Contemporary Icelandic-speakers can read Old Norse, which varies slightly in spelling as well as semantics and word order. However, pronunciation, particularly of the vowel phonemes, has changed at least as much in Icelandic as in the other North Germanic languages.\n\nFaroese retains many similarities but is influenced by Danish, Norwegian, and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] ([[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and/or [[Irish language|Irish]]).{{sfn|van der Auwera|K\u00f6nig|1994|loc = \"Faroese\" (Barnes & Weyhe), p. 217}} Although Swedish, Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most, they still retain [[mutual intelligibility]].{{sfn|Moberg|Gooskens|Nerbonne|Vaillette|2007}} Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by [[Middle Low German]].<ref>''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Harbert|2007|pp=7\u201310}}</ref>\n\n===Other influenced languages===\nVarious other languages, which are not closely related, have been heavily influenced by Norse, particularly the [[Norman language]].

The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized orthography]] marks the long vowels with an acute accent. In medieval manuscripts, it is often unmarked but sometimes marked with an accent or through [[gemination]].\n\nOld Norse had nasalized versions of all ten vowel places.<ref name=\"CleasbyA\" group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson|1874|loc= p.1, \"A\"}}</ref> These occurred as allophones of the vowels before nasal consonants and in places where a nasal had followed it in an older form of the word, before it was absorbed into a neighboring sound. If the nasal was absorbed by a stressed vowel, it would also lengthen the vowel. These nasalizations also occurred in the other Germanic languages, but were not retained long. They were noted in the [[First Grammatical Treatise]], and otherwise might have remained unknown. The First Grammarian marked these with a dot above the letter.<ref name=\"CleasbyA\" group=\"cv\" /> This notation did not catch on, and would soon be obsolete. Nasal and oral vowels probably merged around the 11th century in most of Old East Norse.{{sfn|Bandle|2005|loc = Ch.

It is unclear whether they were sequences of two consonants (with the first element realised as {{IPA|/h/}} or perhaps {{IPA|/x/}}) or as single voiceless sonorants {{IPA|/l\u0325/}}, {{IPA|/r\u0325/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0325/}} respectively. In Old Norwegian, Old Danish and later Old Swedish, the groups ''hl'', ''hr'', ''hn'' were reduced to plain ''l'', ''r'', ''n'', which suggests that they had most likely already been pronounced as voiceless sonorants by Old Norse times.\n\nThe pronunciation of ''hv'' is unclear, but it may have been {{IPA|/x\u02b7/}} (the Proto-Germanic pronunciation), {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}} or the similar phoneme {{IPA|/\u028d/}}. Unlike the three other digraphs, it was retained much longer in all dialects. Without ever developing into a voiceless sonorant in Icelandic, it instead underwent [[fortition]] to a plosive {{IPA|/kv/}}, which suggests that instead of being a voiceless sonorant, it retained a stronger frication.\n\n=== Orthography ===\n{{Main|Old Norse orthography}}\nUnlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]], runic Old Norse was originally written with the [[Younger Futhark]], which had only 16 letters. Because of the limited number of runes, several runes were used for different sounds, and long and short vowels were not distinguished in writing. [[Medieval runes]] came into use some time later.\n\nAs for the [[Latin alphabet]], there was no standardized orthography in use in the Middle Ages. A modified version of the letter [[wynn]] called [[vend (letter)|vend]] was used briefly for the sounds {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}. Long vowels were sometimes marked with acutes but also sometimes left unmarked or geminated. The [[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized Old Norse spelling]] was created in the 19th century and is, for the most part, phonemic. The most notable deviation is that the nonphonemic difference between the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced]] and the [[voiceless dental fricative]] is marked. The oldest texts and [[runic inscriptions]] use [[thorn (letter)|''\u00fe'']] exclusively. Long vowels are denoted with [[acute accent|acutes]]. Most other letters are written with the same glyph as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phoneme, except as shown in the table below.\n\n=== Accent ===\n{{See also|St\u00f8d|Norwegian phonology#Accent|Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|l1=Danish st\u00f8d|l2=Norwegian tonal stress|l3=Swedish tonal stress}}\n{{Expand section|Dating, etc.|date=April 2010}}\n\nPrimary [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] in Old Norse falls on the [[word stem]], so that ''hyrjar'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8hyr.jar/}}. In compound words, secondary stress falls on the second stem (e.g. ''[[wikt:l\u00e6risveinn#Old Norse|l\u00e6risveinn]]'', {{IPA|/\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0\u027e.i\u02ccsw\u025bin\u02d0/}}).<ref name=\"ProseReader\">{{harvnb|Vigf\u00fasson|Powell|1879|loc=  Ch. 1}}</ref>\n\n== Phonological processes ==\n=== Ablaut ===\n[[Indo-European ablaut|Ablaut]] patterns are groups of vowels which are swapped, or ''ablauted,'' in the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of a word. [[Old Norse morphology#Strong verbs|Strong verbs]] ablaut the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]'s nucleus to derive the past forms of the verb. This parallels English conjugation, where, e.g., the nucleus of ''sing'' becomes ''sang'' in the past tense and ''sung'' in the past participle. Some verbs are derived by ablaut, as the [[Old Norse morphology#Present-preterite verbs|present-in-past verbs]] do by consequence of being derived from the past tense forms of strong verbs.\n\n=== Umlaut ===\n{{See also|Germanic umlaut|Old Norse morphology#Before Old Norse|l2=Old Norse morphophonology}}\n\nUmlaut or mutation is an [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] process acting on vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel of a different [[vowel backness]]. In the case of ''i-umlaut'' and ''\u0280-umlaut'', this entails a fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of ''u-umlaut'', this entails [[labialization]] of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and in many situations grammatically significant as a side effect of losing the [[Proto-Germanic language#Morphology|Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes]] whose vowels created the umlaut [[allophones]].\n\nSome {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8y/}},<ref name=\"FromOldNordic\" /> and all {{IPA|/\u025bi/}} were obtained by [[i-mutation|i-umlaut]] from {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/au/}}, and {{IPA|/ai/}} respectively.

Most of the fused [[morpheme]]s are retained in modern Icelandic, especially in regard to noun case declensions, whereas modern Norwegian in comparison has moved towards more analytical word structures.\n\n=== Gender ===\n{{Further|Grammatical gender}}\nOld Norse had three [[grammatical gender]]s \u2013 masculine, feminine and neuter. Adjectives or pronouns referring to a noun must [[Agreement (linguistics)|mirror the gender of that noun]], so that one says, \"heill ma\u00f0r!\" but, \"heilt barn!\" As in other languages, the grammatical gender of an impersonal noun is generally unrelated to an expected natural gender of that noun. While indeed ''karl'', \"man\" is masculine, ''kona'', \"woman\", is feminine, and ''h\u00fas'', house, is neuter, so also are ''hrafn'' and ''kr\u00e1ka'', for \"raven\" and \"crow\", masculine and feminine respectively, even in reference to a female raven or a male crow.\n\nAll neuter words have identical nominative and accusative forms,{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc = [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/neutern.php Neuter nouns]}} and all feminine words have identical nominative and accusative plurals.{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc =  [http://www3.hi.is/~haukurth/norse/grammar/femininen.php Feminine nouns]}}\n\nThe gender of some words' plurals does not agree with that of their singulars, such as ''lim'' and ''mund''.<ref group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson |1874|loc= p.&nbsp;389 col.1, \"LIM\"; p.&nbsp;437, col.1 \"MUND\"}}</ref> Some words, such as ''hungr'', have multiple genders, evidenced by their [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] being declined in different genders within a given sentence.{{sfn|''The Menota handbook''|loc=Ch. 8 \u00a73.2.1 \"Gender\"}}{{sfn|Zo\u00ebga|1910|loc = H: ''hungr''}}\n\n=== Morphology ===\n{{Main|Old Norse morphology}}\nNouns, adjectives and pronouns were [[declension|declined]] in four grammatical cases{{snd}}[[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]]{{snd}}in singular and plural numbers. Adjectives and pronouns were additionally declined in three grammatical genders. Some pronouns (first and second person) could have [[dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] in addition to singular and plural. The genitive was used [[partitive case|partitively]] and in compounds and [[kenning]]s (e.g., ''[[Ur\u00f0arbrunnr]]'', the well of Ur\u00f0r; ''[[Lokasenna]]'', the [[gibing]] of Loki).\n\nThere were several classes of nouns within each gender. The following is an example of the \"strong\" [[inflectional paradigm]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | The strong masculine noun '''armr''' (English '''arm''')\n|-\n! Case !! '''Singular''' !! '''Plural'''\n|-\n| '''Nominative''' || armr || armar\n|-\n| '''Accusative''' || arm || rowspan=\"2\" | arma\n|-\n| '''Genitive''' || arms\n|-\n| '''Dative''' || armi ||  \u01ebrmum/armum\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | The feminine noun '''h\u01ebll''' (OWN), '''hall''' (OEN) (English '''hall''')\n|-\n!

This definite article, however, was a separate word and did not become attached to the noun before later stages of the Old Norse period.\n\n== Texts ==\n{{Commons category|Old Norse manuscripts}}\nThe earliest inscriptions in Old Norse are [[runic alphabet|runic]], from the 8th century. Runes continued to be commonly used until the 15th century and have been recorded to be in use in some form as late as the 19th century in some parts of Sweden. With the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|conversion to Christianity]] in the 11th century came the [[Latin alphabet]]. The oldest preserved texts in Old Norse in the Latin alphabet date from the middle of the 12th century. Subsequently, Old Norse became the vehicle of a large and varied body of vernacular literature, unique in medieval Europe. Most of the surviving literature was written in Iceland. Best known are the [[Norse saga]]s, the [[Icelanders' sagas]] and the mythological literature, but there also survives a large body of religious literature, translations into Old Norse of [[courtly romance]]s, classical mythology, and the Old Testament, as well as instructional material, [[First Grammatical Treatise|grammatical treatises]] and a large body of letters and official documents.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2004|p=22\u2013102}}\n\n== Dialects ==\nMost of the innovations that appeared in Old Norse spread evenly through the Old Norse area. As a result, the dialects were very similar and considered to be the same language, a language that they sometimes called the Danish tongue (''D\u01ebnsk tunga''), sometimes Norse language (''Norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l''), as evidenced in the following two quotes from [[Heimskringla]] by [[Snorri Sturluson]]:\n\n{{Verse translation|M\u00f3\u00f0ir Dyggva var Dr\u00f3tt, d\u00f3ttir Danps konungs, sonar R\u00edgs er fyrstr var konungr kalla\u00f0r \u00e1 danska tungu.\n|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Ynglinga saga \u00a7 20. ''Dau\u00f0i Dyggva''\n|Dyggvi's mother was Drott, the daughter of king Danp, R\u00edg's son, who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue.\n}}\n\n{{Verse translation|...stirt var honum norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l, ok kylfdi m\u1d0a\u01ebk til or\u00f0anna, ok h\u01ebf\u00f0u margir menn \u00feat m\u1d0a\u01ebk at spotti.\n|attr1=[[Heimskringla]], Saga Sigur\u00f0ar J\u00f3rsalafara, Eysteins ok \u00d3lafs \u00a7 35(34). ''Fr\u00e1 ve\u00f0jan Haralds ok Magn\u00fas''\n|...the Norse language was hard for him, and he often fumbled for words, which amused people greatly.\n}}\n\nHowever, some changes were geographically limited and so created a dialectal difference between Old West Norse and Old East Norse.\n\nAs Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse, in the 8th century, the effects of the [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] seem to have been very much the same over the whole Old Norse area. But in later dialects of the language a split occurred mainly between west and east as the use of umlauts began to vary. The typical umlauts (for example ''fylla'' from *''fullijan'') were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed (many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse).\n\nAll the while, the changes resulting in [[breaking (linguistics)|breaking]] (for example ''hiarta'' from *''hert\u014d'') were more influential in the East probably once again due to generalizations within the inflectional system. This difference was one of the greatest reasons behind the dialectalization that took place in the 9th and 10th centuries, shaping an Old West Norse dialect in Norway and the Atlantic settlements and an Old East Norse dialect in Denmark and Sweden.\n\nOld West Norse and Old Gutnish did not take part in the monophthongization which changed ''\u00e6i'' (''ei'') into ''\u0113'', ''\u00f8y'' (''ey'') and ''au'' into ''\u00f8\u0304'', nor did certain peripheral dialects of Swedish, as seen in modern [[Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia|Ostrobothnian dialects]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://aveneca.com/westeast.html|title=The Old Norse dialect areas| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707195311/http://aveneca.com/westeast.html| archivedate = 7 Jul 2011| year =2009 | work = aveneca.com}}</ref> Another difference was that Old West Norse lost certain combinations of consonants. The combinations -''mp''-, -''nt''-, and -''nk''- were assimilated into -''pp''-, -''tt''- and -''kk''- in Old West Norse, but this phenomenon was limited in Old East Norse.\n\nHere is a comparison between the two dialects as well as Old Gutnish. It is a transcription from one of the [[Funbo Runestones]] (U 990) from the eleventh century (translation: 'Ve\u00f0r and Thane and Gunnar raised this stone after Haursi, their father. God help his spirit'):\n{{block indent|Ve\u00f0r ok \u00deegn ok Gunnarr reistu stein \u00feenna at Haursa, f\u01eb\u00f0ur sinn. Gu\u00f0 hjalpi \u01ebnd hans.

Modern studies{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} have shown that the positions where it applies are the same as for runic Old West Norse. An alternative and probably more accurate transliteration would therefore render the text in OEN as such:\n{{block indent|Ve\u00f0r ok \u00deegn ok Gunnarr r\u00e6istu st\u00e6in \u00feenna at Haursa, f\u01eb\u00f0ur sinn. Gu\u00f0 hialpi \u01ebnd hans (OEN)}}\n\nSome [[past participle]]s and other words underwent i-umlaut in Old West Norse but not in Old East Norse dialects. Examples of that are Icelandic slegi\u00f0/sleginn and teki\u00f0/tekinn, which in Swedish are [[:wikt:slagit|slagit]]/[[:wikt:slagen|slagen]] and [[:wikt:tagit|tagit]]/[[:wikt:tagen|tagen]].

During the 12th and 13th centuries, [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] and [[Western Norway]] were the most important areas of the Norwegian kingdom and they shaped Old West Norse as an archaic language with a rich set of declensions. In the body of text that has survived into the modern day from until c. 1300, Old West Norse had little dialect variation, and [[Old Icelandic]] does not diverge much more than the [[Old Norwegian]] dialects do from each other.\n\nOld Norwegian differentiated early from Old Icelandic by the loss of the consonant ''h'' in initial position before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r''; thus whereas Old Icelandic manuscripts might use the form ''hnefi'', \"fist\", Old Norwegian manuscripts might use ''nefi''.\n\nFrom the late 13th century, Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian started to diverge more. After c. 1350, the [[Black Death]] and following social upheavals seem to have accelerated language changes in Norway. From the late 14th century, the language used in Norway is generally referred to as [[Old Norwegian#Middle Norwegian|Middle Norwegian]].\n\nOld West Norse underwent a lengthening of initial vowels at some point, especially in Norwegian, so that OWN ''eta'' became ''\u00e9ta,'' ONW ''akr'' > ''\u00e1kr'', OIC ''ek'' > ''\u00e9k''.<ref>{{citation |title=Further Old Norse Secondary Formations |first=Albert Morey |last=Sturtevant |journal=Language |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=457\u2013462 |year=1953  |jstor=409955 |doi=10.2307/409955 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Icelandic ====\nIn Iceland, initial {{IPA|/w/}} before {{IPA|/\u027e/}} was lost:<ref group=\"cv\">{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigf\u00fasson |1874|loc = p.&nbsp;481 \"R\"}}</ref> compare Icelandic ''[[wikt:rangur#Icelandic|rangur]]'' with Norwegian ''vrangr'', OEN ''vrang\u0280''.

It is inscribed on both sides.]]\nOld East Norse, between 800 and 1100, is called ''Runic Swedish'' in Sweden and ''Runic Danish'' in Denmark, but for geographical rather than linguistic reasons. Any differences between the two were minute at best during the more ancient stages of this dialect group. Changes had a tendency to occur earlier in the Danish region. Even today many Old Danish changes have still not taken place in modern Swedish. Swedish is therefore the more [[Linguistic conservatism|conservative]] of the two in both the ancient and the modern languages, sometimes by a profound margin but in general, differences are still minute. The language is called \"runic\" because the body of text appears in [[runes]].\n\nRunic Old East Norse is characteristically conservative in form, especially Swedish (which is still true for modern Swedish compared to Danish). In essence it matches or surpasses the conservatism of post-runic Old West Norse, which in turn is generally more conservative than post-runic Old East Norse. While typically \"Eastern\" in structure, many later post-runic changes and trademarks of OEN had yet to happen.\n\nThe phoneme ''\u0280'', which evolved during the Proto-Norse period from ''z'', was still clearly separated from ''r'' in most positions, even when being geminated, while in OWN it had already merged with ''r''.\n\nMonophthongization of ''\u00e6i > \u0113'' and ''\u00f8y, au > \u00f8\u0304'' started in mid-10th-century Denmark.<ref name=\"FromOldNordic\" /> Compare runic OEN: ''f\u00e6ig\u0280'', ''g\u00e6i\u0280\u0280'', ''haug\u0280'', ''m\u00f8yd\u014dm\u0280'', ''di\u016b\u0280''; with Post-runic OEN: ''f\u0113gher'', ''g\u0113r'', ''h\u00f8\u0304gher'', ''m\u00f8\u0304d\u014dmber'', ''di\u016br''; OWN: ''[[wikt:feigr|feigr]]'', ''[[wikt:geirr|geirr]]'', ''[[wikt:howe|haugr]]'', ''meyd\u00f3mr'', ''d\u00fdr''; from PN *faigiaz, *gaizaz, *haugaz, *mawi- + d\u014dmaz 'maidendom; virginity', *diuza '(wild) animal'.\n\nFeminine o-stems often preserve the plural ending -a\u0280, while in OWN they more often merge with the feminine i-stems: (runic OEN) ''*s\u014dla\u0280'', ''*hafna\u0280''/''*hamna\u0280'', ''*v\u0101ga\u0280'' versus OWN ''s\u00f3lir'', ''hafnir'' and ''v\u00e1gir'' (modern Swedish ''solar'', ''hamnar'', ''v\u00e5gar'' (\"suns, havens, scales\"); Danish has mainly lost the distinction between the two stems, with both endings now being rendered as ''-er'' or ''-e'' alternatively for the o-stems).\n\nVice versa, masculine i-stems with the root ending in either ''g'' or ''k'' tended to shift the plural ending to that of the ja-stems while OEN kept the original: ''dr\u00e6ngia\u0280'', ''*\u00e6lgia\u0280'' and ''*b\u00e6nkia\u0280'' versus OWN ''[[wikt:drengr#Old Norse|drengir]]'', ''elgir'' (\"elks\") and ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 1|bekkir]]'' (modern Danish ''[[wikt:dreng|drenge]]'', ''[[wikt:elg|elge]]'', ''[[wikt:b\u00e6nk|b\u00e6nke]]'', modern Swedish ''[[wikt:dr\u00e4ng|dr\u00e4ngar]]'', ''\u00e4lgar'', ''b\u00e4nkar'').\n\nThe plural ending of ja-stems were mostly preserved while those of OEN often acquired that of the i-stems: ''*b\u00e6\u00f0ia\u0280'', ''*b\u00e6kkia\u0280'', ''*v\u00e6fia\u0280'' versus OWN ''be\u00f0ir'' (\"beds\"), ''[[wikt:bekkr#Etymology 2|bekkir]]'', ''[[wikt:vefr#Old Norse|vefir]]'' (modern Swedish ''b\u00e4ddar'', ''b\u00e4ckar'', ''v\u00e4var'').\n\n==== Old Danish ====\n{{Further|History of Danish}}\nUntil the early 12th century, Old East Norse was very much a uniform dialect. It was in Denmark that the first innovations appeared that would differentiate Old Danish from Old Swedish ({{harvnb|Bandle|2005|loc = ''Old East Nordic'', pp.&nbsp;1856, 1859}}) as these innovations spread north unevenly (unlike the earlier changes that spread more evenly over the East Norse area), creating a series of [[isogloss]]es going from [[Zealand]] to [[Svealand]].\n\nIn Old Danish, {{IPA|/h\u027e/}} merged with {{IPA|/\u027e/}} during the 9th century.<ref>{{citation| first = Tarrin | last =  Wills | title = The Anonymous Verse in the Third Grammatical Treatise| url  =https://sro.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/10765/54631 | year = 2006 | isbn = | publisher = The Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Durham University }}</ref> From the 11th to 14th centuries, the unstressed vowels -''a'', -''o'' and -''e'' ([[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standard normalization]] -''a'', -''u'' and -''i'') started to merge into -''\u0259'', represented with the letter ''e''. This vowel came to be [[epenthesis|epenthetic]], particularly before ''-\u0280'' endings.<ref name=\"TheNordicLanguages\" /> At the same time, the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' became voiced plosives and even [[fricative consonant]]s. Resulting from these innovations, Danish has ''kage'' (cake), ''tunger'' (tongues) and ''g\u00e6ster'' (guests) whereas (Standard) Swedish has retained older forms, ''kaka'', ''tungor'' and ''g\u00e4ster'' (OEN ''kaka'', ''tungur'', ''g\u00e6stir'').\n\nMoreover, the Danish [[pitch accent]] shared with Norwegian and Swedish changed into ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' around this time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==== Old Swedish ====\n{{Further|Old Swedish}}\nAt the end of the 10th and early 11th century initial ''h-'' before ''l'', ''n'' and ''r'' was still preserved in the middle and northern parts of Sweden, and is sporadically still preserved in some northern dialects as ''g-'', e.g. ''gly'' (lukewarm), from ''hl\u00fd\u0280''.

It is the oldest text written as a manuscript found in Sweden and from the 13th century. It is contemporaneous with most of the Icelandic literature.

For example, the diphthong ''ai'' in ''aigu'', ''\u00feair'' and ''waita'' was not retroactively{{clarify|date=June 2019}} umlauted to ''ei'' as in e.g. Old Icelandic ''eigu'', ''\u00feeir'' and ''veita''. Gutnish also shows dropping of {{IPA|/w/}} in initial {{IPA|/w\u027e/}}, which it shares with the Old West Norse dialects (except Old East Norwegian<ref>{{cite book |last=Noreen |first=Adolf |title=Altnordische Grammatik I: Altisl\u00e4ndische und altnorwegische Grammatik  |url=http://www.arnastofnun.is/solofile/1016380 |publisher= |page=211 (\u00a7 288, note 1)}}</ref>), but which is otherwise abnormal. Breaking was also particularly active in Old Gutnish, leading to e.g. ''biera'' versus mainland ''bera''.<ref name=\"TheNordicLanguages\" />\n\n==== Text example ====\nThe [[Gutasaga]] is the longest text surviving from [[Old Gutnish]]. It was written in the 13th century and dealt with the early history of the Gotlanders. This part relates to the agreement that the Gotlanders had with the Swedish king sometime before the 9th century:\n\n{{Verse translation|\nSo gingu gutar sielfs wiliandi vndir suia kunung \u00fey at \u00feair mattin frir Oc frelsir sykia suiariki j huerium sta\u00fe. vtan tull oc allar utgiftir.

Likewise, the Swedes had the right to go to Gotland without corn restrictions or other prohibitions. The king was to provide protection and help, when they needed it and asked for it. The king and the jarl shall send emissaries to the Gutnish ''thing'' to receive the taxes. These emissaries shall declare free passage for the Gotlanders to all locations in the sea of the king at Uppsala and likewise for everyone who wanted to travel to Gotland.\n|attr1={{harvnb|Gutasaga|loc= \u00a7 ''Intr\u00e4det i Sverige''}}\n|attr2=\n}}\n\n== Relationship to other languages ==\n=== Relationship to English ===\n{{See also|History of English#Scandinavian influence|List of English words of Old Norse origin}}\n[[Old English]] and Old Norse were related languages.

This is because both [[English language|English]] and Old Norse stem from a [[Proto-Germanic]] mother language.

This was the nickname given to by her [[Muslim]] opponents because of her alleged ability to foresee the future.\n\nShe was born into the [[Jarawa (Berber)|Jr\u0101wa]] [[Zenata]] tribe in the early 7th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1jfzkJTAZgC|title=North Africa: A History from Antiquity to the Present|last=Naylor|first=Phillip C.|year=2009|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=|page=65|language=en|isbn=978-0292778788}}</ref>\n\nFor five years she ruled a free Berber state from the [[Aur\u00e8s Mountains]] to the oasis of [[Gadames]] (695\u2013700 CE).\n\nBut the Arabs, commanded by [[Musa bin Nusayr]], returned with a strong army and defeated her. She fought at the [[El Djem]] Roman amphitheater but finally was killed in combat near a well that still bears her name, ''Bir al Kahina'' in [[Aures, Algeria|Aures]].<ref name=\"JulienTourneau1970\">{{cite book|author1=Charles Andr\u00e9 Julien|author2=Roger Le Tourneau|title=Histoire de L'Afrique du Nord|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYZyAAAAMAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Praeger|page=13}}</ref>\n\nAccounts from the 19th century on claim she was of [[Berber Jews|Jewish]] religion or that her [[tribe]] were [[Berber Jews|Judaized]] [[Berbers]].<ref>See Hirschberg (1963) and Talbi (1971).</ref> According to [[Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi|al-M\u0101lik\u012b]], she was accompanied in her travels by an \"idol\". Both [[Mohamed Talbi]] and [[Gabriel Camps]] interpreted this idol as a Christian icon, either of Christ, the Virgin, or a saint protecting the queen. [[M'hamed Hassine Fantar]] held that this icon represented a separate Berber deity, and thus made Dihya a pagan.

Hirschberg and Talbi note that Ibn Khaldun seems to have been referring to a time before the advent of the late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] empires, and a little later in the same paragraph seems to say that by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times \"the tribes\" had become [[Christianized]]. As early as 1963, the Israeli historian H.Z. Hirschberg, in retranslating the text of Ibn Khaldun and rigorously repeating the whole document, questioned this interpretation, and in general the existence of large Jewish Berber tribes in the end of Antiquity.<ref name=\"EB1306\" /> In the words of H.Z.

[[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] marched from [[Egypt]] and captured the major [[Byzantine]] city of [[Carthage]] and other cities (see [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest of North Africa]]). Searching for another enemy to defeat, he was told that the most powerful monarch in North Africa was \"the Queen of the Berbers\" (Arabic: ''malikat al-barbar'') Dihy\u0101, and accordingly marched into [[Numidia]]. In 698, the armies met near [[Meskiana]]<ref>Talbi (1971) suggests that based on the topography reported by al-M\u0101lik\u012b, the actual battlefield was the Wadi N\u012bn\u012b.</ref> in the present-day province of [[Oum el-Bouaghi Province|Oum el-Bouaghi]] at the {{ill|Battle of Meskiana|fr|Bataille de l'oued Nini}} (or \"battle of camels\") in [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Philippe S\u00e9nac|author2=Patrice Cressier|title=Histoire du Maghreb m\u00e9di\u00e9val: VIIe-XIe si\u00e8cle|editor=Armand Colin|year=2012|page=111|language=French|isbn=}}</ref> She defeated Hasan so soundly that he fled [[Ifriqiya]] and holed up in [[Cyrenaica]] (Libya) for four or five years. Realizing that the enemy was too powerful and bound to return, she was said to have embarked on a [[scorched earth]] campaign, which had little impact on the mountain and desert tribes, but lost her the crucial support of the sedentary oasis-dwellers. Instead of discouraging the Arab armies, her desperate decision hastened defeat.<ref>However, even if true, the Arab accounts are considered to be greatly exaggerated.

For the Arabs, they told the story in a perspective that made the Kahina seem like a sorcerer, all in an attempt to discredit her. Some Arab historians took it even farther by saying that the Kahina eventually tried to have her sons adopt Islam as their religion. Another group that told the story of the Kahina was the French.

Her face is often seen in graffiti and sculptures around Algeria to showcase their support for the progressive ideals she represents. While her true appearance is still unknown, artists have depicted her with certain aspects that reinforce the progressive movement she is known to represent.

Here <math>\\mu_0</math> and <math>\\sigma_0</math> are the mean and variance, respectively, of an underlying lognormal distribution from which the MLP is derived.\n\n==Mathematical Properties of the MLP distribution==\n\nFollowing are the few mathematical properties of the MLP distribution:\n\n===Cumulative Distribution===\n\nThe MLP [[cumulative distribution function]] (<math>F(m) = \\int_{-\\infty}^m f(t) \\,dt</math>) is given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nF(m) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erfc}\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(m)-\\mu_0}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_0}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(\\alpha \\mu _0 + \\frac{\\alpha ^2 \\sigma ^2 _0}{2}\\right) m^{-\\alpha} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\sigma _0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\alpha \\sigma _0 - \\frac{\\ln(m)- \\mu_0}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_0}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWe can see that as <math>m\\to 0,</math> that <math>\\textstyle F(m)\\to \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(m - \\mu_0)}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_0}\\right),</math> which is the cumulative distribution function for a lognormal distribution with parameters ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> and ''\u03c3''<sub>0</sub>.\n\n===Mean, Variance, Raw Moments ===\n\nThe [[expectation value]] of <math>M</math><sup>k</sup> gives the <math>k</math><sup>th</sup> [[raw moment]] of <math>M</math>,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle M^k\\rangle = \\int _0 ^{\\infty} m^k f(m) \\mathrm dm\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis exists if and only if \u03b1 > <math>k</math>, in which case it becomes:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle M^k\\rangle = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-k} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0 ^2 k^2}{2} + \\mu_0 k\\right),\\ \\alpha > k\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich is the <math>k</math><sup>th</sup> raw moment of the lognormal distribution with the parameters \u03bc<sub>0</sub> and \u03c3<sub>0</sub> scaled by {{frac|\u03b1|\u03b1-<math>k</math>}} in the limit \u03b1\u2192\u221e. This gives the mean and variance of the MLP distribution:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle M \\rangle = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma ^2 _0}{2} + \\mu _0\\right),\\  \\alpha > 1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle M^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-2} \\exp\\left(2\\left(\\sigma ^2 _0 + \\mu _0\\right)\\right),\\  \\alpha > 2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nVar(<math>M</math>) = \u27e8<math>M</math><sup>2</sup>\u27e9-(\u27e8<math>M</math>\u27e9)<sup>2</sup> = \u03b1 exp(\u03c3<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2\u03bc<sub>0</sub>) ({{sfrac|exp(\u03c3<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)|\u03b1-2}} - {{sfrac|\u03b1|(\u03b1-2)<sup>2</sup>}}), \u03b1 > 2\n\n=== Mode ===\n\nThe solution to the equation <math>f'(m)</math> = 0 (equating the slope to zero at the point of maxima) for <math>m</math> gives the mode of the MLP distribution.\n\n:<math>f'(m) = 0  \\Leftrightarrow K \\operatorname{erfc}(u) = \\exp(-u^2),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\textstyle u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\alpha\\sigma_0 - \\frac{\\ln m - \\mu_0}{\\sigma_0} \\right)</math> and <math>K = \\sigma_0(\\alpha+1)\\tfrac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}.</math>\n\nNumerical methods are required to solve this transcendental equation. However, noting that if <math>K</math>\u22481 then u = 0 gives us the mode <math>m</math><sup>*</sup>:\n\n:<math>m^* = \\exp (\\mu_0+ \\alpha \\sigma ^2 _0)</math>\n\n=== Random Variate ===\n\nThe lognormal random variate is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL(\\mu,\\sigma) = \\exp(\\mu+\\sigma N(0,1))\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere <math>N(0,1)</math> is standard normal random variate. The exponential random variate is :\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nE(\\delta) = - \\delta^{-1} \\ln(R(0,1))\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere R(0,1) is the uniform random variate in the interval [0,1]. Using these two, we can derive the random variate for the MLP distribution to be:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nM (\\mu_0,\\sigma_0,\\alpha) =  \\exp(\\mu_0 + \\sigma_0 N (0,1) - \\alpha^{-1} \\ln(R(0,1)))\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== References == \n# {{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Shantanu|last2=Gil|first2=M|last3=Auddy|first3=Sayatan|title=The MLP distribution: a modified lognormal power-law model for the stellar initial mass function|journal=MNRAS|date=April 1, 2015|volume=449|issue=3|pages=2413\u20132420|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv445|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/449/3/2413.full|arxiv=1503.00023|bibcode=2015MNRAS.449.2413B}}\n\n[[Category:Normal distribution]]\n", "name_user": "Popsci2020", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed a typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_lognormal_power-law_distribution"}
