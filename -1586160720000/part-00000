It was shot at [[Merton Park Studios]] and in [[Croydon]] for [[Anglo Amalgamated]], then distributed in the United States by [[American International Pictures]] (AIP) as a [[double feature]] with ''[[Master of the World (1961 film)|Master of the World]]''.

During that year, he came across a way of growing plants and animals to an enormous size. He brings back a baby [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], named Konga, to test out his theory. Decker goes insane after he discovers a serum that turns his chimpanzee subject into a ferocious [[gorilla]]-sized ape. To further his hideous experiments, he mesmerizes the ape and sends it to [[London]] to kill all of his enemies who have more credit in the scientific community than he already has. Among his targets is Dean Foster ([[Austin Trevor]]) Professor Tagore ([[George Pastell]]) and Bob Kenton ([[Jess Conrad]]), the lover of Sandra Banks ([[Claire Gordon]]), the woman that the doctor wants for himself.\n\nAfter Konga strangles Bob Kenton to death, Decker attempts to make Sandra his own. This does not sit well with Margaret ([[Margo Johns]]), the botanist's assistant and current girlfriend, who attempts to get even by giving Konga an enormous amount of the strange serum and turns him into an enormous monster, although she becomes his first victim.\n\nJust before going on a rampage, the super-sized ape grabs Decker in one of his enormous hands, while Sandra's arm is eaten by Decker's carnivorous plants. His rampage comes to a stop when he and Decker are killed by the British army. Upon his death, Konga changes back to a baby chimpanzee.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Michael Gough]] as Dr. Charles Decker\n* [[Margo Johns]] as Margaret\n* [[Jess Conrad]] as Bob Kenton\n* [[Claire Gordon]] as Sandra Banks\n* [[Austin Trevor]] as Dean Foster\n* [[Jack Watson (actor)|Jack Watson]] as Superintendent Brown\n* [[George Pastell]] as Professor Tagore\n* [[Vanda Godsell]] as Bob's Mother\n* [[Stanley Morgan (author)|Stanley Morgan]] as Inspector Lawson\n* [[Grace Arnold]] as Miss Barnesdell\n* [[Leonard Sachs]] as Bob's Father\n* [[Nicholas Bennett]] as Daniel\n* Kim Tracy as Mary \n* Rupert Osborne as Eric Kenton\n* Waveney Lee as Janet Kenton \n* [[John Welsh (actor)|John Welsh]] as Commissioner Garland\n* Paul Stockman as Konga (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFollowing the incredible success of Herman Cohen's previous British made film ''[[Horrors of the Black Museum]]'' that also featured [[Michael Gough]], [[Nat Cohen]] (who was no relation to Herman) of [[Anglo-Amalgamated]] asked Cohen for another [[exploitation film]].\n\nAs Cohen had long admired ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', he thought of a giant ape film shot in color.

The player takes the role of Sam, short for the System Administration Maintenance (SAM) [[artificial intelligence]] software aboard a multi-national space station that serves to monitor the entire station. Initially, the player's view is limited to where the crew have relocated Sam, but as the game progresses, Sam can move its core presence between several of the modules on the station and manipulate cameras and other electronically-controlled equipment in that module. Further on, Sam is provided one of several small spherical probes that allows Sam to move more freely through the station and into hostile environments harmful to the humans aboard, including outside of the station.\n\nThe player, by manipulating Sam, can control various elements of the station, such as opening or closing hatches, activating safety systems and the like. Sam may be instructed by the crew to perform specific tasks, and Sam can reply by finding the task element of interest (such as the status of a station module) and report back to the crew.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:PIA18274-Saturn-NorthPolarHexagon-Cassini-20140402.jpg|thumb|right|Much of the game centers around the [[Saturn's hexagon|hexagonal cloud pattern]] that has been observed on Saturn.]]\nThe story opens aboard the multi-national space station ''Observation'' in orbit above Earth in the year 2026. An unknown event has crippled 'Observation', leaving it without power and spinning. Dr. Emma Fisher, the stations medical officer, tries to restore contact with Houston as well as other five members of the crew to ascertain what has happened, without success.\n\nShe manages to reboot the stations integrated AI, SAM (Systems Administration and Maintenance) which controls the station's systems and functions, and is the role the player assumes.\n\nAfter performing basic diagnostics to find out what happened, SAM receives a transmission of unknown origin, containing co-ordinates to an unknown location. The station then begins to tremor violently with a deafening sound. SAM becomes unresponsive to Emma while being influenced by the signal, causing strange glyphs to flicker on his interface, and with instructions to 'BRING HER' appearing.\n\nSAM recovers after an unspecified period of time has passed, to the sight of Emma having been rendered unconscious following the second event. She eventually comes to, and immediately instructs SAM to run a self-diagnostic. SAM tells Emma the event has caused him to lose most of his core data, and to be disconnected from most of the stations subsystems. He is also unable to locate the other crew members, who are missing and cannot be contacted.\n\nAs Emma restores limited functionality back to SAM, he attempts to re-interface with the rest of the space station and reconnect to his own components. Shortly after recovering some mobility, a station alarm goes off which Fisher instructs SAM to investigate. SAM discovers a fire in one of the modules.\n\nAfter extinguishing the fire, they discover an unidentified substance on a blank plate that is like a dark red oil. Before she can speculate what it is, another alarm goes off. SAM informs her that module 12 has become dislodged, and severe stress is being applied to the station, prompting recommendation for her to eject it.\n\nThey eject the loose module, and the station stabilizes. Concerned there might be extended damage, Emma instructs SAM to check external cameras for other potential risks, and learns that ''Observation'', through unknown means, is now in orbit over Saturn. Asking how they got there, SAM checks the station Black Box, which reveals he was the cause but doesn't know how.\n\nOnce more, SAM receives interference from an unknown entity and blacks out.\n\nEmma reboots SAM again to effect repairs, saying \"You weren't making any sense\". She sets about working with SAM to access the other parts of the station.   They find the bodies of the crew, including Jim, the mission commander. Discovering another crew member, Mae, to be alive in one of the sealed modules, Emma has SAM help with a space walk to get her to safety, but the station suddenly moves closer to Saturn and Mae is lost. A strange hexagonal object appears to both Sam and Emma and tries to communicate to them in a geographic glyph language before disappearing. Continuing repairs, they see a man-made object near Saturn's orbit. Initially thinking that Earth may have sent a rescue mission to them, they soon find it is an exact duplicate of ''Observation''.\n\nEmma uses SAM to jump to the other station, which has lost nearly all power. They find Jim is still alive, and learn this station also had the same weird events that brought them to Saturn. As SAM goes to try to restore basic life support, he interacts with this station's SAM, learning that there was a secret mission that Jim was to follow, based on the discovery that embedded in various star patterns was a specific DNA code and a point in space to be at. Jim had been directed by Earth to make sure ''Observation'' was at that point with Emma aboard at a specific time. Continuing on, Sam encounters another crew member, Josh, who has been hiding from Jim, as Jim has also killed his [[doppelg\u00e4nger]]. Before Josh can reveal more, Jim grabs SAM and Emma, and makes them jump back to Emma's ''Observation''. Jim locks Emma out of the station, leaving her on little life support. As she clings to life, several other identical ''Observation'' stations appear to start gathering around the storm.\n\nJim proceeds to lock SAM out of the controls while he sends a desperate message for help to Earth. SAM manages to find several back doors into the station's systems, interacts with the signal to Earth and warns them about the situation. Earth cuts off Jim, who now knows SAM is to blame. As Jim tries to attack SAM's core, the core suddenly explodes with a strange substance that infests the entire station. SAM is able to lock Jim in a depressurized section of the station, killing him as ordered by the hexagonal entity. SAM then goes to let in Emma through the airlock. Emma knows now that they need to get to the storm on Saturn, and has SAM adjust their orbit and jettison the rest of the station. They fall into the storm and black out. When Emma wakes, they find themselves on some rocky landscape, with debris and bodies from multiple copies of ''Observation'' around them. They approach a giant version of the hexagonal entity again, and make contact. Emma tells a confused SAM that there must have been multiple realities all converging on this point, and they were the first version of Emma and SAM to make it through the ordeal. They disappear briefly into the hexagonal entity. When they wake up, Emma and SAM find their consciousness has merged, and they are back on Earth by some means. They feel odd but alive, and by touching the ground, they are able to infect it the same way the entity did to ''Observation''. The same noises from the entity tell the combined Emma/SAM persona to \"bring them\".\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n''Observation'' was developed by No Code, a Scottish game studio who had previously released ''[[Stories Untold (video game)|Stories Untold]]'' in 2017. Game director and No Code co-founder Jon McKellan had previously worked at [[Creative Assembly]], where he was the lead [[User interface design|user interface designer]] on ''[[Alien: Isolation]]''.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-26-observation-is-like-an-arthouse-accompaniment-to-alien-isolation|title=Observation is like an arthouse accompaniment to Alien: Isolation|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=2018-11-26|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/359431/Road_to_the_IGF_No_Codes_Observation.php|title=Road to the IGF: No Code's Observation|last=Couture|first=Joel|date=2020-03-19|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> McKellan was partially inspired by an article published shortly after ''Alien: Isolation''<nowiki/>'s release. The article talked about how watching the 1979 ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' film from the perspective of the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] made the creature more sympathetic to viewers, as the Alien was merely trying to survive being hunted by people.<ref name=\":4\" /> This got McKellan thinking about the idea of [[Deconstruction|deconstructing]] horror film tropes by imagining them from a different point of view.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://gamingbolt.com/observation-interview-a-unique-sci-fi-thriller-that-flips-the-switch|title=Observation Interview \u2013 A Unique Sci-Fi Thriller that \u201cFlips the Switch\u201d|last=Parijat|first=Shubhankar|date=2018-11-19|website=GamingBolt|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Separately, he also wanted to write a story where the player's actions could impact the story's events.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nMcKellan ultimately founded No Code in 2015 with the intention of developing and releasing ''Observation''.<ref name=\":4\" /> No Code initially began work on a demo version of ''Observation'' in early 2016, showing it to game publishers in hopes of getting a contract with them.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamereactor.eu/flipping-the-script-the-making-of-observation/|title=Flipping the Script: The Making of Observation|last=Bishop|first=Sam|date=2019-06-02|website=Gamereactor UK|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> While the team was successful in attracting a publisher, the process of creating and signing the publishing contracts took a long time.

According to McKellan, ''Stories Untold'' served as a \"road test\" for ''Observation'', as the development team got the chance to develop mechanics and learn from mistakes heading into the development of ''Observation.''<ref name=\":6\" /> \n\n=== Production ===\nAfter spending years on [[pre-production]] and prototype creation, No Code took roughly 25 months to develop the game,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/observations-devs-tell-us-what-its-like-to-release-a-game-into-the-wild/|title=Observation's devs tell us what it's like to release a game into the wild|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=2019-11-07|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] game engine along with other tools like [[Autodesk 3ds Max]] and Substance.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many people who worked on ''Observation'' had previously worked on ''Alien: Isolation'' \u2014 in addition to McKellan, character artists Jack Perry and Ranulf Busby, concept artist Stefano Tsai, and voice actors [[Kezia Burrows]] and [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] had worked on the latter game.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-ai-thriller-observation-is-the-spiritual-successor-to-alien-isolation/|title=How AI thriller Observation is the spiritual successor to Alien: Isolation|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=2019-02-05|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> While the team members had experience in [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA development]], No Code had a limited budget, which forced the team to come up with unique solutions to save money without compromising quality. To simulate the lack of gravity in space during [[motion-capture acting]] sessions, the team pushed an animator around on a [[bar stool]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://egmnow.com/as-game-budgets-balloon-indie-devs-learn-to-work-smarter/|title=As Game Budgets Balloon, Indie Devs Learn to Work Smarter|last=Horti|first=Samuel|date=2019-08-23|website=EGM|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> No Code's philosophy was to save on development costs by only paying special attention to things the player would notice. For things like dialogue between characters in [[Cutscene|cutscenes]], the development team opted to do things like move them behind closed doors out of sight from the player, so that the conversations did not have to be animated.<ref name=\":7\" /> It was this philosophy that caused No Code to invest a lot of time in pre-production, creating a lot of modular environments that could be repurposed throughout the game.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOne of the fundamental topics that No Code wanted to explore in ''Observation'' was how a machine that had become [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] might feel, and how humans might react to it.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/343101/Making_the_player_the_AI_in_outer_space_thriller_Observation.php|title=Making the player the AI in outer space thriller Observation|last=Arguello|first=Diego|date=2019-05-22|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> By putting the player in SAM's shoes, McKellan realized that SAM's feelings would mirror the player's, as both would be experiencing things in a different way.<ref name=\":4\" /> To give the player a sense of \"[feeling] like an alien entity of some sort\",<ref name=\":4\" /> No Code iterated on developing interactions that relied on a machine's understanding of how to perform a task. For example, instead of pressing a physical button on their controller to open a door in-game, players \u2014 as SAM \u2014 had to establish a connection with another system first.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAccording to McKellan, ''Observation'' was initially split into separate sections, but merged into a full-length game when the story's size made it difficult for it to be split into distinct episodes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA few months before the game released, the developers engaged in focus tests to determine problem areas where the testers felt frustrated or lost.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''Observation'' was announced on October 8, 2018, with a release time frame of spring 2019 for PC and PlayStation 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/08/stories-untold-developer-and-devolver-reveal-new-game-observation|title=Stories Untold Developer Reveals New Game: Observation|last=Skrebels|first=Joe|date=2018-10-08|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Hoggins|first=Tom|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/exciting-sci-fi-thriller-observation-revealed-stories-untold/|title=Exciting sci-fi thriller Observation revealed by Stories Untold developer|date=2018-10-09|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-05-23|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> No Code and Devolver Digital had a previous working relationship from the release of ''Stories Untold''.<ref name=\":1\" /> In March 2019, it was announced that the game would be released on May 21, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2019/03/observation-launches-may-21|title=Observation launches May 21|last=Romano|first=Sal|date=2019-03-25|website=Gematsu|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-09}}</ref> Devolver Digital later stated on March 25, 2019 that ''Observation'' would be sold on PC exclusively on the [[Epic Games Store]] for one year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/339439/Observation_will_be_an_Epic_Games_Store_exclusive_Steam_page_pulled.php|title=Observation will be an Epic Games Store exclusive, Steam page pulled|last=Kidwell|first=Emma|date=2019-03-26|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-09}}</ref>\n\n<!--\n== Symbols ==\nWhile symbols throughout this game may seem alienated and random, but each one of them has some meaning to it, as all symbols do.\nThe most notable symbols that appeared constantly is a 6 squared primaried with a filled square and circle in the bottom right.

In a list of symbols, it appeared first then the selected individual and, in the end, another symbol showed the merging of these two symbols, and after seeing the end scenes Fisher merged with S.A.M., supported the meaning of the last symbol means merge of these two and S.A.M. symbol at start. reinterpreting the meaning of these three symbols in order meant the black hexagon is telling S.A.M. and Fisher to become one.\n\nAnother similar symbol can also be found during the S.A.M.s mainframe scene when the player encountered the black hexagon. The new Symbols have similarity but different in the filled square are located on top. the imminent scene is displayed with English text tells the player to \"KILL HIM\" which if you recall the list of symbols the new primaried symbols are at the end and S.A.M. symbol at start followed with a crossed square, so the similar symbol could mean other individuals that aren't chosen like the circled one, or since it's at the top it could mean the captain. And the crossed square symbol mean death or in this case, kill. reinterpreting the meaning of these three symbols in order meant the black hexagon is telling S.A.M. to kill the other crew member aren't chosen or kill the captain, put it simply, \"KILL HIM\".\n-->\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PC: 79/100<ref name=\"mcpc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/observation |title=Observation for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><br />PS4: 75/100<ref name=\"mcps4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/observation |title=Observation for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n| GI = 9/10<ref name=\"gi review\"/>\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>\n}}\n\n''Observation'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"mcpc\" /><ref name=\"mcps4\" /> ''[[Destructoid]]'' called the game \"expertly paced\" but also complained of occasional hiccups when some of the puzzles became \"a point-and-click-adventure-style wild goose chase.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-observation-553518.phtml|title=Review: Observation|last=Devore|first=Jordan|date=2019-05-21|website=Destructoid|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> ''[[GameSpot]]'' praised the games visuals, saying \"''Observation'' absolutely nails its distinct lo-fi, sci-fi aesthetic,\" and concluding that it \"is a wonderful example of how to do focused, self-contained science-fiction storytelling in a game.\"<ref name=\"gamespot review\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/observation-review-space-madness/1900-6417146/|title=Observation Review - Space Madness|last=O'Connor|first=James|date=2019-05-23|website=GameSpot|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>  Several outlets praised the game's storytelling and plot, which was described as \"gripping\" by ''[[Game Informer]]''.<ref name=\"gi review\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/review/observation/the-thrill-of-taking-back-control|title=Observation Review - The Thrill Of Taking Back Control|last=Gwaltney|first=Javy|date=2019-05-21|website=Game Informer|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> It made the Top 20 games of 2019 list for ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/dec/17/top-20-games-of-2019|title=Top 20 games of 2019|last1=MacDonald|first1=Keza|last2=Stuart|first2=Keith|date=2019-12-17|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> [[Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw]] of ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' ranked it as the Third Best Game of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2019-best-worst-and-blandest-zero-punctuation/|title=2019 Best, Worst, and Blandest \u2013 Zero Punctuation|last=Croshaw|first=Ben \"Yahtzee\"|authorlink=Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw|date=2020-01-01|website=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|accessdate=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The player takes the role of Sam, short for the System Administration Maintenance (SAM) [[artificial intelligence]] software aboard a multi-national space station that serves to monitor the entire station. Initially, the player's view is limited to where the crew have relocated Sam, but as the game progresses, Sam can move its core presence between several of the modules on the station and manipulate cameras and other electronically-controlled equipment in that module. Further on, Sam is provided one of several small spherical probes that allows Sam to move more freely through the station and into hostile environments harmful to the humans aboard, including outside of the station.\n\nThe player, by manipulating Sam, can control various elements of the station, such as opening or closing hatches, activating safety systems and the like. Sam may be instructed by the crew to perform specific tasks, and Sam can reply by finding the task element of interest (such as the status of a station module) and report back to the crew.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:PIA18274-Saturn-NorthPolarHexagon-Cassini-20140402.jpg|thumb|right|Much of the game centers around the [[Saturn's hexagon|hexagonal cloud pattern]] that has been observed on Saturn.]]\nThe story opens aboard the multi-national space station ''Observation'' in orbit above Earth in the year 2026. An unknown event has crippled 'Observation', leaving it without power and spinning. Dr. Emma Fisher, the stations medical officer, tries to restore contact with Houston as well as other five members of the crew to ascertain what has happened, without success.\n\nShe manages to reboot the stations integrated AI, SAM (Systems Administration and Maintenance) which controls the station's systems and functions, and is the role the player assumes.\n\nAfter performing basic diagnostics to find out what happened, SAM receives a transmission of unknown origin, containing co-ordinates to an unknown location. The station then begins to tremor violently with a deafening sound. SAM becomes unresponsive to Emma while being influenced by the signal, causing strange glyphs to flicker on his interface, and with instructions to 'BRING HER' appearing.\n\nSAM recovers after an unspecified period of time has passed, to the sight of Emma having been rendered unconscious following the second event. She eventually comes to, and immediately instructs SAM to run a self-diagnostic. SAM tells Emma the event has caused him to lose most of his core data, and to be disconnected from most of the stations subsystems. He is also unable to locate the other crew members, who are missing and cannot be contacted.\n\nAs Emma restores limited functionality back to SAM, he attempts to re-interface with the rest of the space station and reconnect to his own components. Shortly after recovering some mobility, a station alarm goes off which Fisher instructs SAM to investigate. SAM discovers a fire in one of the modules.\n\nAfter extinguishing the fire, they discover an unidentified substance on a blank plate that is like a dark red oil. Before she can speculate what it is, another alarm goes off. SAM informs her that module 12 has become dislodged, and severe stress is being applied to the station, prompting recommendation for her to eject it.\n\nThey eject the loose module, and the station stabilizes. Concerned there might be extended damage, Emma instructs SAM to check external cameras for other potential risks, and learns that ''Observation'', through unknown means, is now in orbit over Saturn. Asking how they got there, SAM checks the station Black Box, which reveals he was the cause but doesn't know how.\n\nOnce more, SAM receives interference from an unknown entity and blacks out.\n\nEmma reboots SAM again to effect repairs, saying \"You weren't making any sense\". She sets about working with SAM to access the other parts of the station.   They find the bodies of the crew, including Jim, the mission commander. Discovering another crew member, Mae, to be alive in one of the sealed modules, Emma has SAM help with a space walk to get her to safety, but the station suddenly moves closer to Saturn and Mae is lost. A strange hexagonal object appears to both Sam and Emma and tries to communicate to them in a geographic glyph language before disappearing. Continuing repairs, they see a man-made object near Saturn's orbit. Initially thinking that Earth may have sent a rescue mission to them, they soon find it is an exact duplicate of ''Observation''.\n\nEmma uses SAM to jump to the other station, which has lost nearly all power. They find Jim is still alive, and learn this station also had the same weird events that brought them to Saturn. As SAM goes to try to restore basic life support, he interacts with this station's SAM, learning that there was a secret mission that Jim was to follow, based on the discovery that embedded in various star patterns was a specific DNA code and a point in space to be at. Jim had been directed by Earth to make sure ''Observation'' was at that point with Emma aboard at a specific time. Continuing on, Sam encounters another crew member, Josh, who has been hiding from Jim, as Jim has also killed his [[doppelg\u00e4nger]]. Before Josh can reveal more, Jim grabs SAM and Emma, and makes them jump back to Emma's ''Observation''. Jim locks Emma out of the station, leaving her on little life support. As she clings to life, several other identical ''Observation'' stations appear to start gathering around the storm.\n\nJim proceeds to lock SAM out of the controls while he sends a desperate message for help to Earth. SAM manages to find several back doors into the station's systems, interacts with the signal to Earth and warns them about the situation. Earth cuts off Jim, who now knows SAM is to blame. As Jim tries to attack SAM's core, the core suddenly explodes with a strange substance that infests the entire station. SAM is able to lock Jim in a depressurized section of the station, killing him as ordered by the hexagonal entity. SAM then goes to let in Emma through the airlock. Emma knows now that they need to get to the storm on Saturn, and has SAM adjust their orbit and jettison the rest of the station. They fall into the storm and black out. When Emma wakes, they find themselves on some rocky landscape, with debris and bodies from multiple copies of ''Observation'' around them. They approach a giant version of the hexagonal entity again, and make contact. Emma tells a confused SAM that there must have been multiple realities all converging on this point, and they were the first version of Emma and SAM to make it through the ordeal. They disappear briefly into the hexagonal entity. When they wake up, Emma and SAM find their consciousness has merged, and they are back on Earth by some means. They feel odd but alive, and by touching the ground, they are able to infect it the same way the entity did to ''Observation''. The same noises from the entity tell the combined Emma/SAM persona to \"bring them\".\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n''Observation'' was developed by No Code, a Scottish game studio who had previously released ''[[Stories Untold (video game)|Stories Untold]]'' in 2017. Game director and No Code co-founder Jon McKellan had previously worked at [[Creative Assembly]], where he was the lead [[User interface design|user interface designer]] on ''[[Alien: Isolation]]''.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-26-observation-is-like-an-arthouse-accompaniment-to-alien-isolation|title=Observation is like an arthouse accompaniment to Alien: Isolation|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=2018-11-26|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/359431/Road_to_the_IGF_No_Codes_Observation.php|title=Road to the IGF: No Code's Observation|last=Couture|first=Joel|date=2020-03-19|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> McKellan was partially inspired by an article published shortly after ''Alien: Isolation''<nowiki/>'s release. The article talked about how watching the 1979 ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' film from the perspective of the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] made the creature more sympathetic to viewers, as the Alien was merely trying to survive being hunted by people.<ref name=\":4\" /> This got McKellan thinking about the idea of [[Deconstruction|deconstructing]] horror film tropes by imagining them from a different point of view.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://gamingbolt.com/observation-interview-a-unique-sci-fi-thriller-that-flips-the-switch|title=Observation Interview \u2013 A Unique Sci-Fi Thriller that \u201cFlips the Switch\u201d|last=Parijat|first=Shubhankar|date=2018-11-19|website=GamingBolt|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Separately, he also wanted to write a story where the player's actions could impact the story's events.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nMcKellan ultimately founded No Code in 2015 with the intention of developing and releasing ''Observation''.<ref name=\":4\" /> No Code initially began work on a demo version of ''Observation'' in early 2016, showing it to game publishers in hopes of getting a contract with them.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamereactor.eu/flipping-the-script-the-making-of-observation/|title=Flipping the Script: The Making of Observation|last=Bishop|first=Sam|date=2019-06-02|website=Gamereactor UK|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> While the team was successful in attracting a publisher, the process of creating and signing the publishing contracts took a long time.

According to McKellan, ''Stories Untold'' served as a \"road test\" for ''Observation'', as the development team got the chance to develop mechanics and learn from mistakes heading into the development of ''Observation.''<ref name=\":6\" /> \n\n=== Production ===\nAfter spending years on [[pre-production]] and prototype creation, No Code took roughly 25 months to develop the game,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/observations-devs-tell-us-what-its-like-to-release-a-game-into-the-wild/|title=Observation's devs tell us what it's like to release a game into the wild|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=2019-11-07|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] game engine along with other tools like [[Autodesk 3ds Max]] and Substance.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many people who worked on ''Observation'' had previously worked on ''Alien: Isolation'' \u2014 in addition to McKellan, character artists Jack Perry and Ranulf Busby, concept artist Stefano Tsai, and voice actors [[Kezia Burrows]] and [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] had worked on the latter game.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-ai-thriller-observation-is-the-spiritual-successor-to-alien-isolation/|title=How AI thriller Observation is the spiritual successor to Alien: Isolation|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=2019-02-05|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> While the team members had experience in [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA development]], No Code had a limited budget, which forced the team to come up with unique solutions to save money without compromising quality. To simulate the lack of gravity in space during [[motion-capture acting]] sessions, the team pushed an animator around on a [[bar stool]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://egmnow.com/as-game-budgets-balloon-indie-devs-learn-to-work-smarter/|title=As Game Budgets Balloon, Indie Devs Learn to Work Smarter|last=Horti|first=Samuel|date=2019-08-23|website=EGM|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> No Code's philosophy was to save on development costs by only paying special attention to things the player would notice. For things like dialogue between characters in [[Cutscene|cutscenes]], the development team opted to do things like move them behind closed doors out of sight from the player, so that the conversations did not have to be animated.<ref name=\":7\" /> It was this philosophy that caused No Code to invest a lot of time in pre-production, creating a lot of modular environments that could be repurposed throughout the game.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOne of the fundamental topics that No Code wanted to explore in ''Observation'' was how a machine that had become [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] might feel, and how humans might react to it.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/343101/Making_the_player_the_AI_in_outer_space_thriller_Observation.php|title=Making the player the AI in outer space thriller Observation|last=Arguello|first=Diego|date=2019-05-22|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> By putting the player in SAM's shoes, McKellan realized that SAM's feelings would mirror the player's, as both would be experiencing things in a different way.<ref name=\":4\" /> To give the player a sense of \"[feeling] like an alien entity of some sort\",<ref name=\":4\" /> No Code iterated on developing interactions that relied on a machine's understanding of how to perform a task. For example, instead of pressing a physical button on their controller to open a door in-game, players \u2014 as SAM \u2014 had to establish a connection with another system first.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAccording to McKellan, ''Observation'' was initially split into separate sections, but merged into a full-length game when the story's size made it difficult for it to be split into distinct episodes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA few months before the game released, the developers engaged in focus tests to determine problem areas where the testers felt frustrated or lost.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''Observation'' was announced on October 8, 2018, with a release time frame of spring 2019 for PC and PlayStation 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/08/stories-untold-developer-and-devolver-reveal-new-game-observation|title=Stories Untold Developer Reveals New Game: Observation|last=Skrebels|first=Joe|date=2018-10-08|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Hoggins|first=Tom|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/exciting-sci-fi-thriller-observation-revealed-stories-untold/|title=Exciting sci-fi thriller Observation revealed by Stories Untold developer|date=2018-10-09|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-05-23|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> No Code and Devolver Digital had a previous working relationship from the release of ''Stories Untold''.<ref name=\":1\" /> In March 2019, it was announced that the game would be released on May 21, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2019/03/observation-launches-may-21|title=Observation launches May 21|last=Romano|first=Sal|date=2019-03-25|website=Gematsu|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-09}}</ref> Devolver Digital later stated on March 25, 2019 that ''Observation'' would be sold on PC exclusively on the [[Epic Games Store]] for one year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/339439/Observation_will_be_an_Epic_Games_Store_exclusive_Steam_page_pulled.php|title=Observation will be an Epic Games Store exclusive, Steam page pulled|last=Kidwell|first=Emma|date=2019-03-26|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-09}}</ref>\n\n<!--\n== Symbols ==\nWhile symbols throughout this game may seem alienated and random, but each one of them has some meaning to it, as all symbols do.\nThe most notable symbols that appeared constantly is a 6 squared primaried with a filled square and circle in the bottom right. The symbols can also be observed in the crew tracker of a selected individual info panel on the top right corner. Because it displays only on selected individuals info panel, suggest the symbols meant for a selected individual.\n\nThe other constant symbols are the circles centering a dot with a horizontal line, it appeared many times before but it makes more sense after the interpretation of the selected individual symbol and the ending scenes that the player encounters the large black hexagon. In a list of symbols, it appeared first then the selected individual and, in the end, another symbol showed the merging of these two symbols, and after seeing the end scenes Fisher merged with S.A.M., supported the meaning of the last symbol means merge of these two and S.A.M. symbol at start. reinterpreting the meaning of these three symbols in order meant the black hexagon is telling S.A.M. and Fisher to become one.\n\nAnother similar symbol can also be found during the S.A.M.s mainframe scene when the player encountered the black hexagon. The new Symbols have similarity but different in the filled square are located on top. the imminent scene is displayed with English text tells the player to \"KILL HIM\" which if you recall the list of symbols the new primaried symbols are at the end and S.A.M. symbol at start followed with a crossed square, so the similar symbol could mean other individuals that aren't chosen like the circled one, or since it's at the top it could mean the captain. And the crossed square symbol mean death or in this case, kill. reinterpreting the meaning of these three symbols in order meant the black hexagon is telling S.A.M. to kill the other crew member aren't chosen or kill the captain, put it simply, \"KILL HIM\".\n-->\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PC: 79/100<ref name=\"mcpc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/observation |title=Observation for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><br />PS4: 75/100<ref name=\"mcps4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/observation |title=Observation for Playstation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n| GI = 9/10<ref name=\"gi review\"/>\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>\n}}\n\n''Observation'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"mcpc\" /><ref name=\"mcps4\" /> ''[[Destructoid]]'' called the game \"expertly paced\" but also complained of occasional hiccups when some of the puzzles became \"a point-and-click-adventure-style wild goose chase.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-observation-553518.phtml|title=Review: Observation|last=Devore|first=Jordan|date=2019-05-21|website=Destructoid|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> ''[[GameSpot]]'' praised the games visuals, saying \"''Observation'' absolutely nails its distinct lo-fi, sci-fi aesthetic,\" and concluding that it \"is a wonderful example of how to do focused, self-contained science-fiction storytelling in a game.\"<ref name=\"gamespot review\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/observation-review-space-madness/1900-6417146/|title=Observation Review - Space Madness|last=O'Connor|first=James|date=2019-05-23|website=GameSpot|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>  Several outlets praised the game's storytelling and plot, which was described as \"gripping\" by ''[[Game Informer]]''.<ref name=\"gi review\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/review/observation/the-thrill-of-taking-back-control|title=Observation Review - The Thrill Of Taking Back Control|last=Gwaltney|first=Javy|date=2019-05-21|website=Game Informer|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> It made the Top 20 games of 2019 list for ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/dec/17/top-20-games-of-2019|title=Top 20 games of 2019|last1=MacDonald|first1=Keza|last2=Stuart|first2=Keith|date=2019-12-17|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> [[Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw]] of ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' ranked it as the Third Best Game of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2019-best-worst-and-blandest-zero-punctuation/|title=2019 Best, Worst, and Blandest \u2013 Zero Punctuation|last=Croshaw|first=Ben \"Yahtzee\"|authorlink=Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw|date=2020-01-01|website=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|accessdate=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
