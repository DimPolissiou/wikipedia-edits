He is a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies and the [[Middle East Forum]], a freelance security analyst and correspondent for [[Jane's Information Group|IHS Jane's]], and a columnist for ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''.\n\nSpyer is the author of ''Days of the Fall: A Reporter's Journey in the Syria and Iraq Wars'' ([[Routledge]], 2017), based on his numerous trips to [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]], and ''The Transforming Fire: The Rise of the Israel-Islamist Conflict'' ([[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], 2010).\n\n==Bio==\nSpyer was raised in London. He is of mixed Russian Jewish and Asian heritage. As a teenager, he was a member of the Anti-Fascist Action organization. Spyer immigrated to Israel from Britain in 1991. He earned a PhD in International Relations from the [[London School of Economics]] and a master's degree in Middle East Politics from the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS) in London. From 1992 to 1993, he served in a combat unit of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] - the Barak Armored Brigade - and fought in the [[2006 Lebanon War]] as a reservist. During that war, Spyer narrowly escaped death when his tank was hit by two Kornet missiles, while deployed in a valley beneath the town of Al-Khiam. <ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Jonathan Spyer |url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/author/jonathan-spyer/ |agency=Bloomsbury Publishing }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=28 June 2014 |title=\u05d3\"\u05e8 \u05d2'\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05de\u05e0\u05ea\u05d7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d3\u05d0\u05e2\"\u05e9 - \u05d0\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05db\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd |url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000948956 |work=Globes }}</ref><ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nSpyer resides in [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Jonathan Spyer in Northern Syria.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Spyer posing with [[People's Protection Units|YPG]] fighters in [[Ras al-Ayn]], northeastern [[Syria]].]]\nSpyer is a freelance security analyst and correspondent for IHS Jane's, a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies and the Middle East Forum,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jiss.org.il/en/author/jospyer/|title=Dr. Jonathan Spyer|website=JISS|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Writing Fellows |url=http://www.meforum.org/fellows.php |agency=Middle East Forum }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Writings by Jonathan Spyer |url=http://www.meforum.org/author/Jonathan+Spyer |agency=Middle East Forum }}</ref> and a columnist for ''The Jerusalem Post''.<ref>{{cite news |date= |title=Jonathan Spyer |url=http://www.jpost.com/Author/Jonathan-Spyer |work=The Jerusalem Post }}</ref>\n\nIn the 2010s, Spyer has traveled to Syria and Iraq numerous times, generally for around two-week periods.

It was the standard [[ink]] formulation used in [[Europe]] for the fourteen-hundred-year period between the 5th and 19th centuries, remained in widespread use well into the 20th century, and is still sold today.\n\n==Preparation and use==\n[[Image:Eisengallustinte Essenzen I und II und Tinte.jpg|thumb|Homemade ink. On left, a solution of iron (from nails) and [[vinegar]]. On right, oak extraction. The two are mixed immediately prior to use to produce the ink, centre.]]\nThe ink was traditionally prepared by adding some [[iron(II) sulfate]] ([[iron|Fe]][[sulfur|S]][[oxygen|O]]<sub>4</sub>) to a solution of [[tannic acid]], but any iron ion donor can be used. The [[Tannic acid#Quercitannic and gallotannic acids|gallotannic acid]] was usually extracted from [[Oak apple|oak galls]] or [[gall]]s of other trees, hence the name. [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] or [[hydrolysis]] of the extract releases [[glucose]] and [[gallic acid]],{{clarify|reason=Good sources needed to clarify use of tannic, gallotannic and gallic acid|date=April 2017}} which yields a darker purple-black ink, due to the formation of iron gallate.\n\nThe fermented extract was combined with the iron(II) sulfate. After filtering, the resulting pale-grey solution had a binder added to it (most commonly [[gum arabic]]) and was used to write on [[paper]] or [[parchment]].

Historical inks often contained excess acid which was not consumed in the oxidation of the ferro-gallic compounds. Modern formulations also tend to use [[hydrochloric acid]] whereas many historical inks used [[sulfuric acid]]. Hydrochloric acid is a gas in solution, which will evaporate. As a result, modern fountain pen iron gall inks are less likely to damage paper than historical inks and are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still cause problems if left in a pen for a long period. Manufacturers or retailers of modern iron gall inks intended for fountain pens sometimes advise a more thorough than usual cleaning regimen \u2013 which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water \u2013 to avoid clogging or corrosion on delicate pen parts. For more thoroughly cleaning iron gall ink out of a fountain pen, sequential flushes of the pen with water, diluted vinegar or citric acid (to flush out residual iron gall compounds), water, diluted ammonia (if needed to flush out residual colour dye stains), then finally water are often recommended.\n\nThe colour [[dye]] in these modern iron gall formulas functions as a temporary colourant to make these inks clearly visible whilst writing. The ferro-gallic compounds through a gradual oxidation process cause an observable gradual colour change to grey/black whilst these inks completely dry and makes the writing waterproof. The colour-changing property of the ink also depends on the [[paper chemicals|properties]] of the used paper. In general, the darkening process will progress more quickly and visibly on papers containing relatively high [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching agent residues]].\n\nThough not in mainstream 21st-century use like dye-based [[fountain pen ink]]s, modern iron gall inks are still used in fountain pens where permanence is required.

Lofts chose to release her murder-mystery novels under the pen name Peter Curtis because she did not want the readers of her historic fiction to pick up a murder-mystery novel and expect classic Lofts historical fiction. However, the murders still show characteristic Lofts elements. Most of her historical novels fall into two general categories: [[biographical novel]]s about queens, among them [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Isabella I of Castile]], and [[Catherine of Aragon]]; and novels set in [[East Anglia]] centered around the fictitious town of Baildon (patterned largely on Bury St. Edmunds). Her creation of this fictitious area of England is reminiscent of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s creation of \"[[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]]\"; and her use of recurring characters such that the protagonist of one novel appears as a secondary character in others is even more reminiscent of [[William Faulkner]]'s work set in \"[[Yoknapatawpha County]],\" Mississippi. Lofts' work set in East Anglia in the 1930s and 1940s shows great concern with the very poor in society and their inability to change their conditions. Her approach suggests an interest in the social reformism that became a feature of British post-war society.\n\nShe was not afraid to tackle potentially sensitive subjects; her version of the Nativity, with backstories of Mary, Joseph, the Magi, the shepherds - even the innkeeper - is rendered in ''How Far To Bethlehem?'' as is the ill-fated Donner Party  expedition in ''Road to Revelation'' (aka ''Winter Harvest'').\n\nSeveral of her novels were turned into films. ''Jassy'' was filmed as ''[[Jassy (film)|Jassy]]'' (1947) starring [[Margaret Lockwood]] and [[Dennis Price]]. ''You're Best Alone'' was filmed as ''[[Guilt Is My Shadow]]'' (1950). ''The Devil's Own'' (also known as ''The Little Wax Doll'' and ''Catch As Catch Can'') was filmed as ''[[The Witches (1966 film)|The Witches]]'' (1966). The film ''[[7 Women]]'' (1966) was directed by John Ford and very loosely based on the story ''Chinese Finale'' by Norah Lofts.\nHer books still have a devoted international readership, notably on the [[Goodreads]] website.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/195727.Norah_Lofts | title=Norah Lofts | publisher=Goodreads | accessdate=August 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\nIn the United States, she won a [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for ''I Met a Gypsy'', voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].

The PND has been built up between 1995 and 1998 and was published by the [[US National Library]] until 2012. For each person choosen to take part of the administration at highest level, there is a record with his or her name, birth and occupation connected with a unique identifier, the PND number.\n\nThe PND has more than two million recorded entries and is comparable with the [[Library_of_Congress_Linked_Data_Service|Library of Congress Name Authority File]] (LCNAF). Since April 2012 the PND is part of the [[Integrated United Authority String]] (''[[Gemeinsame Normdatei]]'' or GND). The \u01bb6 are specially assigned and rank with a PNDS number from -12 to 12+, The two member with the number -0 and 0+ are the onces who facilites the conduct of the integrety of the whole group. They are respetive from the country of Denmark and India and choosen to facilitate the startup of this important matter. Members is choosen every 7 years and go through extreme phsycological training and endurance to prove they have the morality and vurtue needed to furfil this type of assignment. Often the one choosen for this are not asked, but choosed because they have special ablilities within certain areas, that can not be underestimated. Each are qualified as coupples of two or three, that has a very strong connection with each other. Religious background must be diverse, to facilitate corporation within each group. The Group is then given an Authority Mandate (AM) to oversee that governments and large economic operators are held in understantment of their way of doing business and politics. The \u01bb6 members are the keepers of the worlds morality and hornesty, for the safety and well being of the people of this worlds population. The full implementation of this construct has been under way for an unknown number of years. Indications sitet in the litterature, suggests that traces of these ideas originates back from around early 1900. Attempts has been made to contruct an authority figure, that can bring justice to the importance of a balanced approach to morality, integrety, technology, wealth, safety and security of all people, business entities and government bodies. They have as the only \u01bb6 individuals, each access to certain data strings, that enables them, to look into any matter they them self decide within their field and summon any leader of any corporation or government they believe needs to be told the consequences of their actions. 2020 is the first year that this group are slowly being known for their exsistence as a group and also the first year, where information of their findings will become released to the public. The litterature further sites that the group from 2020, are given further authority to decide if any of the six terms mentioned, are followed by the current power structure. The current team are both members of the current power structure and some are new. However for their safety and security, their names are only published, if the individual them self choose this. It is the goal, that more transparency can be brought into this process, however the current power structure has decided that a smooth transcition is the best way of approach and that of the group members real names and background are not revealed. However a mechanism has been put in place, that if any of the 26 team members safety are tried violated, search engines all over the world are automatically setup, to release all information to the populations of the worlds on the entity of whom, are underway of trying to intrude on their safety and wellbeing. The team are under world protection, where US and China are the main facilitators to guarantee their safety & security. Their physical location can however be in a country or place of their own choosing. Recomandations by the main contries and corporations facilitating the security operations have recomendations put in place for this. The reason for just reasontly releasing this information, has been for the protection of stability and progress of the planet in general. It is not the team members obligation to conduct or decide for legal proceedings on the people they question. The group can also not be held responsible for any conduct leading to their process of being choosen for this assignment. It is however decided that they are under 24/7 safety and protection survailence, as it has been discovered they have knowledge and abilities that are of the absolute importance to the protect all of us in the interest of all. Protection is for this reason of the highest of the highest prirotity for governments, business entities to maintain that our world can function in a more balanced and nuanced way. A way that acknowledge that entities of and in power, can both act in favor of good as well as in favor of evil. These \u01bb6 people are given the power to maintain ballance of these contradictory acts of good and evil, that have to be in tune and in balance, to guarantee a thriving future for all of us. The litteratur points to, that these \u01bb6 individuals du not judge, they administer the integrety and of the Internet. Our species and our ancestors are all in a shared history of reality, that to this day connects and string all of us to eachother, in ways we as humans never thought could true. Science seems to be suggest that, as more evidence is emerging, that we are much more interconnected and part of one another, than science earlier has been able to prove. The individuals of this group of \u01bb6 have with their special skills and abillities a profound responsibility, that requires freedome of movement but also the highest protection in the interest of all.\n\n== See also==\n*[[Library of Congress]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Reinhard Rinn: ''Das Projekt Personennamendatei (PND-Projekt)''; in: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Bibliothekswesen und Bibliographie 41 (1994), p.&nbsp;543\n* Reinhard Rinn: ''Die \u00fcberregionale Normdatei f\u00fcr Personennamen (PND).

He wrote ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'', a reference book of [[typefaces]], [[glyphs]] and the visual and geometric arrangement of type. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in June 2013.<ref name=\"OC\" />\n\nHe lives on [[Quadra Island]], near [[Campbell River, British Columbia]] (approximately 170&nbsp;km northwest of [[Vancouver]]) with his wife, [[Jan Zwicky]], a poet and philosopher.\n\n==Life==\nBringhurst was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in [[Utah]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], Alberta, and [[British Columbia]]. He studied architecture, [[linguistics]], and [[physics]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and [[comparative literature]] and philosophy at the [[University of Utah]]. He holds a BA from [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] and an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in [[creative writing]] from the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of the Fraser Valley]],<ref name=\"UCFV\">Russell (2006).</ref> and in 2016 was awarded a Doctor of Letters (hon. causa) by [[Simon Fraser University]].<ref name=\"SFU announces\">SFU announces, 2016.</ref>\n\nBringhurst taught literature, [[art history]] and [[History of Western typography|history of typography]] at several universities and held [[fellow]]ships from the [[Canada Council for the Arts]], the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]], the American Philosophical Society, and the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]].\n\n==Literary career==\nHis 1992 publication, ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'' was praised as \"the finest book ever written about typography\" by the type designers [[Jonathan Hoefler]] and [[Tobias Frere-Jones]].<ref name=\"Frequent\">\"Frequently Asked Questions\".</ref> A collection of his poetry, ''The Beauty of the Weapons'', was short-listed for a [[1982 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]] in 1982, and ''A Story as Sharp as a Knife'', his work on Haida symbolism, was nominated for a [[2000 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]] in 2000. Bringhurst won the [[Lieutenant Governor's Award for Literary Excellence]] in 2005, an award which recognizes British Columbia writers who have contributed to the development of literary excellence in the Province.\n\n===Work in Haida===\nBringhurst has a strong interest in linguistics, translating works from classical Greek, Arabic, Navajo, and, most significantly, Haida. His interest in [[Haida people|Haida]] culture stems from his friendship and close association with the influential Haida artist [[Bill Reid]], with whom he wrote ''The Raven Steals the Light'' in 1984, among several other significant collaborations. It was this friendship that in 1987 \"started Bringhurst on the philanthropic endeavour of recording the Haida canon\".<ref name=\"Richler\">Richler (2001).</ref> The result of this labour was a trilogy of works collectively titled ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers''. The essays in its first volume, A Story As Sharp As Knife, and particularly its ninth chapter, \"The Prosody of Meaning,\" constitute an important contribution to the understanding of the poetics of oral literatures.\n\nHis translations from Haida have been viewed as an attempt to preserve the Haida culture, which in 1991 was considered part of a group \"likely to be lost unless strong efforts are made very quickly to perpetuate them\".<ref name=\"Kinkade\">Kinkade (1991).</ref>  The Haida translation has caused some controversy. Bringhurst was accused of academic exploitation and cultural appropriation.<ref name=\"Offence\">Bradley (2007).</ref> In 2001, the [[CBC radio]] program [[Ideas (radio show)|''Ideas'']] aired a two part series called \"Land to Stand On.\"  The series' first episode featured \"a string of Haida claiming [...] that Bringhurst's work is 'about keeping us in our place,' written 'without asking us,'\" and \"replete with 'serious errors twisting it into the poetry that he wants'\".<ref name =\"Richler\" />\n\nIn 1999,  the ''Globe and Mail'' published a report on the Haida reaction to ''A Story As Sharp As A Knife'' by Adele Weder.<ref name=\"Weder\">Weder (1999).</ref>  Weder's piece was later criticized for citing only two Haida sources, claiming they could speak for the entire Haida community, and was described as an \"inflammatory article ... not likely to be mistaken for exemplary journalism\".<ref name=\"Bradley895\">Bradley (2007) 895.</ref> ''The Globe and Mail'' published Bringhurst's response,<ref name=\"Genetics\">Bringhurst \"Since when\" (1999).</ref> which was later called \"considerably more measured\".<ref name=\"Bradley896\">Bradley (2007) 896.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Jeff Leer reviewed ''A Story As Sharp As A Knife'' saying Bringhurst has neither formal linguistic education<ref name=\"Leer565\">Leer (2000).</ref> nor significant experience with spoken Haida,<ref name=\"Leer576\">Leer (2000), 576.</ref> and doubting Bringhurst's ability to translate from Haida. Leer's review compared Bringhurst's work unfavourably to Enrico's ''Skidegate Haida Myths and Histories'', and referred to the Weder review as an authoritative source. Leer's publisher, the ''International Journal of American Linguistics'',  retracted the review and apologized to Bringhurst for publishing:\n\n{{Quote|text=some unfounded statements from another author that might be read to impugn Prof. Bringhurst's qualifications or integrity. The ''Journal's'' sole intention in publishing the book review was to bring an important work by a well-respected scholar to the attention of its readers. [...] it was not the ''Journal's'' intent to transmit erroneous perceptions of Prof. Bringhurst's training or scholarship.<ref name=\"Apology\">\"An Apology\" (2001).</ref>}}\n\nMost academic discussion and recognition of Bringhurst's work in Haida has been positive. Linguist [[Dell Hymes]] wrote a review of the ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers'' trilogy (of which ''A Story As Sharp As A Knife'' is part) in ''Language in Society'',<ref name=\"Hymes\">Hymes (2003).</ref> praising  the trilogy.  He said it \"should become a classic reference point\"<ref name=\"Hymes750\">Hymes (2003), 750.</ref> for Haida scholars in the future. In 2004, Bringhurst won the Edward Sapir Prize for ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers''.<ref name=\"Sapir\">\"Edward Sapir Book Prize\" (2004).</ref> The committee giving the award was headed by [[Leanne Hinton]], an expert in American Indian languages, and chair of the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley.<ref name=\"Edward\">\"Edward Sapir Prize\" (2005).</ref>\n[[File:Robert Bringhurst.jpg|thumb|Bringhurst in 2018]]\nBringhurst has been defended by [[Margaret Atwood]], who says that \"territorial squabbling cannot obscure the fact that Bringhurst's achievement is gigantic as well as heroic\", and that far from appropriating native voices, ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers'' \"restores to life two exceptional poets we ought to know\".<ref name=\"Atwood\">Atwood (2004).</ref> The CBC documentary was attacked in print for relying \"entirely on the fallacy, convenient to the producers, that Bringhurst had not consulted with any Haida\".<ref name=\"Richler\" />  Bringhurst with the help of Bill Reid had spent the better part of the previous decade working with members of the Haida community.<ref name=\"Richler\" /> People from other indigenous Canadian communities, such as late Cree elder Wilna Hodgson, [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Saskatchewan Order of Merit|SOM]],<ref name=\"Sask\">Past Recipients (2012).</ref> have also defended Bringhurst. In a letter to the editor of ''[[Books In Canada]]'', she called ''A Story As Sharp As A Knife'' \"a gift to First Nation people across [Canada]\", and a true \"masterpiece in the growing genre of spoken texts\". In her opinion, Bringhurst's \"efforts are clearly informed with the kind of integrity that all translators might strive to emulate\".<ref name=\"Hodgson\">Hodgson (2000).</ref>\n\nBringhurst says that \"culture is not genetic\" and that he pays respect to Native American languages like Haida by allowing works from those languages to be appreciated as art by as wide an audience as possible.<ref name=\"Prize\">\"Prize Winning Poet\" (2011).</ref> He says he always intended his translations to be \"[exercises] in literary history, not in the interpretation of present-day Haida culture\".<ref name=\"Richler\" />\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''The Shipwright's Log'', 1972\n*''Cadastre'', 1973 \n*''Deuteronomy'', 1974 (Sono Nis Press, Delta, British Columbia, Canada)\n*''Eight Objects'', 1975 (Kanchenjunga Press)\n*''Bergschrund'', 1975\n*''Tzuhalem's Mountain'', 1982\n*''The Beauty of the Weapons: Selected Poems 1972&ndash;82'', 1982, nominated for a [[1982 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]];

In 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of the Fraser Valley]],<ref name=\"UCFV\">Russell (2006).</ref> and in 2016 was awarded a Doctor of Letters (hon. causa) by [[Simon Fraser University]].<ref name=\"SFU announces\">SFU announces, 2016.</ref>\n\nBringhurst taught literature, [[art history]] and [[History of Western typography|history of typography]] at several universities and held [[fellow]]ships from the [[Canada Council for the Arts]], the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]], the American Philosophical Society, and the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]].\n\n==Literary career==\nHis 1992 publication, ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'' was praised as \"the finest book ever written about typography\" by the type designers [[Jonathan Hoefler]] and [[Tobias Frere-Jones]].<ref name=\"Frequent\">\"Frequently Asked Questions\".</ref> A collection of his poetry, ''The Beauty of the Weapons'', was short-listed for a [[1982 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]] in 1982, and ''A Story as Sharp as a Knife'', his work on Haida symbolism, was nominated for a [[2000 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]] in 2000. Bringhurst won the [[Lieutenant Governor's Award for Literary Excellence]] in 2005, an award which recognizes British Columbia writers who have contributed to the development of literary excellence in the Province.\n\n===Work in Haida===\nBringhurst has a strong interest in linguistics, translating works from classical Greek, Arabic, Navajo, and, most significantly, Haida. His interest in [[Haida people|Haida]] culture stems from his friendship and close association with the influential Haida artist [[Bill Reid]], with whom he wrote ''The Raven Steals the Light'' in 1984, among several other significant collaborations. It was this friendship that in 1987 \"started Bringhurst on the philanthropic endeavour of recording the Haida canon\".<ref name=\"Richler\">Richler (2001).</ref> The result of this labour was a trilogy of works collectively titled ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers''. The essays in its first volume, A Story As Sharp As Knife, and particularly its ninth chapter, \"The Prosody of Meaning,\" constitute an important contribution to the understanding of the poetics of oral literatures.\n\nHis translations from Haida have been viewed as an attempt to preserve the Haida culture, which in 1991 was considered part of a group \"likely to be lost unless strong efforts are made very quickly to perpetuate them\".<ref name=\"Kinkade\">Kinkade (1991).</ref>  The Haida translation has caused some controversy. Bringhurst was accused of academic exploitation and cultural appropriation.<ref name=\"Offence\">Bradley (2007).</ref> In 2001, the [[CBC radio]] program [[Ideas (radio show)|''Ideas'']] aired a two part series called \"Land to Stand On.\"  The series' first episode featured \"a string of Haida claiming [...] that Bringhurst's work is 'about keeping us in our place,' written 'without asking us,'\" and \"replete with 'serious errors twisting it into the poetry that he wants'\".<ref name =\"Richler\" />\n\nIn 1999,  the ''Globe and Mail'' published a report on the Haida reaction to ''A Story As Sharp As A Knife'' by Adele Weder.<ref name=\"Weder\">Weder (1999).</ref>  Weder's piece was later criticized for citing only two Haida sources, claiming they could speak for the entire Haida community, and was described as an \"inflammatory article ... not likely to be mistaken for exemplary journalism\".<ref name=\"Bradley895\">Bradley (2007) 895.</ref> ''The Globe and Mail'' published Bringhurst's response,<ref name=\"Genetics\">Bringhurst \"Since when\" (1999).</ref> which was later called \"considerably more measured\".<ref name=\"Bradley896\">Bradley (2007) 896.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Jeff Leer reviewed ''A Story As Sharp As A Knife'' saying Bringhurst has neither formal linguistic education<ref name=\"Leer565\">Leer (2000).</ref> nor significant experience with spoken Haida,<ref name=\"Leer576\">Leer (2000), 576.</ref> and doubting Bringhurst's ability to translate from Haida. Leer's review compared Bringhurst's work unfavourably to Enrico's ''Skidegate Haida Myths and Histories'', and referred to the Weder review as an authoritative source. Leer's publisher, the ''International Journal of American Linguistics'',  retracted the review and apologized to Bringhurst for publishing:\n\n{{Quote|text=some unfounded statements from another author that might be read to impugn Prof. Bringhurst's qualifications or integrity. The ''Journal's'' sole intention in publishing the book review was to bring an important work by a well-respected scholar to the attention of its readers. [...] it was not the ''Journal's'' intent to transmit erroneous perceptions of Prof. Bringhurst's training or scholarship.<ref name=\"Apology\">\"An Apology\" (2001).</ref>}}\n\nMost academic discussion and recognition of Bringhurst's work in Haida has been positive. Linguist [[Dell Hymes]] wrote a review of the ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers'' trilogy (of which ''A Story As Sharp As A Knife'' is part) in ''Language in Society'',<ref name=\"Hymes\">Hymes (2003).</ref> praising  the trilogy.  He said it \"should become a classic reference point\"<ref name=\"Hymes750\">Hymes (2003), 750.</ref> for Haida scholars in the future. In 2004, Bringhurst won the Edward Sapir Prize for ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers''.<ref name=\"Sapir\">\"Edward Sapir Book Prize\" (2004).</ref> The committee giving the award was headed by [[Leanne Hinton]], an expert in American Indian languages, and chair of the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley.<ref name=\"Edward\">\"Edward Sapir Prize\" (2005).</ref>\n[[File:Robert Bringhurst.jpg|thumb|Bringhurst in 2018]]\nBringhurst has been defended by [[Margaret Atwood]], who says that \"territorial squabbling cannot obscure the fact that Bringhurst's achievement is gigantic as well as heroic\", and that far from appropriating native voices, ''Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers'' \"restores to life two exceptional poets we ought to know\".<ref name=\"Atwood\">Atwood (2004).</ref> The CBC documentary was attacked in print for relying \"entirely on the fallacy, convenient to the producers, that Bringhurst had not consulted with any Haida\".<ref name=\"Richler\" />  Bringhurst with the help of Bill Reid had spent the better part of the previous decade working with members of the Haida community.<ref name=\"Richler\" /> People from other indigenous Canadian communities, such as late Cree elder Wilna Hodgson, [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Saskatchewan Order of Merit|SOM]],<ref name=\"Sask\">Past Recipients (2012).</ref> have also defended Bringhurst. In a letter to the editor of ''[[Books In Canada]]'', she called ''A Story As Sharp As A Knife'' \"a gift to First Nation people across [Canada]\", and a true \"masterpiece in the growing genre of spoken texts\". In her opinion, Bringhurst's \"efforts are clearly informed with the kind of integrity that all translators might strive to emulate\".<ref name=\"Hodgson\">Hodgson (2000).</ref>\n\nBringhurst says that \"culture is not genetic\" and that he pays respect to Native American languages like Haida by allowing works from those languages to be appreciated as art by as wide an audience as possible.<ref name=\"Prize\">\"Prize Winning Poet\" (2011).</ref> He says he always intended his translations to be \"[exercises] in literary history, not in the interpretation of present-day Haida culture\".<ref name=\"Richler\" />\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''The Shipwright's Log'', 1972\n*''Cadastre'', 1973 \n*''Deuteronomy'', 1974 (Sono Nis Press, Delta, British Columbia, Canada)\n*''Eight Objects'', 1975 (Kanchenjunga Press)\n*''Bergschrund'', 1975\n*''Tzuhalem's Mountain'', 1982\n*''The Beauty of the Weapons: Selected Poems 1972&ndash;82'', 1982, nominated for a [[1982 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Award]];

From left to right: [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Gunn]], [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]], [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]], [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]] and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]].]]\n* [[David Boreanaz]] as [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[City Of|1.01]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]]; ''[[Angel: After the Fall|After the Fall]])''\n: The titular main character, Angel is a vampire cursed with a soul who is prophesied to play a major role in the [[apocalypse]]. He spends most of his time during the series in fighting evil demons, sent on his path by visions from [[The Powers That Be (Angel)|The Powers That Be]].  Angel's main motivation for his actions is a quest for redemption for the years he spent without a soul.  During this time, he was known as Angelus and became known as \"The Scourge of Europe\", as well as \"The Demon with the Face of an Angel\", causing death and destruction wherever he went.  Originally appearing in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', Angel was written out of that show at the end of the third season so he could star in his own spin-off.  Angel is originally hesitant to form friendships and allow anyone to get close to him after the events in ''Buffy''.  Over the course of his own series, Angel falls in love, fathers a son and gains numerous allies and friends, but is always forced to control the monster that hides within him. Like many characters on the show, Angel changes drastically, starting out as an almost reluctant hero, and ending up an [[altruistic]] hero who is, in Cordelia's words, \"trying to save everyone on the planet.\"\n\n: Angel is the only character to appear in every episode.\n\n* [[Charisma Carpenter]] as [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[City Of|1.01]]\u2013[[Home (Angel)|4.22]], appeared in [[You're Welcome (Angel)|5.12]]; ''After the Fall'')\n: Cordelia Chase seeks to become a successful actress in Los Angeles after events in third season of ''Buffy''.  Contrary to that plan, however, she is sucked into Angel's life after almost being killed by a vampire.  Initially shallow and vapid, Cordelia is forced to grow after the visions sent by The Powers That Be are bestowed upon her.  During her tenure on the show, Cordelia undergoes this transformation, changing from high school popularity queen into a compassionate and nurturing figure.  Events in the show's third season lead to Cordelia becoming a vessel for the being known as Jasmine in the fourth season, after which she falls into a coma.  No longer a cast member in season five, she guest stars in the episode \"[[You're Welcome (Angel episode)|You're Welcome]]\", a send-off to her character, setting up the events for the [[Not Fade Away (Angel episode)|series finale]].\n\n* [[Glenn Quinn]] as [[Allen Francis Doyle]] ([[City Of|1.01]]\u2013[[Hero (Angel)|1.09]])\n: Allen Francis Doyle (more commonly known as just Doyle) is a half-demon, half-human hybrid and the original bearer of the visions from The Powers That Be. Doyle plays the Irish anti-hero, who would rather have a drink than fight the forces of evil.  When put to the test however, Doyle shows a hero's heart, willingly sacrificing himself to save the lives of his friends in the episode \"[[Hero (Angel episode)|Hero]]\", just after giving his visions to Cordelia.  Archived footage of Doyle is used in two later episodes (\"[[Birthday (Angel episode)|Birthday]] and \"You're Welcome\"), partially in remembrance of Glenn Quinn, who died in 2002.\n\n* [[Alexis Denisof]] as [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]] ([[Parting Gifts|1.10]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]], appeared previously; ''After the Fall'')\n: After the death of Doyle, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce shows up, touting himself as a \"rogue demon hunter\". Wesley teams up with Angel and Cordelia, spending much of the first season providing comic relief, but over the course of the second and third seasons, Wesley grows into the role of a capable leader, accompanied by a darkening of his personality. Originally a tried and true hero, Wesley's methods lead to him becoming more of an [[anti-hero]]. Wesley is ousted from the team after events in the latter half of the third season, and is only reluctantly accepted during the apocalyptic events of the fourth season. Wesley is reintegrated into the group during the final season.\n\n: Wesley appears in 100 of the 110 episodes, missing only the first nine episodes of the series and the fifth season episode \"[[Destiny (Angel)|Destiny]]\". He is the only character besides Angel himself to be a regular in all five seasons. In Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Wesley and Cordelia shared a mutual attraction that ended abruptly when their kiss had no spark.\n\n* [[J. August Richards]] as [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Charles Gunn]] ([[Judgment (Angel)|2.01]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]], recurring previously; ''After the Fall'')\n: Charles Gunn (frequently referred to as simply Gunn) appears at the end of the first season as a young demon hunter from the streets, who grudgingly befriends Angel after the vampire helps him.  Joining the cast in season two, Gunn must adjust to Wesley and Cordelia, who are primarily researchers, while he seeks more solace in the simple brawn work.  After events in the second season leave the three alone, he becomes close friends with both, notably Wesley, a friendship that is all but destroyed by the end of the third season.  After spending three years with the team as \"muscle\", Gunn quickly accepts the chance to become a highly knowledgeable lawyer during the fifth season, which ends up costing him severely in the end.\n\n* [[Amy Acker]] as [[Winifred Burkle|Winifred \"Fred\" Burkle]] ([[Heartthrob (Angel)|3.01]]\u2013[[A Hole in the World|5.15]], recurring previously; ''After the Fall'')\n: Winifred Burkle (more commonly called Fred) is originally a shy girl with troubles of fitting into the group but is shown to be extremely intelligent. She is saved from the demon world of Pylea by the Angel team in the last episodes of the second season. As the series progresses, however, Fred grows to become a capable and sociable person, providing a stable but quirky personality to group.  She becomes the subject of a [[love triangle]] during the third and fourth season which has severe effects on the make-up of the team and becomes somewhat of a focal point in the series.  In the latter half of the fifth season however, she is infected by the legendary demon Illyria, who takes over her form, destroying Fred's soul.\n\n* [[Vincent Kartheiser]] as [[Connor (Angel)|Connor]] ([[Angel (season 4)#Episodes|4.01]]\u2013[[Home (Angel)|4.22]], recurring previously and afterward; ''After the Fall'')\n: Connor is the son of Angel and Darla. He first appeared in the third season as a baby, left in the care of Angel after Darla sacrificed herself in order to give birth to the child.  Cared for and loved by the entire Angel crew, it came as a great shock when Wesley kidnapped Connor in hopes of protecting the child from a prophecy that cited Angel would kill him.  Unbeknownst to Wesley, the prophecy had been a fake created by Daniel Holtz, mortal enemy of Angel, and [[Sahjhan]], a demon whom Connor was actually prophesied to kill in the future. Sahjhan opened a portal to the hell dimension, [[Quor-Toth]], and Holtz took the boy and jumped inside to escape capture. After spending years in Quor-Toth being raised by Holtz to become \"The Destroyer\", a vicious demon hunter, the two were able to return to the normal world.  While only a few months had passed for Angel and crew, Connor was now in his late teens.  Holtz was able to manipulate Connor into trying to kill Angel, but after Angel was saved, Connor grudgingly came to accept his father and joined the crew with a certain reluctance in the fourth season.  Connor would play another important part in the season's final story, as he became father to the season's main adversary: Jasmine.  After Jasmine's defeat, Angel allowed Wolfram & Hart to alter Connor's memories, giving him a normal human life, a spell that would ultimately be broken by Wesley during the show's fifth and final season.  With two sets of memories mixing, Connor lives a confusing but content life, making an appearance in the series finale.\n\n* [[Andy Hallett]] as [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]] ([[Release (Angel)|4.14]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]], recurring previously; ''After the Fall'')\n: Lorne is the pacifist and music-loving empathy demon originally opens up a violence-free karaoke bar called Caritas, open to both demons and humans, where he reads people's futures by their singing. He is introduced in the second season, still referred to as The Host then, he is not credited as a regular until the latter half of the show's fourth season. Originally an occasional supporting character, Lorne moves in with the team during the third season, when ''Caritas'' is destroyed.  Although quickly accepted by the others, he has trouble adjusting to the violent lifestyle that accompanies the group.  Lorne comes into his own finally when the team became the owners of Wolfram & Hart's Los Angeles branch, becoming head of the entertainment division.  After the events of the fifth season's latter half, Lorne reevaluates his life and decides that he no longer has a place among the team. Andy Hallett died in 2009.\n\n* [[James Marsters]] as [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[Conviction (Angel)|5.01]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]], recurring previously; ''After the Fall'')\n: Spike is a vampire who fought to regain his soul and also an old companion/bitter enemy of Angel. He appears on ''Angel'' in the show's fifth and final season.  He initially appears as an incorporeal being, per events of ''Buffy''s final episode \"[[Chosen (Buffy episode)|Chosen]]\", and must deal with the tug of the afterlife, more specifically; hell.  However, when Spike is made corporeal again, he comes to serve as a constant reminder of Angel's past deeds, but also the hero that Angel no longer sees himself as being.  As such, Angel must question his actions past and present, the meaning of the Shanshu Prophecy, and finally, the corrupting nature of Wolfram & Hart.  Although the two remain rivals, they have an unshakable bond that makes them brothers in arms right up to the end.\n\n* [[Amy Acker]] as [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]] ([[Shells (Angel)|5.15]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]]; ''After the Fall'')\n: As a result of Fred inhaling Illyria's essence, her body is used as the host, with Illyria inheriting her human emotions, her legacy living on in some way.  Although Illyria herself initially opposes the team, she joins them after she finds she has nowhere else to go, and gradually becomes accepted, standing by the team in the final moments of the series.\n\n* [[Mercedes McNab]] as [[Harmony Kendall]] ([[Underneath (Angel)|5.17]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]], recurring previously)\n: Harmony Kendall is the type of woman that never moved on after her popular high school years.  She is still vapid, shallow and remains eternally at the age of a high school senior.  Bitten by a vampire during the third season of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', Harmony has made recurring appearances on both shows, displaying the same ineptitude for being a vampire as she did for being a mortal.  Taken from the Wolfram & Hart secretary pit by Wesley to work for Angel, Harmony earnestly tries to be accepted by Angel and the others, including former boyfriend Spike.\n\n==Recurring==\n\n* [[Elisabeth R\u00f6hm]] as [[Kate Lockley]] (Seasons 1\u20132; ''After the Fall'')\n: Kate Lockley is a police detective that meets Angel in the first season's [[Lonely Hearts (Angel episode)|second episode]], Kate acts as a contact with the police.  There are initial hints of a romance between the two, but those disappear when Kate learns of Angel's status as a vampire.  Soon, she becomes obsessed with the occult, falling into a negative spiral only enhanced by her distrust of Angel and the death of her father, the man who had single-handedly raised her and was also a retired but respected police officer.  Her obsessions grow to become a general hatred for vampires, including Angel, and the law-firm of Wolfram & Hart.  Angel, similarly obsessed with the firm, ignores Kate, and thereby almost arrives too late when she attempts suicide.  Able to save her, the two reconcile, but Kate decides to leave Los Angeles, she's already been fired from the L.A.P.D., and does not reappear again.  Before she leaves, she strengthens Angel's faith in the higher powers by mentioning that he was able to enter her apartment even though she never invited him in, leaving the audience to speculate whether or not Angel truly arrived in time to save her.\n* [[Julie Benz]] as [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] (Seasons 1\u20135)\n: Darla was Angel's sire and former lover. She is resurrected as a human in the [[To Shanshu in L.A. (Angel episode)|first season finale]], and is then employed by Wolfram & Hart to manipulate Angel.  Appearing at various intervals during the early season two episodes, Darla is able to drive Angel into a paranoid and obsessive frenzy.  During this time, Darla struggles with her human soul, and eventually learns that she is suffering from a fatal form of syphilis, as she did before being sired by the [[The Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Master]].  Before Angel can really help her, she is targeted by Wolfram & Hart, who enlist Drusilla to sire Darla once more.  Losing her soul again, Darla becomes one of Angel's most devastating foes.  In \"[[Reprise (Angel episode)|Reprise]]\", she and Angel have a one-night stand, after which Angel threatens to kill her.  She returns in the third season, pregnant with their child.\n* [[Matthew James (actor)|Matthew James]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Merl|Merl]] (Seasons 2\u20133)\n: Merl was a demon informant for Angel during season 2, when he split from the rest of the Angel Investigations crew.

He appears in six episodes during seasons 2 and 3.\n* [[Brigid Brannagh]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Virginia Bryce|Virginia Bryce]] (Season 2)\n: Virginia Bryce was introduced in the season 2 episode, \"[[Guise Will Be Guise]]\", in which Wesley (then masquerading as Angel), Cordelia, and Gunn were hired to protect her by her father. Her father then attempted to sacrifice Virginia at his birthday celebration, but the ritual failed. Virginia later learned that Wesley wasn't Angel, but forgave him and started to date him until she realized that Wesley's job was more dangerous than she originally believed.\n* [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Anne Steele|Anne Steele]] (Seasons 2 and 5)\n: Anne Steele originally appeared on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' in two episodes; in both instances, she is saved by Buffy Summers. Anne, who is prone to changing her name, later used Buffy's middle name as her own. Anne is later seen on ''Angel'', as a youth counselor at a homeless teen center. Anne seems friendly with Gunn, and later with the rest of the Angel Investigations team. She appears in three episodes of ''Angel'' including the series finale \"[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|Not Fade Away]]\".\n* [[Mark Lutz (actor)|Mark Lutz]] as [[Groosalugg]] (Seasons 2\u20133; ''After the Fall'')\n: Groosalugg is a half-demon/half-human who was originally from Pylea, Lorne's home dimension. He was the greatest warrior in Pylea, though was harshly treated by the priests who ruled the dimension. Soon after, he met Cordelia (who accidentally fell into Pylea through a portal), and the two had a short relationship before Cordelia went back to her own dimension.

Gwen's powers often helped her professional career as a thief, though they were also considered a curse as for a long time, she couldn't touch anyone without electrifying them. Gwen later reappeared in ''After the Fall'' in which she is involved with Angel Investigations.\n* [[Jenny Mollen]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Nina Ash|Nina Ash]] (Season 5; ''After the Fall'')\n: Introduced in the season 5 episode, \"[[Unleashed (Angel)|Unleashed]]\", Nina Ash was a young art major who became a werewolf.

Nina left Los Angeles with her sister and niece in order to get away from the then-upcoming apocalypse. Nina later appeared in ''After the Fall'', and provides shelter for demons and humans alike. At this point, Angel and Nina are no longer a couple, and she later marries someone else.\n\n==Villains==\nBecause of the nature of the Wolfram & Hart organization, they appeared in every season of ''Angel'', providing him with a constant opposition.  During the show's fifth season, Angel and his crew become the runners of Wolfram & Hart, but still fight against it in the form of its corruptive effect and their liaison to the Senior Partners, Eve.\n\n===Wolfram & Hart===\n* [[Christian Kane]] as Lindsey McDonald (Seasons 1\u20132, 5)\n\n: Lindsey McDonald is usually both an enemy and ally to the Angel Investigations team and formerly works with Wolfram & Hart. His first appearance is in the latter moments of the show's [[City of|first episode]]. Over the course of the following episodes he develops as a constant adversary of Angel, even hiring rogue slayer Faith to attack him.  Their conflict comes to a head in the [[To Shanshu in L.A.|first season finale]], where Angel cuts off Lindsey's hand in combat.  During the second season, Lindsey's obsession with Angel grows, the prosthetic hand a constant reminder of their animosity.  Their conflict again comes to the forefront when Lindsey falls in love with Darla and attacks Angel brutally with his truck and a sledgehammer.  However, Angel is able to overpower Lindsey and crushes his prosthetic hand.  When Lindsey receives a new hand in the episode \"[[Dead End (Angel episode)|Dead End]]\", courtesy of Wolfram & Hart, he is forced to work with Angel when the hand begins to act oddly.  At the end of the episode, Lindsey recognizing how far he's fallen, quits Wolfram & Hart, and leaves Los Angeles to find himself.  Although they seem to patch things up just before Lindsey leaves, Lindsey returns in the fifth season as a free agent, hoping to kill Angel.  He helps Angel destroy the Circle of the Black Thorn but is killed by Lorne who shoots him twice in the chest on Angel's orders.  Lindsey dies upset that Lorne killed him and not Angel himself.

Highly ambitious and competitive, Lilah proved herself to be one of the show's leading antagonists. She later engaged in an affair with Wesley, and became president of the Special Projects Division. She was later killed in season 4 upon Angelus' resurface, by Jasmine (in the body of Cordelia), but later reappeared in the Hell division of Wolfram & Hart. Lilah appears in 35 episodes.\n\n* [[Sam Anderson]] as [[Holland Manners]] (Seasons 1\u20132)\n: The head of Special Projects at Wolfram & Hart. He was known for arranging the deaths of people inside and outside the law firm, which included his employee Lee Mercer. He personally supervises Wolfram & Hart's operations regarding Angel. In particular, he oversees the resurrection of Angel's sire Darla and orchestrates her return to vampirism by Drusilla in an attempt to corrupt Angel. Eventually, Holland was later killed in a massacre at his wine cellar by Darla and Drusilla. Angel was there, but due to Holland's corruption of him, he failed to do anything to prevent the event from happening. He remains with Wolfram & Hart after death, as do all the firm's lawyers after their deaths.\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Nathan Reed|Nathan Reed]] (Season 2)\n: Nathan Reed was Lilah and Lindsay's new superior after Holland Manners' death. He appeared in \"[[Blood Money (Angel)|Blood Money]]\", \"[[Reprise (Angel)|Reprise]]\" and \"[[Dead End (Angel)|Dead End]]\". He disappeared following season two, and was never mentioned again.\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Gavin Park|Gavin Park]] (Seasons 2\u20134)\n: Originally a lawyer for Wolfram & Hart who first appears at the end of the second season, Gavin Park had a longstanding rivalry with Lilah Morgan, whom he later worked under. He once assaulted Lilah in the season 3 episode, \"[[Billy (Angel)|Billy]]\", which deepened their mutual dislike of each other. Gavin was responsible for setting up surveillance cameras on the Hyperion Hotel, where Angel Investigations was set up. In season 4, during the massacre at the offices of Wolfram & Hart, Gavin was killed by The Beast. However, he was subsequently brought back as a zombie, only to be killed by Gunn soon after.\n* [[John Rubinstein]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Linwood Murrow|Linwood Murrow]] (Seasons 3\u20134)\n: Replacing Nathan Reed as the head of the Special Projects Division in season three, Linwood Murrow was originally the boss of Lilah Morgan and Gavin Park. Instead of being concerned with Wolfram & Hart's plans to corrupt Angel, Murrow was more concerned with his safety and personal agenda. He even attempted to kill Angel at one point, though the vampire would later torture him for information later on. Lilah disliked Murrow, who was sexist and misogynistic towards her, and disrespected him. Eventually, upon discovering that Lilah went over his head to meet with the Senior Partners, Lilah (who had replaced him as head of Special Projects) beheaded him after Murrow confronted her.\n\n* [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as [[Knox (Buffyverse)|Knox]] (Seasons 4\u20135)\n: First appearing the season four [[Home (Angel episode)|finale]], Knox seems to be the typical Wolfram & Hart employee, and not decidedly evil, although this is quickly questioned by Wesley.  From their first meeting, Knox is quite taken with Fred, and over the time that the two are working together, a romance develops, but Fred eventually dumps him.  Knox, however, has become obsessed with Fred, and orchestrates for her to be the host to Illyria, the being that he has been worshipping since childhood.  Finally showing his evil side, working alongside Illyria, Wesley does not hesitate to gun him down as revenge for the death of Fred.\n\n* [[Sarah Thompson (actress)|Sarah Thompson]] as Eve (Season 5)\n\n: Starting with the show's fifth season, Eve serves as the team's liaison to the Senior Partners.  The fact that the entire team did not trust her hardly unnerves her, and it is revealed she's struck up a relation with Lindsey.  Together, the two plot a scheme to kill Angel, but they fail and Eve is forced to go into hiding from the Partners' wrath.  When new liaison Marcus Hamilton is assigned, she is also forced to sign over her immortality.  Just as Lindsey returns to her, he decides to help Angel in his fight against the Circle of the Black Thorn, when she confronts Angel later, she learns he arranged Lindsey's assassination.  Completely broken, she is left in the Wolfram & Hart as it starts to crumble around her.\n* [[Adam Baldwin]] as [[Marcus Hamilton (Angel)|Marcus Hamilton]] (Season 5)\n: Marcus Hamilton was the team's new liaison to the Senior Partners after Eve's betrayal, he is decidedly more stern than Eve, certain to not give the team any leeway.  Eventually becoming a close advisor to Angel, Marcus must stand up to face him when Angel reveals his own betrayal.  Describing himself as \"legion\" and carrying the strength of the Senior Partners in his blood, he loses his battle against Angel, flanked by his son Connor, when the vampire uses this knowledge to drain him of his power.  The death of Hamilton is the final piece in Angel's plan of assassinating the Partners' agents, and leads directly into the final moments of the series, where the Senior Partners unleash a veritable hell on the team as retribution.\n\n===Second season===\n* [[Juliet Landau]] as [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (Seasons 2, 5)\n: A vampire who originated on ''Buffy''. Sired and driven mad by Angelus, Drusilla used to scour the world with Angel, Darla and her own sired vampire Spike. By the time of second season of ''Angel'', Drusilla is called in to sire Darla by Wolfram & Hart, and together the two go on a killing spree through the city.  Angel, taking a turn towards the dark, is able to defeat the two by setting them on fire, and Drusilla flees back to Sunnydale, appearing in the ''Buffy'' episode \"[[Crush (Buffy episode)|Crush]]\".  She is not seen afterward except in flashbacks.\n\n===Third season===\n* [[Keith Szarabajka]] as Daniel Holtz (Season 3)\n\n: First mentioned in season 2 but first seen in season 3, Daniel Holtz was an 18th-century vampire hunter who hunted Angel (then Angelus) and Darla, even more so after they killed his family. He later made a deal with Sahjhan to be frozen in time for 200 years. Upon his revival in late 2001 (in the episode \"[[Offspring (Angel)|Offspring]]\"), he hunted down Angel and the Angel Investigations team. Later, Holtz kidnapped Angel's son Connor during the season, and raised him in a hell dimension, teaching Connor to hate and kill his father. Holtz and Connor returned to Los Angeles after years in the hell dimension (which translates to only a couple of months in Los Angeles), and Connor attempted to kill his father. When the boy failed to kill his father and later started to build a relationship with Angel, Holtz ordered Justine Cooper to kill him and make it look like Angel had murdered him. This development would lead to Connor sinking Angel to the bottom of the ocean at the end of season 3.\n* [[Jack Conley (actor)|Jack Conley]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Sahjhan|Sahjhan]] (Seasons 3, 5)\n: A demon of the Granok species, he first encountered Holtz in the late 18th century, and offered him to be frozen in time in order to kill Angel and Darla in the future. Sahjhan wanted for Holtz to kill Connor because a prophecy stated that Connor would grow into adulthood and kill him. He eventually grew impatient with Holtz when he kidnapped Connor in order to raise him to kill Angel in the hell dimension. He later abandoned Connor in the hell dimension Quor'toth, deciding he was good as dead when Holtz took him to that dimension. Sahjhan was imprisoned for a second time by Angel, but later returned. Connor killed Sahjhan in season 5, fulfilling the prophecy. \n* [[Laurel Holloman]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Justine Cooper|Justine Cooper]] (Seasons 3\u20134)\n: Justine Cooper is a vampire hunter and follower of Holtz. Devastated after her twin sister Julia was killed by vampires, Justine turned to alcohol and roamed graveyards at night, searching for vampires. She was recruited by Holtz in the season 3 episode \"[[Dad (Angel)|Dad]]\" and formed a bond with him. Justine tried to find people who have lost loved ones to join their cause, and also attacked Wesley when he tried to deliver Connor to Holtz. She was later abandoned by Holtz, and rallied the remaining members of Holtz's militia against Angel. Eventually, Justine killed Holtz on his request, and framed the death on Angel, in order to get Connor to turn against his father Angel. She ultimately helped Connor with his plan to banish Angel to the bottom of the ocean. Justine was later captured by Wesley, who bound and gagged her and placed her in a closet for several months. The character was last seen in the season four premiere, \"[[Angel (season 4)#Episodes|Deep Down]]\" when Wesley left her chained to a railing and left her with a key, and told her she had the choice of moving on with her life or continue to be a slave.\n\n===Fourth season===\n* [[Vladimir Kulich]] as [[List of minor Angel characters#Beast|The Beast]] (Season 4)\n* [[Gina Torres]] and [[Charisma Carpenter]] as Jasmine (Season 4)\n\n: A deity, Jasmine served as one of the main antagonists of the fourth season. Jasmine, also known as the \"Devourer\", is a super being who seeks to gain corporeal form, then blend with all of humanity, making each human her spiritual slave. She feeds on humanity to maintain her form and delivers a Utopian existence to all via mind control. For most of season four, Jasmine possessed Cordelia, leading to her host committing several out-of-character acts, e.g. Cordelia sleeping with Connor and later killing Lilah Morgan. A subsequent pregnancy was to give Jasmine a full body, and subsequently Cordelia gave birth to Jasmine; this birth would lead to Cordelia's coma and subsequent death. Jasmine wanted a world where the people were completely devoted to her, but this agenda failed, leading to Jasmine's death at the hands of Connor. According to [[List of minor Angel characters#Skip|Skip]], Jasmine arranged for almost every major event that had occurred in the past seven years: Lorne's arrival, Angel's move to L.A., Doyle passing his visions to Cordelia, Cordelia's transformation into a half-demon and her ascension to the realms of the Powers, the birth of Connor, and the coming of The Beast.\n\n===Fifth season===\n* The Circle of the Black Thorn (Season 5)\n: The Circle of the Black Thorn serve as agents of the Senior Partners, and are to be the harbingers of the apocalypse.  The Circle includes the characters [[List of minor Angel characters#Archduke Sebassis|Archduke Sebassis]], [[List of minor Angel characters#Cyvus Vail|Cyvus Vail]], [[List of minor Angel characters#Izzy|Izzerial the Devil]] and [[List of minor Angel characters#Senator Helen Brucker|Senator Helen Brucker]]. They were ultimately destroyed by Angel and his team.\n\n==Characters from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''==\n* [[Seth Green]] as [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] (Season 1)\n: Daniel \"Oz\" Osborne appears in the first season episode \"[[In the Dark (Angel)|In the Dark]]\", crossing over from ''Buffy'' to give Angel the Gem of Amarra, which will grant him virtual immortality, thus eradicating any vampire weaknesses, such as sunlight or being killed via wooden stake.  The Gem is stolen by Spike, also crossing over from ''Buffy'' and Oz assists the Angel crew in their search for him.  Oz leaves Los Angeles again after the adventure is over, and Angel decides to destroy the Gem after he has taken it back from Spike.\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Buffy Summers]] (Season 1)\n: Buffy Summers appears in two episodes of Angel's first season, first in \"[[I Will Remember You (Angel)|I Will Remember You]]\", where she and Angel rekindle their love after he becomes human as a result of a Mohra demon's blood.  After Angel learns from The Oracles, conduits to The Powers That Be that Buffy will die if he remains human, he asks them to turn back time, and prevents himself from being affected by the Mohra blood.  She returns in \"[[Sanctuary (Angel episode)|Sanctuary]]\" to oppose Faith, leading to a conflict between Angel that was resolved in the following crossover, in the ''Buffy'' episode \"[[The Yoko Factor]]\".  Buffy was at first thought to have appeared in the fifth season episode \"[[The Girl in Question]]\", but Sarah Michelle Gellar did not appear in the role, and in the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight|Buffy Season Eight]]'' comics it was also revealed to be a decoy and not the real Buffy.\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith Lehane]] (Seasons 1\u20132, 4)\n: Faith Lehane first made the jump to ''Angel'' in its first season, in the episode \"[[Five by Five (Angel)|Five by Five]]\", hired to kill Angel.  After kidnapping and torturing Wesley, she engages Angel in combat, secretly acting on a death wish.  Angel is able to convince Faith to walk the path of redemption, the plot of the following episode \"[[Sanctuary (Angel episode)|Sanctuary]]\".  Thanks to Angel's faith in her, Faith agrees to turn herself in and go to prison for her crimes, and Angel occasionally visits her, as he does in \"[[Judgment (Angel)|Judgment]]\".  Faith returns in the show's fourth season, in the episode \"[[Salvage (Angel)|Salvage]]\", broken out of jail by Wesley in order to hunt down and bring in Angelus.  Almost at the cost of her own life, they (with some assistance by Willow) succeed to re-ensoul Angel, and Faith goes with Willow to Sunnydale to help fight against The First Evil and Caleb which occurs in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|the seventh season of ''Buffy'']].\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as [[Willow Rosenberg]] (Seasons 2, 4)\n: Willow Rosenberg first appeared on the phone in the season two episode \"[[Disharmony (Angel)|Disharmony]]\", calling with Cordelia about Harmony.  She again appeared, but in a non-speaking role, at the end of the second season finale \"[[There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb]]\", to tell of Buffy's death in \"[[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Gift]]\", over on ''Buffy''.  Willow's last appearance is in the fourth season episode \"[[Orpheus (Angel)|Orpheus]]\" to re-ensoul Angel as she did in the second season of ''Buffy''.  During this short time with the team, she connected with the members of Angel's crew, notably Wesley (in fact, Alexis Denisof, the actor portraying Wesley, is married to Hannigan in real-life), who shared their respective experiences with the darkness inside them.  As an extra to the adventure, Willow was able to take Faith back to Sunnydale to aid in the ongoing events of the seventh season of ''Buffy''.\n* [[Tom Lenk]] as [[Andrew Wells]] (Season 5)\n: The last of the ''Buffy'' alumni, Andrew Wells appears twice in the show's fifth and final season.  First in the episode \"[[Damage (Angel)|Damage]]\" as a representative for Buffy's gang to pick up new rogue slayer [[List of minor Angel characters#Dana|Dana]].  It is Andrew that expresses the group's new distrust for Angel's team, reuniting with the resurrected Spike at the same time.  Andrew ultimately tricks Angel's team into giving up Dana after he appears with a large group of slayers.  Andrew returns in \"[[The Girl in Question]]\", as a support to the Buffy decoy (as revealed in the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight|Buffy Season Eight]]'' comics), giving Spike and Angel some advice on life and telling them it's time to let Buffy move on (for now).\n\n{{Angel (1999 TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Angel Characters, List Of}}\n[[Category:Angel (TV series) characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of Buffyverse characters]]\n[[sv:Angel (TV-serie)#Marcus Hamilton]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Angel'' characters}}\n{{Cleanup-rewrite|date=May 2009}}\n\nThis article lists the major and recurring [[fictional character]]s created by [[Joss Whedon]] and the writers of [[Mutant Enemy]] for the cult hit television program, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''.

From left to right: [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Gunn]], [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]], [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]], [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]] and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]].]]\n* [[David Boreanaz]] as [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[City Of|1.01]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]]; ''[[Angel: After the Fall|After the Fall]])''\n: The titular main character, Angel is a vampire cursed with a soul who is prophesied to play a major role in the [[apocalypse]]. He spends most of his time during the series in fighting evil demons, sent on his path by visions from [[The Powers That Be (Angel)|The Powers That Be]].  Angel's main motivation for his actions is a quest for redemption for the years he spent without a soul.  During this time, he was known as Angelus and became known as \"The Scourge of Europe\", as well as \"The Demon with the Face of an Angel\", causing death and destruction wherever he went.  Originally appearing in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', Angel was written out of that show at the end of the third season so he could star in his own spin-off.  Angel is originally hesitant to form friendships and allow anyone to get close to him after the events in ''Buffy''.  Over the course of his own series, Angel falls in love, fathers a son and gains numerous allies and friends, but is always forced to control the monster that hides within him. Like many characters on the show, Angel changes drastically, starting out as an almost reluctant hero, and ending up an [[altruistic]] hero who is, in Cordelia's words, \"trying to save everyone on the planet.\"\n\n: Angel is the only character to appear in every episode.\n\n* [[Charisma Carpenter]] as [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[City Of|1.01]]\u2013[[Home (Angel)|4.22]], appeared in [[You're Welcome (Angel)|5.12]]; ''After the Fall'')\n: Cordelia Chase seeks to become a successful actress in Los Angeles after events in third season of ''Buffy''.  Contrary to that plan, however, she is sucked into Angel's life after almost being killed by a vampire.  Initially shallow and vapid, Cordelia is forced to grow after the visions sent by The Powers That Be are bestowed upon her.  During her tenure on the show, Cordelia undergoes this transformation, changing from high school popularity queen into a compassionate and nurturing figure.  Events in the show's third season lead to Cordelia becoming a vessel for the being known as Jasmine in the fourth season, after which she falls into a coma.  No longer a cast member in season five, she guest stars in the episode \"[[You're Welcome (Angel episode)|You're Welcome]]\", a send-off to her character, setting up the events for the [[Not Fade Away (Angel episode)|series finale]].\n\n* [[Glenn Quinn]] as [[Allen Francis Doyle]] ([[City Of|1.01]]\u2013[[Hero (Angel)|1.09]])\n: Allen Francis Doyle (more commonly known as just Doyle) is a half-demon, half-human hybrid and the original bearer of the visions from The Powers That Be. Doyle plays the Irish anti-hero, who would rather have a drink than fight the forces of evil.  When put to the test however, Doyle shows a hero's heart, willingly sacrificing himself to save the lives of his friends in the episode \"[[Hero (Angel episode)|Hero]]\", just after giving his visions to Cordelia.  Archived footage of Doyle is used in two later episodes (\"[[Birthday (Angel episode)|Birthday]] and \"You're Welcome\"), partially in remembrance of Glenn Quinn, who died in 2002.\n\n* [[Alexis Denisof]] as [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]] ([[Parting Gifts|1.10]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]], appeared previously; ''After the Fall'')\n: After the death of Doyle, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce shows up, touting himself as a \"rogue demon hunter\". Wesley teams up with Angel and Cordelia, spending much of the first season providing comic relief, but over the course of the second and third seasons, Wesley grows into the role of a capable leader, accompanied by a darkening of his personality. Originally a tried and true hero, Wesley's methods lead to him becoming more of an [[anti-hero]]. Wesley is ousted from the team after events in the latter half of the third season, and is only reluctantly accepted during the apocalyptic events of the fourth season. Wesley is reintegrated into the group during the final season.\n\n: Wesley appears in 100 of the 110 episodes, missing only the first nine episodes of the series and the fifth season episode \"[[Destiny (Angel)|Destiny]]\". He is the only character besides Angel himself to be a regular in all five seasons. In Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Wesley and Cordelia shared a mutual attraction that ended abruptly when their kiss had no spark.\n\n* [[J. August Richards]] as [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Charles Gunn]] ([[Judgment (Angel)|2.01]]\u2013[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|5.22]], recurring previously; ''After the Fall'')\n: Charles Gunn (frequently referred to as simply Gunn) appears at the end of the first season as a young demon hunter from the streets, who grudgingly befriends Angel after the vampire helps him.  Joining the cast in season two, Gunn must adjust to Wesley and Cordelia, who are primarily researchers, while he seeks more solace in the simple brawn work.  After events in the second season leave the three alone, he becomes close friends with both, notably Wesley, a friendship that is all but destroyed by the end of the third season.  After spending three years with the team as \"muscle\", Gunn quickly accepts the chance to become a highly knowledgeable lawyer during the fifth season, which ends up costing him severely in the end.\n\n* [[Amy Acker]] as [[Winifred Burkle|Winifred \"Fred\" Burkle]] ([[Heartthrob (Angel)|3.01]]\u2013[[A Hole in the World|5.15]], recurring previously; ''After the Fall'')\n: Winifred Burkle (more commonly called Fred) is originally a shy girl with troubles of fitting into the group but is shown to be extremely intelligent. She is saved from the demon world of Pylea by the Angel team in the last episodes of the second season. As the series progresses, however, Fred grows to become a capable and sociable person, providing a stable but quirky personality to group.  She becomes the subject of a [[love triangle]] during the third and fourth season which has severe effects on the make-up of the team and becomes somewhat of a focal point in the series.

A subsequent pregnancy was to give Jasmine a full body, and subsequently Cordelia gave birth to Jasmine; this birth would lead to Cordelia's coma and subsequent death.

The studio primarily developed [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] ports and adaptations of other video games, peaking at eight projects in 1994. Mike Ribero left his position as [[Sega of America]]'s vice president of sales and marketing to become CEO of Radical Entertainment in 1996.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Radical and Disney to Play Ball!|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=99|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1997|page=31}}</ref> Between 1997 and 1998, several employees left the studio to form [[Barking Dog Studios]].\n\n=== 369 Interactive ===\nIn 2003, Radical Entertainment opened a development division, 369 Interactive, which was set to develop multiple titles based on the ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'' franchise, in partnership with [[Ubi Soft]].\n\n=== Acquisition by Vivendi Universal (2005\u20132008) ===\nAlthough Radical Entertainment developed few titles for Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the titles gained massive success and warranted the company's interest in the developers. In 2005, Vivendi acquired Radical Entertainment, however, as described by a former developer at Radical, the mood did not change much and Radical still operated as an independent game developing company. After being acquired by Vivendi, Radical began to make many games such as ''[[Scarface: The World Is Yours]]'' and ''[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]'' while being published under Vivendi's [[Sierra Entertainment]] label. Radical was also given the license to continue development of the ''[[Crash Bandicoot (series)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' franchise which was also published under Sierra Entertainment. Radical took over the development of ''[[Crash Tag Team Racing]]'' from [[Traveller's Tales]]. Due to the success of ''Crash Tag Team Racing'', Radical started the development of ''[[Crash of the Titans]]'' and proclaimed that \"Crash was home at Radical\" stating that Radical would develop all further ''Crash'' games. The critical and commercial success of ''Crash of the Titans'' spawned one more sequel, ''[[Crash: Mind over Mutant]]'', which managed to both critically beat its predecessor as well as commercially. During the development of ''Crash: Mind Over Mutant'', Radical began working on its first original [[intellectual property]], ''[[Prototype (video game)|Prototype]]''.\n\n=== Subsidiary of Activision (2008\u20132009) ===\nIn 2008 it was announced that Vivendi Games and [[Activision]] were to form [[Activision Blizzard]]. The merger changed the mood of Radical and made it more like a first-party developer, instead of independent. At the time of the merge Radical was working on three different projects, one was an unnamed project and the other two were ''Crash: Mind Over Mutant'' and ''Prototype''. After the merger took place, about half of Radical's staff was cut under Activision Blizzard's restructuring. This resulted in the cancellation of the unnamed project while development of ''Crash'' and ''Prototype'' were unaffected. As revealed later by a former developer at Radical, the unnamed project was ''Scarface 2'', which had been at development at Radical for over two years and had nearly [[gone gold]], the developer stated that Activision cancelled the project. ''Crash: Mind Over Mutant'' was one of the last games to be published under the Sierra Entertainment label, abit only in Europe, as North American copies use Activision's logo. Nevertheless, Activision themselves is given credit within the video game. ''Prototype'' was published through Activision.\n\nAfter the release of ''Prototype'' in 2009 Radical did not officially announce any new projects, though it was revealed again by another former developer that Radical was working on another unnamed project, which had been in development for over a year. However, when Radical Entertainment experienced layoffs which resulted in over 60 people losing jobs, the project ''Crash Landed'' was cancelled by Activision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/experience-going-indie/ |title=Feral developers: why game industry talent is going indie |last=Kuchera |first=Ben |date=24 August 2011 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref> In 2019, environment artist Wayne Dalton leaked images of this unannounced project which was revealed to be a video game tie-in to the cancelled ''Spider-Man 4'' film, taking over development from [[Treyarch]].

The Master Artisan of Bi Sool Chae, Kim Soo-Mi, focuses on preserving the traditions of Hanbok-making, including hand-dyeing and hand-sewing each garment.\n\nThe Master Artisan lives with her two married sons in her traditional Korean estate. Her two daughters-in-law have been her apprentices for a long time. When the time comes for the Artisan to choose her successor, the fierce competition between the two daughters-in-law results in tragedies that reverberate for decades afterwards.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n*[[Oh Yeon-seo]] as Jang Bo-ri (formerly Jang Eun-bi)\n**[[Yoo Eun-mi]] as young Bo-ri\nDaughter and only child of Bi Sool Chae's second son (Soo-bong) and his wife (In-hwa), Eun-bi is a kind-hearted girl with artistic talent. She is much-loved by her father, grandmother, aunt and uncle. She loves her mother very much, but is hurt because her mother spends too much time making hanbok instead of with her.\n\nWhen she is eight years old, Eun-bi gets into her mother's car and falls asleep in the back seat. Her mother, unaware that Eun-bi is in the back seat, pursues her sister-in-law Ok-soo in her car during a rainy night, and causes an accident which claims the life of her brother-in-law. After this accident, a frightened Eun-bi runs away, and her mother, not knowing she was there in the first place, drives off without her. \n\nWhile wandering the streets, she is subsequently hit by a truck that is driven by Do Hye-ok. Afraid that she will be prosecuted for hitting Eun-bi, Hye-ok takes an unconscious Eun-bi to a nearby inn. When Eun-bi wakes, she has lost her memory, and believes Hye-ok is her mother and Min-jung is her older sister. When a policeman questions her about the accident, Hye-ok is forced to pretend Eun-bi is her child. Since Eun-bi no longer remembers her own name, Hye-ok names her Bo-ri, which means \u201cbarley,\u201d because she was eating barley mixed rice at that moment.\n\nHye-ok does not send Bo-ri to school beyond Junior High, and puts her to work in her small restaurant in a rural town called Jang-heung, where Bo-ri continues to work for the next twenty years. Although mistreated by Hye-ok, who abuses her and treats her like a slave compared to her real daughter Min-jung, she remains affectionate and devoted to Hye-ok, believing her to be her real mother.\n\nBo-ri's compassion is further demonstrated by her selfless love for Min-jung's abandoned baby Bi-dan, who she believes is a foundling. Bi-dan was born premature and suffered hearing loss as a result. Bo-ri works tirelessly to earn enough money to pay for surgery to restore Bi-dan's hearing. She also never tells anyone that Bi-dan is not her biological daughter, even though many look down on her for having a baby as a single woman.\n\nAt some point, Bo-ri fatefully encounters her aunt, Ok-soo, the widow of Bi Sool Chae's oldest son who perished in that car accident. Although her aunt does not recognize her, she teaches Bo-ri the art of making hanbok, for which Bo-ri has a natural talent. Through her hanbok-making skills, Bo-ri ends up encountering her family members again.\n\n*[[Kim Ji-hoon (actor born 1981)|Kim Ji-hoon]] as Lee Jae-hwa\n**[[Jung Yun-seok]] as young Jae-hwa\nA childhood friend of Eun-bi, and nephew of Eun-bi's aunt Ok-soo. His mother died suddenly in a car accident when he was about 10 years old. He was also forced to accept a new stepmother, a brother (Jae-hee), and a baby sister very soon afterwards, as his father quickly marries his mistress of many years.\n\nInstead of working at his father's company, Jae-hwa becomes a prosecutor and ends up in Jang-heung where he meets Bo-ri. At first he has an antagonistic relationship with Bo-ri, but he later falls in love with her, accepting her and Bi-Dan with open arms. \n\n*[[Lee Yoo-ri]] as Yeon Min-jung\n**[[:ko:\uc2e0\uc218\uc5f0|Shin Soo-yeon]] as young Min-jung\nExtremely bitter about being raised by a poor single mother, Min-jung feels entitled to a better life with wealth and status, which she ruthlessly pursues.\n\nHer first meeting with Eun-bi was at the first Hanbok competition for Bi Sool Chae's successor, in which she served as a model for Ok-soo's hanbok. Her win-at-any-cost attitude is demonstrated when she rips the belt from Eun-bi's hanbok to rig the competition.\n\nAfter Eun-bi comes to live with her and her mother and becomes Bo-ri, Min-jung purposefully copies Bo-ri's drawing, an evocative image of Bi Sool Chae's dye yard, and wins an art contest and a college scholarship sponsored by Bi Sool Chae. To further gain sympathy, she lies that she is an orphan, and forbids her mother from contacting her, or ever revealing their relationship. She eventually brown-noses her way into becoming adopted by Soo-bong and In-hwa, Eun-bi's real parents who still miss their lost daughter. Min-jung discovers that their lost daughter is in fact Bo-ri, who lived with her as her sister when they were young. She deliberately hides this from the Bi Sool Chae family, preventing them from finding Eun-bi, and effectively stealing Eun-bi's life.\n\nWhile in college, she pursues a relationship with Moon Ji-sang, who was the son of a wealthy businessman. When she learns that Ji-sang's father lost all his money, she cruelly dumps him. She then discovers that she is six months pregnant, and the doctor informs her that it is too late to terminate the pregnancy. After desperately hiding her pregnancy from her new parents, she secretly travels to her real mother's house in Jang-Heung and gives birth to a premature daughter, whom she promptly abandons. Although she told her mother to bring the baby to an orphanage, the baby is named Bi-dan (\u201cSilk\u201d) and raised by Bo-ri as her own.\n\nLee Jae-hee eventually falls in love with Min-jung and proposes marriage. Becoming the wife of a wealthy heir is Min-jung's dream come true. But as she is realizing her dreams, her past crimes continue to haunt her: stealing Eun-bi's life, abandoning her mother, abandoning her secret baby, and betraying Moon Ji-sang. He falls in love with Min-jung, and gets his company to sponsor her study abroad in the US. He eventually marries Min-jung, even as he is warned of her treacherous nature by her former boyfriend, Moon Ji-sang, who was once his trusted assistant. When he finally realizes who Min-Jung truly is, he is horrified that he let himself trust her.\n\n*[[Oh Chang-seok]] as Lee Jae-hee\n**[[:ko:\uc870\ud604\ub3c4|Jo Hyun-do]] as young Jae-hee\nLee is Jae-hwa's half-brother whose mother was their father's mistress for many years. Although as a child he was friendly with Jae-hwa, due to a misunderstanding, as an adult he envies Jae-hwa for being a potential threat to inheriting their father's business, and his inferiority complex causes him to behave in unscrupulous ways.\n\n=== Supporting characters ===\n*[[Kim Yong-rim]] as Park Soo-mi\n\nPark is the Master Artisan of renowned Hanbok house Bi Sool Chae. She is wealthy, respected, and her services are sought after for restoring royal garments and dressing the First Lady of Korea. She insists on preserving the traditional art of hanbok-making, painstakingly hand-dyeing and hand-sewing each garment. She has an incredible eye for detail, and is able to recognize the seamstress with one look of the garment.\n\nShe appreciates her older daughter-in-law Ok-soo, for constructing her hanboks with love and compassion for the wearer. Although her younger daughter-in-law In-hwa is a talented seamstress and designer, she recognizes that In-hwa has greed and malice in her heart, which is also reflected in the hanboks that she makes.\n\n*[[Kim Hye-ok]] as In-hwa\n\nOnce a very poor child, In-hwa stole a Bi Sool Chae hanbok in order to dress her mother's corpse at her funeral. The Master Artisan of Bi Sool Chae beat her for the theft, but allowed her to keep the hanbok. She told In-hwa that the hanbok was paid for with her beating, and that it is good that her mother was not going to the afterlife in stolen clothing.\n\nIn-hwa becomes enamored with the art of hanbok-making, and manipulates Soo-bong into marrying her by piercing the gas line under his bedroom floor with her sewing scissors, and causing him to nearly suffocate to death. After she saves his life, he feels compelled to marry her.\n\nWhen the Master Artisan says she will choose her successor, In-hwa becomes obsessed with being chosen, and ignores Eun-bi even more. While In-hwa is a very talented designer and seamstress, the Master Artisan has always favored the older daughter-in-law, Ok-soo, for her kind and loving nature, which was reflected in her sewing style. In addition, the Master Artisan suspects In-hwa of deliberately damaging the gas line and endangering Soo-bong's life after she discovers the sewing scissors that were broken when piercing the gas line.\n\nIn her desperation to be selected as the successor, In-hwa steals and burns a hanbok that Ok-soo was making. To win the competition, she relentlessly pursues a one-of-a-kind embroidery piece that was designed for Korean royalty. When she learns that Ok-soo obtained the embroidery, she chases Ok-soo and her husband Hee-bong in her car during a rainy night, and causes an accident in which Hee-bong dies and Eun-bi is lost. However, she lies and says that she was not at the scene of the accident. The Master Artisan and her husband believe her.\n\nWhen Ok-soo leaves Bi Sool Chae in her grief, In-hwa becomes the Head Seamstress of Bi Sool Chae. But she continues to butt heads with the Master Artisan, who insists on preserving tradition, while In-hwa has a more modern attitude, and wants to incorporate machine-sewing and mass manufacturing and make a lot more money.\n\nWhen she encounters Do Bo-ri as an adult, who is really her daughter Eun-bi, she fails to recognize her. In fact, she considers Bo-ri vulgar and rude, and insults her for having a child out of wedlock.\n\nShe has a great deal in common with Min-jung, her adopted daughter, in their single-minded pursuit of a \u201cbetter\u201d life, and willingness to resort to treachery in order to achieve their goals.\n\n*[[Yang Mi-kyung]] as Song Ok-soo\n\nSong is the eldest daughter-in-law to the Master Artisan and widow to Heebong.  She has a kind and forgiving attitude, which is shown in her sewing style. When the competition for Head Seamstress was announced, she had originally planned to let In-hwa win, but discovered In-Hwa's true nature before the final test of the competition. \n\nWhen she gets her hands on the Yongbo needed to win the contest, In-Hwa had chased her down and causes them to get in an accident where her husband Hee-bong dies and Eun-bi is lost. She believes that she saw In-Hwa's car at the scene of the accident, but no one believes her. She then leaves Bi Seul Chae out of grief and ends up in JeungHueng for the next 15 years. \n\nShe doesn't recognize Bo-Ri when she meets her after all these years. Bo-Ri had then asked her to teach her the art of Hanbok making. \n\nAfter another five years, she comes back to Bi Seul Chae with the intent to expose In-Hwa's lies and to prove that Bo-Ri is Eun-bi. \n*[[Ahn Nae-sang]] as Jang Soo-bong\n\nJang is In-Hwa's husband and Bo-Ri's father. \n*[[Han Jin-hee]] as Lee Dong-hoo\n\nLee is the father of Jae-Hwa, Jae-Hee, and Ga-eul. He is very protective of Ga-eul. \n*[[Geum Bo-ra]] as Lee Hwa-yeon\n\nLee Hwa-yeon is the former mistress and wife of Lee Dong-Hoo and the mother of Jae-hee and Ga-eul. She wants the best for Jae-hee. \n*[[Woo Hee-jin]] as Lee Jung-ran\n*[[Han Seung-yeon]] as Lee Ga-eul\n*Jang Won-jong as Jang Hee-bong (cameo)\n*Hwang Young-hee as Do Hye-ok\n*[[Supernova (South Korean band)|Geonil]] as Kang Yoo-chun\n*[[Choi Dae-chul]] as Kang Nae-chun\n*Jeon In-chul as Park Jong-ha\n*[[Kim Ji-young (actress born 2005)|Kim Ji-young]] as Do Bi-dan\n*[[Sung Hyuk]] as Moon Ji-sang\nMoon Ji-sang lived together with his college girlfriend Min-jung. When his father lost his wealth, Min-jung cruelly dumped him. After discovering that she is pregnant, he tries to rekindle their relationship, promising to take care of her and their child no matter what. Min-jung gets him arrested as a stalker, and the shock of his arrest contributes to his father's death, whose funeral Ji-sang cannot attend due to his imprisonment. He also later learns that Min-jung abandoned their baby in an orphanage.\n\nDevastated by what Min-jung did to him, he becomes vengeful. He eventually becomes a trusted assistant to Lee Jae-hee and witnesses his romance with Min-jung. After getting into conflicts with Min-jung, Jae-hee fires him, but he is rehired as Jae-hee's father's assistant. Despite his earnest warnings about Min-jung's treacherous nature, Lee Jae-hee marries her anyway.\n\nJi-sang later meets Bi-dan and discovers that she is his daughter. He becomes grateful to Bo-ri for raising her with a lot of love.\n\n*[[Oh Seung-ah]] as Choi Yoo Ra\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Award\n! Category\n!

The Master Artisan of Bi Sool Chae, Kim Soo-Mi, focuses on preserving the traditions of Hanbok-making, including hand-dyeing and hand-sewing each garment.\n\nThe Master Artisan lives with her two married sons in her traditional Korean estate. Her two daughters-in-law have been her apprentices for a long time. When the time comes for the Artisan to choose her successor, the fierce competition between the two daughters-in-law results in tragedies that reverberate for decades afterwards.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n*[[Oh Yeon-seo]] as Jang Bo-ri (formerly Jang Eun-bi)\n**[[Yoo Eun-mi]] as young Bo-ri\nDaughter and only child of Bi Sool Chae's second son (Soo-bong) and his wife (In-hwa), Eun-bi is a kind-hearted girl with artistic talent. She is much-loved by her father, grandmother, aunt and uncle. She loves her mother very much, but is hurt because her mother spends too much time making hanbok instead of with her.\n\nWhen she is eight years old, Eun-bi gets into her mother's car and falls asleep in the back seat. Her mother, unaware that Eun-bi is in the back seat, pursues her sister-in-law Ok-soo in her car during a rainy night, and causes an accident which claims the life of her brother-in-law. After this accident, a frightened Eun-bi runs away, and her mother, not knowing she was there in the first place, drives off without her. \n\nWhile wandering the streets, she is subsequently hit by a truck that is driven by Do Hye-ok. Afraid that she will be prosecuted for hitting Eun-bi, Hye-ok takes an unconscious Eun-bi to a nearby inn. When Eun-bi wakes, she has lost her memory, and believes Hye-ok is her mother and Min-jung is her older sister. When a policeman questions her about the accident, Hye-ok is forced to pretend Eun-bi is her child. Since Eun-bi no longer remembers her own name, Hye-ok names her Bo-ri, which means \u201cbarley,\u201d because she was eating barley mixed rice at that moment.\n\nHye-ok does not send Bo-ri to school beyond Junior High, and puts her to work in her small restaurant in a rural town called Jang-heung, where Bo-ri continues to work for the next twenty years. Although mistreated by Hye-ok, who abuses her and treats her like a slave compared to her real daughter Min-jung, she remains affectionate and devoted to Hye-ok, believing her to be her real mother.\n\nBo-ri's compassion is further demonstrated by her selfless love for Min-jung's abandoned baby Bi-dan, who she believes is a foundling. Bi-dan was born premature and suffered hearing loss as a result. Bo-ri works tirelessly to earn enough money to pay for surgery to restore Bi-dan's hearing. She also never tells anyone that Bi-dan is not her biological daughter, even though many look down on her for having a baby as a single woman.\n\nAt some point, Bo-ri fatefully encounters her aunt, Ok-soo, the widow of Bi Sool Chae's oldest son who perished in that car accident. Although her aunt does not recognize her, she teaches Bo-ri the art of making hanbok, for which Bo-ri has a natural talent. Through her hanbok-making skills, Bo-ri ends up encountering her family members again.\n\n*[[Kim Ji-hoon (actor born 1981)|Kim Ji-hoon]] as Lee Jae-hwa\n**[[Jung Yun-seok]] as young Jae-hwa\nA childhood friend of Eun-bi, and nephew of Eun-bi's aunt Ok-soo. His mother died suddenly in a car accident when he was about 10 years old. He was also forced to accept a new stepmother, a brother (Jae-hee), and a baby sister very soon afterwards, as his father quickly marries his mistress of many years.\n\nInstead of working at his father's company, Jae-hwa becomes a prosecutor and ends up in Jang-heung where he meets Bo-ri. At first he has an antagonistic relationship with Bo-ri, but he later falls in love with her, accepting her and Bi-Dan with open arms. \n\n*[[Lee Yoo-ri]] as Yeon Min-jung\n**[[:ko:\uc2e0\uc218\uc5f0|Shin Soo-yeon]] as young Min-jung\nExtremely bitter about being raised by a poor single mother, Min-jung feels entitled to a better life with wealth and status, which she ruthlessly pursues.\n\nHer first meeting with Eun-bi was at the first Hanbok competition for Bi Sool Chae's successor in which she served as a model for Ok-soo's hanbok. Her win-at-any-cost attitude is demonstrated when she schemes with Jae-Hee to rig the competition.\n\nAfter Eun-bi comes to live with her and her mother and becomes Bo-ri, Min-jung purposefully copies Bo-ri's drawing, an evocative image of Bi Sool Chae's dye yard, and wins an art contest and a college scholarship sponsored by Bi Sool Chae. To further gain sympathy, she lies that she is an orphan, and forbids her mother from contacting her, or ever revealing their relationship. She eventually brown-noses her way into becoming adopted by Soo-bong and In-hwa, Eun-bi's real parents who still miss their lost daughter. Min-jung discovers that their lost daughter is in fact Bo-ri, who lived with her as her sister when they were young. She deliberately hides this from the Bi Sool Chae family, preventing them from finding Eun-bi, and effectively stealing Eun-bi's life.\n\nWhile in college, she pursues a relationship with Moon Ji-sang, who was the son of a wealthy businessman. When she learns that Ji-sang's father lost all his money, she cruelly dumps him. She then discovers that she is six months pregnant, and the doctor informs her that it is too late to terminate the pregnancy. After desperately hiding her pregnancy from her new parents, she secretly travels to her real mother's house in Jang-Heung and gives birth to a premature daughter, whom she promptly abandons. Although she told her mother to bring the baby to an orphanage, the baby is named Bi-dan (\u201cSilk\u201d) and raised by Bo-ri as her own.\n\nLee Jae-hee eventually falls in love with Min-jung and proposes marriage. Becoming the wife of a wealthy heir is Min-jung's dream come true. But as she is realizing her dreams, her past crimes continue to haunt her: stealing Eun-bi's life, abandoning her mother, abandoning her secret baby, and betraying Moon Ji-sang. He falls in love with Min-jung, and gets his company to sponsor her study abroad in the US. He eventually marries Min-jung, even as he is warned of her treacherous nature by her former boyfriend, Moon Ji-sang, who was once his trusted assistant. When he finally realizes who Min-Jung truly is, he is horrified that he let himself trust her.\n\n*[[Oh Chang-seok]] as Lee Jae-hee\n**[[:ko:\uc870\ud604\ub3c4|Jo Hyun-do]] as young Jae-hee\nLee is Jae-hwa's half-brother whose mother was their father's mistress for many years. Although as a child he was friendly with Jae-hwa, due to a misunderstanding, as an adult he envies Jae-hwa for being a potential threat to inheriting their father's business, and his inferiority complex causes him to behave in unscrupulous ways.\n\n=== Supporting characters ===\n*[[Kim Yong-rim]] as Park Soo-mi\n\nPark is the Master Artisan of renowned Hanbok house Bi Sool Chae. She is wealthy, respected, and her services are sought after for restoring royal garments and dressing the First Lady of Korea. She insists on preserving the traditional art of hanbok-making, painstakingly hand-dyeing and hand-sewing each garment. She has an incredible eye for detail, and is able to recognize the seamstress with one look of the garment.\n\nShe appreciates her older daughter-in-law Ok-soo, for constructing her hanboks with love and compassion for the wearer. Although her younger daughter-in-law In-hwa is a talented seamstress and designer, she recognizes that In-hwa has greed and malice in her heart, which is also reflected in the hanboks that she makes.\n\n*[[Kim Hye-ok]] as In-hwa\n\nOnce a very poor child, In-hwa stole a Bi Sool Chae hanbok in order to dress her mother's corpse at her funeral. The Master Artisan of Bi Sool Chae beat her for the theft, but allowed her to keep the hanbok. She told In-hwa that the hanbok was paid for with her beating, and that it is good that her mother was not going to the afterlife in stolen clothing.\n\nIn-hwa becomes enamored with the art of hanbok-making, and manipulates Soo-bong into marrying her by piercing the gas line under his bedroom floor with her sewing scissors, and causing him to nearly suffocate to death. After she saves his life, he feels compelled to marry her.\n\nWhen the Master Artisan says she will choose her successor, In-hwa becomes obsessed with being chosen, and ignores Eun-bi even more. While In-hwa is a very talented designer and seamstress, the Master Artisan has always favored the older daughter-in-law, Ok-soo, for her kind and loving nature, which was reflected in her sewing style. In addition, the Master Artisan suspects In-hwa of deliberately damaging the gas line and endangering Soo-bong's life after she discovers the sewing scissors that were broken when piercing the gas line.\n\nIn her desperation to be selected as the successor, In-hwa steals and burns a hanbok that Ok-soo was making. To win the competition, she relentlessly pursues a one-of-a-kind embroidery piece that was designed for Korean royalty. When she learns that Ok-soo obtained the embroidery, she chases Ok-soo and her husband Hee-bong in her car during a rainy night, and causes an accident in which Hee-bong dies and Eun-bi is lost. However, she lies and says that she was not at the scene of the accident. The Master Artisan and her husband believe her.\n\nWhen Ok-soo leaves Bi Sool Chae in her grief, In-hwa becomes the Head Seamstress of Bi Sool Chae. But she continues to butt heads with the Master Artisan, who insists on preserving tradition, while In-hwa has a more modern attitude, and wants to incorporate machine-sewing and mass manufacturing and make a lot more money.\n\nWhen she encounters Do Bo-ri as an adult, who is really her daughter Eun-bi, she fails to recognize her. In fact, she considers Bo-ri vulgar and rude, and insults her for having a child out of wedlock.\n\nShe has a great deal in common with Min-jung, her adopted daughter, in their single-minded pursuit of a \u201cbetter\u201d life, and willingness to resort to treachery in order to achieve their goals.\n\n*[[Yang Mi-kyung]] as Song Ok-soo\n\nSong is the eldest daughter-in-law to the Master Artisan and widow to Heebong.  She has a kind and forgiving attitude, which is shown in her sewing style. When the competition for Head Seamstress was announced, she had originally planned to let In-hwa win, but discovered In-Hwa's true nature before the final test of the competition. \n\nWhen she gets her hands on the Yongbo needed to win the contest, In-Hwa had chased her down and causes them to get in an accident where her husband Hee-bong dies and Eun-bi is lost. She believes that she saw In-Hwa's car at the scene of the accident, but no one believes her. She then leaves Bi Seul Chae out of grief and ends up in JeungHueng for the next 15 years. \n\nShe doesn't recognize Bo-Ri when she meets her after all these years. Bo-Ri had then asked her to teach her the art of Hanbok making. \n\nAfter another five years, she comes back to Bi Seul Chae with the intent to expose In-Hwa's lies and to prove that Bo-Ri is Eun-bi. \n*[[Ahn Nae-sang]] as Jang Soo-bong\n\nJang is In-Hwa's husband and Bo-Ri's father. \n*[[Han Jin-hee]] as Lee Dong-hoo\n\nLee is the father of Jae-Hwa, Jae-Hee, and Ga-eul. He is very protective of Ga-eul. \n*[[Geum Bo-ra]] as Lee Hwa-yeon\n\nLee Hwa-yeon is the former mistress and wife of Lee Dong-Hoo and the mother of Jae-hee and Ga-eul. She wants the best for Jae-hee. \n*[[Woo Hee-jin]] as Lee Jung-ran\n*[[Han Seung-yeon]] as Lee Ga-eul\n*Jang Won-jong as Jang Hee-bong (cameo)\n*Hwang Young-hee as Do Hye-ok\n*[[Supernova (South Korean band)|Geonil]] as Kang Yoo-chun\n*[[Choi Dae-chul]] as Kang Nae-chun\n*Jeon In-chul as Park Jong-ha\n*[[Kim Ji-young (actress born 2005)|Kim Ji-young]] as Do Bi-dan\n*[[Sung Hyuk]] as Moon Ji-sang\nMoon Ji-sang lived together with his college girlfriend Min-jung. When his father lost his wealth, Min-jung cruelly dumped him. After discovering that she is pregnant, he tries to rekindle their relationship, promising to take care of her and their child no matter what. Min-jung gets him arrested as a stalker, and the shock of his arrest contributes to his father's death, whose funeral Ji-sang cannot attend due to his imprisonment. He also later learns that Min-jung abandoned their baby in an orphanage.\n\nDevastated by what Min-jung did to him, he becomes vengeful. He eventually becomes a trusted assistant to Lee Jae-hee and witnesses his romance with Min-jung. After getting into conflicts with Min-jung, Jae-hee fires him, but he is rehired as Jae-hee's father's assistant. Despite his earnest warnings about Min-jung's treacherous nature, Lee Jae-hee marries her anyway.\n\nJi-sang later meets Bi-dan and discovers that she is his daughter. He becomes grateful to Bo-ri for raising her with a lot of love.\n\n*[[Oh Seung-ah]] as Choi Yoo Ra\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Award\n! Category\n!
