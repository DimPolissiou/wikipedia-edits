Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually dispersed through the corps of the army with two of the regiments, 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana being assigned to the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually dispersed through the corps of the army with two of the regiments, 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana being assigned to the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

The show was later renamed ''[[Seinfeld]]'' to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom ''The Marshall Chronicles''. By its third season, it had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-run.\n\nAlong with Seinfeld, the show starred ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veteran [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and experienced actors [[Michael Richards]] and [[Jason Alexander]].

In the \"Seinfeld Season 6\" DVD set, commenting on the episode \"[[The Gymnast]]\", Seinfeld cited [[Jean Shepherd]] as an influence, saying, \"He really formed my entire comedic sensibility\u2014I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.\" From 2004 to 2007, the former ''Seinfeld'' cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show.\n\n===Post-''Seinfeld''===\nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to [[New York City]] to make a comeback with his [[stand-up comedy]] rather than stay in [[Los Angeles]] and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan \"[[Think different]]\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut.

The show was later renamed ''[[Seinfeld]]'' to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom ''The Marshall Chronicles''. By its third season, it had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-run.\n\nAlong with Seinfeld, the show starred ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veteran [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and experienced actors [[Michael Richards]] and [[Jason Alexander]].

In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan \"[[Think different]]\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut.

RNAP [[helicase|locally opens]] the double-stranded [[DNA]] (usually about four turns of the double helix) so that one strand of the exposed [[nucleotide]]s can be used as a template for the synthesis of [[RNA]], a process called [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. A [[transcription factor]] and its associated transcription [[mediator complex]] must be attached to a [[DNA binding site]] called a [[promoter region]] before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position. RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription, it also guides the nucleotides into position, facilitates attachment and elongation, has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities, and termination recognition capability. In [[eukaryote]]s, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides.\n\nRNAP produces RNA that functionally is either [[Coding strand|coding]] (for protein) ([[messenger RNA]]) (mRNA); or [[non-coding]]: so-called \"RNA genes\". At least four functional types of RNA genes exist: \n# [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) \u2014 transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]];\n# [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) \u2014 incorporates into [[ribosome]]s;\n# [[micro RNA]] (miRNA) \u2014 regulates gene activity; and, \n# [[catalytic RNA]] ([[ribozyme]]) \u2014 functions as an enzymatically active RNA molecule.\n\nRNA polymerase is essential to life, and is found in all living organisms and many viruses. Depending on the organism, a RNA polymerase can be a [[protein complex]] (multi-subunit RNAP) or only consist of one subunit (single-subunit RNAP, ssRNAP), each representing an independent lineage. The former is found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes alike, sharing a similar core structure and mechanism.<ref name=\"pmid21233849\"/> The latter is found in phages as well as eukaryotic [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]], and is related to modern [[DNA polymerase]]s.<ref name=\"pmid9419244\"/> Eukaryotic and archaeal RNAPs have more subunits than bacterial ones do, and are controlled differently.\n\nBacteria and archaea only have one RNA polymerase. Eukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA. [[RNA polymerase I]] synthesizes a pre-[[rRNA]] 45[[Svedberg|S]] (35S in [[yeast]]), which matures and will form the major RNA sections of the ribosome. [[RNA polymerase II]] synthesizes precursors of mRNAs and most [[snRNA]] and microRNAs. [[RNA polymerase III]] synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S and other [[small RNA]]s found in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytosol]]. [[RNA polymerase IV]] and [[RNA polymerase V|V]] found in plants are less-understood; they make [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]]. In addition to the ssRNAPs, chloroplasts also encode and use a bacteria-like RNAP.\n\n== Structure ==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Bacterial RNA-polymerase structure 1HQM.png\n|caption1=''T. aquaticus'' RNA polymerase core (PDB 1HQM).\n|image2=Eukaryotic RNA-polymerase II structure 1WCM.png\n|caption2=Yeast RNA polymerase II core (PDB 1WCM).\n|footer=Homologous subunits are colored the same:<ref name=\"pmid21233849\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Werner F, Grohmann D | title = Evolution of multisubunit RNA polymerases in the three domains of life | journal = Nature Reviews.

RNA polymerase \"core\" from [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] consists of five subunits: two alpha (\u03b1) subunits of 36&nbsp;[[kilodalton|kDa]], a beta (\u03b2) subunit of 150&nbsp;kDa, a beta prime subunit (\u03b2\u2032) of 155&nbsp;kDa, and a small omega (\u03c9) subunit. A sigma (\u03c3) factor binds to the core, forming the holoenzyme.

Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated. In ''Escherichia coli'' bacteria, more than 100 [[transcription factor]]s have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishihama A | title = Functional modulation of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 54 | pages = 499\u2013518 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11018136 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.54.1.499 }}</ref>\n\nRNAP can initiate transcription at specific DNA sequences known as [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s. It then produces an RNA chain, which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template DNA strand. The process of adding [[nucleotide]]s to the RNA strand is known as elongation; in eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million [[nucleotides]] (the full length of the [[dystrophin]] gene). RNAP will preferentially release its RNA transcript at specific DNA sequences encoded at the end of genes, which are known as [[Terminator (genetics)|terminators]].\n\nProducts of RNAP include:\n*[[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA)\u2014template for the [[Translation (biology)|synthesis of proteins]] by [[ribosome]]s.\n*[[Non-coding RNA]] or \"RNA genes\"\u2014a broad class of genes that encode RNA that is not translated into protein. The most prominent examples of RNA genes are [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]. However, since the late 1990s, many new RNA genes have been found, and thus RNA genes may play a much more significant role than previously thought.\n**[[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA)\u2014transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]]\n**[[Ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA)\u2014a component of ribosomes\n**[[Micro RNA]]\u2014regulates gene activity\n**Catalytic RNA ([[Ribozyme]])\u2014enzymatically active RNA molecules\n\nRNAP accomplishes [[de novo synthesis|''de novo'' synthesis]]. It is able to do this because specific interactions with the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to [[DNA polymerase]], RNAP includes [[helicase]] activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.\n\n==Action==\n{{see also|Transcription (biology)#Major steps}}\n\n=== Initiation ===\nRNA polymerase binding in bacteria involves the [[sigma factor]] recognizing the core promoter region containing the \u221235 and \u221210 elements (located ''before'' the beginning of sequence to be transcribed) and also, at some promoters, the \u03b1 subunit C-terminal domain recognizing promoter upstream elements.<ref>{{InterPro|IPR011260}}</ref> There are multiple interchangeable sigma factors, each of which recognizes a distinct set of promoters.  For example, in ''E. coli'', \u03c3<sup>70</sup> is expressed under normal conditions and recognizes promoters for genes required under normal conditions (\"[[housekeeping gene]]s\"), while \u03c3<sup>32</sup> recognizes promoters for genes required at high temperatures (\"[[heat shock protein|heat-shock genes]]\"). In archaea and eukaryotes, the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple [[general transcription factor]]s that work together. The RNA polymerase-promoter closed complex is usually referred to as the \"[[transcription preinitiation complex]].\"<ref name=\"Roeder1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Roeder|first1=Robert G.|title=The complexities of eukaryotic transcription initiation: regulation of preinitiation complex assembly|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|volume=16|issue=11|year=1991|pages=402\u2013408|issn=0968-0004|doi=10.1016/0968-0004(91)90164-Q|pmid=1776168}}</ref><ref name=\"MBOG\">{{cite book |vauthors=Watson JD, Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann AA, Levine M, Losick RM | title=Molecular Biology of the Gene | publisher=Pearson | edition=7th | year=2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter binding to the DNA, the RNA polymerase switches from a closed complex to an open complex.  This change involves the separation of the DNA strands to form an unwound section of DNA of approximately 13 bp, referred to as the \"[[transcription bubble]]\".  [[Supercoiling]] plays an important part in polymerase activity because of the unwinding and rewinding of DNA.  Because regions of DNA in front of RNAP are unwound, there are compensatory positive supercoils.  Regions behind RNAP are rewound and negative supercoils are present.<ref name=\"MBOG\"/>\n\n=== Promoter escape ===\nRNA polymerase then starts to synthesize the initial DNA-RNA heteroduplex, with ribonucleotides base-paired to the template DNA strand according to Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions.  As noted above, RNA polymerase makes contacts with the promoter region. However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. In order to continue RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must escape the promoter. It must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [[DNA scrunching|\"scrunching\"]] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Revyakin A, Liu C, Ebright RH, Strick TR | title = Abortive initiation and productive initiation by RNA polymerase involve DNA scrunching | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5802 | pages = 1139\u201343 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17110577 | pmc = 2754787 | doi = 10.1126/science.1131398 | bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1139R }}</ref> During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a \"stressed intermediate.\"  Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough (~10 bp), RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. The heteroduplex at the active center stabilizes the elongation complex.\n\nHowever, promoter escape is not the only outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription.  The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [[Abortive initiation]], the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition, results in short RNA fragments of around 9 bp in a process known as abortive transcription. The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman SR, Ebright RH, Nickels BE | title = Direct detection of abortive RNA transcripts in vivo | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5929 | pages = 927\u20138 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19443781 | pmc = 2718712 | doi = 10.1126/science.1169237 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324..927G | authorlink2 = Richard H.

Transcribing the region causes the formation of a \"hairpin\" structure from the RNA transcription looping and binding upon itself.

As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid.  These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.\n\nTranscription termination in eukaryotes is less well understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3' end, in a process called [[polyadenylation]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykke-Andersen S, Jensen TH | title = Overlapping pathways dictate termination of RNA polymerase II transcription | journal = Biochimie | volume = 89 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177\u201382 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17629387 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2007.05.007 }}</ref>\n\n==Other organisms==\nGiven that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related.

RNAP [[helicase|locally opens]] the double-stranded [[DNA]] (usually about four turns of the double helix) so that one strand of the exposed [[nucleotide]]s can be used as a template for the synthesis of [[RNA]], a process called [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. A [[transcription factor]] and its associated transcription [[mediator complex]] must be attached to a [[DNA binding site]] called a [[promoter region]] before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position. RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription, it also guides the nucleotides into position, facilitates attachment and elongation, has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities, and termination recognition capability. In [[eukaryote]]s, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides.\n\nRNAP produces RNA that functionally is either [[Coding strand|coding]] (for protein) ([[messenger RNA]]) (mRNA); or [[non-coding]]: so-called \"RNA genes\". At least four functional types of RNA genes exist: \n# [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) \u2014 transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]];\n# [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) \u2014 incorporates into [[ribosome]]s;\n# [[micro RNA]] (miRNA) \u2014 regulates gene activity; and, \n# [[catalytic RNA]] ([[ribozyme]]) \u2014 functions as an enzymatically active RNA molecule.\n\nRNA polymerase is essential to life, and is found in all living organisms and many viruses. Depending on the organism, a RNA polymerase can be a [[protein complex]] (multi-subunit RNAP) or only consist of one subunit (single-subunit RNAP, ssRNAP), each representing an independent lineage. The former is found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes alike, sharing a similar core structure and mechanism.<ref name=\"pmid21233849\"/> The latter is found in phages as well as eukaryotic [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]], and is related to modern [[DNA polymerase]]s.<ref name=\"pmid9419244\"/> Eukaryotic and archaeal RNAPs have more subunits than bacterial ones do, and are controlled differently.\n\nBacteria and archaea only have one RNA polymerase. Eukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA. [[RNA polymerase I]] synthesizes a pre-[[rRNA]] 45[[Svedberg|S]] (35S in [[yeast]]), which matures and will form the major RNA sections of the ribosome. [[RNA polymerase II]] synthesizes precursors of mRNAs and most [[snRNA]] and microRNAs. [[RNA polymerase III]] synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S and other [[small RNA]]s found in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytosol]]. [[RNA polymerase IV]] and [[RNA polymerase V|V]] found in plants are less-understood; they make [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]]. In addition to the ssRNAPs, chloroplasts also encode and use a bacteria-like RNAP.\n\n== Structure ==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Bacterial RNA-polymerase structure 1HQM.png\n|caption1=''T. aquaticus'' RNA polymerase core (PDB 1HQM).\n|image2=Eukaryotic RNA-polymerase II structure 1WCM.png\n|caption2=Yeast RNA polymerase II core (PDB 1WCM).\n|footer=Homologous subunits are colored the same:<ref name=\"pmid21233849\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Werner F, Grohmann D | title = Evolution of multisubunit RNA polymerases in the three domains of life | journal = Nature Reviews.

Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated.

It then produces an RNA chain, which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template DNA strand. The process of adding [[nucleotide]]s to the RNA strand is known as elongation; in eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million [[nucleotides]] (the full length of the [[dystrophin]] gene). RNAP will preferentially release its RNA transcript at specific DNA sequences encoded at the end of genes, which are known as [[Terminator (genetics)|terminators]].\n\nProducts of RNAP include:\n*[[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA)\u2014template for the [[Translation (biology)|synthesis of proteins]] by [[ribosome]]s.\n*[[Non-coding RNA]] or \"RNA genes\"\u2014a broad class of genes that encode RNA that is not translated into protein. The most prominent examples of RNA genes are [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]. However, since the late 1990s, many new RNA genes have been found, and thus RNA genes may play a much more significant role than previously thought.\n**[[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA)\u2014transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]]\n**[[Ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA)\u2014a component of ribosomes\n**[[Micro RNA]]\u2014regulates gene activity\n**Catalytic RNA ([[Ribozyme]])\u2014enzymatically active RNA molecules\n\nRNAP accomplishes [[de novo synthesis|''de novo'' synthesis]]. It is able to do this because specific interactions with the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to [[DNA polymerase]], RNAP includes [[helicase]] activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.\n\n==Action==\n{{see also|Transcription (biology)#Major steps}}\n\n=== Initiation ===\nRNA polymerase binding in bacteria involves the [[sigma factor]] recognizing the core promoter region containing the \u221235 and \u221210 elements (located ''before'' the beginning of sequence to be transcribed) and also, at some promoters, the \u03b1 subunit C-terminal domain recognizing promoter upstream elements.<ref>{{InterPro|IPR011260}}</ref> There are multiple interchangeable sigma factors, each of which recognizes a distinct set of promoters.  For example, in ''E. coli'', \u03c3<sup>70</sup> is expressed under normal conditions and recognizes promoters for genes required under normal conditions (\"[[housekeeping gene]]s\"), while \u03c3<sup>32</sup> recognizes promoters for genes required at high temperatures (\"[[heat shock protein|heat-shock genes]]\"). In archaea and eukaryotes, the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple [[general transcription factor]]s that work together. The RNA polymerase-promoter closed complex is usually referred to as the \"[[transcription preinitiation complex]].\"<ref name=\"Roeder1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Roeder|first1=Robert G.|title=The complexities of eukaryotic transcription initiation: regulation of preinitiation complex assembly|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|volume=16|issue=11|year=1991|pages=402\u2013408|issn=0968-0004|doi=10.1016/0968-0004(91)90164-Q|pmid=1776168}}</ref><ref name=\"MBOG\">{{cite book |vauthors=Watson JD, Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann AA, Levine M, Losick RM | title=Molecular Biology of the Gene | publisher=Pearson | edition=7th | year=2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter binding to the DNA, the RNA polymerase switches from a closed complex to an open complex.  This change involves the separation of the DNA strands to form an unwound section of DNA of approximately 13 bp, referred to as the \"[[transcription bubble]]\".  [[Supercoiling]] plays an important part in polymerase activity because of the unwinding and rewinding of DNA.  Because regions of DNA in front of RNAP are unwound, there are compensatory positive supercoils.  Regions behind RNAP are rewound and negative supercoils are present.<ref name=\"MBOG\"/>\n\n=== Promoter escape ===\nRNA polymerase then starts to synthesize the initial DNA-RNA heteroduplex, with ribonucleotides base-paired to the template DNA strand according to Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions.  As noted above, RNA polymerase makes contacts with the promoter region. However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. In order to continue RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must escape the promoter. It must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [[DNA scrunching|\"scrunching\"]] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Revyakin A, Liu C, Ebright RH, Strick TR | title = Abortive initiation and productive initiation by RNA polymerase involve DNA scrunching | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5802 | pages = 1139\u201343 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17110577 | pmc = 2754787 | doi = 10.1126/science.1131398 | bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1139R }}</ref> During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a \"stressed intermediate.\"  Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough (~10 bp), RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. The heteroduplex at the active center stabilizes the elongation complex.\n\nHowever, promoter escape is not the only outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription.  The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [[Abortive initiation]], the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition, results in short RNA fragments of around 9 bp in a process known as abortive transcription. The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman SR, Ebright RH, Nickels BE | title = Direct detection of abortive RNA transcripts in vivo | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5929 | pages = 927\u20138 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19443781 | pmc = 2718712 | doi = 10.1126/science.1169237 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324..927G | authorlink2 = Richard H.

In the RNA polymerase this occurs at the same active site used for polymerization and is therefore markedly different from the DNA polymerase where proofreading occurs at a distinct nuclease active site.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sydow JF, Cramer P | title = RNA polymerase fidelity and transcriptional proofreading | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 732\u20139 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19914059 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2009.10.009 | url = http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1940413/component/escidoc:1940417/1940413.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe overall error rate is around 10<sup>\u22124</sup> to 10<sup>\u22126</sup>.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Philips |first1=Rob |last2=Milo |first2=Ron | name-list-format = vanc |title=What is the error rate in transcription and translation? |url=http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-the-error-rate-in-transcription-and-translation/ |access-date=26 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Termination===\n{{main|Terminator (genetics)}}\nIn bacteria, termination of RNA transcription can be rho-dependent or rho-independent.

Transcribing the region causes the formation of a \"hairpin\" structure from the RNA transcription looping and binding upon itself.  This hairpin structure is often rich in G-C base-pairs, making it more stable than the DNA-RNA hybrid itself.  As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid.  These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.\n\nTranscription termination in eukaryotes is less well understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3' end, in a process called [[polyadenylation]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykke-Andersen S, Jensen TH | title = Overlapping pathways dictate termination of RNA polymerase II transcription | journal = Biochimie | volume = 89 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177\u201382 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17629387 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2007.05.007 }}</ref>\n\n==Other organisms==\nGiven that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related.

In the film, she plays a young pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] who falls in love with the hero, [[Solomon Perel]], not knowing that he is Jewish.

Her mother was also known for having signed the 1971 ''[[Manifesto of the 343|Manifesto of the 343 Bitches]]'', which was signed by women advocating for reproductive rights and admitting to having had an abortion when abortions were illegal in France. In Delpy's 2007 film ''[[2 Days in Paris]]'', her character's mother was played by her real mother and acknowledges signing the manifesto, mirroring her action in real life. Pillet died in 2009.\n\nAt an early age, Julie was exposed to the arts by her parents. She later said:\n\n{{quote|I couldn't hope for better parents. They really raised me with a love of art, bringing me to museums and seeing things that a child wouldn't see at that age. I would see [[Ingmar Bergman]] movies when I was 9 and totally go for it.

In the film, she plays a young pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] who falls in love with the hero, [[Solomon Perel]], not knowing that he is Jewish.

By that year many Iranian restaurants and businesses were established in a portion of [[Westwood Boulevard]] south of [[Wilshire Boulevard]].<ref name=Mitchellp1/>\n\nJews have increasingly settled within the city of Los Angeles in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and in the Conejo Valley city of [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]].\n\nWhen Jews settled in Los Angeles, they were originally located in the Downtown area. Industrial expansion in the Downtown area pushed the Jews to [[Eastside Los Angeles]], where The Los Angeles Jewish community formed in the years 1910\u20131920. The Brooklyn Avenue-[[Boyle Heights]] area, the Temple Street area, and the Central Avenue area were the settlement points of Jews in that period.<ref name=Romop95/>\n\nIn the 1920s the Jewish population saw Boyle Heights as the heart of the Jewish community. In 1908 Boyle Heights had 3 Jewish families. In 1920 there were 1,842 Jewish families there.  In the mid-1920s about 33% of all of the Jews in Los Angeles lived in Boyle Heights. By 1930 almost 10,000 Jewish families lived in Boyle Heights.<ref name=Romop95/>\n\nSince 1953, every representative of the [[Los Angeles City Council|City Council]]'s [[Los Angeles City Council District 5|5th District]] has been Jewish.\n\n==Media==\n===Film===\n{{See also|List of Jewish American businesspeople in media#Television, film and video}}\n\nJews played a major role in creating the film industry in [[Hollywood]] during the first half of the 20th Century. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros.]] were all started and led by Jews, almost all of them recent or children of immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe. In his book ''[[An Empire of Their Own]]'', [[Neal Gabler]] wrote that in the [[movie industry#United States|movie industry]], there \"were none of the impediments imposed by loftier professions and more entrenched businesses to keep Jews and other undesirables out.\" Gabler also argued that because of discrimination in a predominately [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] America due to their Jewishness, \"the Jews could simply create new a country--an empire of their own, so to speak . . . an America where fathers were strong, families stable, people attractive, resilient, resourceful, and decent.\" The 20th Century [[American Dream]] was to a considerable degree depicted and defined by Hollywood.<ref name=\"DWAD\">[http://newsreel.org/guides/blacksan.htm BLACKS & JEWS]</ref>\n\nVery quickly, Protestants attacked the movie industry as a Jewish conspiracy to undermine \"Christian\" and \"American\" morals, especially in a period of large-scale immigration from southern and eastern Europe. Such beliefs in Jewish control, power, and conspiracy are traditional elements of anti-Semitic thinking. The role of these \"Hollywood Jews\" has been debated for years, but one thing is agreed on: most of them avoided identifying themselves as Jews at all, since their major desire was to assimilate and be accepted by the non-Jewish white establishment. Some African Americans, angered by negative images of blacks in movies and by the small number of major black directors and producers from the 1910s to 1960s, raised charges that Jews in Hollywood were both stereotyping and also unfairly excluding blacks. Hollywood leaders responded that there was no conspiracy controlling Hollywood and that Jews in the industry had been leading supporters of liberal causes, including civil rights and the expansion of black participation in the industry.<ref name=\"DWAD\"/>\n\nIn more recent times, the role of Jews in Hollywood has become less central, but individual Jews are still leaders in the industry.<ref name=\"DWAD\"/>\n\n===Newspaper===\n''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'' is a local Jewish newspaper.

Industrial expansion in the Downtown area pushed the Jews to [[Eastside Los Angeles]], where The Los Angeles Jewish community formed in the years 1910\u20131920. The Brooklyn Avenue-[[Boyle Heights]] area, the Temple Street area, and the Central Avenue area were the settlement points of Jews in that period.<ref name=Romop95/>\n\nIn the 1920s the Jewish population saw Boyle Heights as the heart of the Jewish community.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros.]] were all started and led by Jews, almost all of them recent or children of immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe. In his book ''[[An Empire of Their Own]]'', [[Neal Gabler]] wrote that in the [[movie industry#United States|movie industry]], there \"were none of the impediments imposed by loftier professions and more entrenched businesses to keep Jews and other undesirables out.\" Gabler also argued that because of discrimination in a predominately [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] America due to their Jewishness, \"the Jews could simply create new a country--an empire of their own, so to speak . . . an America where fathers were strong, families stable, people attractive, resilient, resourceful, and decent.\" The 20th Century [[American Dream]] was to a considerable degree depicted and defined by Hollywood.<ref name=\"DWAD\">[http://newsreel.org/guides/blacksan.htm BLACKS & JEWS]</ref>\n\nVery quickly, Protestants attacked the movie industry as a Jewish conspiracy to undermine \"Christian\" and \"American\" morals, especially in a period of large-scale immigration from southern and eastern Europe. Such beliefs in Jewish control, power, and conspiracy are traditional elements of anti-Semitic thinking. The role of these \"Hollywood Jews\" has been debated for years, but one thing is agreed on: most of them avoided identifying themselves as Jews at all, since their major desire was to assimilate and be accepted by the non-Jewish white establishment. Some African Americans, angered by negative images of blacks in movies and by the small number of major black directors and producers from the 1910s to 1960s, raised charges that Jews in Hollywood were both stereotyping and also unfairly excluding blacks. Hollywood leaders responded that there was no conspiracy controlling Hollywood and that Jews in the industry had been leading supporters of liberal causes, including civil rights and the expansion of black participation in the industry.<ref name=\"DWAD\"/>\n\nIn more recent times, the role of Jews in Hollywood has become less central, but individual Jews are still leaders in the industry.<ref name=\"DWAD\"/>\n\n===Newspaper===\n''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'' is a local Jewish newspaper.
