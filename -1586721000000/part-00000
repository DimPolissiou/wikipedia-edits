On one such instance, Muhammad's \"announcement of a revelation permitting him to enter into marriages disallowed to other men drew from her [Aisha] the retort, 'It seems to me your Lord hastens to satisfy your desire!'\"<ref name=ahmed5152>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1992|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> Furthermore, Muhammad and Aisha had a strong intellectual relationship.<ref>{{harvnb|Mernissi|1988|p=104}}</ref> Muhammad valued her keen memory and intelligence and so instructed his companions to draw some of their religious practices from her.<ref>{{harvnb|Mernissi|1988|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ramadan|2007|p=121}}</ref>\n\nAisha was jealous of [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]] who was the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, saying, \"I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija though I did not see her, but the Prophet used to mention her very often, and when ever he slaughtered a sheep, he would cut its parts and send them to the women friends of Khadija.

As the story goes, Aisha left her ''[[howdah]]'' in order to search for a missing necklace. Her slaves mounted the ''howdah'' and prepared it for travel without noticing any difference in weight without Aisha's presence. Hence the caravan accidentally departed without her. She remained at the camp until the next morning, when [[Safwan ibn Muattal|Safwan ibn al-Mu\u2018attal]], a nomad and member of Muhammad's army, found her and brought her back to Muhammad at the army's next camp. Rumours that Aisha and Safwan had committed adultery were spread, particularly by [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], [[Hassan ibn Thabit]], Mistah ibn Uthatha and [[Hammanah bint Jahsh]] (sister of [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]], another of Muhammad's wives). [[Usama ibn Zayd]], son of [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], defended Aisha's reputation; while [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] advised \"Women are plentiful, and you can easily change one for another.\" Muhammad came to speak directly with Aisha about the rumours. He was still sitting in her house when he announced that he had received a revelation from [[God in Islam|God]] confirming Aisha's innocence. Surah 24 details the Islamic laws and punishment regarding [[Zina|adultery]] and slander. Aisha's accusers were subjected to punishments of 80 lashes.<ref>The story is told multiple times in the early traditions, nearly all of the versions being ultimately derived from Aisha's own account. Typical examples can be found in {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|462}}, {{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|37|6673}} and {{harvnb|Guillaume|1955|pp=494\u2013499}}.</ref>\n\n===Story of the honey===\nAfter the daily ''[[Asr prayer|Asr]]'' prayer, Muhammad would visit each of his wives' apartments to inquire about their well-being. Muhammad was just in the amount of time he spent with them and attention he gave to them.<ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.islamswomen.com/articles/zaynab_bint_jahsh.php |title=Great Women of Islam \u2013 Zaynab bint Jahsh |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015004735/http://islamswomen.com/articles/zaynab_bint_jahsh.php |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Once, Muhammad's fifth wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, received some honey from a relative which Muhammad took a particular liking to. As a result, every time Zaynab offered some of this honey to him he would spend a longer time in her apartment. This did not sit well with Aisha and [[Hafsa bint Umar]].\n{{Quote|Hafsa and I decided that when the Prophet entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"...\"But I have drunk honey.\" Hisham said: It also meant his saying, \"I will not drink anymore, and I have taken an oath, so do not inform anybody of that'|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]<ref>{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|8|78|682}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon after this event, Muhammad reported that he had received a revelation in which he was told that he could eat anything permitted by God. Some Sunni commentators on the Qur'an sometimes give this story as the \"occasion of revelation\" for [[At-Tahrim]], which opens with the following verses: {{Quote|O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which [[Allah]] has made lawful to thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<br>Allah has already ordained for you, (O men), the dissolution of your oaths (in some cases): and Allah is your Protector, and He is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.|Qur'an, surah 66 (At-Tahrim), [[ayah|ayat]] 1\u20132<ref>{{Cite quran|66|1|e=2|s=ns}}</ref>}} Word spread to the small [[Ummah|Muslim community]] that Muhammad's wives were speaking sharply to him and conspiring against him. Muhammad, saddened and upset, separated from his wives for a month. \u2018Umar, Hafsa's father, scolded his daughter and also spoke to Muhammad of the matter. By the end of this time, his wives were humbled; they agreed to \"speak correct and courteous words\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ibn Sa'd|1995|pp=132\u2013133}}</ref> and to focus on the [[afterlife]].<ref>{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|43|648}}</ref>\n\n===Death of Muhammad===\nAisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life. When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next. They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there. He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his most beloved wife.<ref name=ahmed58>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1992|p=58}}</ref><ref name=abbott69>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=69}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lings|1983|p=339}}</ref><ref name=\"Haykal\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1976|pp=502\u2013503}}</ref><ref name=\"Guillaume\">{{harvnb|Guillaume|1955|p=679 and 682}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nAfter Muhammad's death, which ended Aisha and Muhammad's 14-year-long marriage, Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning and acquiring knowledge of the Quran and the ''[[sunnah]]'' of Muhammad. Aisha was one of three wives (the other two being Hafsa bint Umar and [[Umm Salama]]) who memorized the Qur'an. Like Hafsa, Aisha had her own script of the Quran written after Muhammad's death.<ref name=\"jannah.org\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.jannah.org/sisters/aishah.html |title=Aishah bint Abu Bakr |publisher=Jannah.org |accessdate=2013-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000817/http://www.jannah.org/sisters/aishah.html |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> During Aisha's life many prominent customs of Islam, such as [[veil]]ing of women, began.\n\nAisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam.<ref name=\"Elsadda\" /> Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, and \u2018Uthman. During a time in Islam when women were not expected, or wanted, to contribute outside the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad.<ref name=ahmed51 />{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Role during caliphate===\n\n====Role during first and second caliphates====\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph. This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr.<ref>{{harvnb|Spellberg|Aghaie|pp=42\u201347}}</ref> Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as father-in-law. As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority.<ref name=spellberg45>{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|pp=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAisha garnered more special privilege in the Islamic community for being known as both a wife of Muhammad and the daughter of the first caliph. Being the daughter of Abu Bakr tied Aisha to honorable titles earned from her father's strong dedication to Islam. For example, she was given the title of ''al-siddiqa bint al-siddiq'', meaning 'the truthful woman, daughter of the truthful man',<ref name=spellberg40 /> a reference to Abu Bakr's support of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]].<ref>{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|p=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 634 Abu Bakr fell sick and was unable to recover. Prior to his death, he appointed \u2018Umar, one of his chief advisers, as the second caliph.<ref name=spellberg40 /> Throughout \u2018Umar's time in power Aisha continued to play the role of a consultant in political matters.<ref name=spellberg40 />\n\n====Role during the third caliphate====\nAfter \u2018Umar died, \u2018Uthm\u0101n was chosen to be the third caliph. He wanted to promote the interests of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. Aisha had little involvement with \u2018Uthm\u0101n for the first couple years, but eventually she found a way into the politics of his reign. She eventually grew to despise \u2018Uthm\u0101n, and many are unsure of what specifically triggered her eventual opposition towards him. A prominent opposition that arose towards him was when \u2018Uthm\u0101n mistreated \u2018[[Ammar ibn Yasir]] (companion of Muhammad) by beating him. Aisha became enraged and spoke out publicly, saying, \"How soon indeed you have forgotten the practice (sunnah) of your prophet and these, his hairs, a shirt, and sandal have not yet perished!\".<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=108}}</ref>\n\nAs time continued issues of antipathy towards \u2018Uthm\u0101n continued to arise. Another instance of opposition arose when the people came to Aisha, after Uthm\u0101n ignored the rightful punishment for Walid idn Uqbah (Uthm\u0101n's brother). Aisha and Uthm\u0101n argued with each other, Uthm\u0101n eventually made a comment on why Aisha had come and how she was \"ordered to stay at home\".<ref name= abbott111>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=111}}</ref> Arising from this comment, was the question of whether Aisha, and for that matter women, still had the ability to be involved in public affairs. The Muslim community became split: \"some sided with Uthm\u0101n, but others demanded to know who indeed had better right than Aisha in such matters\".<ref name= abbott111/>\n\nThe caliphate took a turn for the worse when [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] was governed by [[Abdullah ibn Saad]]. Abbott reports that [[Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa]] of Egypt, an opponent of \u2018Uthm\u0101n, forged letters in the Mothers of the Believers' names to the conspirators against \u2018Uthm\u0101n. The people cut off \u2018Uthm\u0101n's water and food supply. When Aisha realized the behavior of the crowd, Abbott notes, Aisha could not believe the crowd \"would offer such indignities to a widow of Mohammad\".<ref name= abbott122>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=122}}</ref> This refers to when [[Safiyya bint Huyayy]] (one of Muhammad's wives) tried to help \u2018Uthm\u0101n and was taken by the crowd. [[Malik al-Ashtar]] then approached her about killing Uthm\u0101n and the letter, and she claimed she would never want to \"command the shedding of the blood of the Muslims and the killing of their [[Imam|Im\u0101m]]\";<ref name= abbott122/> she also claimed she did not write the letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=123}}</ref> The city continued to oppose \u2018Uthm\u0101n, but as for Aisha, her journey to Mecca was approaching. With the journey to Mecca approaching at this time, she wanted to rid herself of the situation. \u2018Uthm\u0101n heard of her not wanting to hurt him, and he asked her to stay because of her influence on the people, but this did not persuade Aisha, and she continued on her journey.<ref name=\"Nabia\" />\n\n===First Fitna===\n{{Main|Battle of the Camel}}\n[[File:First Fitna map blank.svg|thumb|350px|Domains of [[Rashidun Caliphate]] under [[Rashidun|four caliphs]].

The first to respond to Aisha was Abdullah ibn Aamar al-Hadhrami, the governor of Mecca during the reign of Uthman, and prominent members of the [[Banu Umayya]]. With the funds from the \"Yemeni Treasury\" Aisha set out on a campaign against the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nAisha, along with an army including [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam]] and [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubayd-Allah]], confronted Ali's army, demanding the prosecution of Uthman's killers who had mingled with his army outside the city of [[Basra]].

This was of great importance to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of the [[succession to Muhammad]].

On one such instance, Muhammad's \"announcement of a revelation permitting him to enter into marriages disallowed to other men drew from her [Aisha] the retort, 'It seems to me your Lord hastens to satisfy your desire!'\"<ref name=ahmed5152>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1992|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> Furthermore, Muhammad and Aisha had a strong intellectual relationship.<ref>{{harvnb|Mernissi|1988|p=104}}</ref> Muhammad valued her keen memory and intelligence and so instructed his companions to draw some of their religious practices from her.<ref>{{harvnb|Mernissi|1988|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ramadan|2007|p=121}}</ref>\n\nAisha was jealous of [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]] who was the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, saying, \"I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija though I did not see her, but the Prophet used to mention her very often, and when ever he slaughtered a sheep, he would cut its parts and send them to the women friends of Khadija.

As the story goes, Aisha left her ''[[howdah]]'' in order to search for a missing necklace. Her slaves mounted the ''howdah'' and prepared it for travel without noticing any difference in weight without Aisha's presence. Hence the caravan accidentally departed without her. She remained at the camp until the next morning, when [[Safwan ibn Muattal|Safwan ibn al-Mu\u2018attal]], a nomad and member of Muhammad's army, found her and brought her back to Muhammad at the army's next camp. Rumours that Aisha and Safwan had committed adultery were spread, particularly by [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], [[Hassan ibn Thabit]], Mistah ibn Uthatha and [[Hammanah bint Jahsh]] (sister of [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]], another of Muhammad's wives). [[Usama ibn Zayd]], son of [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], defended Aisha's reputation; while [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] advised \"Women are plentiful, and you can easily change one for another.\" Muhammad came to speak directly with Aisha about the rumours. He was still sitting in her house when he announced that he had received a revelation from [[God in Islam|God]] confirming Aisha's innocence. Surah 24 details the Islamic laws and punishment regarding [[Zina|adultery]] and slander. Aisha's accusers were subjected to punishments of 80 lashes.<ref>The story is told multiple times in the early traditions, nearly all of the versions being ultimately derived from Aisha's own account. Typical examples can be found in {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|462}}, {{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|37|6673}} and {{harvnb|Guillaume|1955|pp=494\u2013499}}.</ref>\n\n===Story of the honey===\nAfter the daily ''[[Asr prayer|Asr]]'' prayer, Muhammad would visit each of his wives' apartments to inquire about their well-being. Muhammad was just in the amount of time he spent with them and attention he gave to them.<ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.islamswomen.com/articles/zaynab_bint_jahsh.php |title=Great Women of Islam \u2013 Zaynab bint Jahsh |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015004735/http://islamswomen.com/articles/zaynab_bint_jahsh.php |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Once, Muhammad's fifth wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, received some honey from a relative which Muhammad took a particular liking to. As a result, every time Zaynab offered some of this honey to him he would spend a longer time in her apartment. This did not sit well with Aisha and [[Hafsa bint Umar]].\n{{Quote|Hafsa and I decided that when the Prophet entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"...\"But I have drunk honey.\" Hisham said: It also meant his saying, \"I will not drink anymore, and I have taken an oath, so do not inform anybody of that'|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]<ref>{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|8|78|682}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon after this event, Muhammad reported that he had received a revelation in which he was told that he could eat anything permitted by God. Some Sunni commentators on the Qur'an sometimes give this story as the \"occasion of revelation\" for [[At-Tahrim]], which opens with the following verses: {{Quote|O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which [[Allah]] has made lawful to thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<br>Allah has already ordained for you, (O men), the dissolution of your oaths (in some cases): and Allah is your Protector, and He is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.|Qur'an, surah 66 (At-Tahrim), [[ayah|ayat]] 1\u20132<ref>{{Cite quran|66|1|e=2|s=ns}}</ref>}} Word spread to the small [[Ummah|Muslim community]] that Muhammad's wives were speaking sharply to him and conspiring against him. Muhammad, saddened and upset, separated from his wives for a month. \u2018Umar, Hafsa's father, scolded his daughter and also spoke to Muhammad of the matter. By the end of this time, his wives were humbled; they agreed to \"speak correct and courteous words\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ibn Sa'd|1995|pp=132\u2013133}}</ref> and to focus on the [[afterlife]].<ref>{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|43|648}}</ref>\n\n===Death of Muhammad===\nAisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life. When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next. They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there. He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his most beloved wife.<ref name=ahmed58>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1992|p=58}}</ref><ref name=abbott69>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=69}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lings|1983|p=339}}</ref><ref name=\"Haykal\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1976|pp=502\u2013503}}</ref><ref name=\"Guillaume\">{{harvnb|Guillaume|1955|p=679 and 682}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nAfter Muhammad's death, which ended Aisha and Muhammad's 14-year-long marriage, Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning and acquiring knowledge of the Quran and the ''[[sunnah]]'' of Muhammad. Aisha was one of three wives (the other two being Hafsa bint Umar and [[Umm Salama]]) who memorized the Qur'an. Like Hafsa, Aisha had her own script of the Quran written after Muhammad's death.<ref name=\"jannah.org\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.jannah.org/sisters/aishah.html |title=Aishah bint Abu Bakr |publisher=Jannah.org |accessdate=2013-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000817/http://www.jannah.org/sisters/aishah.html |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> During Aisha's life many prominent customs of Islam, such as [[veil]]ing of women, began.\n\nAisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam.<ref name=\"Elsadda\" /> Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, and \u2018Uthman. During a time in Islam when women were not expected, or wanted, to contribute outside the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad.<ref name=ahmed51 />{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Role during caliphate===\n\n====Role during first and second caliphates====\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph. This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr.<ref>{{harvnb|Spellberg|Aghaie|pp=42\u201347}}</ref> Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as father-in-law. As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority.<ref name=spellberg45>{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|pp=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAisha garnered more special privilege in the Islamic community for being known as both a wife of Muhammad and the daughter of the first caliph. Being the daughter of Abu Bakr tied Aisha to honorable titles earned from her father's strong dedication to Islam. For example, she was given the title of ''al-siddiqa bint al-siddiq'', meaning 'the truthful woman, daughter of the truthful man',<ref name=spellberg40 /> a reference to Abu Bakr's support of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]].<ref>{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|p=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 634 Abu Bakr fell sick and was unable to recover. Prior to his death, he appointed \u2018Umar, one of his chief advisers, as the second caliph.<ref name=spellberg40 /> Throughout \u2018Umar's time in power Aisha continued to play the role of a consultant in political matters.<ref name=spellberg40 />\n\n====Role during the third caliphate====\nAfter \u2018Umar died, \u2018Uthm\u0101n was chosen to be the third caliph. He wanted to promote the interests of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. Aisha had little involvement with \u2018Uthm\u0101n for the first couple years, but eventually she found a way into the politics of his reign. She eventually grew to despise \u2018Uthm\u0101n, and many are unsure of what specifically triggered her eventual opposition towards him. A prominent opposition that arose towards him was when \u2018Uthm\u0101n mistreated \u2018[[Ammar ibn Yasir]] (companion of Muhammad) by beating him. Aisha became enraged and spoke out publicly, saying, \"How soon indeed you have forgotten the practice (sunnah) of your prophet and these, his hairs, a shirt, and sandal have not yet perished!\".<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=108}}</ref>\n\nAs time continued issues of antipathy towards \u2018Uthm\u0101n continued to arise. Another instance of opposition arose when the people came to Aisha, after Uthm\u0101n ignored the rightful punishment for Walid idn Uqbah (Uthm\u0101n's brother). Aisha and Uthm\u0101n argued with each other, Uthm\u0101n eventually made a comment on why Aisha had come and how she was \"ordered to stay at home\".<ref name= abbott111>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=111}}</ref> Arising from this comment, was the question of whether Aisha, and for that matter women, still had the ability to be involved in public affairs. The Muslim community became split: \"some sided with Uthm\u0101n, but others demanded to know who indeed had better right than Aisha in such matters\".<ref name= abbott111/>\n\nThe caliphate took a turn for the worse when [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] was governed by [[Abdullah ibn Saad]]. Abbott reports that [[Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa]] of Egypt, an opponent of \u2018Uthm\u0101n, forged letters in the Mothers of the Believers' names to the conspirators against \u2018Uthm\u0101n. The people cut off \u2018Uthm\u0101n's water and food supply. When Aisha realized the behavior of the crowd, Abbott notes, Aisha could not believe the crowd \"would offer such indignities to a widow of Mohammad\".<ref name= abbott122>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=122}}</ref> This refers to when [[Safiyya bint Huyayy]] (one of Muhammad's wives) tried to help \u2018Uthm\u0101n and was taken by the crowd. [[Malik al-Ashtar]] then approached her about killing Uthm\u0101n and the letter, and she claimed she would never want to \"command the shedding of the blood of the Muslims and the killing of their [[Imam|Im\u0101m]]\";<ref name= abbott122/> she also claimed she did not write the letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1942|p=123}}</ref> The city continued to oppose \u2018Uthm\u0101n, but as for Aisha, her journey to Mecca was approaching. With the journey to Mecca approaching at this time, she wanted to rid herself of the situation. \u2018Uthm\u0101n heard of her not wanting to hurt him, and he asked her to stay because of her influence on the people, but this did not persuade Aisha, and she continued on her journey.<ref name=\"Nabia\" />\n\n===First Fitna===\n{{Main|Battle of the Camel}}\n[[File:First Fitna map blank.svg|thumb|350px|Domains of [[Rashidun Caliphate]] under [[Rashidun|four caliphs]].

In particular, Muhammad's unions with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar associated him with two of the most significant leaders of the early Muslim community, Aisha's and Hafsa's fathers, Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, respectively.<ref name=\"Aslan\">{{harvnb|Aslan|2005|pp=58\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nAisha's marriage has given her significance among many within Islamic culture, becoming known as the most learned woman of her time.

She expressed herself as a role model to women, which can also be seen within some traditions attributed to her.

For this reason, Muslim feminists throughout the world are advocating a return to the society Muhammad originally envisioned for his followers. Despite differences in culture, nationalities, and beliefs, these women believe that the lesson to be learned from Muhammad in Medina is that Islam is above all an egalitarian religion. Their Medina is a society in which Muhammad designated women like Umm Waraqa as spiritual guides for the Ummah; in which the Prophet himself was sometimes publicly rebuked by his wives; in which women prayed and fought alongside the men; in which women like Aisha and Umm Salamah acted not only as religious but also as political\u2014and on at least one occasion military\u2014leaders; and in which the call to gather for prayer, bellowed from the rooftop of Muhammad's house, brought men and women together to kneel side by side and be blessed as a single undivided community.}}\n\nNot only was Aisha supportive of Muhammad, but she contributed scholarly intellect to the development of Islam.<ref name=\"Anwar\" /> She was given the title ''al-Siddiqah'', meaning 'the one who affirms the truth'.

Her discontinuation of public politics, however, did not stop her political influence completely. Privately, Aisha continued influencing those intertwined in the Islamic political sphere. Amongst the Islamic community, she was known as an intelligent woman who debated law with male companions.<ref>{{harvnb|Geissinger|2011|p=42}}</ref> Aisha was also considered to be the embodiment of proper rituals while partaking in the [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]], a journey she made with several groups of women. For the last two years of her life, Aisha spent much of her time telling the stories of Muhammad, hoping to correct false passages that had become influential in formulating Islamic law.
