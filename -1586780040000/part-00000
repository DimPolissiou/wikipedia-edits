There are over 30 Bemba clans, named after animals or natural organisms, such as the royal clan, \"the people of the crocodile\" (Bena Ng'andu) or the Bena Bowa (Mushroom Clan). The [[Bemba language]] (Chibemba) is related to the [[Bantu languages]] Kaonde (in Zambia and the DRC), Luba (in the DRC), Nsenga and Tonga (in Zambia), and Nyanja/[[Chewa language|Chewa]] (in Zambia and Malawi). It is mainly spoken in the Northern, Luapula and Copperbelt Provinces, and has become the most widely spoken African language in the country, although not always as a first language. Bemba numbered 250,000 in 1963 but a much larger population includes some 'eighteen different ethnic groups' who, together with the Bemba, form a closely related ethno-linguistic cluster of matrilineal-matrifocal agriculturalists known as the Bemba-speaking peoples of Zambia.

Luo [[Benga music]] derives from the traditional music of the ''[[nyatiti]]'' lyre:<ref name=\"Manuel, Popular Musics, pg. 101\">Manuel, ''Popular Musics'', pg. 101</ref> the Luo-speaking [[Acholi people|Acholi]] of northern Uganda use the [[adungu]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Turino, pp. 179, 182; Sandahl, Sten, \"Exiles and Traditions\" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 698\u2013701</ref> Rhythms are characterized by syncopation and acrusis. Melodies are lyrical, with vocal ornamentations, especially when the music carries an important message. Songs are call-and-response or solo performances such as chants, recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases which carried serious messages. Luo dances such as the ''dudu'' were introduced by them. A unique characteristic is the introduction of another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance in self-praise. This is called ''pakruok''. A unique kind of ululation, ''sigalagala'', mainly done by women, marks the climax of the musical performance. Dance styles are elegant and graceful, involving the movement of one leg in the opposite direction to the waist or vigorous shaking of the shoulders, usually to the ''nyatiti''. Adamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances the Luo wore costumes; sisal skirts (owalo), beads (Ombulu / tigo) worn around the neck and waist and red or white clay used by the ladies. The men's costumes included kuodi or chieno, a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist. Ligisa headgear, shield and spear, reed hats and clubs were made from locally available materials. Luo musical instruments range from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, ongeng'o or gara, shakers), nyatiti, a type of lyre; orutu, a type of fiddle), wind (tung' a horn,Asili, a flute, Abu-!, to a specific type of trumpet. In the benga style of music. the guitar (acoustic, later electric) replaced the nyatiti as the string instrument. Benga is played by musicians of many tribes and is no longer considered a purely Luo style.\n* The [[Maasai people#Music and dance|Music and dance of the Maasai people]] used no instruments in the past because as semi-nomadic Nilotic pastoralists instruments were considered too cumbersome to move. Traditional Maasai music is strictly [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[vocal music]], a group chanting polyphonic rhythms while soloists take turns singing verses. The [[call and response (music)|call and response]] that follows each verse is called ''namba''. Performances are often competitive and divided by age and gender. The neighbouring [[Turkana people]] have maintained their ancient traditions, including call and response music, which is almost entirely vocal. A horn made from the [[kudu]] antelope is also played. The [[Samburu people|Samburu]] are related to the Maasai, and like them, play almost no instruments except simple pipes and a kind of guitar.  There are also erotic songs sung by women praying for rain.\n* The [[Borana people|Borana]] live near the [[Ethiopia]]n border, and their music reflects [[music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[Somali music|Somali]] and other traditions.

Dances are usually accompanied by songs composed for the occasion and sung on a [[pentatonic scale]]. The Akamba also have work songs. Their music is divided into several groups based on age: ''Kilumi'' is a dance for mainly elderly women and men performed at healing and rain-making ceremonies,''Mbeni'' for young and acrobatic girls and boys,  ''Mbalya'' or ''Ngutha'' is a dance for young people who meet to entertain themselves after the day's chores are done, ''Kyaa'' for the old men and women.''Kiveve, Kinze'' etc. In the Kilumi dance the drummer, usually female, plays sitting on a large ''mwase'' drum  covered  with goatskin at one end and open at the other. The drummer is also the lead singer.

(or 'BaBemba' using the Ba- prefix to mean 'people of', and also called 'Awemba' or 'BaWemba' in the past) belong to a large group of peoples mainly in the [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern]], [[Luapula Province|Luapula]] and [[Copperbelt]] Provinces of [[Zambia]] who trace their origins to the Luba and Lunda states of the upper [[Congo basin]], in what became [[Katanga Province]] in southern [[Congo-Kinshasa]] (DRC). There are over 30 Bemba clans, named after animals or natural organisms, such as the royal clan, \"the people of the crocodile\" (Bena Ng'andu) or the Bena Bowa (Mushroom Clan). The [[Bemba language]] (Chibemba) is related to the [[Bantu languages]] Kaonde (in Zambia and the DRC), Luba (in the DRC), Nsenga and Tonga (in Zambia), and Nyanja/[[Chewa language|Chewa]] (in Zambia and Malawi). It is mainly spoken in the Northern, Luapula and Copperbelt Provinces, and has become the most widely spoken African language in the country, although not always as a first language. Bemba numbered 250,000 in 1963 but a much larger population includes some 'eighteen different ethnic groups' who, together with the Bemba, form a closely related ethno-linguistic cluster of matrilineal-matrifocal agriculturalists known as the Bemba-speaking peoples of Zambia.

Luo [[Benga music]] derives from the traditional music of the ''[[nyatiti]]'' lyre:<ref name=\"Manuel, Popular Musics, pg. 101\">Manuel, ''Popular Musics'', pg. 101</ref> the Luo-speaking [[Acholi people|Acholi]] of northern Uganda use the [[adungu]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Turino, pp. 179, 182; Sandahl, Sten, \"Exiles and Traditions\" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 698\u2013701</ref> Rhythms are characterized by syncopation and acrusis. Melodies are lyrical, with vocal ornamentations, especially when the music carries an important message. Songs are call-and-response or solo performances such as chants, recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases which carried serious messages. Luo dances such as the ''dudu'' were introduced by them. A unique characteristic is the introduction of another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance in self-praise. This is called ''pakruok''. A unique kind of ululation, ''sigalagala'', mainly done by women, marks the climax of the musical performance. Dance styles are elegant and graceful, involving the movement of one leg in the opposite direction to the waist or vigorous shaking of the shoulders, usually to the ''nyatiti''. Adamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances the Luo wore costumes; sisal skirts (owalo), beads (Ombulu / tigo) worn around the neck and waist and red or white clay used by the ladies. The men's costumes included kuodi or chieno, a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist. Ligisa headgear, shield and spear, reed hats and clubs were made from locally available materials. Luo musical instruments range from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, ongeng'o or gara, shakers), nyatiti, a type of lyre; orutu, a type of fiddle), wind (tung' a horn,Asili, a flute, Abu-!, to a specific type of trumpet. In the benga style of music. the guitar (acoustic, later electric) replaced the nyatiti as the string instrument. Benga is played by musicians of many tribes and is no longer considered a purely Luo style.\n* The [[Maasai people#Music and dance|Music and dance of the Maasai people]] used no instruments in the past because as semi-nomadic Nilotic pastoralists instruments were considered too cumbersome to move. Traditional Maasai music is strictly [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[vocal music]], a group chanting polyphonic rhythms while soloists take turns singing verses. The [[call and response (music)|call and response]] that follows each verse is called ''namba''. Performances are often competitive and divided by age and gender. The neighbouring [[Turkana people]] have maintained their ancient traditions, including call and response music, which is almost entirely vocal. A horn made from the [[kudu]] antelope is also played. The [[Samburu people|Samburu]] are related to the Maasai, and like them, play almost no instruments except simple pipes and a kind of guitar.  There are also erotic songs sung by women praying for rain.\n* The [[Borana people|Borana]] live near the [[Ethiopia]]n border, and their music reflects [[music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[Somali music|Somali]] and other traditions.

The Himalayan kingdom was connected to India through a district of the Punjab, but its population was 77 per cent Muslim and it shared a boundary with Pakistan. Hence, it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to Pakistan when the British paramountcy ended on 14\u201315 August. When he hesitated to do this, Pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]]<ref>Viscount Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, stayed on in independent India from 1947 to 1948, serving as the first Governor-General of the Union of India.</ref> for assistance, and the [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. The United Nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of Kashmiris must be ascertained, while India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.<ref name=\"stein\">Stein, Burton. 2010.

However, since the [[referendum]] demanded by the UN was never conducted, relations between India and Pakistan soured,<ref name=\"stein\" /> and eventually led to two more wars over Kashmir in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]] and [[Kargil War|1999]].\n\n[[File:Kashmir top.jpg|thumb|[[Topographic map]] of Kashmir]]\n\n===Current status and political divisions===\n{{Main|Aksai Chin|Azad Kashmir|Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Ladakh|Gilgit\u2013Baltistan|Trans-Karakoram Tract}}\nIndia has control of about half the area of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which continues the name [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]], while Pakistan controls a third of the region, divided into two ''de facto'' provinces, [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]].\n\nAccording to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', \"Although there was a clear Muslim majority in Kashmir before the 1947 partition and its economic, cultural, and geographic contiguity with the Muslim-majority area of the Punjab (in Pakistan) could be convincingly demonstrated, the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region.

Traditionally the staple crop of the valley was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, Indian corn, wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its [[temperate climate]], it is suited for crops like [[asparagus]], artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, [[peach]]es, and cherries. The chief trees are [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]], firs and [[pine]]s, [[Platanus orientalis|chenar]] or plane, maple, birch and [[walnut]], apple, cherry.\n\nHistorically, Kashmir became known worldwide when [[Cashmere wool]] was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at [[knitting]] and making [[Pashmina]] [[shawl]]s, silk carpets, rugs, [[kurta]]s, and pottery. [[Saffron]], too, is grown in Kashmir. Srinagar is known for its silver-work, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n\n{{Wide image|Srinagar pano.jpg|800px|Srinagar, the largest city of Kashmir|center}}\n\n===Transport===\nTransport is predominantly by air or road vehicles in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatonline.com/kashmir/travel-tips/local-transport.html |title=Local Transport in Kashmir \u2013 Means of Transportation Kashmir \u2013 Mode of Transportation Kashmir India |publisher=Bharatonline.com |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> Kashmir has a {{convert|135|km|abbr=on|0}} long modern [[Jammu\u2013Baramulla line|railway]] line that started in October 2009, and was last extended in 2013 and connects Baramulla, in the western part of Kashmir, to Srinagar and [[Banihal]].

The Himalayan kingdom was connected to India through a district of the Punjab, but its population was 77 per cent Muslim and it shared a boundary with Pakistan. Hence, it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to Pakistan when the British paramountcy ended on 14\u201315 August. When he hesitated to do this, Pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]]<ref>Viscount Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, stayed on in independent India from 1947 to 1948, serving as the first Governor-General of the Union of India.</ref> for assistance, and the [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. The United Nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of Kashmiris must be ascertained, while India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.<ref name=\"stein\">Stein, Burton. 2010.

Of these, 2,154,695 (74.16%) were Muslims, 689,073 (23.72%) Hindus, 25,828 (0.89%) Sikhs, and 35,047 (1.21%) [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (implying 935 (0.032%) others).\n\nThe [[Hindu]]s were found mainly in [[Jammu Division|Jammu]], where they constituted a little less than 60% of the population.<ref name=imperialgazetteerkashmir>''Imperial Gazetteer of India, volume 15''. 1908.

In the last census of British India in 1941, the total population of Kashmir and Jammu (which as a result of the second world war, was estimated from the 1931 census) was 3,945,000. Of these, the total Muslim population was 2,997,000 (75.97%), the Hindu population was 808,000 (20.48%), and the Sikh 55,000 (1.39%).<ref name = brush>{{cite journal | last1 = Brush | first1 = J.

Traditionally the staple crop of the valley was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, Indian corn, wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its [[temperate climate]], it is suited for crops like [[asparagus]], artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, [[peach]]es, and cherries. The chief trees are [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]], firs and [[pine]]s, [[Platanus orientalis|chenar]] or plane, maple, birch and [[walnut]], apple, cherry.\n\nHistorically, Kashmir became known worldwide when [[Cashmere wool]] was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at [[knitting]] and making [[Pashmina]] [[shawl]]s, silk carpets, rugs, [[kurta]]s, and pottery. [[Saffron]], too, is grown in Kashmir. Srinagar is known for its silver-work, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n\n{{Wide image|Srinagar pano.jpg|800px|Srinagar, the largest city of Kashmir|center}}\n\n===Transport===\nTransport is predominantly by air or road vehicles in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatonline.com/kashmir/travel-tips/local-transport.html |title=Local Transport in Kashmir \u2013 Means of Transportation Kashmir \u2013 Mode of Transportation Kashmir India |publisher=Bharatonline.com |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> Kashmir has a {{convert|135|km|abbr=on|0}} long modern [[Jammu\u2013Baramulla line|railway]] line that started in October 2009, and was last extended in 2013 and connects Baramulla, in the western part of Kashmir, to Srinagar and [[Banihal]].
