{"title_page": "High Court of Tanzania", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2016}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}\n}}\n{{Politics of Tanzania}}\nIn 1964 Tanganyika and Zanzibar formed the United Republic of Tanzania.  After the Treaty of the Union, the two countries continued to remain with their own legal systems including court structures.  In the 1977 Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, the High Court of Tanganyika whose jurisdiction was and still is territoriality limited to Tanzania Mainland (formerly Tanganyika) was called the '''High Court of Tanzania''' and the High Court of Zanzibar retained its original name.  It is essential to note that the High Court of Tanzania only has territorial jurisdiction over legal issues arising in Tanzania Mainland and the High Court of Zanzibar has territorial jurisdiction over legal issues arising in Zanzibar.\n\nThe Courts in the United Republic of Tanzania are arranged in a simple and clear hierarchy containing superior courts and subordinate courts and a special constitutional court, which is formed only when there is a constitutional dispute arising between Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland.  In the history of the Union of Zanzibar and Tanganyika a special Constitutional court has never been formed, despite open disagreements on the interpretation and nature of the Union.  The Courts of the United Republic of Tanzania are established by the Constitution and municipal laws of Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland.   In Tanzania Mainland, the High Court of Tanzania has three divisions, namely the Commercial Division (the Commercial Court), the Land Division (the Land Court) and the Labour Division (the Labour Court).\n\nOn the other hand, Zanzibar only has one division of its High Court but is establishing a Commercial Division of the High Court of Zanzibar.  The High Court of Zanzibar has a registry in Pemba and in Zanzibar, however, the registry in Pemba does not have a resident judge.  The High Court of Tanzania has registries in Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Tanga, Arusha, Iringa, Bukoba, Dodoma, Mwanza, Mbeya, Mtwara, Tabora and all the registries have resident judges.\n\n==The Court of Appeal of the United Republic of Tanzania==\nThe highest court of the United Republic of Tanzania is the Court of Appeal of the United Republic Tanzania which is a true union institution in that it has territorial jurisdiction over appeals arising from the High Court of Tanzania and the High Court of Zanzibar.\n\n==Divisions of the High Court of Tanzania ==\n\nThe Commercial Court handles all commercial disputes.  This Court was established through amendment of the High Court Registries Rules of 1984. The main objective of establishing this court was to ensure efficient management and expeditious disposal of commercial disputes so as to encourage business development under a free market economy and also growth of foreign investments.\n\nThe Labour Court is responsible for hearing and determining employment disputes. It was first inaugurated and launched in June 2007 under the  Employment and Labour Relations Act.\n\nThe Land Court was established as a result of the land reforms which were implemented by the Land Act 1999.  Until 2010, the Land Court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine land disputes relating to land with a pecuniary value of TZS 50,000 or more.  Due to lack of sufficient manpower, including judges and the large number of cases being filed in the Land Court, the efficient and timely  disposal of cases was negatively impacted.  Consequently, in 2010, the Chief Justice of Tanzania, Augustino Ramadhani CJ, extended the jurisdiction to deal with land cases to all judges of the High Court.\n\n==History==\nThe High Court of Tanzania is established under article 108(1) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.  It is the predecessor to the High Court of [[Tanganyika]] and later Tanzania, which was established under article 17 (1) of the Tanganyika order in council, 1920.\n\nThe High Court is described as a superior court having full jurisdiction by virtue of section 2 (1) of the Judicature and Application of Laws Act, chapter 358 RE:2002. It has now developed forming a different structure to the former, where it has the ordinary court, and the two special divisions that is Commercial Division and Labour Division. However it is subject to the Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as stipulated under the constitution and any other written laws.\n\nThe court is also known as a [[court of record]] where it is required to keep records of its own proceedings and that it may fine or imprison but also as a [[Admiralty Court|court of admiralty]] it can adjudicate disputes arising in the high seas and inland waters.\n\n==Composition==\n{{Further|Chief Justice of Tanzania}}\nHaving its base from the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, the High Court of Tanzania is composed of the principal judge and not less than 30 other judges.\n\nJudges of the High Court as provided  by the Constitution are appointed by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, in pursuant to the special qualifications stated in its article 109 (7) after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission established under part iii of the constitution. Formally the judges of the court were required to be not less than 15, compared to the recent changes of a composition of not less than 30 judges.\n\nThe principal judge is a special assistant of the Chief Justice in the administration of the High court and courts which are subordinate to it. Provided under article 109 (3) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.  In addition to his ordinary power as a judge of the High Court, the principal judge is also empowered to perform all such duties and functions which in accordance with legal traditions applicable are matters to be performed by the head of the High Court.\n\nAssessors can be simply regarded as a panel of experts in determining an issue before the court. Assessors in the divisions of the High Court are selected from a list of experts submitted to the court by the specific court users committee and have to be knowledgeable in the field concerning the suit. Under article 27 (4) of the Magistrates Courts Act it provides that in any appeal a rule of customary law is in issue or relevant the High Court may refer any question of Customary law to a panel of experts and Also in section 265 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1985 it stipulates that all criminal trials before the court shall be with aid of two or more assessors as the court thinks fit.\n\nThe divisions of the court are also properly constituted when presided over by a single judge sitting with two assessors; however where both parties to the case agree the judge in the commercial court can hear their case without aid of assessors.\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe high court by virtue of section 2 (1) of the Judicature and Application of Laws Act is vested with full and unlimited Jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters, that is to say it shall have power over any matter not expressly provided by the law the constitution or any other law. It is also provided further under article 108(2) of the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania. Such Jurisdiction is subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as stipulated under the constitution and any other written laws.\n\nIn the light of article 108(2) of the constitution of the united republic and the provisions of the Judicature and Application of laws Act, the high court has original jurisdiction over all matters that are outside the jurisdiction of the courts subordinate to it.  For example, proceedings where the value of the subject matter exceeds that of the district or resident magistrate courts, such cases are to be tried by the High Court. The High court also has original jurisdiction over all naval affairs or admiral matters.\n\nThe high court has also exclusive original jurisdiction over all offences that are not triable by subordinate courts. The majority of these offences either carry capital punishment or life imprisonment, such offences include murder, manslaughter, infanticide, treason, inciting to mutiny and various other offences.\n\nThe high court is vested with the appellate power in regard to determining matters submitted to it from subordinate courts, such an appeal may be from the Resident magistrate court or the district court. An appeal to the high court can be on points of law or on points of facts, or on both facts and law.  An appeal can also be civil or criminal. Section 72 of the civil procedure code states that \u201cwhere a case is heard by a bench of two or more judges the appeal shall be decided in accordance with the opinion of the majority of such judges\u201d.\n\n==Powers==\n\n===Review===\nThe law allows any person who is aggrieved by any decision or order from which an appeal is allowed but no appeal has been made to apply for review of the order or decision made by a magistrate who passed the judgement.  Review may also be applied for in circumstances where the party has no right to appeal so that a court can reverse its decision. According to the Order 42 rule 1(b) of the civil procedure code the applicant for review has to show that he or she discovered new or important matters or evidence. The judge to whom the application is made is free to alter his or her decision as he or she deems fit.\n\nA good example was in the case of ''Paul lema v Wilson chuwa (1989)'' where a high court judge reviewed his own order made in a matter arising from a suit to resist the sale of a house in a public auction.  In an appeal the Court of Appeal held that a judge has power to review his own decision, but has no power to take a second look at his own decision given after review.\n\n===Supervision and revision===\nThe high court is vested with general powers of supervision and revision over all districts courts and courts of resident Magistrates in the exercise of their appellate jurisdiction on matters originating from primary courts as well as in exercising their original jurisdiction.  Where in exercise of such repower the high court may either call to inspect the record of any proceedings, direct any district court to call for and inspect the records of any proceedings in a primary court, or it can itself revise any such proceedings.\n\nUnder the magistrate courts act if in any proceedings of a civil nature where it appears that there has been an error material to the merits of the case involving injustices, the high court may revise the proceedings and make such decision as it sees fit..\n\n==Conclusion==\nConclusively in the case of ''Northern Tanzania Farmers Coop society Ltd v Shelukindo'' the court stated that \u201cThe high court is an organ deriving its establishment and existence by the operation of the constitution of this country. This organ unless otherwise expressly restricted by the legislature has unlimited criminal and civil jurisdiction, pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction apart from the court of appeal, it is the highest court for the administration of justice in this country.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Shivji I. et al, (2004) \u2018constitutional and legal systems of Tanzania\u2019, Mkuki na nyota publishers, Dar es Salaam.\n* Civil procedure code, Chapter 33 of the revised laws of Tanzania\n* The constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania 1977, as amended 2008\n* Judicature and Application of Laws Act, chapter 358 of the laws of Tanzania\n\n{{Tanzania topics}}\n{{Judiciaries of Africa}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Tanzania]]\n[[Category:Tanzanian law]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2016}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}\n}}\n{{Politics of Tanzania}}\nIn 1964 Tanganyika and Zanzibar formed the United Republic of Tanzania.

Billy spends his days drinking with friends and creating disturbances across his father's estate. One day, Billy ruins a dinner meeting between his father and his associates by acting obnoxiously. Brian loses confidence in his son and chooses his devious executive vice president Eric Gordon to take over Madison Hotels. When Billy begs his father to reconsider his decision, as he knows how callous and cruel Eric is, Brian reveals that he secretly bribed Billy's school teachers to give him passing grades. The two finally compromise: Billy must complete all 12 grades in two-week intervals to prove he is competent enough to manage the company.\n\nShortly after enrolling into school, Billy becomes attracted to a teacher named Veronica Vaughn, who initially ignores him. Nevertheless, Billy successfully progresses through his first two grades. He finds himself as one of Veronica's students in the third grade and earns her respect by standing up for Ernie, his friend and classmate. Billy becomes popular among the third graders and misses them as he advances through school. Billy's progress alarms Eric. Desperate to take over Madison Hotels, he blackmails Billy's elementary school principal, Max Anderson, into lying that Billy bribed him for passing grades, with a wrestling magazine containing pictures of Max's previous career as the \"Revolting Blob\", a masked [[wrestler]] who accidentally killed a man in the ring.\n\nAngered, Brian calls off his deal with Billy and renames Eric as chairman to the company. Billy grows distraught and reverts to his carefree lifestyle. Veronica motivates him to return to school, while his grade school classmates convince Max to retract his bribery accusations, infuriating Eric. Brian agrees to give Billy another chance but Eric cites that Billy failed the challenge by not finishing 9th grade within two weeks. He then threatens to sue Brian if he does not pass the company onto him. Billy intervenes and challenges Eric to an academic [[decathlon]] to finally settle their feud with the winner getting to take over Madison Hotels.\n\nBoth men excel in different activities, but Billy manages to take a single-point lead before the contest's final event, a ''[[Jeopardy!]]''-style academic test. Billy gives a completely dimwitted answer for the opening question in the event, and Eric is given the chance to win the contest by answering a question regarding [[business ethics]]. Eric, being a highly unscrupulous businessman, cannot conceive of an answer and breaks down. He brandishes a [[revolver]], but Max (in his wrestling gear) tackles Eric from backstage before he can harm Billy.

Billy spends his days drinking with friends and creating disturbances across his father's estate. One day, Billy ruins a dinner meeting between his father and his associates by acting obnoxiously. Brian loses confidence in his son and chooses his devious executive vice president Eric Gordon to take over Madison Hotels. When Billy begs his father to reconsider his decision, as he knows how callous and cruel Eric is, Brian reveals that he secretly bribed Billy's school teachers to give him passing grades. The two finally compromise: Billy must complete all 12 grades in two-week intervals to prove he is competent enough to manage the company.\n\nShortly after enrolling into school, Billy becomes attracted to a teacher named Veronica Vaughn, who initially ignores him. Nevertheless, Billy successfully progresses through his first two grades. He finds himself as one of Veronica's students in the third grade and earns her respect by standing up for Ernie, his friend and classmate. Billy becomes popular among the third graders and misses them as he advances through school. Billy's progress alarms Eric. Desperate to take over Madison Hotels, he blackmails Billy's elementary school principal, Max Anderson, into lying that Billy bribed him for passing grades, with a wrestling magazine containing pictures of Max's previous career as the \"Revolting Blob\", a masked [[wrestler]] who accidentally killed a man in the ring.\n\nAngered, Brian calls off his deal with Billy and renames Eric as chairman to the company. Billy grows distraught and reverts to his carefree lifestyle. Veronica motivates him to return to school, while his grade school classmates convince Max to retract his bribery accusations, infuriating Eric. Brian agrees to give Billy another chance but Eric cites that Billy failed the challenge by not finishing 9th grade within two weeks. He then threatens to sue Brian if he does not pass the company onto him. Billy intervenes and challenges Eric to an academic [[decathlon]] to finally settle their feud with the winner getting to take over Madison Hotels.\n\nBoth men excel in different activities but Billy manages to take a single-point lead before the contest's final event, a ''[[Jeopardy!]]''-style academic test. Billy gives a completely dimwitted answer for the opening question in the event, and Eric is given the chance to win the contest by answering a question regarding [[business ethics]]. Eric, being a highly unscrupulous businessman, cannot conceive of an answer and breaks down. He brandishes a [[revolver]], but Max (in his wrestling gear) tackles Eric from backstage before he can harm Billy. Eric recovers from the attack and attempts to shoot Veronica, but he is shot in the butt by Danny McGrath, a rifle-wielding madman whom Billy apologized to earlier for bullying him.\n\nAt his graduation ceremony, Billy, deciding that he is not fit for running a hotel company, announces he will pass Madison Hotels to Carl Alphonse, Brian's polite and loyal operations manager, and attend college in order to become a teacher. Eric, walking on crutches due to his wound, watches on and fumes in frustration over Billy's decision.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Billy Madison\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as Brian Madison\n* [[Bridgette Wilson]] as Veronica Vaughn\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Eric Gordon\n* [[Josh Mostel]] as Principal Max Anderson\n* [[Norm Macdonald]] as Frank\n* Mark Beltzman as Jack\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Carl Alphonse\n* [[Theresa Merritt]] as Juanita\n* [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]] as Principal/Judge of the decathlon\n* [[Hrant Alianak]] as Pete\n* Dina Platias as Ms. Lippy\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as Mr. Oblaski\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Danny McGrath (uncredited)\n* [[Chris Farley]] as Bus Driver (uncredited)\n* Greg Valcov as The Penguin (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\nOn the film review aggregation site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a mediocre approval rating of 40% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 4.73/10.

Cornell University, 2010, p. 36-37.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] signed by the Allies with imperial Germany, which ended World War I, the area became part of the nascent [[Second Polish Republic]].\n\n== Early plans ==\nBefore the onset of war in 1914, for the purposes of securing Germany's eastern border against the [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial army]], [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], the [[Chancellor of the German Empire|German chancellor]], decided on the [[annexation]] of a specific strip of land from [[Congress Poland]], known later on as the [[Polish Border Strip]]. In order to avoid adding the Polish population there to the population of imperial Germany, it was proposed that the Poles would be [[ethnic cleansing|moved]] to a proposed new Polish state further east, while the strip would be resettled with the Germans.<ref>Holborn 1982, p. 449 (see [[#Sources|\"Sources\" section below]]).</ref>\n\nAs World War I started, the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]] conceived of creating a dependent Polish state from territory conquered from Russia, since the majority of all Poles had lived in the area ever since the nation vanished from the European maps, after the [[Partitions of Poland|three splittings of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772\u20131795. This putative Polish kingdom, of limited autonomy, would be ruled by a German prince and have its military, transportation and economy controlled by Germany. Its army and railway network would be placed under [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] command.<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nDuring the first year of the war, German and Austrian troops quickly conquered the Russian [[Vistula Land]], the former [[Congress Poland]], and in 1915, divided its administration between a German Governor General in [[Warsaw]] and an Austrian counterpart in [[Lublin]].<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nRather than focusing on mineral and industrial resources, the purpose of eastern expansion was to strengthen German agriculture, expand [[Junker]] holdings and acquire large settlement areas for the German farmers and settlers. In this way, the German leadership hoped both to appease the Junker elites and, at the same time, ease the class conflicts in its rural areas. In addition, the confiscation of fertile territories was seen as one way of gaining [[war reparation]]s from Russia.<ref>Pajewski 2005, pp. 89-90 (see [[#Sources|\"Sources\" section below]]).</ref>\n{{Polish statehood}}\n\nIn several memoranda sent during 1915 and 1916, [[Hans Hartwig von Beseler]], the Governor-General of the Polish areas under German control, proposed the establishment of an independent Polish state. Under the influence of General [[Erich Ludendorff]], then in effect the director of Germany's eastern European operations, this proposal included the annexation of considerable amounts of land by Prussia, Lithuania and Austria-Hungary. Gerhard von Mutius, cousin of Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg and the foreign office's representative at Beseler's headquarters, disputed the use of annexation, insisting that \"if the military interests allow for it, divisions and secessions should be avoided\", as such a policy would secure an \"anti-Russian inclination [toward] the new Poland\".<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\nAustria-Hungary had three different ideas regarding Poland. One, the \"Austro-Polish solution\", involved the creation of a Polish kingdom under the [[Emperor of Austria]], who, among his other titles, was already [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|King of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. German and [[Magyars|Magyar (Hungarian)]] elements within the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] monarchy opposed such a move for fear of creating a predominantly [[Slavs|Slavic]] area. Unlike [[Francis Joseph of Austria|Emperor Francis Joseph]], however, [[Charles I of Austria]], who had [[Coronation|acceded]] to the Habsburg thrones in 1916, promoted the idea. The other two ideas involved the division of the former Congress Poland between Prussia and Austro-Hungary, or between Austro-Hungary and a state built from Lithuania, [[Belarus]] and the remnants of Congress Poland.<ref>Pajewski 2005, p. 91.</ref>\n\nThe Austrians, however, had underestimated Germany's desire to determine Poland's fate.<ref>Pajewski 2005, pp. 92\u201393.</ref> They did recognise, according to Prime Minister [[Karl von St\u00fcrgkh]], that \"Poles will remain Poles [...] even 150 years after [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was joined to Austria, Poles still didn't become Austrians\".<ref>Pajewski 2005, p. 93.</ref> It was clear to Austrian politicians that the creation of a Polish state along the lines intended by Germany would mean the loss of Galicia, so they proposed its partition and the formation of [[East Galicia]] as an Austrian province.<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nOf the candidates for the new Polish throne, [[Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria]] ({{lang-pl|Karol Stefan}}) and his son [[Archduke Karl Albrecht of Austria|Charles Albert]] were early contenders. Both resided in the Galician city of [[\u017bywiec|Saybusch (now \u017bywiec)]] and spoke Polish fluently. Charles Stephen's daughters were married to the Polish aristocrats Princes [[Czartoryski]] and [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]].\n\nBy early 1916, the \"Austro-Polish solution\" had become hypothetical. [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], the German Chief of the General Staff, had rejected the idea in January, followed by Bethmann-Hollweg in February. Bethmann-Hollweg had been willing to see an Austrian candidate on the new Polish throne, so long as Germany retained control over the Polish economy, resources and army.<ref>Hein Eirch Goemans 2000, p. 104 (see [[#Sources|\"Sources\" section below]]).</ref>\n\nGerman candidates for the throne were disputed between the royal houses of [[Saxony]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]].<ref>Tipton, Frank B.

By the end of 1916 Germany wanted to annex almost 30,000 square kilometres of Polish territory. These lands were to be settled by ethnic Germans, while the Polish and Jewish population was to be removed.<ref name=\"border strip\"/>\n\nAfter the expected victory the Polish economy was to be dominated by Germany and preparations were made for German control over the Polish railway system, shipping in the [[Vistula]] and industrial areas in [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie|D\u0105browa basin]], [[Radom]] and [[Kielce]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Armies of occupation|page=[https://archive.org/details/armiesofoccupati0000unse/page/128 128]|first1=Roy Arnold|last1=Prete|first2=A.

In October 1916, at joint deliberations at [[Pszczyna]], the German and Austrian leadership agreed to accelerate the proclamation promising creation of a Polish state in the future.<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2007-1001-500, Warschaus Generalgouverneur in Lublin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Governors-General [[Hans Hartwig von Beseler|Beseler]] (first from left) and Kuk (second from left) in 1916]]\n[[File:OkupacjaKP1914-18.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Occupation of the Kingdom of Poland during World War I:{{legend|#699BA9|[[German Empire]]}}{{legend|#3BCECE|Occupied (from Russia) by Germany }}{{legend|#7CB01E|[[Austria-Hungary]]}}{{legend|#9FFE9F|Occupied (from Russia) by Austria-Hungary}}{{legend|#6AAF8B|[[Russian Empire]]}}]]\nIn the meantime, General von Beseler had managed to gain support among pro-Austrian Poles and the followers of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. The [[Narodowa Demokracja]] party (centred in [[Paris]]), however, rejected any cooperation with the Central Powers. After the German Emperor and Chancellor met with a Polish delegation led by [[J\u00f3zef Brudzi\u0144ski]], the final details were arranged. On 5 November 1916, Governor von Beseler at Warsaw issued an [[Act of 5th November]], in which he promised that a Polish state would be created, without specifying any future Polish ruler, Polish borders or system of governance and, for the first time since 1831, had the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] decorated with Polish flags. The Austrian Governor-General Kuk issued a similar proclamation at Lublin. A pro-German faction led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Studnicki]] existed but didn't gain any significant backing among Polish population.\n\nImmediately after the proclamation, the German governor-general in Warsaw issued an advertisement for [[military recruitment]], resulting in Polish protests which especially decried the absence of a Polish government.\n\n===Council of State===\n{{main|Provisional Council of State}}\nOn 14 January 1917, a [[Provisional Council of State]] ({{lang-pl|Tymczasowa Rada Stanu}}) was established as a provisional government, consisting of 15 members chosen by the German and ten by the Austrian authorities. The [[magnate]] [[Waclaw Niemojowski]] was appointed ''[[Marsza\u0142ek|Crown Marshal]]'', with [[J\u00f3zef Miku\u0142owski-Pomorski]] acting as his deputy. [[Franciszek Pius Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] were put in charge of the Military Commission. The Council's first proclamation espoused [[monarchy|monarchical government]], Poland's expansion towards the east and supported an army of volunteers. A ''National Council'' served as a provisional parliament. The Councillors insisted on actual Polish autonomy and, on 21 April, were given authority over education, law courts and [[propaganda]]. Still, students were dissatisfied with the extent of autonomy and organised a strike on 3 May, resulting in the temporary closing of all universities.\n\nMeanwhile, [[U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s proclamation in favor of a unified and independent Poland (on 22 January 1917) and the downfall of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] in the [[February Revolution]] strengthened the Polish forces favoring a neutral or pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] stance.\n\n===Oath crisis===\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]]]\n{{main|Oath crisis}}\n\nIn December 1916, a [[brigade]] of [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish legions]] under [[Stanis\u0142aw Szeptycki]] moved into Warsaw to form the [[officer corps]] of the new Polish army.\n\nOn 21 April, the Council of State had passed a proclamation in favor of the Polish army ({{lang-de|[[Polnische Wehrmacht]]}}) and appointed [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski|Colonel Sikorski]] to oversee recruitment. The relationship between the Central Powers and the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish legions]] became increasingly difficult, especially after the powers barred Austrian subjects from the Legions (now called the Polish auxiliary corps, ''Polski Korpus Posilkowy''), aiming to divert them into the regular Austrian army. Pi\u0142sudski had abstained from the vote on the Polish army, and on 2 July resigned together with two left-wing State Councillors. The [[Polish Army oaths#Polish Legions in World War I|new army's oath]] drafted by the governors-general and passed by the Council of State resulted in a [[oath crisis|political crisis]], especially since it was directed to an unspecified \"future king\" and emphasized the alliance with Germany and Austria. Several legionaries refused to take the oath and were arrested, prompting General von Beseler to arrest Pi\u0142sudski, his associate [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], and have them confined in Germany. In August, the remains of the Legions, roughly ten thousand soldiers, were transferred to the Eastern front. Crown Marshall Niemojowski resigned on 6 August and the Council disbanded on 25 August.\n\n===\"Regency\" constitution===\n[[File:Regency Council.jpg|right|thumb|The Regency Council. Left to right: Ostrowski, [[Aleksander Kakowski|Kakowski]], and [[Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski|Lubomirski]]]]\n{{main|Regency Council (Poland)}}\n\nAfter the intermission of the Temporary Committee of the Provisional Council of State ({{lang-pl|Komisja Przej\u015bciowa Tymczasowej Rady Stanu}}), the Central Powers introduced a provisional constitution, the ''patent'', on 12 September 1917. The ''patent'' devised a constitutional monarchy with a [[bicameral parliament]] but without [[ministerial responsibility]]. Only schools and courts were transferred to Polish authorities, but \u2014 under Polish protests \u2014 the German minority was given a separate school system. Pending the election of a King of Poland, a [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] ({{lang-pl|Rada Regencyjna}}) was installed as a provisional government. On 18 September, the following members of the Council were named: [[Aleksander Kakowski]], [[Archbishop of Warsaw]]; aristocrat [[Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski|Prince Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski]] who had served as mayor of Warsaw in 1916/17; and [[J\u00f3zef Ostrowski]], a great landowner and formerly the leading Polish politician in the Russian [[Duma]].<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nThe Regency Council was ceremonially installed on 15 October, the anniversary of [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]]'s death, and on 26 November, appointed [[Jan Kucharzewski]], a lawyer who had been working in the government since June, as Prime Minister.\n\n[[File:Polish Regents 1916.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Members of the Regency Council with officers of the Polish Army]]\nAdministration, however, strictly remained in the hands of German authorities, now headed by [[Otto von Steinmeister]]. In March 1918, a resolution of the German Reichstag called for the establishment of a native civil administration in Poland, [[Courland|Kurland]] and [[Lithuania]]. However, the German authorities refused to transfer administration to Polish authorities and merely considered Poles as candidates to be trained under German supervision.\n\nAfter the [[oath crisis]] of 1917, recruitment to the Polish army had received scant support and achieved negligible results, reaching merely 5,000 men. In May 1918, the force was strengthened by General [[J\u00f3zef Dowb\u00f3r-Mu\u015bnicki]] moving his Polish corps \u2014 assembled from the former [[Tsarist]] army \u2014 to Poland. In August, the legionaries arrested for refusing the oath were released and some again volunteered for the Polish army.\n\nIn August 1918, [[Pope Pius XI|Achille Ratti]] arrived in Warsaw as apostolic visitor to adjust the [[Catholic Church]] to the altered political circumstances. This appointment was mainly due to the influence of German Chancellor [[Georg von Hertling]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], since 1917 [[Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria|Nuncio to Bavaria]] in Munich.  Ratti gained fame in 1920 for being the only diplomat to stay in Warsaw during the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] and was elected as Pope Pius XI in 1922.\n\n===End of the German plans===\nAfter Germany's 1918 [[Spring Offensive]] had failed to win the war on the Western front, General Ludendorff in September proposed seeking peace based on the plan outlined by U.S. President Wilson in January 1918 in his [[Fourteen Points]], which in regard to Poland demanded the creation of an \"independent Polish state ... guaranteed by international covenant\" with \"free and secure access to the sea\". On 3 October the new German Chancellor, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden|Prince Max of Baden]], announced Germany's acceptance of Wilson's plan and an immediate disestablishment of military administration in the countries occupied by Germany. Three days later the Regency Council in Warsaw also adopted Wilson's proposals as the basis for creating a Polish state.<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nOn 1 October, General von Beseler had conferred with Hindenburg at Berlin and, informed of the gloomy military situation, had returned to Warsaw ill and dispirited. On 6 October, he handed over administration to Polish civil servants and, on 23 October, transferred the command over Polish forces (which by then included the Polish regiments of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]) to the Regency Council.\n\nHowever, another Polish government based in Lublin arose to challenge the Regency's authority: on 6 November [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]] proclaimed the \"Polish People's Republic\" (''Tymczasowy Rz\u0105d Ludowy Republiki Polskiej'' - literally: \"Temporary People's Council of the Polish Republic\"), with Daszy\u0144ski himself (a Socialist politician and formerly a member of the Austrian parliament) as Prime Minister and Colonel [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] as military commander. Moderates in Warsaw, who now hoped for a return of General Pi\u0142sudski, who was still held in custody at [[Magdeburg]], repudiated Lublin's declaration of the deposition of the Regency to be deposed and its plans for radical social reforms.  Already in October the Regency Council had requested Pi\u0142sudski's release, and after negotiations through [[Harry Graf Kessler]] the General was allowed to return to Warsaw, where he arrived on 10 November. The following day Germany signed the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]] and German troops in Warsaw were disarmed as they refused to fire on Polish insurgents. Both the Regency Council and the Daszy\u0144ski government ceded all authority to Pi\u0142sudski. The Regency dissolved itself three days later.\n\n===Occupation authorities===\nThe occupation authorities included [[Government General of Warsaw|German Governor-General]] at Warsaw, commander-in-chief of the [[Polska Si\u0142a Zbrojna]] \u2014 [[Hans Hartwig von Beseler]] (1 October 1915 \u2013 11 November 1918); as well as the Austro-Hungarian Governors-General at Lublin: including Major General Erich Freiherr von Diller (1 October 1915 \u2013 20 April 1916), Feldzeugmeister Karl Kuk (21 April 1916 \u2013 April 1917); as well as Major General [[Stanislaus Graf Szeptycki]] (April 1917 \u2013 28 February 1918); and the Infantry General {{ill|Anton Lipo\u0161\u010dak|pl|Anton Lipo\u0161\u010dak|hr|Anton Lipo\u0161\u0107ak}} (1 March \u2013 11 November 1918).\n\nThe state authorities within the [[Provisional Council of State]] (14 January \u2013 15 August 1917) included  Waclaw Niemojowski, Crown Marshall (14 January \u2013 6 August 1917); Deputy Marshall J\u00f3zef Miku\u0142owski-Pomorski; and from the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] (15 October 1917 \u2013 14 November 1918), [[Archbishop of Warsaw|Archbishop]] [[Aleksander Kakowski]], Prince [[Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski]], and J\u00f3zef Ostrowski.<ref name=\"Monitor\">[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/92033/BibliographicResource_3000053592371.html  ''Monitor Polski'', z dn. 7 pa\u017adziernika 1918, s. 1.]</ref>\n\n== Borders ==\nIn their proclamation of 5 November 1916, the [[Central Powers]] refused to{{citation needed|reason=Which power demanded that determination? Otherwise the CPs \"didn't determine\", instead of \"refused to determine\"|date=July 2014}} determine the Polish borders.\n\n===Eastern===\nFollowing the [[October Revolution|Bolsheviks taking power in Russia in November 1917]], some Polish politicians sided with Germany as the \"last bulwark of order\" against the Bolshevik threat but Germany's policy of creating several smaller [[client states]] east of Poland, supported especially by the supreme command under Ludendorff, also heightened resistance to German presence in Polish territories.\n\nWith the support of the German military, the [[Council of Lithuania]] proclaimed an independent Lithuanian state on 11 December. Polish sentiment reacted strongly, as it considered [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland and Lithuania to be a historical union]] and especially since it regarded [[Wilno]] (Vilnius), the proposed new Lithuanian capital, as a Polish city.\n\nThe Regency Council sought admission to the negotiations with the Bolshevik government during travels to Berlin and Vienna early in 1918 but only gained German Chancellor [[Georg von Hertling]]'s promise to admit the Polish government in an advisory capacity. This, however, was refused by the Bolshevik representatives, who denied the Polish government any legitimacy. The German representative [[Max Hoffmann]] expressed a belief that \"independent Poland was always considered by me to be a utopia, and I have no doubts regarding my support for Ukrainian claims.\"<ref>Pajewski 643</ref> When the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], signed on 9 February, ceded the province of [[Che\u0142m]] \u2014 which had been part of Congress Poland until 1913 \u2014 to the new [[Ukrainian People's Republic|state of Ukraine]], many in Poland regarded this as a \"[[Partition of Poland#.22Fourth Partition.22|Fourth partition of Poland]]\", prompting a \"political [[general strike]]\" in Warsaw on 14 February and the resignation of the [[Jan Kucharzewski]] administration later that month. Parts of the Polish auxiliary corps under [[J\u00f3zef Haller]] protested by breaking through the Austro-Russian front line to [[Ukraine]], where they united with Polish detachments which had left the [[Tsarist]] army. After a fierce [[Battle of Kani\u00f3w|battle with the German army]] at [[Kaniv|Kani\u00f3w]] in May, the remnants were interned, though Haller managed to escape to Moscow.\n\n===Western===\n{{main|Polish Border Strip}}\nHowever, Poland's unspecified borders were threatened in the West as well: Late in 1917, the German supreme command had proposed annexing a \"[[Polish Border Strip|border strip]]\" to Germany,<ref name=\"border strip\">Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey J. Giles and Walter Pape, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042006889&id=jXKk-gs-VNEC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=%22kingdom+of+Poland%22+1916&sig=NjXAsXW-c7jn2mG-QckYol3iCoI Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identity and Cultural Differences]'', Rodopi, 1999, {{ISBN|90-420-0678-1}}, p. 28-9</ref> a policy earlier suggested by a letter to the German government by members of Poland's German minority, settled around [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. Such plans were agreed to in principle by the German government in March 1918 and in April gained support in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] but were strongly opposed by General von Beseler in a report to Emperor William.\n\nIn July, Ludendorff specified his plans in a memorandum, proposing annexing a greatly enlarged \"border strip\" of 20,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\"Goemans\">Hein Erich Goemans, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8sQOlYk032oC&q=Kingdom+Poland+1916 War and Punishment: The Causes of War Termination and the First World War]'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|0-691-04944-0}}, pp. 104\u2013105</ref><ref name=\"border strip\"/> In August, [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Charles of Austria]] insisted on the Austro-Polish option, forbidding [[Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria|Archduke Charles Stephen]] from accepting the crown and declaring his opposition to any German plans for annexation. In response, General Ludendorff agreed to leave Wilno (and possibly [[Minsk]]) to Poland but reaffirmed the \"border strip\" plan. However, this did little to soothe Polish sentiment, which regarded the return of Wilno as self-evident and refused to yield any part of the former [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of Poland (1795\u20131918)]]\n* [[Diplomatic history of World War I]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{in lang|pl}} Immanuel Geiss, Tzw., ''Polski Pas Graniczny 1914-1918'', Warszawa, 1964.\n*{{in lang|pl}} Janusz Pajewski, ''Pierwsza Wojna \u015awiatowa 1914-1918'', Wydawnictwa PWN, 2005.\n*{{in lang|pl}} Piotr Eberhardt, \"Projekty aneksyjne Cesarstwa Niemieckiego wobec ziem polskich podczas I wojny swiatowej in Problematyka geopolityczna ziem polskich\", Warszawa: PAN IGiPZ, 2008.\n* [[Hajo Holborn]], ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840-1945'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1982.\n* Hein Eirch Goemans, ''War and punishment: the causes of war termination and the First World War'', Princeton University Press, 2000.\n*{{in lang|pl}} [http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=3047&from=FBC Pro memoria.

In order to avoid adding the Polish population there to the population of imperial Germany, it was proposed that the Poles would be [[ethnic cleansing|moved]] to a proposed new Polish state further east, while the strip would be resettled with the Germans.<ref>Holborn 1982, p. 449 (see [[#Sources|\"Sources\" section below]]).</ref>\n\nAs World War I started, the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]] conceived of creating a dependent Polish state from territory conquered from Russia, since the majority of all Poles had lived in the area ever since the nation vanished from the European maps, after the [[Partitions of Poland|three splittings of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772\u20131795. This putative Polish kingdom, of limited autonomy, would be ruled by a German prince and have its military, transportation and economy controlled by Germany. Its army and railway network would be placed under [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] command.<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nDuring the first year of the war, German and Austrian troops quickly conquered the Russian [[Vistula Land]], the former [[Congress Poland]], and in 1915, divided its administration between a German Governor General in [[Warsaw]] and an Austrian counterpart in [[Lublin]].<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nRather than focusing on mineral and industrial resources, the purpose of eastern expansion was to strengthen German agriculture, expand [[Junker]] holdings and acquire large settlement areas for the German farmers and settlers. In this way, the German leadership hoped both to appease the Junker elites and, at the same time, ease the class conflicts in its rural areas. In addition, the confiscation of fertile territories was seen as one way of gaining [[war reparation]]s from Russia.<ref>Pajewski 2005, pp. 89-90 (see [[#Sources|\"Sources\" section below]]).</ref>\n{{Polish statehood}}\n\nIn several memoranda sent during 1915 and 1916, [[Hans Hartwig von Beseler]], the Governor-General of the Polish areas under German control, proposed the establishment of an independent Polish state. Under the influence of General [[Erich Ludendorff]], then in effect the director of Germany's eastern European operations, this proposal included the annexation of considerable amounts of land by Prussia, Lithuania and Austria-Hungary. Gerhard von Mutius, cousin of Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg and the foreign office's representative at Beseler's headquarters, disputed the use of annexation, insisting that \"if the military interests allow for it, divisions and secessions should be avoided\", as such a policy would secure an \"anti-Russian inclination [toward] the new Poland\".<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\nAustria-Hungary had three different ideas regarding Poland. One, the \"Austro-Polish solution\", involved the creation of a Polish kingdom under the [[Emperor of Austria]], who, among his other titles, was already [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|King of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. German and [[Magyars|Magyar (Hungarian)]] elements within the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] monarchy opposed such a move for fear of creating a predominantly [[Slavs|Slavic]] area. Unlike [[Francis Joseph of Austria|Emperor Francis Joseph]], however, [[Charles I of Austria]], who had [[Coronation|acceded]] to the Habsburg thrones in 1916, promoted the idea. The other two ideas involved the division of the former Congress Poland between Prussia and Austro-Hungary, or between Austro-Hungary and a state built from Lithuania, [[Belarus]] and the remnants of Congress Poland.<ref>Pajewski 2005, p. 91.</ref>\n\nThe Austrians, however, had underestimated Germany's desire to determine Poland's fate.<ref>Pajewski 2005, pp. 92\u201393.</ref> They did recognise, according to Prime Minister [[Karl von St\u00fcrgkh]], that \"Poles will remain Poles [...] even 150 years after [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was joined to Austria, Poles still didn't become Austrians\".<ref>Pajewski 2005, p. 93.</ref> It was clear to Austrian politicians that the creation of a Polish state along the lines intended by Germany would mean the loss of Galicia, so they proposed its partition and the formation of [[East Galicia]] as an Austrian province.<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nOf the candidates for the new Polish throne, [[Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria]] ({{lang-pl|Karol Stefan}}) and his son [[Archduke Karl Albrecht of Austria|Charles Albert]] were early contenders. Both resided in the Galician city of [[\u017bywiec|Saybusch (now \u017bywiec)]] and spoke Polish fluently. Charles Stephen's daughters were married to the Polish aristocrats Princes [[Czartoryski]] and [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]].\n\nBy early 1916, the \"Austro-Polish solution\" had become hypothetical. [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], the German Chief of the General Staff, had rejected the idea in January, followed by Bethmann-Hollweg in February. Bethmann-Hollweg had been willing to see an Austrian candidate on the new Polish throne, so long as Germany retained control over the Polish economy, resources and army.<ref>Hein Eirch Goemans 2000, p. 104 (see [[#Sources|\"Sources\" section below]]).</ref>\n\nGerman candidates for the throne were disputed between the royal houses of [[Saxony]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]].<ref>Tipton, Frank B.

In October 1916, at joint deliberations at [[Pszczyna]], the German and Austrian leadership agreed to accelerate the proclamation promising creation of a Polish state in the future.<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2007-1001-500, Warschaus Generalgouverneur in Lublin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Governors-General [[Hans Hartwig von Beseler|Beseler]] (first from left) and Kuk (second from left) in 1916]]\n[[File:OkupacjaKP1914-18.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Occupation of the Kingdom of Poland during World War I:{{legend|#699BA9|[[German Empire]]}}{{legend|#3BCECE|Occupied (from Russia) by Germany }}{{legend|#7CB01E|[[Austria-Hungary]]}}{{legend|#9FFE9F|Occupied (from Russia) by Austria-Hungary}}{{legend|#6AAF8B|[[Russian Empire]]}}]]\nIn the meantime, General von Beseler had managed to gain support among pro-Austrian Poles and the followers of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. The [[Narodowa Demokracja]] party (centred in [[Paris]]), however, rejected any cooperation with the Central Powers. After the German Emperor and Chancellor met with a Polish delegation led by [[J\u00f3zef Brudzi\u0144ski]], the final details were arranged. On 5 November 1916, Governor von Beseler at Warsaw issued an [[Act of 5th November]], in which he promised that a Polish state would be created, without specifying any future Polish ruler, Polish borders or system of governance and, for the first time since 1831, had the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] decorated with Polish flags. The Austrian Governor-General Kuk issued a similar proclamation at Lublin. A pro-German faction led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Studnicki]] existed but didn't gain any significant backing among Polish population.\n\nImmediately after the proclamation, the German governor-general in Warsaw issued an advertisement for [[military recruitment]], resulting in Polish protests which especially decried the absence of a Polish government.\n\n===Council of State===\n{{main|Provisional Council of State}}\nOn 14 January 1917, a [[Provisional Council of State]] ({{lang-pl|Tymczasowa Rada Stanu}}) was established as a provisional government, consisting of 15 members chosen by the German and ten by the Austrian authorities. The [[magnate]] [[Waclaw Niemojowski]] was appointed ''[[Marsza\u0142ek|Crown Marshal]]'', with [[J\u00f3zef Miku\u0142owski-Pomorski]] acting as his deputy. [[Franciszek Pius Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] were put in charge of the Military Commission. The Council's first proclamation espoused [[monarchy|monarchical government]], Poland's expansion towards the east and supported an army of volunteers. A ''National Council'' served as a provisional parliament. The Councillors insisted on actual Polish autonomy and, on 21 April, were given authority over education, law courts and [[propaganda]]. Still, students were dissatisfied with the extent of autonomy and organised a strike on 3 May, resulting in the temporary closing of all universities.\n\nMeanwhile, [[U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s proclamation in favor of a unified and independent Poland (on 22 January 1917) and the downfall of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] in the [[February Revolution]] strengthened the Polish forces favoring a neutral or pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] stance.\n\n===Oath crisis===\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]]]\n{{main|Oath crisis}}\n\nIn December 1916, a [[brigade]] of [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish legions]] under [[Stanis\u0142aw Szeptycki]] moved into Warsaw to form the [[officer corps]] of the new Polish army.\n\nOn 21 April, the Council of State had passed a proclamation in favor of the Polish army ({{lang-de|[[Polnische Wehrmacht]]}}) and appointed [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski|Colonel Sikorski]] to oversee recruitment. The relationship between the Central Powers and the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish legions]] became increasingly difficult, especially after the powers barred Austrian subjects from the Legions (now called the Polish auxiliary corps, ''Polski Korpus Posilkowy''), aiming to divert them into the regular Austrian army. Pi\u0142sudski had abstained from the vote on the Polish army, and on 2 July resigned together with two left-wing State Councillors. The [[Polish Army oaths#Polish Legions in World War I|new army's oath]] drafted by the governors-general and passed by the Council of State resulted in a [[oath crisis|political crisis]], especially since it was directed to an unspecified \"future king\" and emphasized the alliance with Germany and Austria. Several legionaries refused to take the oath and were arrested, prompting General von Beseler to arrest Pi\u0142sudski, his associate [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], and have them confined in Germany. In August, the remains of the Legions, roughly ten thousand soldiers, were transferred to the Eastern front. Crown Marshall Niemojowski resigned on 6 August and the Council disbanded on 25 August.\n\n===\"Regency\" constitution===\n[[File:Regency Council.jpg|right|thumb|The Regency Council. Left to right: Ostrowski, [[Aleksander Kakowski|Kakowski]], and [[Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski|Lubomirski]]]]\n{{main|Regency Council (Poland)}}\n\nAfter the intermission of the Temporary Committee of the Provisional Council of State ({{lang-pl|Komisja Przej\u015bciowa Tymczasowej Rady Stanu}}), the Central Powers introduced a provisional constitution, the ''patent'', on 12 September 1917. The ''patent'' devised a constitutional monarchy with a [[bicameral parliament]] but without [[ministerial responsibility]]. Only schools and courts were transferred to Polish authorities, but \u2014 under Polish protests \u2014 the German minority was given a separate school system. Pending the election of a King of Poland, a [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] ({{lang-pl|Rada Regencyjna}}) was installed as a provisional government. On 18 September, the following members of the Council were named: [[Aleksander Kakowski]], [[Archbishop of Warsaw]]; aristocrat [[Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski|Prince Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski]] who had served as mayor of Warsaw in 1916/17; and [[J\u00f3zef Ostrowski]], a great landowner and formerly the leading Polish politician in the Russian [[Duma]].<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nThe Regency Council was ceremonially installed on 15 October, the anniversary of [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]]'s death, and on 26 November, appointed [[Jan Kucharzewski]], a lawyer who had been working in the government since June, as Prime Minister.\n\n[[File:Polish Regents 1916.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Members of the Regency Council with officers of the Polish Army]]\nAdministration, however, strictly remained in the hands of German authorities, now headed by [[Otto von Steinmeister]]. In March 1918, a resolution of the German Reichstag called for the establishment of a native civil administration in Poland, [[Courland|Kurland]] and [[Lithuania]]. However, the German authorities refused to transfer administration to Polish authorities and merely considered Poles as candidates to be trained under German supervision.\n\nAfter the [[oath crisis]] of 1917, recruitment to the Polish army had received scant support and achieved negligible results, reaching merely 5,000 men. In May 1918, the force was strengthened by General [[J\u00f3zef Dowb\u00f3r-Mu\u015bnicki]] moving his Polish corps \u2014 assembled from the former [[Tsarist]] army \u2014 to Poland. In August, the legionaries arrested for refusing the oath were released and some again volunteered for the Polish army.\n\nIn August 1918, [[Pope Pius XI|Achille Ratti]] arrived in Warsaw as apostolic visitor to adjust the [[Catholic Church]] to the altered political circumstances. This appointment was mainly due to the influence of German Chancellor [[Georg von Hertling]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], since 1917 [[Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria|Nuncio to Bavaria]] in Munich.  Ratti gained fame in 1920 for being the only diplomat to stay in Warsaw during the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] and was elected as Pope Pius XI in 1922.\n\n===End of the German plans===\nAfter Germany's 1918 [[Spring Offensive]] had failed to win the war on the Western front, General Ludendorff in September proposed seeking peace based on the plan outlined by U.S. President Wilson in January 1918 in his [[Fourteen Points]], which in regard to Poland demanded the creation of an \"independent Polish state ... guaranteed by international covenant\" with \"free and secure access to the sea\". On 3 October the new German Chancellor, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden|Prince Max of Baden]], announced Germany's acceptance of Wilson's plan and an immediate disestablishment of military administration in the countries occupied by Germany. Three days later the Regency Council in Warsaw also adopted Wilson's proposals as the basis for creating a Polish state.<ref name=\"DavLukZaw\"/>\n\nOn 1 October, General von Beseler had conferred with Hindenburg at Berlin and, informed of the gloomy military situation, had returned to Warsaw ill and dispirited. On 6 October, he handed over administration to Polish civil servants and, on 23 October, transferred the command over Polish forces (which by then included the Polish regiments of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]) to the Regency Council.\n\nHowever, another Polish government based in Lublin arose to challenge the Regency's authority: on 6 November [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]] proclaimed the \"Polish People's Republic\" (''Tymczasowy Rz\u0105d Ludowy Republiki Polskiej'' - literally: \"Temporary People's Council of the Polish Republic\"), with Daszy\u0144ski himself (a Socialist politician and formerly a member of the Austrian parliament) as Prime Minister and Colonel [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] as military commander. Moderates in Warsaw, who now hoped for a return of General Pi\u0142sudski, who was still held in custody at [[Magdeburg]], repudiated Lublin's declaration of the deposition of the Regency to be deposed and its plans for radical social reforms.  Already in October the Regency Council had requested Pi\u0142sudski's release, and after negotiations through [[Harry Graf Kessler]] the General was allowed to return to Warsaw, where he arrived on 10 November. The following day Germany signed the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]] and German troops in Warsaw were disarmed as they refused to fire on Polish insurgents. Both the Regency Council and the Daszy\u0144ski government ceded all authority to Pi\u0142sudski. The Regency dissolved itself three days later.\n\n===Occupation authorities===\nThe occupation authorities included [[Government General of Warsaw|German Governor-General]] at Warsaw, commander-in-chief of the [[Polska Si\u0142a Zbrojna]] \u2014 [[Hans Hartwig von Beseler]] (1 October 1915 \u2013 11 November 1918); as well as the Austro-Hungarian Governors-General at Lublin: including Major General Erich Freiherr von Diller (1 October 1915 \u2013 20 April 1916), Feldzeugmeister Karl Kuk (21 April 1916 \u2013 April 1917); as well as Major General [[Stanislaus Graf Szeptycki]] (April 1917 \u2013 28 February 1918); and the Infantry General Anton Lipo\u0161\u010dak ('''<small>[[:hr:Anton Lipo\u0161\u0107ak|cro]]</small>''') (1 March \u2013 11 November 1918).\n\nThe state authorities within the [[Provisional Council of State]] (14 January \u2013 15 August 1917) included  Waclaw Niemojowski, Crown Marshall (14 January \u2013 6 August 1917); Deputy Marshall J\u00f3zef Miku\u0142owski-Pomorski; and from the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] (15 October 1917 \u2013 14 November 1918), [[Archbishop of Warsaw|Archbishop]] [[Aleksander Kakowski]], Prince [[Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski]], and J\u00f3zef Ostrowski.<ref name=\"Monitor\">[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/92033/BibliographicResource_3000053592371.html  ''Monitor Polski'', z dn. 7 pa\u017adziernika 1918, s. 1.]</ref>\n\n== Borders ==\nIn their proclamation of 5 November 1916, the [[Central Powers]] refused to{{citation needed|reason=Which power demanded that determination? Otherwise the CPs \"didn't determine\", instead of \"refused to determine\"|date=July 2014}} determine the Polish borders.\n\n===Eastern===\nFollowing the [[October Revolution|Bolsheviks taking power in Russia in November 1917]], some Polish politicians sided with Germany as the \"last bulwark of order\" against the Bolshevik threat but Germany's policy of creating several smaller [[client states]] east of Poland, supported especially by the supreme command under Ludendorff, also heightened resistance to German presence in Polish territories.\n\nWith the support of the German military, the [[Council of Lithuania]] proclaimed an independent Lithuanian state on 11 December. Polish sentiment reacted strongly, as it considered [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland and Lithuania to be a historical union]] and especially since it regarded [[Wilno]] (Vilnius), the proposed new Lithuanian capital, as a Polish city.\n\nThe Regency Council sought admission to the negotiations with the Bolshevik government during travels to Berlin and Vienna early in 1918 but only gained German Chancellor [[Georg von Hertling]]'s promise to admit the Polish government in an advisory capacity. This, however, was refused by the Bolshevik representatives, who denied the Polish government any legitimacy. The German representative [[Max Hoffmann]] expressed a belief that \"independent Poland was always considered by me to be a utopia, and I have no doubts regarding my support for Ukrainian claims.\"<ref>Pajewski 643</ref> When the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], signed on 9 February, ceded the province of [[Che\u0142m]] \u2014 which had been part of Congress Poland until 1913 \u2014 to the new [[Ukrainian People's Republic|state of Ukraine]], many in Poland regarded this as a \"[[Partition of Poland#.22Fourth Partition.22|Fourth partition of Poland]]\", prompting a \"political [[general strike]]\" in Warsaw on 14 February and the resignation of the [[Jan Kucharzewski]] administration later that month. Parts of the Polish auxiliary corps under [[J\u00f3zef Haller]] protested by breaking through the Austro-Russian front line to [[Ukraine]], where they united with Polish detachments which had left the [[Tsarist]] army. After a fierce [[Battle of Kani\u00f3w|battle with the German army]] at [[Kaniv|Kani\u00f3w]] in May, the remnants were interned, though Haller managed to escape to Moscow.\n\n===Western===\n{{main|Polish Border Strip}}\nHowever, Poland's unspecified borders were threatened in the West as well: Late in 1917, the German supreme command had proposed annexing a \"[[Polish Border Strip|border strip]]\" to Germany,<ref name=\"border strip\">Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey J. Giles and Walter Pape, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042006889&id=jXKk-gs-VNEC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=%22kingdom+of+Poland%22+1916&sig=NjXAsXW-c7jn2mG-QckYol3iCoI Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identity and Cultural Differences]'', Rodopi, 1999, {{ISBN|90-420-0678-1}}, p. 28-9</ref> a policy earlier suggested by a letter to the German government by members of Poland's German minority, settled around [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. Such plans were agreed to in principle by the German government in March 1918 and in April gained support in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] but were strongly opposed by General von Beseler in a report to Emperor William.\n\nIn July, Ludendorff specified his plans in a memorandum, proposing annexing a greatly enlarged \"border strip\" of 20,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\"Goemans\">Hein Erich Goemans, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8sQOlYk032oC&q=Kingdom+Poland+1916 War and Punishment: The Causes of War Termination and the First World War]'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|0-691-04944-0}}, pp. 104\u2013105</ref><ref name=\"border strip\"/> In August, [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Charles of Austria]] insisted on the Austro-Polish option, forbidding [[Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria|Archduke Charles Stephen]] from accepting the crown and declaring his opposition to any German plans for annexation. In response, General Ludendorff agreed to leave Wilno (and possibly [[Minsk]]) to Poland but reaffirmed the \"border strip\" plan. However, this did little to soothe Polish sentiment, which regarded the return of Wilno as self-evident and refused to yield any part of the former [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of Poland (1795\u20131918)]]\n* [[Diplomatic history of World War I]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{in lang|pl}} Immanuel Geiss, Tzw., ''Polski Pas Graniczny 1914-1918'', Warszawa, 1964.\n*{{in lang|pl}} Janusz Pajewski, ''Pierwsza Wojna \u015awiatowa 1914-1918'', Wydawnictwa PWN, 2005.\n*{{in lang|pl}} Piotr Eberhardt, \"Projekty aneksyjne Cesarstwa Niemieckiego wobec ziem polskich podczas I wojny swiatowej in Problematyka geopolityczna ziem polskich\", Warszawa: PAN IGiPZ, 2008.\n* [[Hajo Holborn]], ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840-1945'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1982.\n* Hein Eirch Goemans, ''War and punishment: the causes of war termination and the First World War'', Princeton University Press, 2000.\n*{{in lang|pl}} [http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=3047&from=FBC Pro memoria.

During the next two centuries, the Highlands area would welcome [[English people|English]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers.  Even by the 20th Century, many [[immigrants]] saw the hills of the Highlands of [[Navesink Highlands|Navesink]] which were almost {{convert|300|ft}} above sea level.\n\nThe oldest route to the eastern coast of the United States is the Minisink Trail which started on the upper [[Delaware River]], came through northern [[New Jersey]] and ended at the [[Navesink River]]. Navesink means \"good fishing spot\" in the native tongue at the time.  The trail was used by Native Americans, such as the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and Lenni Lenapi tribes.  They came from all over New Jersey to spend the summer fishing and finding clams. The Newasunks, [[Raritans]], and Sachem Papomorga (or Lenni Lenapis) were the most prevalent tribes and stayed the longest. These were the tribes which mostly traded with early settlers.\n\nOne year after Verrazzano explored the area, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer Estevan Gomez visited the Highlands of Navesink and created the first maps of the area. These were the maps in which [[Sandy Hook]] was first drawn and called \"Cabo de Arenas\" or \"Cape of Sands\".\n\nIn 1609, [[Henry Hudson]] sailed into the [[Sandy Hook Bay]] and wrote: \"This is very good land to fall in with and a pleasant land to see. Our men went on land, so they went up into the woods and saw great stores of very goodly oaks and some currants\". One of Hudson's crew became the first man killed by Native Americans who were frightened by his scouting party.\n\nMany years after Hudson's trip to the area, the Highlands of Navesink saw a number of Dutch who traded with the Navesink Indians and prepared nautical charts. William Reape, one of the Dutch, made a bargain with the local natives to trade land in exchange for rum, blankets and gunpowder.\n\nEventually, the Dutch settlers named the land \"Rensselaer's Hoeck,\" but British settlers took over and renamed the settlement \"Portland\" in 1664. The group purchasing the land included James Hubbard, John Bawne, John Tilton Jr., [[Richard Stout]], [[William Goulding]] and Samuel Spear.\n\nThree years later, in 1677, [[Richard Hartshorne (1641 - 1722)|Richard Hartshorne]] purchased a {{convert|2320|acre|adj=on}} tract of land from the Native Americans which provided him with control of nearly all of Sandy Hook and Highlands which was then called \"Portland Poynt.\" Hartshorne and his family became the first permanent settlers of the area.\n\nSome early settlers soon realized the importance Highlands and Sandy Hook would have in the defense of the country.  People in Highlands and Sandy Hook could warn New York of any enemies approaching by sea and also to help guide ships into [[New York harbor]]. In 1762, New York merchants purchased a four-acre site from the Hartshorne family for a light house. Two years later, the Sandy Hook Light House was lighted for the first time.\n\nThe hills of the Highlands of Navasink and Sandy Hook also played an important role during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  It was a vital strategic site for the British and Colonial Armies.  When the British fleet arrived close to Sandy Hook in 1776, sympathizers with the British built fortifications and with the help of the British were able to hold Sandy Hook for the remainder of the Revolutionary War.  The [[Loyalists]] stayed in control of Sandy Hook even after the war was ended by the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781.\n\nCaptain [[Joshua Huddy]] was the eldest of seven brothers and a member of the Monmouth Continental Militia.  He pursued gangs of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] ([[Loyalist]]) refugees who plundered the area searching for American rebels.  The refugees made Huddy a target and tried to kill him several times.  Unfortunately, one of the Loyalists' raids from Sandy Hook ended with setting Huddy's house on fire. Huddy agreed to surrender if they would help him to put out the fire. They agreed and took Huddy as a prisoner.  The fire from the house had attracted the attention of Huddy's neighbors and the local militia raced after the Tories, catching them before they could reach their boats at Black Point in [[Rumson, New Jersey|Rumson]].  In the fight that ensued, Huddy escaped.\n\nHowever, two years later the Loyalists captured Huddy and brought him to [[Gravelly Point]] in Highlands where he was allowed to write his will.  Then Huddy was hanged for the death of Captain Philip White who had been captured by Rebels earlier in Long Branch and shot while being transported to [[Freehold Township, New Jersey|Freehold]].  Huddy was not involved in the shooting, as he was in a British prison at the time, but was hanged anyway.  His body was carried by patriots to Freehold and buried.  Today, a monument in Huddy Park honors Captain Joshua Huddy.\n\nIn 1796, the first hotel in the Highlands of Navesink was built and many other hotels were built until the War of 1812.  Two years later, the tourism began to grow and new hotels were built on Sandy Hook and on the hills of Highlands.  In addition, a number of new homes were being built and visitors were coming to Highlands by the boatload.\n\nAuthor [[James Fenimore Cooper]], author of ''[[Last of the Mohicans]]'', also wrote ''Water Witch'', a novel which was inspired by his visits to Highlands.  [[Walt Whitman]], one of America's most famous poets, celebrated his excursions to Highlands in his journals and a group of his poems entitled, \"Fancies at Navesink.\"<ref name=Pallone>[[Frank Pallone|Pallone, Frank]].

It was the beginning of a glorious era for the small town on the Shrewsbury River. Trains and steamships brought vacationers to celebrate post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prosperity.\n\nNew York theatrical producers and famous actors built summer homes in Highlands.  The area became so popular that ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' sent a journalist down nearly every summer in the 1870s and 1880s to write about the community and its people.<ref name=Pallone/>\n\nThe Seashore Railroad had been built on the Sandy Hook peninsula during 1865 and a ferry service was established to take passengers across the river from Highlands to his hotel on Sandy Hook.  Then a bridge was constructed in 1872 and the ferry service ceased operations. The new drawbridge was about {{convert|1500|ft}} and {{convert|18|ft}} wide.  It was constructed at a cost of $35,000 and opened in 1872, but was closed for three years when a [[schooner]] ran into it in 1875.<ref name=Pallone/> By 1883, a railroad came to [[Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey|Atlantic Highlands]] and in 1892 the old [[draw bridge]] at Highlands was torn down and a new railroad bridge was built by the New Jersey Central Railroad Company for their coastal line. This new bridge for rail, vehicular, and foot traffic was opened in 1892.<ref name=Pallone/>\n\nOn Lighthouse Hill were the Twin Lights which is one of the most historic sites in the nation.  Built in 1862, it was the first twin light house, the first electric powered light, the first glimpse of America for incoming ships, the first in the nation to use the [[Fresnel lens]], the first to use [[wireless telegraphy]], and the site of the first experiments with [[radar]].<ref>Staff.

The beacon - whale oil burned in pots - was not only to welcome sailors, but to warn citizens that the French were coming up the harbor and it was time to take down the musket from over the fireplace. During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the beacon served the same purpose, only Britain was the enemy.<ref>[http://www.njlhs.org/njlight/letter.html Letter from President John Hamilton to the Council of New York-relating to the destruction of the Beacon on the Highlands of Neversink], New Jersey Lighthouse Society.

A beacon system was established near the site of the present Twin Lights, that was to be used in the event the French decided to invade New York.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1899, [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the inventor of wireless telegraphy demonstrated his invention at the Twin Lights so the ''[[New York Herald]]'' could be the first to have news of the 1899 [[America's Cup]] races to be run off the New Jersey Coast.<ref>Stattel, Erin O.

By 1932, however, century-long [[steamboat]] operations on the Shrewsbury and Navesink Rivers came quickly to an end.\n\nBefore [[World War II]], the northern tower was the first place where experiments with radar were held. So successful were the tests that, soon after the war, [[radar]] was the major tool of navigation and the government decided to decommission the Twin Lights and abandon the building as an operative light house.\n\nDuring 1900, Highlands was incorporated and passed an ordinance prohibiting horses, cows and pigs from running loose on the streets. It also ordered that three-inch hemlock and chestnut planking be used as curbs along the officially designated streets.\n\nBy 1920 the \"manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors\" was prohibited. However, \"[[rum-running]]\" was a common practice for New Jersey's beachfront and Highlands became the main port for the infamous trade. Highlands also had great boat-building facilities which could produce boats faster than the authorities could catch. The [[Jersey Skiff]], designed and built in Highlands, became the primary craft to be used in the smuggling operations.\n\nHighlands became known for [[sport fishing]] in the 1920s.  Today, countless boats can be seen in the rivers, bays and ocean to catch [[Summer flounder|fluke]], [[bluefish]], [[striped bass]] or [[whiting (fish)|whiting]].\n\n[[Clamming]] was an important activity here for the Native Americans and the first settlers learned from them.  A writer in 1890 reported that clams were to Parkertown what the whale once was to Nantucket.\n\n[[Gertrude Ederle]] spent all of her summers in Highlands and learned to swim at the beach on Miller Street.  She would swim from Sandy Hook to the Highlands Bridge in two hours and forty minutes to train for her famous [[English Channel]] swim in 1926.  She became the first woman to swim the English Channel, and also the first to be given a ticker-tape parade on Broadway.

During the next two centuries, the Highlands area would welcome [[English people|English]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers.  Even by the 20th Century, many [[immigrants]] saw the hills of the Highlands of [[Navesink Highlands|Navesink]] which were almost {{convert|300|ft}} above sea level.\n\nThe oldest route to the eastern coast of the United States is the Minisink Trail which started on the upper [[Delaware River]], came through northern [[New Jersey]] and ended at the [[Navesink River]]. Navesink means \"good fishing spot\" in the native tongue at the time.  The trail was used by Native Americans, such as the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and Lenni Lenapi tribes.  They came from all over New Jersey to spend the summer fishing and finding clams. The Newasunks, [[Raritans]], and Sachem Papomorga (or Lenni Lenapis) were the most prevalent tribes and stayed the longest. These were the tribes which mostly traded with early settlers.\n\nOne year after Verrazzano explored the area, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer Estevan Gomez visited the Highlands of Navesink and created the first maps of the area. These were the maps in which [[Sandy Hook]] was first drawn and called \"Cabo de Arenas\" or \"Cape of Sands\".\n\nIn 1609, [[Henry Hudson]] sailed into the [[Sandy Hook Bay]] and wrote: \"This is very good land to fall in with and a pleasant land to see. Our men went on land, so they went up into the woods and saw great stores of very goodly oaks and some currants\". One of Hudson's crew became the first man killed by Native Americans who were frightened by his scouting party.\n\nMany years after Hudson's trip to the area, the Highlands of Navesink saw a number of Dutch who traded with the Navesink Indians and prepared nautical charts. William Reape, one of the Dutch, made a bargain with the local natives to trade land in exchange for rum, blankets and gunpowder.\n\nEventually, the Dutch settlers named the land \"Rensselaer's Hoeck,\" but British settlers took over and renamed the settlement \"Portland\" in 1664. The group purchasing the land included James Hubbard, John Bawne, John Tilton Jr., [[Richard Stout]], [[William Goulding]] and Samuel Spear.\n\nThree years later, in 1677, [[Richard Hartshorne (1641 - 1722)|Richard Hartshorne]] purchased a {{convert|2320|acre|adj=on}} tract of land from the Native Americans which provided him with control of nearly all of Sandy Hook and Highlands which was then called \"Portland Poynt.\" Hartshorne and his family became the first permanent settlers of the area.\n\nSome early settlers soon realized the importance Highlands and Sandy Hook would have in the defense of the country.  People in Highlands and Sandy Hook could warn New York of any enemies approaching by sea and also to help guide ships into [[New York harbor]]. In 1762, New York merchants purchased a four-acre site from the Hartshorne family for a light house. Two years later, the Sandy Hook Light House was lighted for the first time.\n\nThe hills of the Highlands of Navasink and Sandy Hook also played an important role during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  It was a vital strategic site for the British and Colonial Armies.  When the British fleet arrived close to Sandy Hook in 1776, sympathizers with the British built fortifications and with the help of the British were able to hold Sandy Hook for the remainder of the Revolutionary War.  The [[Loyalists]] stayed in control of Sandy Hook even after the war was ended by the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781.\n\nCaptain [[Joshua Huddy]] was the eldest of seven brothers and a member of the Monmouth Continental Militia.  He pursued gangs of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] ([[Loyalist]]) refugees who plundered the area searching for American rebels.  The refugees made Huddy a target and tried to kill him several times.  Unfortunately, one of the Loyalists' raids from Sandy Hook ended with setting Huddy's house on fire. Huddy agreed to surrender if they would help him to put out the fire. They agreed and took Huddy as a prisoner.  The fire from the house had attracted the attention of Huddy's neighbors and the local militia raced after the Tories, catching them before they could reach their boats at Black Point in [[Rumson, New Jersey|Rumson]].  In the fight that ensued, Huddy escaped.\n\nHowever, two years later the Loyalists captured Huddy and brought him to [[Gravelly Point]] in Highlands where he was allowed to write his will.  Then Huddy was hanged for the death of Captain Philip White who had been captured by Rebels earlier in Long Branch and shot while being transported to [[Freehold Township, New Jersey|Freehold]].  Huddy was not involved in the shooting, as he was in a British prison at the time, but was hanged anyway.  His body was carried by patriots to Freehold and buried.  Today, a monument in Huddy Park honors Captain Joshua Huddy.\n\nIn 1796, the first hotel in the Highlands of Navesink was built and many other hotels were built until the War of 1812.  Two years later, the tourism began to grow and new hotels were built on Sandy Hook and on the hills of Highlands.  In addition, a number of new homes were being built and visitors were coming to Highlands by the boatload.\n\nAuthor [[James Fenimore Cooper]], author of ''[[Last of the Mohicans]]'', also wrote ''Water Witch'', a novel which was inspired by his visits to Highlands.  [[Walt Whitman]], one of America's most famous poets, celebrated his excursions to Highlands in his journals and a group of his poems entitled, \"Fancies at Navesink.\"<ref name=Pallone>[[Frank Pallone|Pallone, Frank]].

It was the beginning of a glorious era for the small town on the Shrewsbury River. Trains and steamships brought vacationers to celebrate post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prosperity.\n\nNew York theatrical producers and famous actors built summer homes in Highlands.  The area became so popular that ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' sent a journalist down nearly every summer in the 1870s and 1880s to write about the community and its people.<ref name=Pallone/>\n\nThe Seashore Railroad had been built on the Sandy Hook peninsula during 1865 and a ferry service was established to take passengers across the river from Highlands to his hotel on Sandy Hook.  Then a bridge was constructed in 1872 and the ferry service ceased operations. The new drawbridge was about {{convert|1500|ft}} and {{convert|18|ft}} wide.  It was constructed at a cost of $35,000 and opened in 1872, but was closed for three years when a [[schooner]] ran into it in 1875.<ref name=Pallone/> By 1883, a railroad came to [[Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey|Atlantic Highlands]] and in 1892 the old [[draw bridge]] at Highlands was torn down and a new railroad bridge was built by the New Jersey Central Railroad Company for their coastal line. This new bridge for rail, vehicular, and foot traffic was opened in 1892.<ref name=Pallone/>\n\nOn Lighthouse Hill were the Twin Lights which is one of the most historic sites in the nation.  Built in 1862, it was the first twin light house, the first electric powered light, the first glimpse of America for incoming ships, the first in the nation to use the [[Fresnel lens]], the first to use [[wireless telegraphy]], and the site of the first experiments with [[radar]].<ref>Staff.

The beacon - whale oil burned in pots - was not only to welcome sailors, but to warn citizens that the French were coming up the harbor and it was time to take down the musket from over the fireplace. During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the beacon served the same purpose, only Britain was the enemy.<ref>[http://www.njlhs.org/njlight/letter.html Letter from President John Hamilton to the Council of New York-relating to the destruction of the Beacon on the Highlands of Neversink], New Jersey Lighthouse Society.

A beacon system was established near the site of the present Twin Lights, that was to be used in the event the French decided to invade New York.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1899, [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the inventor of wireless telegraphy demonstrated his invention at the Twin Lights so the ''[[New York Herald]]'' could be the first to have news of the 1899 [[America's Cup]] races to be run off the New Jersey Coast.<ref>Stattel, Erin O.

By 1932, however, century-long [[steamboat]] operations on the Shrewsbury and Navesink Rivers came quickly to an end.\n\nBefore [[World War II]], the northern tower was the first place where experiments with radar were held. So successful were the tests that, soon after the war, [[radar]] was the major tool of navigation and the government decided to decommission the Twin Lights and abandon the building as an operative light house.\n\nDuring 1900, Highlands was incorporated and passed an ordinance prohibiting horses, cows and pigs from running loose on the streets. It also ordered that three-inch hemlock and chestnut planking be used as curbs along the officially designated streets.\n\nBy 1920 the \"manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors\" was prohibited. However, \"[[rum-running]]\" was a common practice for New Jersey's beachfront and Highlands became the main port for the infamous trade. Highlands also had great boat-building facilities which could produce boats faster than the authorities could catch. The [[Jersey Skiff]], designed and built in Highlands, became the primary craft to be used in the smuggling operations.\n\nHighlands became known for [[sport fishing]] in the 1920s.  Today, countless boats can be seen in the rivers, bays and ocean to catch [[Summer flounder|fluke]], [[bluefish]], [[striped bass]] or [[whiting (fish)|whiting]].\n\n[[Clamming]] was an important activity here for the Native Americans and the first settlers learned from them.  A writer in 1890 reported that clams were to Parkertown what the whale once was to Nantucket.\n\n[[Gertrude Ederle]] spent all of her summers in Highlands and learned to swim at the beach on Miller Street.  She would swim from Sandy Hook to the Highlands Bridge in two hours and forty minutes to train for her famous [[English Channel]] swim in 1926.  She became the first woman to swim the English Channel, and also the first to be given a ticker-tape parade on Broadway. Ederle attended the 1975 dedication of a park in Highlands named in her honor.<ref>[https://www.highlandsnj.com/gardenclub/Projects-Ederle.html Ederle Park], Borough of Highlands.

{"title_page": "Book discussion club", "text_new": "{{External links|date=March 2019}}\nA '''book discussion club''' is a group of people who meet to discuss a book or books that they have [[reading (activity)|read]] and express their opinions, likes, dislikes, etc. It is more often called simply a '''book club''', a term that is also used to describe a [[book sales club]], which can cause confusion. Other frequently used terms to describe a book discussion club include '''reading group''', '''book group''', and '''book discussion group'''. Book discussion clubs may meet in private homes, [[library|libraries]], [[bookstore]]s, online forums, pubs, and in caf\u00e9s or restaurants over meals or drinks.\n\nA practice also associated with book discussion, '''common reading program''' or '''common read''', involves institutions encouraging their members to discuss select books in group settings; common reading programs are largely associated with educational institutions encouraging their students to hold book discussion meetings.\n\n== Single-title clubs ==\nA single-title club is one in which people discuss a particular title that every person in the group has read at the same time, often with each member buying a personal copy. Clearly, the club must somehow decide ahead of time what that title will be. Some groups may decide to choose new release titles, whilst others may choose older ones, or a mixture of the two. If it is a book discussion club that meets at a library, then each member may borrow a copy of the book from the library over a given timeframe in order for a later discussion.\n\nThere may be a few problems with these clubs. Some members may regard them as opportunities to meet people for social contact and general conversation, partially veering off onto a wide variety of non-literary topics, while others wish to engage in serious literary analysis focused on the book in question and related works, with little non-literary interaction. Additionally, some members may suggest a book not because they are interested in it from a literary point-of-view but because they think it will offer them an opportunity to make points of personal interest to them or fit an external agenda. Also, different expectations and education/skill levels may lead to conflicts and disappointments in clubs of this kind.\n\n== Multi-title clubs ==\nThe characteristics of a multi-title club are such that each member may be reading different titles from each other at any given time, and they may share a reading list for a period of time. What distinguishes this from any group of unrelated people reading different things from each other is that each title is expected to be read by the next member in a serial fashion.\n\n=== Open loans ===\nOpen loans suggest that the books in question are free to be loaned among the population with the expectation of getting them back eventually. Instead of one member deciding what everyone will read, with all the cost implications of acquiring that title, these clubs usually involve circulating books they already own. Each book is introduced with a short precis. This offers members the advantage of previewing a work before committing to read. It has the effect of narrowing the focus of the dialogue so that book and reader are more quickly and more accurately matched up. The sequential nature of the process implies that within a short time, three to five people may have read the same title, which is the perfect amount for a worthy conversation.\n\n=== Catch and release ===\nCatch and release imply that actual ownership of the book transfers each iteration with no expectation of the book returning to the original owner. The mechanism of transfer may include a personal face to face hand off, sending the items through the mail, or most remarkably, leaving the book in a public place with the expectation that unknown future readers will find it there. All three methods are utilized with [[BookCrossing]]. Participants use a website and a system of unique identification numbers to track released items as they migrate through a worldwide community. The interaction is largely web-centric, but it does not exclude face-to-face gatherings, each of which can take on the traits of other book discussion clubs.\n\n==Library book clubs==\nMany [[public library|public libraries]] lead book clubs as a library program on a regular basis.  A librarian usually leads a discussion after participants read the book.  Copies of the book are available to either be checked out or signed out for the group meeting.  If leading a book discussion group outside of the facility,  often libraries offer book discussion kits where several titles of a book are able to be loaned out of the library to a single patron.  Also, the lending period is typically longer than for the average book.  The kits also contains a suggested reading guide with discussion questions.  This is a convenience as everyone in the group is not forced to buy a copy of the book.<ref>Hermes, V., Hill, M.A., & Frisbee, J. L. (2008). Reviving literary discussion: Book club to go kits. ''Reference & User Services Quarterly, 48''(1), 30-34.</ref>\n\nLibrarians also aid in the procurement of items needed for private book club meetings. They are able to withhold multiple copies of a publication and extend loan periods. They are also able to facilitate club meetings digitally, through discussion boards or video meetings. Many librarians note the positive influence of [[Google+]] hangouts and [[Skype]] to host meetings for long distance club members and for times in which all members could not attend the club. Librarians have helped non-traditional book clubs find footing within their community.<ref>Gilliss, A. F. (2014). A novel idea: librarians reimagine book clubs with the help of technology. American Libraries, (5). 45.</ref>\n\n== Online clubs ==\nWith the challenge that not all members of a club can regularly meet at an appointed place and time, a new form of book clubs has emerged online. Online clubs exist in the shape of [[Internet forum]]s, [[Yahoo Groups]], e-mail [[mailing list]]s, dedicated websites, such as Goodreads.com,<ref>Goodreads. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.goodreads.com/group</ref> apps such as [http://novellic.com Novellic] and even telephone conference calls. Also, in the category of [[social networks]], these online clubs are made up of members of a variety of reading interests and often approach book discussion in different ways, e.g. academic discussion, pleasure-reading discussion, personal connection, and reaction to books members read.\n\n== Author led clubs ==\nIn 2012, a new book club format referred to as author-led book clubs was introduced by Business Book Club \"[http://www.12booksgroup.com 12 Books].\" Author led book clubs include the author of the current book as part of the discussion; it often concludes the discussion with a live [[conference call]] or [[webinar]].\n\n== Broadcast clubs ==\nA broadcast club is one in which a television, radio, or podcast show features a regular segment that presents a discussion of a book. The segment is announced in advance so that viewers or listeners may read the book prior to the broadcast discussion. Some notable broadcast book discussion clubs include:\n\n* \"[[Oprah's Book Club]]\", a segment of the American television show ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' hosted by [[Oprah Winfrey]]\n* \"[[Book Club of the Air]]\", a segment of [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s American radio show ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'' hosted by [[Ray Suarez]]\n* \"Good Morning America Book Club\", a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s American television show ''[[Good Morning America]]''\n* \"Despierta Leyendo (Wake Up Reading)\", a segment of [[Univision]]'s American Spanish-language television show ''[[\u00a1Despierta Am\u00e9rica!]] (Wake Up America)'' hosted by [[Jorge Ramos (news anchor)|Jorge Ramos]]\n* \"[[Richard & Judy#Richard .26 Judy Book Club|Richard & Judy Book Club]]\", a segment of [[Channel 4]]'s British television show ''[[Richard & Judy]]'' hosted by [[Richard and Judy|Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan]]\n* ''[[Bookclub (radio)|Bookclub]]'', a British radio show on the [[BBC Radio 4]] station hosted by [[James Naughtie]]\n* ''[[First Tuesday Book Club]]'', an Australian television show on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] network hosted by [[Jennifer Byrne]]\n* \"Jonny's Book Club\", a segment of the weekly [[podcast]] ''[[Gay Pimpin' with Jonny McGovern]]'' hosted by [[Jonny McGovern]]\n\n== Book reading clubs ==\nGiven the busy lifestyles of today, another variation on the traditional 'book club' is the book reading club. In such a club, the group agrees on a specific book, and each week (or whatever frequency), one person in the group [[Reading (process)#History|reads the book out loud]] while the rest of the group listens. The group can either allow interruptions for comments and questions from the members at any time, or agree to allow such input at chapter or section endings. Such a club makes reading a shared experience and frees the busy members from the \"homework\" of having read the book before coming to the club. It also creates a lively environment for commenting on the specifics of the books as it is read and can lead to very enriching exchanges. A given book may continue for several sittings, depending on the pace of reading, frequency of meetings, and the extent of comments and discussion. Members can take turns reading to share the reading responsibility. Another variation on the concept could be jointly listening to an audio-book with pauses for comments. Once a book is completed, members recommend their choices of the new books and vote on which book to proceed with next.\n\n== Organizations ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150406084202/http://www.bookbuffet.com/ BookBuffet] is a website directed toward book groups and avid readers with literary news, book reviews, author podcasts, technology tips, and vetted resource links. Members register their group to use a set of tools where they can maintain a joint calendar, communicate, and keep track of books their group has read as well as rate books and share reviews. Book group moderators (people who lead book groups) can keep track of all their various client groups, communicate, and share information in chat forums. There is also a \"find a group\" feature for people looking to join an existing group. Founded by Paula Shackleton. \n* New Zealand's only nationwide book group specialist is Book Discussion Scheme.\n*they all die\n* [http://www.readerscircle.org/ Reader's Circle] is a book club where people attend with whatever they're reading. The only structure is if participants decide to have an 'optional book.' Otherwise, people just bring their own books, articles, magazines, and conversation goes from there.\n* [[Great Books Foundation]] is a nonprofit educational organization established in 1947 that publishes collections of classic and modern literature for use in book discussion clubs. It also offers workshops in conducting book discussions.\n* [[Library of Congress]] [[Center for the Book]] is a program of the Library of Congress' Library Services division that promotes community-wide book discussion groups through its \"One Book\" project.\n* [http://www.book-surfing.com BookSurfing] is a social network based book discussion club that uses Facebook as its platform to organize and set up meetings. A moderator sets up a Facebook event and selects eight people who meet at one of the participants house for a \"Surf\". Every participant reads the text he brings out loud to the entire group.

"{{External links|date=March 2019}}\nA '''book discussion club''' is a group of people who meet to discuss a book or books that they have [[reading (activity)|read]] and express their opinions, likes, dislikes, etc. It is more often called simply a '''book club''', a term that is also used to describe a [[book sales club]], which can cause confusion. Other frequently used terms to describe a book discussion club include '''reading group''', '''book group''', and '''book discussion group'''. Book discussion clubs may meet in private homes, [[library|libraries]], [[bookstore]]s, online forums, pubs, and in caf\u00e9s or restaurants over meals or drinks.\n\nA practice also associated with book discussion, '''common reading program''' or '''common read''', involves institutions encouraging their members to discuss select books in group settings; common reading programs are largely associated with educational institutions encouraging their students to hold book discussion meetings.\n\n== Single-title clubs ==\nA single-title club is one in which people discuss a particular title that every person in the group has read at the same time, often with each member buying a personal copy. Clearly, the club must somehow decide ahead of time what that title will be. Some groups may decide to choose new release titles, whilst others may choose older ones, or a mixture of the two. If it is a book discussion club that meets at a library, then each member may borrow a copy of the book from the library over a given timeframe in order for a later discussion.\n\nThere may be a few problems with these clubs. Some members may regard them as opportunities to meet people for social contact and general conversation, partially veering off onto a wide variety of non-literary topics, while others wish to engage in serious literary analysis focused on the book in question and related works, with little non-literary interaction. Additionally, some members may suggest a book not because they are interested in it from a literary point-of-view but because they think it will offer them an opportunity to make points of personal interest to them or fit an external agenda. Also, different expectations and education/skill levels may lead to conflicts and disappointments in clubs of this kind.\n\n== Multi-title clubs ==\nThe characteristics of a multi-title club are such that each member may be reading different titles from each other at any given time, and they may share a reading list for a period of time. What distinguishes this from any group of unrelated people reading different things from each other is that each title is expected to be read by the next member in a serial fashion.\n\n=== Open loans ===\nOpen loans suggest that the books in question are free to be loaned among the population with the expectation of getting them back eventually. Instead of one member deciding what everyone will read, with all the cost implications of acquiring that title, these clubs usually involve circulating books they already own. Each book is introduced with a short precis. This offers members the advantage of previewing a work before committing to read. It has the effect of narrowing the focus of the dialogue so that book and reader are more quickly and more accurately matched up. The sequential nature of the process implies that within a short time, three to five people may have read the same title, which is the perfect amount for a worthy conversation.\n\n=== Catch and release ===\nCatch and release imply that actual ownership of the book transfers each iteration with no expectation of the book returning to the original owner. The mechanism of transfer may include a personal face to face hand off, sending the items through the mail, or most remarkably, leaving the book in a public place with the expectation that unknown future readers will find it there. All three methods are utilized with [[BookCrossing]]. Participants use a website and a system of unique identification numbers to track released items as they migrate through a worldwide community. The interaction is largely web-centric, but it does not exclude face-to-face gatherings, each of which can take on the traits of other book discussion clubs.\n\n==Library book clubs==\nMany [[public library|public libraries]] lead book clubs as a library program on a regular basis.  A librarian usually leads a discussion after participants read the book.  Copies of the book are available to either be checked out or signed out for the group meeting.  If leading a book discussion group outside of the facility,  often libraries offer book discussion kits where several titles of a book are able to be loaned out of the library to a single patron.  Also, the lending period is typically longer than for the average book.  The kits also contains a suggested reading guide with discussion questions.  This is a convenience as everyone in the group is not forced to buy a copy of the book.<ref>Hermes, V., Hill, M.A., & Frisbee, J. L. (2008). Reviving literary discussion: Book club to go kits. ''Reference & User Services Quarterly, 48''(1), 30-34.</ref>\n\nLibrarians also aid in the procurement of items needed for private book club meetings. They are able to withhold multiple copies of a publication and extend loan periods. They are also able to facilitate club meetings digitally, through discussion boards or video meetings. Many librarians note the positive influence of [[Google+]] hangouts and [[Skype]] to host meetings for long distance club members and for times in which all members could not attend the club. Librarians have helped non-traditional book clubs find footing within their community.<ref>Gilliss, A. F. (2014). A novel idea: librarians reimagine book clubs with the help of technology. American Libraries, (5). 45.</ref>\n\n== Online clubs ==\nWith the challenge that not all members of a club can regularly meet at an appointed place and time, a new form of book clubs has emerged online. Online clubs exist in the shape of [[Internet forum]]s, [[Yahoo Groups]], e-mail [[mailing list]]s, dedicated websites, such as Goodreads.com,<ref>Goodreads. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.goodreads.com/group</ref> apps such as [http://novellic.com Novellic] and even telephone conference calls. Also, in the category of [[social networks]], these online clubs are made up of members of a variety of reading interests and often approach book discussion in different ways, e.g. academic discussion, pleasure-reading discussion, personal connection, and reaction to books members read.\n\n== Author led clubs ==\nIn 2012, a new book club format referred to as author-led book clubs was introduced by Business Book Club \"[http://www.12booksgroup.com 12 Books].\" Author led book clubs include the author of the current book as part of the discussion; it often concludes the discussion with a live [[conference call]] or [[webinar]].\n\n== Broadcast clubs ==\nA broadcast club is one in which a television, radio, or podcast show features a regular segment that presents a discussion of a book. The segment is announced in advance so that viewers or listeners may read the book prior to the broadcast discussion. Some notable broadcast book discussion clubs include:\n\n* \"[[Oprah's Book Club]]\", a segment of the American television show ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' hosted by [[Oprah Winfrey]]\n* \"[[Book Club of the Air]]\", a segment of [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s American radio show ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'' hosted by [[Ray Suarez]]\n* \"Good Morning America Book Club\", a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s American television show ''[[Good Morning America]]''\n* \"Despierta Leyendo (Wake Up Reading)\", a segment of [[Univision]]'s American Spanish-language television show ''[[\u00a1Despierta Am\u00e9rica!]] (Wake Up America)'' hosted by [[Jorge Ramos (news anchor)|Jorge Ramos]]\n* \"[[Richard & Judy#Richard .26 Judy Book Club|Richard & Judy Book Club]]\", a segment of [[Channel 4]]'s British television show ''[[Richard & Judy]]'' hosted by [[Richard and Judy|Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan]]\n* ''[[Bookclub (radio)|Bookclub]]'', a British radio show on the [[BBC Radio 4]] station hosted by [[James Naughtie]]\n* ''[[First Tuesday Book Club]]'', an Australian television show on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] network hosted by [[Jennifer Byrne]]\n* \"Jonny's Book Club\", a segment of the weekly [[podcast]] ''[[Gay Pimpin' with Jonny McGovern]]'' hosted by [[Jonny McGovern]]\n\n== Book reading clubs ==\nGiven the busy lifestyles of today, another variation on the traditional 'book club' is the book reading club. In such a club, the group agrees on a specific book, and each week (or whatever frequency), one person in the group [[Reading (process)#History|reads the book out loud]] while the rest of the group listens. The group can either allow interruptions for comments and questions from the members at any time, or agree to allow such input at chapter or section endings. Such a club makes reading a shared experience and frees the busy members from the \"homework\" of having read the book before coming to the club. It also creates a lively environment for commenting on the specifics of the books as it is read and can lead to very enriching exchanges. A given book may continue for several sittings, depending on the pace of reading, frequency of meetings, and the extent of comments and discussion. Members can take turns reading to share the reading responsibility. Another variation on the concept could be jointly listening to an audio-book with pauses for comments. Once a book is completed, members recommend their choices of the new books and vote on which book to proceed with next.\n\n== Organizations ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150406084202/http://www.bookbuffet.com/ BookBuffet] is a website directed toward book groups and avid readers with literary news, book reviews, author podcasts, technology tips, and vetted resource links. Members register their group to use a set of tools where they can maintain a joint calendar, communicate, and keep track of books their group has read as well as rate books and share reviews. Book group moderators (people who lead book groups) can keep track of all their various client groups, communicate, and share information in chat forums.

Roman children played a number of games, and their toys are known from archaeology and literary sources.

Marriage facilitated a partnership between the father and prospective husbands, and enabled the formation of a mutually beneficial alliance with both political and economic incentives at heart.<ref>Caldwell, \"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\", pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> The social regime, geared towards early marriage and implemented through children's education and upbringing, was particularly restrictive for girls.<ref name=\"Caldwell p. 16\"/> Some, perhaps many, girls went to a [[ludus (ancient Rome)|public primary school]], however there is some evidence to suggest that girls\u2019 education was limited to this elementary school level.

Both genders participated in [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]]; for example, at the [[Secular Games]] of 17 BC, the ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'' was sung by a choir of girls and boys.<ref>Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 198.</ref> Children were made into virtuous adults through scholastic means, with curriculum, language, literature, and philosophy teaching moral precepts.

Epictetus suggests that at the age of 14, girls were considered to be on the brink of womanhood, and beginning to understand the inevitability of their future role as wives. They learned modesty through explicit instruction and upbringing.<ref>Caldwell, \"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\", pp. 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe lives of boys and girls began to diverge dramatically after they formally came of age,<ref>Rawson, \"The Roman Family,\" p. 40.</ref> and memorials to women recognize their domestic qualities far more often than intellectual achievements.<ref>Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 45.</ref> The skills a Roman matron needed to run a household required training, and mothers probably passed on their knowledge to their daughters in a manner appropriate to their station in life, given the emphasis in Roman society on traditionalism.<ref>Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 197.</ref> Virginity and sexual purity was a culturally valued quality, and considered vital for the stability of both family and state. The rape of an unmarried girl posed a threat to her reputation and marriageability, and the penalty of death was sometimes imposed on the unchaste daughter.<ref>Caldwell, \"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\", pp. 11, 45\u201346.</ref> The Emperor Augustus introduced marriage legislation, the [[Lex Papia Poppaea]], which rewarded marriage and childbearing. The legislation also imposed penalties on young persons who failed to marry and on those who committed adultery. Therefore, marriage and childbearing was made law between the ages of twenty-five and sixty for men, and twenty and fifty for women.<ref>Mary T. Boatwright, Daniel J. Gargola, Noel Lenski, Richard J. A. Talbert, \"A Brief History of The Romans\" (Oxford University Press; 2 edition, 2013), p. 176.</ref>\n\n==Women in the family and law==\n\n===Always a daughter===\n{{See also|Pater familias}}\nBoth daughters and sons were subject to ''[[patria potestas]]'', the power wielded by their father as head of household (''familia''). A Roman household was considered a collective (''corpus'', a \"body\") over which the ''pater familias'' had mastery (''dominium''). Slaves, who had no legal standing, were part of the household as property. In the early Empire, the legal standing of daughters differed little if at all from that of sons.<ref>Frier, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19\u201320.</ref> If the father died without a will, the right of a daughter to share in the family property was equal to that of a son, though legislation in the 2nd century BCE had attempted to limit this right. Even apart from legal status, daughters seem no less esteemed within the Roman family than sons, though sons were expected to ensure family standing by following their fathers into public life.<ref>Beryl Rawson, \"The Roman Family,\" in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cremona, museo civico, ritrattuo femminile, primi decenni del iii secolo d.c..JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of a Roman girl, early 3rd century]]\nThe ''pater familias'' had the right and duty to find a husband for his daughter,<ref>Frier, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 66.</ref> and first marriages were normally arranged. Technically, the couple had to be old enough to consent, but the age of consent was 12 for girls and 14 for boys, though in practice boys seem to have been on average five years older. Among the elite, 14 was the age of transition from childhood to adolescence,<ref>[[John Crook (classicist)|J.A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Rome 90B.C.-212 A.D.''</ref> but a [[betrothal]] might be arranged for political reasons when the couple were too young to marry,<ref name=\"Beryl Rawson 1999 p. 21\"/> and in general [[nobiles|noble women]] married younger than women of the lower classes. Most Roman women would have married in their late teens to early twenties. An aristocratic girl was expected to be a virgin when she married, as her young age might indicate.<ref>Judith P. Hallett, ''Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family'' (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142.</ref> A daughter could legitimately refuse a match made by her parents only by showing that the proposed husband was of bad character.<ref>Rawson, \"The Roman Family\", p. 21.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Roman Republic#Early Republic (458 BCE - 274 BCE)|early Republic]], the bride became subject to her husband's ''potestas'', but to a lesser degree than their children.<ref>Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 20.</ref> By the early Empire, however, a daughter's legal relationship to her father remained unchanged when she married, even though she moved into her husband's home.<ref name=\"McGinn, pp. 19\">Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', pp. 19\u201320.</ref> This arrangement was one of the factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the early modern period: although she had to answer to her father legally, she didn't conduct her daily life under his direct scrutiny,<ref>\"If adults sons or daughters and their children had lived in the same household as the ''paterfamilias'',\" notes Rawson, \"they may well have found the constant awareness of his powers and position a great strain\" (\"The Roman Family,\" p. 15).</ref> and her husband had no legal power over her.<ref name=\"McGinn, pp. 19\"/>\n\nA daughter was expected to be deferential toward her father and to remain loyal to him, even if it meant having to differ with her husbands.<ref>Hallett, 139.</ref> \"Deference\" was not always absolute. After arranging his daughter's first two marriages, [[Cicero]] disapproved \u2014 rightly, as it turned out \u2014 of her choice to marry the unreliable [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Dolabella]], but found himself unable to prevent it.<ref>Rawson, ''The Roman Family'', p. 21.</ref>\n\nA daughter kept her own [[Naming conventions for women in ancient Rome|family name]] (''nomen'') for life, not assuming that of her husband. Children usually took the father's name. In the Imperial period, however, children might sometimes make their mother's family name part of theirs, or even adopt it instead.<ref>Rawson, \"The Roman Family,\" p. 18.</ref>\n\n== Women and sexuality ==\nFrom the start of the Roman republic, there was a high emphasis placed on a woman's virginity. [[Pudicitia]] (chastity) was a goddess of feminine purity, and was worshipped by Roman women. Only those who were virgins were allowed to enter the temple.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Women and Politics in Ancient Rome|last=Bauman|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=8, 10, 15, 105}}</ref> A woman's sexual life began with the consummation of her marriage in her husband's cubiculum, or private room where slaves did not enter. In Roman houses it was common for men and women to each have their own cubicula, allowing potential for them to engage in sex lives separate from each other. While it was expected that women should only have sexual relations with their husbands, it was common for men to have many sexual partners throughout his life.<ref name=\":13\"/> After marriage, women were scrutinized in the household to prevent any adulterous behavior. For example, [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] first wife, [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]], highlights this point well as she attempted to have private relations with [[Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus|Publius Clodius]]. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, monitored Pompeia's actions and prevented their private meetings. The mere possibility of Pompeia committing adultery caused Caesar to divorce her.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Growing up and Growing old in Ancient Rome|last=Harlow, Mary|first=and Ray, Laurence|publisher=Rutledge|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n=== Augustus's campaign on women and the family ===\nThe obsession with a woman's purity, and her role as a faithful wife and dutiful mother in the family increased during the reign of Augustus. This general campaign to improve family dynamics began in 18\u201317 BC.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of the Romans|last=Boatwright|first=Mary|last2=Gargola|first2=Daniel|last3=Lenski|first3=Noel|last4=Talbert|first4=Richard|publisher=Oxford University|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=176\u2013177}}</ref> Augustus' new laws targeted both men and women between the ages of 20-55, who were rewarded for being in healthy relationships, and punished if not married and without children. Additionally, Augustus enforced the divorce and punishment of adulterous wives. Women under his rule could be punished in the courts for adultery and banished. This shifted a woman's body and relationships from being private, to become a public matter that could be regulated. Therefore, the palace was secured and driven by this idea that women would be returned to their proper places as chaste wives and mothers, and thus household order would be restored. Augustus went so far as to punish and exile his own daughter, Julia, for engaging in extramarital affairs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Women and the law===\n{{rquote|right|''There never was a case in court in which the quarrel was not started by a woman. If Manilia is not a defendant, she'll be the plaintiff; she will herself frame and adjust the pleadings; she will be ready to instruct [[Publius Juventius Celsus|Celsus himself]] how to open his case, and how to urge his points.''|[[Juvenal]], ''Satire'' VI}}\n\nAlthough the rights and status of women in the earliest period of Roman history were more restricted than in the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BCE - 30 BCE)|late Republic]] and Empire, as early as the 5th century BC, Roman women could own land, write their own wills, and appear in court. The historian [[Valerius Maximus]] devotes a section of his work ''On Memorable Deeds and Speeches'' to women who conducted cases on their own behalf, or on behalf of others.<ref>Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50.</ref> These women got to show their ability as orators in the courtroom at a time when oratory was considered a defining pursuit of the most ambitious Roman men.

The independent Maesia spoke in her own defense, and was acquitted almost unanimously after only a short trial because she spoke with such strength and effectiveness. Since these characteristics were considered masculine, however, the historian opined that under her feminine appearance, she had a \"virile spirit,\" and thereafter she was called \"the [[Androgyne]].\"<ref>[[Valerius Maximus]] 8.3.1; Joseph Farrell, ''Latin Language and Latin Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 74\u201375; Michael C. Alexander, ''Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149\u201350 BCE'' (University of Toronto Press, 1990), p. 180.

Marriage ceremonies, contracts, and other formalities were meant only to prove that a couple had, in fact, married. Under early or archaic [[Roman law]], marriages were of three kinds: ''[[confarreatio]]'', symbolized by the sharing of bread (''panis farreus''); ''coemptio'', \"by purchase\"; and ''usus'', by mutual cohabitation. [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] always married by ''confarreatio'', while [[plebs|plebeians]] married by the latter two kinds. In marriage by ''usus'', if a woman was absent for three consecutive nights at least once a year, she would avoid her husband establishing legal control over her. This differed from the [[Ancient Greek marriage law|Athenian custom of arranged marriage]] and sequestered wives who were not supposed to walk in the street unescorted.\n\nThe form of marriage known as ''manus'' was the norm in the [[Roman Republic#Early Republic (458 BCE - 274 BCE)|early Republic]], but became less frequent thereafter.<ref>The late Imperial Roman [[Gaius (jurist)|jurist Gaius]] writes of ''manus'' marriage as something that used to happen. Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 54.</ref> Under this early form of marriage, the bride passed into the \"hand\" (''manus'') of her husband; that is, she was transferred from the ''potestas'' of her father to that of her husband. Her [[dowry]], any [[inheritance|inheritance rights]] transferred through her marriage, and any property acquired by her after marriage belonged to him. Husbands could divorce on grounds of adultery, and a few cases of divorce for a wife's infertility are recorded.<ref>Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 53.</ref> ''Manus'' marriage was an unequal relationship; it changed a woman\u2019s intestate heirs from her siblings to her children, not because she was their mother, but because in law her position was the same as that of a daughter to her husband. Under ''manus'', women were expected to obey their husbands in almost all aspects of their lives.\n\nThis archaic form of ''manus'' marriage was largely abandoned by the time of [[Julius Caesar]], when a woman remained under her father's authority by law even when she moved into her husband's home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period:<ref>[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Pandora's Daughters: The Role and Status of Women in Greek and Roman Antiquity'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 140\u2013141; J.P.

If the donor died first, however, the gift to the surviving spouse was valid.</ref>\n\n====Divorce====\n[[File:Fresco depicting a seated woman, from the Villa Arianna at Stabiae, Naples National Archaeological Museum (17393152265).jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of a seated woman from [[Stabiae]], 1st century AD]]\n[[Divorce]] was a legal but relatively informal affair which mainly involved a wife leaving her husband\u2019s house and taking back her dowry. According to the historian [[Valerius Maximus]], divorces were taking place by 604 BCE or earlier, and the law code as embodied in the mid-5th century BCE by the [[Twelve Tables]] provides for divorce.  Divorce was socially acceptable if carried out within social norms (''[[mos maiorum]]''). By the time of [[Cicero]] and [[Julius Caesar]], divorce was relatively common and \"shame-free,\" the subject of gossip rather than a social disgrace.<ref>[[Suzanne Dixon]], \"From Ceremonial to Sexualities: A Survey of Scholarship on Roman Marriage\" in ''A Companion to Families in the Greek and Roman Worlds'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), p. 248.</ref> Valerius says that Lucius Annius was disapproved of because he divorced his wife without consulting his friends; that is, he undertook the action for his own purposes and without considering its effects on his social network (''[[amicitia]]'' and ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientela]]''). The [[Roman censor|censors]] of 307 BCE thus expelled him from the Senate for moral turpitude.\n\nElsewhere, however, it is claimed that the first divorce took place only in 230 BCE, at which time [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] notes<ref>[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Antiquitates Romanae'', 2.25</ref> that \"[[Spurius Carvilius]], a man of distinction, was the first to divorce his wife\" on grounds of infertility. This was most likely the [[Spurius Carvilius Maximus Ruga]] who was consul in 234 and 228 BCE. The evidence is confused.<ref>[[Aulus Gellius]] (''Noctes Atticae'' 4.3.1) places the divorce in 227 BCE,  but fudges the date and his sources elsewhere.</ref>\n\nDuring the classical period of Roman law (late Republic and [[Principate]]), a man or woman<ref>Alan Watson, ''The Spirit of Roman Law'' (University of Georgia Press, 1995), p. 173.</ref> could end a marriage simply because he or she wanted to, and for no other reason. Unless the wife could prove the spouse was worthless, he kept the children. Because property had been kept separate during the marriage, divorce from a \"free\" marriage was a very easy procedure.<ref>Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', part D, \"The End of Marriage.\"</ref>\n\n====Remarriage====\n[[File:Affresco romano - eracle ed onfale - area vesuviana.JPG|thumb|[[Heracles]] and [[Omphale]], Roman fresco, [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth Style]] (45\u201379 AD), [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]], Italy]]\nThe frequency of remarriage among the elite was high. Speedy remarriage was not unusual, and perhaps even customary, for aristocratic Romans after the death of a spouse.<ref>Susan Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage: ''Iusti Coniuges'' from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 258\u2013259, 500\u2013502 ''et passim''.</ref> While no formal waiting period was dictated for a widower, it was customary for a woman to remain in mourning for ten months before remarrying.<ref>Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'', p. 48.</ref> The duration may allow for pregnancy: if a woman had become pregnant just before her husband's death, the period of ten months ensures that no question of paternity, which might affect the child's social status and inheritance, would attach to the birth.<ref>In Roman [[inclusive counting]], a pregnancy was counted as lasting ten months.</ref> No law prohibited pregnant women from marrying, and there are well-known instances: Augustus married Livia when she was carrying her former husband's child, and the [[College of Pontiffs]] ruled that it was permissible as long as the child's father was determined first. Livia's previous husband even attended the wedding.<ref>[[Eva Cantarella]], \"Marriage and Sexuality in Republican Rome: A Roman Conjugal Love Story,\" in ''The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. 276.</ref>\n\nBecause elite marriages often occurred for reasons of politics or property, a widow or divorc\u00e9e with assets in these areas faced few obstacles to remarrying. She was far more likely to be legally emancipated than a first-time bride, and to have a say in the choice of husband. The marriages of [[Fulvia]], who commanded troops during the last civil war of the Republic and who was the first Roman woman to have her face on a coin, are thought to indicate her own political sympathies and ambitions: she was married first to the [[populares|popularist]] champion [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius Pulcher]], who was murdered in the street after a long feud with Cicero; then to [[Scribonius Curio]], a figure of less ideological certitude who at the time of his death had come over to Julius Caesar; and finally to [[Mark Antony]], the last opponent to the republican oligarchs and to Rome's future first emperor.\n\nThe [[Greek historiography|Greek observer]] [[Plutarch]] indicates that a second wedding among Romans was likely to be a quieter affair, as a widow would still feel the absence of her dead husband, and a divorc\u00e9e ought to feel shame.<ref>Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#105 105.]</ref> But while the circumstances of divorce might be shameful or embarrassing, and remaining married to the same person for life was ideal, there was no general disapproval of remarriage; on the contrary, marriage was considered the right and desirable condition of adult life for both men and women.<ref>Karen K. Hersh, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 4, 48, ''et passim'' citing Humbert (1971), pp. 1\u201311. See also Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage''.</ref> [[Cato the Younger]], who presented himself as a paragon modeled after his [[Cato the Elder|moral namesake]], allowed his pregnant wife [[Marcia (wife of Cato the Younger)|Marcia]] to divorce him and marry [[Quintus Hortensius|Hortensius]], declining to offer his young daughter to the 60-year-old orator instead.

Crook Law and Life of Rome 90 B.C.-212 A.D.</ref> Concubinage differed from marriage chiefly in the status of children born from the relationship. Children had their mother's social rank, and not as was customary their father's.\n\n====Domestic abuse====\n[[File:Maenad and Cupid MAN Napoli Inv110591.jpg|thumb|A [[maenad]] with a [[cupid]] in her arms, fresco, 1st century AD]]\nClassical Roman law did not allow any [[domestic abuse]] by a husband to his wife,<ref>''A casebook on Roman Family Law'', Frier and McGinn, pg. 95.</ref> but as with any other crime, laws against domestic abuse can be assumed to fail to prevent it. [[Cato the Elder]] said, according to his biographer [[Plutarch]], \"that the man who struck his wife or child, laid violent hands on the holiest of holy things. Also that he thought it more praiseworthy to be a good husband than a good senator.\"<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Cato the Elder'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html#20.2 20.2.]</ref> A man of status during the Roman Republic was expected to behave moderately toward his wife and to define himself as a good husband.

Fagan, \"Violence in Roman Social Relations,\" in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 487.</ref>\n\nDomestic abuse enters the historical record mainly when it involves the egregious excesses of the elite. The Emperor [[Nero]] was alleged to have had his first wife (and stepsister) [[Claudia Octavia]] murdered, after subjecting her to torture and imprisonment. Nero then married his pregnant mistress [[Poppaea Sabina]], whom he kicked to death for criticizing him.<ref>Tacitus, Annals XVI.6</ref> Some modern historians believe that Poppaea died from a miscarriage or childbirth, and that the story was exaggerated to vilify Nero. The despised [[Commodus]] is supposed also to have killed his wife and his sister.<ref>Frank McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: A Life'', p. 435.</ref>\n\n===Motherhood===\n[[File:Sarcophagus Marcus Cornelius Statius Louvre Ma659 n1.jpg|thumb|left|Mother nursing an infant in the presence of the father, detail from a young boy's [[sarcophagus]] ''ca.'' 150 [[BCE|CE]]]]\nRoman wives were expected to bear children, but the women of the aristocracy, accustomed to a degree of independence, showed a growing disinclination to devote themselves to traditional motherhood. By the 1st century [[BCE|CE]], most elite women avoided breast-feeding their infants themselves, and hired wet-nurses.<ref>Rawson, \"The Roman Family,\" p. 30.</ref> The practice was not uncommon as early as the 2nd century [[BCE]], when the comic playwright [[Plautus]] mentions wet-nurses casually.<ref>[[Plautus]], ''Miles Gloriosus'' 697.</ref> Since a mother's milk was considered best for the baby,<ref>As noted by [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]] (1st century AD) in his ''Gynaecology'' 2.18.</ref> aristocratic women might still choose to breast-feed, unless physical reasons prevented it.<ref>Jane F.

Family-values traditionalists such as Cato appear to have taken an interest: Cato liked to be present when his wife bathed and swaddled their child.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 20.2.</ref>\n\nLarge families were not the norm among the elite even by the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BCE - 30 BCE)|Late Republic]]; the family of [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius Pulcher]], who had at least three sisters and two brothers, was considered unusual.<ref>W. Jeffrey Tatum, ''The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p. 33ff.</ref> The [[birth rate]] among the aristocracy declined to such an extent that the first Roman emperor [[Augustus]] (reigned 27 BCE\u201314 CE) passed a series of laws intended to increase it, including special honors for women who bore at least three children (the ''[[Jus trium liberorum|ius trium liberorum]])''.<ref>Janine Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'' (New York, 1960), p. 32; ''A History of Women in the West from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'', vol. 1, p. 115.</ref> Those who were unmarried, divorced, widowed, or barren were prohibited from inheriting property unless named in a will.<ref>Jane F. Gardner, ''Family and ''Familia'' in Roman Law and Life'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2004), p. 53.</ref>\n\nRoman women were not only valued for the number of children that they produced, but also for their part in raising and educating children to become good citizens. To rear children for successful lives, an exemplary Roman mother needed to be well-educated herself.<ref>Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 50.</ref>\n\nOne of the Roman women most famous for their strength and influence as a mother was [[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]], the mother of the [[Gracchi]]. [[Julius Caesar]], whose father died when he was only a young teen, had a close relationship with his mother, [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]], whose political clout was essential in preventing the execution of her 18-year-old son during the [[proscription]]s of [[Sulla]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Daily life==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Fresco of woman with tray in Villa San Marco retouched.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Fresco showing a woman looking in a mirror as she dresses (or undresses) her hair, from the Villa of Arianna at Stabiae (Castellammare di Stabia), Naples National Archaeological Museum (17392924485).jpg\n| width2 = 190\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left image:''' Wall painting from the Vila San Marco, [[Stabiae]], 1st century <br />'''Right image:''' A woman fixing her hair in the mirror, fresco from the Villa of Arianna at [[Stabiae]], 1st century AD\n}}\nAristocratic women managed a large and complex household. Since wealthy couples often owned multiple homes and country estates with dozens or even hundreds of slaves, some of whom were educated and highly skilled, this responsibility was the equivalent of running a small corporation. In addition to the social and political importance of entertaining [[hospitium|guests]], [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients]], and visiting dignitaries from abroad, the husband held his morning business meetings (''salutatio'') at home.<ref>Susan Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage:'' Iusti Coniuges ''from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian'' (Oxford University Press, 1991, reprinted 2002), p. 420.</ref> The home (''[[domus]]'') was also the center of the family's social identity, with ancestral portraits displayed in the entrance hall (''atrium''). Since the most ambitious aristocratic men were frequently away from home on military campaign or administrative duty in the [[Roman province|provinces]], sometimes for years at a time, the maintenance of the family's property and business decisions were often left to the wives; for instance, while [[Julius Caesar]] was away from Rome throughout the 50s BCE, his wife [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]] was responsible for taking care of his assets. When Ovid, Rome's greatest living poet, was exiled by [[Augustus]] in 8 CE, his wife exploited social connections and legal maneuvers to hold on to the family's property, on which their livelihood depended.<ref>[[Hermann Fr\u00e4nkel]], ''Ovid: A Poet between Two Worlds'' (University of California Press, 1956), p. 151.</ref> Ovid expresses his love and admiration for her lavishly in the poetry he wrote during his exile.<ref>Jo-Marie Claasen, \"Tristia,\" in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2009), p. 179.</ref> Frugality, parsimony, and austerity were characteristics of the virtuous matron.<ref>Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 45.</ref>\n\nOne of the most important tasks for women to oversee in a large household was clothing production. In the early Roman period, the spinning of wool was a central domestic occupation, and indicated a family's self-sufficiency, since the wool would be produced on their estates. Even in an urban setting, wool was often a symbol of a wife's duties, and equipment for spinning might appear on the funeral monument of a woman to show that she was a good and honorable matron.<ref>Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 51.</ref> Even women of the upper classes were expected to be able to spin and weave in virtuous emulation of their rustic ancestors \u2014 a practice ostentatiously observed by [[Livia]].\n\n===In business===\n\"One of the most curious characteristics of that age,\" observed French classical scholar [[Gaston Boissier]], \"was that the women appear as much engaged in business and as interested in speculations as the men. Money is their first care. They work their estates, invest their funds, lend and borrow. We find one among Cicero's creditors, and two among his debtors.\"<ref>[[Gaston Boissier]], ''Cicero and his friends: a study of Roman Society in the time of Caesar'', [https://www.questia.com/read/10552570?title=Cicero%20and%20His%20Friends%3a%20A%20Study%20of%20Roman%20Society%20in%20the%20Time%20of%20Caesar Questia edition.]</ref> Although Roman society did not allow women to gain official political power, it did allow them to enter business.<ref>A Casebook on Roman Family Law Frier+McGinn pg 461</ref>\n\nEven women of wealth were not supposed to be idle ladies of leisure. Among the aristocracy, women as well as men lent money to their peers to avoid resorting to a moneylender. When Pliny was considering buying an estate, he factored in a loan from his mother-in-law as a guarantee rather than an option.<ref>Law and Life of Rome, J.A. Crook pg.172</ref> Women also joined in funding public works, as is frequently documented by inscriptions during the Imperial period.  The \"lawless\" Politta, who appears in the ''Martyrdom of [[Pionius]]'', owned estates in the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]]. Inscriptions record her generosity in funding the renovation of the [[Sardis]] gymnasium.<ref>Christians and Pagans, Fox, Pg. 464</ref>\n\nBecause women had the right to own property, they might engage in the same business transactions and management practices as any landowner. As with their male counterparts, their management of slaves appears to have varied from relative care to negligence and outright abuse. During the [[First Servile War]], Megallis and her husband Damophilus were both killed by their slaves on account of their brutality, but their daughter was spared because of her kindness and granted safe passage out of Sicily, along with an armed escort.<ref>The Gracchi Marius and Sulla, A.H. Beesley, pg. 21 on the first Serville War</ref>\n\n[[File:Pompeii - Fullonica of Veranius Hypsaeus 2 - MAN.jpg|thumb|left|Women and a man working alongside one another at a dye shop (''fullonica''), on a wall painting from Pompeii]]\nUnlike landholding, industry was not considered an honorable profession for those of [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank. [[Cicero]] suggested that in order to gain respectability a merchant should buy land. Attitudes changed during the Empire, however, and [[Claudius]] created legislation to encourage the upper classes to engage in shipping. Women of the upper classes are documented as owning and running shipping corporations.\n\nTrade and manufacturing are not well represented in Roman literature, which was produced for and largely by the elite, but funerary inscriptions sometimes record the profession of the deceased, including women.<ref>See ''Ancient Roman Life as Illustrated by Latin Inscriptions'' by Brian K.

The political system in ancient Rome involved men exclusively\u2014from senators to magistrates. Women were even prevented from voting. They were not seen as fit to be part of the political sphere as men believed them to be only suited for \"elegance, adornment, and finery.\"<ref name=\":13\"/> However, elite women could manipulate their husbands and through them exercise control over the political world. In some cases, women were viewed as a threat to male rule. [[Cato the Elder|Cato the elder]] went so far as to prevent boys from attending senatorial meetings in fear that they would relay the news to their inquisitive mothers.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society|last=Hallet|first=Judith|publisher=Princeton University|year=1984|isbn=|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=8, 10}}</ref>\n\nDuring the civil wars that ended the Republic, [[Appian]] reports the heroism of wives who saved their husbands.  An [[epitaph]] known as the ''[[Laudatio Turiae]]'' preserves a husband's [[laudatio funebris|eulogy]] for his wife, who during the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war following the death of Julius Caesar]] endangered her own life and relinquished her jewelry to send support to her husband in exile.<ref>Arthur Ernest Gordon, ''Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy'' (University of California Press, 1983), pp. 34, 103.</ref> Both survived the turbulence of the time to enjoy a long marriage.

However, starting with Augustus' rule, the inability to vote no longer mattered because the senate lost its power. Additionally, the shift from the forum to the palace allowed for women who lived there to gain an upper hand in influencing politics.<ref name=\":13\"/>\n\nOne notable woman was [[Livia Drusilla]] [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]] (58 BCE \u2013 CE 29),  the wife of [[Augustus]] and the most powerful woman in the [[Principate|early Roman Empire]], acting several times as regent and being Augustus' faithful advisor. Several women of the Imperial family, such as Livia's great-granddaughter and Caligula's sister [[Agrippina the Younger]], gained political influence as well as public prominence.\n\nWomen also participated in efforts to overthrow the emperors who abused their power. Shortly after [[Caligula]]'s sister [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]] died, her widower [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] and her sisters [[Agrippina the Younger]] and [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Livilla]] conspired to overthrow Caligula. The plot was discovered, and Lepidus was executed. Agrippina and Livilla were exiled, and returned from exile only when their paternal uncle Claudius came to power after Caligula's assassination in 41 CE.\n\nWomen could also be motivated by less than noble causes. Claudius's third wife [[Valeria Messalina]] conspired with [[Gaius Silius]] to overthrow her husband in the hope of installing herself and her lover in power.\n\n[[Tacitus]] immortalized the woman [[Epicharis (Pisonian conspirator)|Epicharis]] for her part in the [[Pisonian conspiracy]], where she attempted to gain the support of the Roman fleet and was instead arrested.<ref>Tacitus, Annals 15.51</ref> Once the conspiracy was uncovered, she would reveal nothing even under torture, in contrast to the senators, who were not subjected to torture and yet raced to spill the details. Tacitus also praises [[Egnatia Maximilla]] for sacrificing her fortune in order to stand by her innocent husband against Nero.<ref>Tacitus, Annals 15.71.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' (''Elagabalus'' 4.2 and 12.3) emperor [[Elagabalus]] had his mother or grandmother take part in Senate proceedings. \"And Elagabalus was the only one of all the emperors under whom a woman attended the senate like a man, just as though she belonged to the senatorial order\" (David Magie's translation). According to the same work, Elagabalus also established a women's senate called the ''senaculum'', which enacted rules to be applied to matrons, regarding clothing, chariot riding, the waering of jewelry etc. (''Elagabalus'' 4.3 and ''Aurelian'' 49.6). Before this, [[Agrippina the Younger]], mother of [[Nero]], had been ''listening'' to Senate proceedings, concealed behind a curtain, according to [[Tacitus]] (''Annales'', 13.5).\n\n===Women and the military===\nClassical texts have little to say about women and the Roman army. Emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BC\u2013AD 14) disallowed marriage by ordinary soldiers, a ban that lasted nearly two centuries. However it has been suggested  that  wives and children of centurions lived with them at border and provincial forts.<ref>Allison P. (2011) 'Soldiers\u2019 families in the early Roman Empire', in B.

Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their participation might be limited. As a rule women did not perform [[animal sacrifice]], the central rite of most major public ceremonies,<ref>[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F.

Schultz, ''Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 134\u2013136. In some sense, every head of household was a priest responsible for religious maintenance at home; in Roman patriarchal society, this was the ''paterfamilias''. Public religion, like society and politics in general, reflected the hierarchy of the household, since the ''familia'' was the building block of society. See John Scheid, ''An Introduction to Roman Religion'' (Indiana University Press, 2003), p. 129ff.</ref> Some cult practices were reserved for women only, for example, the rites of the Good Goddess ([[Bona Dea]]).<ref>Beard ''et al''., ''Religions of Rome'', vol. 1, pp. 296\u2013297.</ref>\n\nWomen priests played a prominent and crucial role in the official [[Religion in ancient Rome|religion of Rome]].

The independence of the Vestals thus existed in relation to the prohibitions imposed on them. In addition to conducting certain religious rites, the Vestals participated at least symbolically in every official sacrifice, as they were responsible for preparing the required ritual substance ''[[mola salsa]]''.<ref>Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins,'' pp. 154\u2013155.</ref> The Vestals seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century CE, until the Christian emperors dissolved the order.\n\nA few priesthoods were held jointly by married couples. Marriage was a requirement for the [[Flamen Dialis]], the high priest of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]; his wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own unique priestly attire, and like her husband was placed under obscure magico-religious prohibitions. The flaminica was a perhaps exceptional case of a woman performing animal sacrifice; she offered a ram to Jupiter on each of the ''[[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinae]]'', the eight-day Roman cycle comparable to a [[week]].<ref>[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.</ref> The couple were not permitted to divorce, and if the flaminica died the flamen had to resign his office.\n\n[[File:Arte romana, triade capitolina, 160-180 dc (guidonia montecelio, museo civico archeologico) 01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Capitoline Triad]] of Minerva, Jupiter, and Juno]]\nLike the Flaminica Dialis, the ''[[regina sacrorum]]'', \"queen of the sacred rites,\" wore distinctive ceremonial dress and performed animal sacrifice, offering a sow or female lamb to Juno on the [[Kalends|first day of each month]].<ref>Emily A.

The wealthiest families had private baths at home, but most people went to bath houses not only to wash but to socialize, as the larger facilities offered a range of services and recreational activities, among which [[casual sex]] was not excluded. One of the most vexed questions of Roman social life is whether the sexes bathed together in public. Until the late Republic, evidence suggests that women usually bathed in a separate wing or facility, or that women and men were scheduled at different times. But there is also clear evidence of [[mixed bathing]] from the late Republic until the rise of Christian dominance in the later Empire. Some scholars have thought that only lower-class women bathed with men, or those of dubious moral standing such as entertainers or prostitutes, but [[Clement of Alexandria]] observed that women of the highest social classes could be seen naked at the baths. [[Hadrian]] prohibited mixed bathing, but the ban seems not to have endured. Most likely, customs varied not only by time and place, but by facility, so that women could choose to segregate themselves by gender or not.<ref>Garrett G. Fagan, ''Bathing in Public in the Roman World'' (University of Michigan Press, 1999, 2002), pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nFor entertainment women could attend debates at the Forum, the public games (''[[ludi]]''), [[chariot races]], and theatrical performances.

The law limited women's possession and display of gold and silver (as money or personal ornament), expensive clothing and their \"unnecessary\" use of chariots and litters. Victory over [[Carthage]] flooded Rome with wealth and in 195 BCE the Lex Oppia was reviewed. The ruling consul, [[Cato the Censor]] argued for its retention: personal morality and self-restraint were self-evidently inadequate controls on indulgence and luxury. Luxury provoked the envy and shame of those less well-off, and was therefore divisive. Roman women, in Cato's view, had showed only too clearly that their appetites once corrupted knew no limits, and must be restrained. Large numbers of Roman matrons thought otherwise, and made concerted public protest. In 193 BCE the laws were abolished: Cato's opposition did not harm his political career.

Subverting the tradition of male dominance, the love poets of the late Republic and [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan era]] declared their eagerness to submit to \"love slavery\" (''servitium amoris''). [[Catullus]] addresses a number of poems to \"Lesbia,\" a married woman with whom he has an affair, usually identified as a fictionalized [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Metellus)|Clodia]], sister of the prominent [[populares|popularist]] politician [[Clodius Pulcher]]. The affair ends badly, and Catullus's declarations of love turn to attacks on her sexual appetites \u2014 rhetoric that accords with the other hostile source on Clodia's behavior, [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Pro Caelio]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Ars Amatoria|The Art of Love]]'', [[Ovid]] goes a step further, adopting the genre of [[didactic poetry]] for offering instruction in how to pursue, keep, and get over a lover.

Balancing food, exercise, and sexual activity came to be regarded as a choice that women might make. The observation that intensive training was likely to result in amenorrhea implies that there were women who engaged in such regimens.<ref>Hanson, \"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\" p. 260. The ''Gynecology'' of [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]] is central to Hanson's arguments.</ref>\n\nIn the Roman era, medical writers saw a place for exercise in the lives of women in sickness and health.

The outsized phallus of [[Roman art]] was associated with the god [[Priapus]], among others. It was laughter-provoking, grotesque, or used for magical purposes; see David Fredrick, ''The Roman Gaze: Vision, Power, and the Body'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), p. 156. Nude statues of men that were intended to be beautiful or dignified had a small penis.</ref> was considered a symptom of excessive sexuality. Although Hellenistic and Roman medical and other writers refer to [[clitoridectomy]] as primarily an \"Egyptian\" custom, gynecological manuals under the Christian Empire in [[late antiquity]] propose that hypersexuality could be treated by surgery or repeated childbirth.<ref>Hanson, \"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\" p. 267.

A freed slave owed a period of service, the terms of which might be agreed upon as a precondition of freedom, to her former owner, who became her [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]. The patron had obligations in return, such as paying for said services and helping in legal matters. The [[patron-client relationship]] was one of the fundamental social structures of ancient Rome, and failure to fulfill one's obligations brought disapproval and censure.\n\nIn most ways, freedwomen had the same legal status as freeborn women. But because under Roman law a slave had no father, freed slaves had no inheritance rights unless they were named in a will.\n\nThe relationship of a former slave to her patron could be complicated. In one legal case, a woman named Petronia Iusta attempted to show \u2014 without a birth declaration to prove it \u2014 that she had been free-born. Her mother, she acknowledged, had been a slave in the household of Petronius Stephanus and Calatoria Themis, but Iusta maintained that she had been born after her mother's manumission. Calatoria, by now a widow, in turn argued that Iusta was born before her mother was free and that she had been manumitted, therefore owing her former owner the service due a patron. Calatoria could produce no documentation of this supposed manumission, and the case came down to the testimony of witnesses.<ref>J.A. Crook, ''Law and Life of Rome 90 B.C.-A.D. 212'' (Cornell University Press, 1967, 1984), pp. 48\u201350.</ref>\n\nUneducated or unskilled slaves had few opportunities to earn their freedom, and if they became free would lack means of supporting themselves. Therefore, a freedwoman in the workplace could have the advantage in training and skill over a woman born to a free family of [[working poor]].<ref>Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 194.</ref>\n\nThe status of freedwomen, like freedmen, varied widely. [[Caenis]] was a freedwoman and secretary to the Emperor [[Vespasian]]; she was also his concubine. He is said to have lived with her faithfully, but she was not considered a wife.<ref>Crook, ''Law and Life of Rome'', p. 101.</ref>\n\n==Prostitution==\n{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}\nWomen could turn to prostitution to support themselves, but not all prostitutes had freedom to decide. There is some evidence that even slave prostitutes could benefit from their labor.<ref>The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World: A Study of social History and the Brothel By Thomas A. McGinn. pg. 52</ref> Although rape was a crime, the law only punished the rape of a slave if it \"damaged the goods,\" because a slave had no legal standing. The penalty was aimed at providing her owner compensation for the \"damage\" of his property. Because a slave woman was considered property under Roman law, forcing her to be a prostitute was not considered a crime. Prior to [[Septimius Severus]], women who engaged in acts that brought ''infamia'' to them as slaves also suffered ''infamia'' when freed.<ref>Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press. 1998, p. 56.</ref> Sometimes sellers of female slaves attached a ''ne serva'' clause to the slave to prevent her from being prostituted. The Ne Serva clause meant that if the new owner or any owner after him or her used the slave as a prostitute she would be free. Later on the ''ne serva'' agreements became enforceable by law.<ref>Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 293</ref> Prostitution was not limited to slaves or poor citizens; according to Suetonius, Caligula when converting his palace into a brothel employed upper class \"matrons and youths\" as prostitutes. Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula, Tacitus records that during one of Nero's feasts the prefect [[Tigellinus]] had brothels filled with upper class women.<ref>Tacitus, Annals 15.37</ref> Prostitution could also be a punishment instead of an occupation; a law of Augustus allowed that women guilty of adultery could be sentenced to work in brothels as prostitutes. The law was abolished in 389.<ref>Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 171, 310.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[List of Roman women]]\n* [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities]]\n* [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]]\n* [[Women in ancient Sparta]]\n* [[Women in Classical Athens]]\n* [[Women in ancient warfare]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|author=Assa, Janine|title=The Great Roman Ladies|place=New York|publisher=Grove Press|year=1960}}\n* Daehner, Jens (ed.), ''The Herculaneum Women: History, Context, Identities'' (Los Angeles: The [[J.

A Roman household was considered a collective (''corpus'', a \"body\") over which the ''pater familias'' had mastery (''dominium''). Slaves, who had no legal standing, were part of the household as property. In the early Empire, the legal standing of daughters differed little if at all from that of sons.<ref>Frier, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19\u201320.</ref> If the father died without a will, the right of a daughter to share in the family property was equal to that of a son, though legislation in the 2nd century BCE had attempted to limit this right.

Technically, the couple had to be old enough to consent, but the age of consent was 12 for girls and 14 for boys, though in practice boys seem to have been on average five years older. Among the elite, 14 was the age of transition from childhood to adolescence,<ref>[[John Crook (classicist)|J.A.

[[Pudicitia]] (chastity) was a goddess of feminine purity, and was worshipped by Roman women. Only those who were virgins were allowed to enter the temple.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Women and Politics in Ancient Rome|last=Bauman|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=8, 10, 15, 105}}</ref> A woman's sexual life began with the consummation of her marriage in her husband's cubiculum, or private room where slaves did not enter. In Roman houses it was common for men and women to each have their own cubicula, allowing potential for them to engage in sex lives separate from each other. While it was expected that women should only have sexual relations with their husbands, it was common for men to have many sexual partners throughout his life.<ref name=\":13\"/> After marriage, women were scrutinized in the household to prevent any adulterous behavior. For example, [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] first wife, [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]], highlights this point well as she attempted to have private relations with [[Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus|Publius Clodius]]. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, monitored Pompeia's actions and prevented their private meetings. The mere possibility of Pompeia committing adultery caused Caesar to divorce her.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Growing up and Growing old in Ancient Rome|last=Harlow, Mary|first=and Ray, Laurence|publisher=Rutledge|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n=== Augustus's campaign on women and the family ===\nThe obsession with a woman's purity, and her role as a faithful wife and dutiful mother in the family increased during the reign of Augustus. This general campaign to improve family dynamics began in 18\u201317 BC.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of the Romans|last=Boatwright|first=Mary|last2=Gargola|first2=Daniel|last3=Lenski|first3=Noel|last4=Talbert|first4=Richard|publisher=Oxford University|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=176\u2013177}}</ref> Augustus' new laws targeted both men and women between the ages of 20-55, who were rewarded for being in healthy relationships, and punished if not married and without children. Additionally, Augustus enforced the divorce and punishment of adulterous wives. Women under his rule could be punished in the courts for adultery and banished. This shifted a woman's body and relationships from being private, to become a public matter that could be regulated. Therefore, the palace was secured and driven by this idea that women would be returned to their proper places as chaste wives and mothers, and thus household order would be restored. Augustus went so far as to punish and exile his own daughter, Julia, for engaging in extramarital affairs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Women and the law===\n{{rquote|right|''There never was a case in court in which the quarrel was not started by a woman.

She then became subject to her husband's ''potestas'', though to a lesser degree than their children.<ref>Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 20.</ref> In the earliest periods of Roman history, [[Manus Marriage]] meant that a married woman would be subjugated by her husband, but that custom had died out by the 1st century BCE, in favor of Free Marriage which did not grant a husband any rights over his wife or have any changing effect on a woman's status.<ref>Duby,Perrot,and Pantel A History of Women Volume 1, pg. 133</ref> During the classical era of [[Roman law]], marriage required no ceremony, but only a mutual will and agreement to live together in harmony. Marriage ceremonies, contracts, and other formalities were meant only to prove that a couple had, in fact, married. Under early or archaic [[Roman law]], marriages were of three kinds: ''[[confarreatio]]'', symbolized by the sharing of bread (''panis farreus''); ''coemptio'', \"by purchase\"; and ''usus'', by mutual cohabitation. [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] always married by ''confarreatio'', while [[plebs|plebeians]] married by the latter two kinds. In marriage by ''usus'', if a woman was absent for three consecutive nights at least once a year, she would avoid her husband establishing legal control over her. This differed from the [[Ancient Greek marriage law|Athenian custom of arranged marriage]] and sequestered wives who were not supposed to walk in the street unescorted.\n\nThe form of marriage known as ''manus'' was the norm in the [[Roman Republic#Early Republic (458 BCE - 274 BCE)|early Republic]], but became less frequent thereafter.<ref>The late Imperial Roman [[Gaius (jurist)|jurist Gaius]] writes of ''manus'' marriage as something that used to happen. Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 54.</ref> Under this early form of marriage, the bride passed into the \"hand\" (''manus'') of her husband; that is, she was transferred from the ''potestas'' of her father to that of her husband. Her [[dowry]], any [[inheritance|inheritance rights]] transferred through her marriage, and any property acquired by her after marriage belonged to him. Husbands could divorce on grounds of adultery, and a few cases of divorce for a wife's infertility are recorded.<ref>Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 53.</ref> ''Manus'' marriage was an unequal relationship; it changed a woman\u2019s intestate heirs from her siblings to her children, not because she was their mother, but because in law her position was the same as that of a daughter to her husband. Under ''manus'', women were expected to obey their husbands in almost all aspects of their lives.\n\nThis archaic form of ''manus'' marriage was largely abandoned by the time of [[Julius Caesar]], when a woman remained under her father's authority by law even when she moved into her husband's home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period:<ref>[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Pandora's Daughters: The Role and Status of Women in Greek and Roman Antiquity'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 140\u2013141; J.P.

If the donor died first, however, the gift to the surviving spouse was valid.</ref>\n\n====Divorce====\n[[File:Fresco depicting a seated woman, from the Villa Arianna at Stabiae, Naples National Archaeological Museum (17393152265).jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of a seated woman from [[Stabiae]], 1st century AD]]\n[[Divorce]] was a legal but relatively informal affair which mainly involved a wife leaving her husband\u2019s house and taking back her dowry. According to the historian [[Valerius Maximus]], divorces were taking place by 604 BCE or earlier, and the law code as embodied in the mid-5th century BCE by the [[Twelve Tables]] provides for divorce.  Divorce was socially acceptable if carried out within social norms (''[[mos maiorum]]''). By the time of [[Cicero]] and [[Julius Caesar]], divorce was relatively common and \"shame-free,\" the subject of gossip rather than a social disgrace.<ref>[[Suzanne Dixon]], \"From Ceremonial to Sexualities: A Survey of Scholarship on Roman Marriage\" in ''A Companion to Families in the Greek and Roman Worlds'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), p. 248.</ref> Valerius says that Lucius Annius was disapproved of because he divorced his wife without consulting his friends; that is, he undertook the action for his own purposes and without considering its effects on his social network (''[[amicitia]]'' and ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientela]]''). The [[Roman censor|censors]] of 307 BCE thus expelled him from the Senate for moral turpitude.\n\nElsewhere, however, it is claimed that the first divorce took place only in 230 BCE, at which time [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] notes<ref>[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Antiquitates Romanae'', 2.25</ref> that \"[[Spurius Carvilius]], a man of distinction, was the first to divorce his wife\" on grounds of infertility. This was most likely the [[Spurius Carvilius Maximus Ruga]] who was consul in 234 and 228 BCE. The evidence is confused.<ref>[[Aulus Gellius]] (''Noctes Atticae'' 4.3.1) places the divorce in 227 BCE,  but fudges the date and his sources elsewhere.</ref>\n\nDuring the classical period of Roman law (late Republic and [[Principate]]), a man or woman<ref>Alan Watson, ''The Spirit of Roman Law'' (University of Georgia Press, 1995), p. 173.</ref> could end a marriage simply because he or she wanted to, and for no other reason. Unless the wife could prove the spouse was worthless, he kept the children. Because property had been kept separate during the marriage, divorce from a \"free\" marriage was a very easy procedure.<ref>Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', part D, \"The End of Marriage.\"</ref>\n\n====Remarriage====\n[[File:Affresco romano - eracle ed onfale - area vesuviana.JPG|thumb|[[Heracles]] and [[Omphale]], Roman fresco, [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth Style]] (45\u201379 AD), [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]], Italy]]\nThe frequency of remarriage among the elite was high. Speedy remarriage was not unusual, and perhaps even customary, for aristocratic Romans after the death of a spouse.<ref>Susan Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage: ''Iusti Coniuges'' from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 258\u2013259, 500\u2013502 ''et passim''.</ref> While no formal waiting period was dictated for a widower, it was customary for a woman to remain in mourning for ten months before remarrying.<ref>Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'', p. 48.</ref> The duration may allow for pregnancy: if a woman had become pregnant just before her husband's death, the period of ten months ensures that no question of paternity, which might affect the child's social status and inheritance, would attach to the birth.<ref>In Roman [[inclusive counting]], a pregnancy was counted as lasting ten months.</ref> No law prohibited pregnant women from marrying, and there are well-known instances: Augustus married Livia when she was carrying her former husband's child, and the [[College of Pontiffs]] ruled that it was permissible as long as the child's father was determined first. Livia's previous husband even attended the wedding.<ref>[[Eva Cantarella]], \"Marriage and Sexuality in Republican Rome: A Roman Conjugal Love Story,\" in ''The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. 276.</ref>\n\nBecause elite marriages often occurred for reasons of politics or property, a widow or divorc\u00e9e with assets in these areas faced few obstacles to remarrying. She was far more likely to be legally emancipated than a first-time bride, and to have a say in the choice of husband. The marriages of [[Fulvia]], who commanded troops during the last civil war of the Republic and who was the first Roman woman to have her face on a coin, are thought to indicate her own political sympathies and ambitions: she was married first to the [[populares|popularist]] champion [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius Pulcher]], who was murdered in the street after a long feud with Cicero; then to [[Scribonius Curio]], a figure of less ideological certitude who at the time of his death had come over to Julius Caesar; and finally to [[Mark Antony]], the last opponent to the republican oligarchs and to Rome's future first emperor.\n\nThe [[Greek historiography|Greek observer]] [[Plutarch]] indicates that a second wedding among Romans was likely to be a quieter affair, as a widow would still feel the absence of her dead husband, and a divorc\u00e9e ought to feel shame.<ref>Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#105 105.]</ref> But while the circumstances of divorce might be shameful or embarrassing, and remaining married to the same person for life was ideal, there was no general disapproval of remarriage; on the contrary, marriage was considered the right and desirable condition of adult life for both men and women.<ref>Karen K.

Crook Law and Life of Rome 90 B.C.-212 A.D.</ref> Concubinage differed from marriage chiefly in the status of children born from the relationship. Children had their mother's social rank, and not as was customary their father's.\n\n====Domestic abuse====\n[[File:Maenad and Cupid MAN Napoli Inv110591.jpg|thumb|A [[maenad]] with a [[cupid]] in her arms, fresco, 1st century AD]]\nClassical Roman law did not allow any [[domestic abuse]] by a husband to his wife,<ref>''A casebook on Roman Family Law'', Frier and McGinn, pg. 95.</ref> but as with any other crime, laws against domestic abuse can be assumed to fail to prevent it. [[Cato the Elder]] said, according to his biographer [[Plutarch]], \"that the man who struck his wife or child, laid violent hands on the holiest of holy things. Also that he thought it more praiseworthy to be a good husband than a good senator.\"<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Cato the Elder'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html#20.2 20.2.]</ref> A man of status during the Roman Republic was expected to behave moderately toward his wife and to define himself as a good husband.

The Emperor [[Nero]] was alleged to have had his first wife (and stepsister) [[Claudia Octavia]] murdered, after subjecting her to torture and imprisonment. Nero then married his pregnant mistress [[Poppaea Sabina]], whom he kicked to death for criticizing him.<ref>Tacitus, Annals XVI.6</ref> Some modern historians believe that Poppaea died from a miscarriage or childbirth, and that the story was exaggerated to vilify Nero.

Since wealthy couples often owned multiple homes and country estates with dozens or even hundreds of slaves, some of whom were educated and highly skilled, this responsibility was the equivalent of running a small corporation. In addition to the social and political importance of entertaining [[hospitium|guests]], [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients]], and visiting dignitaries from abroad, the husband held his morning business meetings (''salutatio'') at home.<ref>Susan Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage:'' Iusti Coniuges ''from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian'' (Oxford University Press, 1991, reprinted 2002), p. 420.</ref> The home (''[[domus]]'') was also the center of the family's social identity, with ancestral portraits displayed in the entrance hall (''atrium''). Since the most ambitious aristocratic men were frequently away from home on military campaign or administrative duty in the [[Roman province|provinces]], sometimes for years at a time, the maintenance of the family's property and business decisions were often left to the wives; for instance, while [[Julius Caesar]] was away from Rome throughout the 50s BCE, his wife [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]] was responsible for taking care of his assets. When Ovid, Rome's greatest living poet, was exiled by [[Augustus]] in 8 CE, his wife exploited social connections and legal maneuvers to hold on to the family's property, on which their livelihood depended.<ref>[[Hermann Fr\u00e4nkel]], ''Ovid: A Poet between Two Worlds'' (University of California Press, 1956), p. 151.</ref> Ovid expresses his love and admiration for her lavishly in the poetry he wrote during his exile.<ref>Jo-Marie Claasen, \"Tristia,\" in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2009), p. 179.</ref> Frugality, parsimony, and austerity were characteristics of the virtuous matron.<ref>Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 45.</ref>\n\nOne of the most important tasks for women to oversee in a large household was clothing production. In the early Roman period, the spinning of wool was a central domestic occupation, and indicated a family's self-sufficiency, since the wool would be produced on their estates. Even in an urban setting, wool was often a symbol of a wife's duties, and equipment for spinning might appear on the funeral monument of a woman to show that she was a good and honorable matron.<ref>Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 51.</ref> Even women of the upper classes were expected to be able to spin and weave in virtuous emulation of their rustic ancestors \u2014 a practice ostentatiously observed by [[Livia]].\n\n===In business===\n\"One of the most curious characteristics of that age,\" observed French classical scholar [[Gaston Boissier]], \"was that the women appear as much engaged in business and as interested in speculations as the men. Money is their first care. They work their estates, invest their funds, lend and borrow. We find one among Cicero's creditors, and two among his debtors.\"<ref>[[Gaston Boissier]], ''Cicero and his friends: a study of Roman Society in the time of Caesar'', [https://www.questia.com/read/10552570?title=Cicero%20and%20His%20Friends%3a%20A%20Study%20of%20Roman%20Society%20in%20the%20Time%20of%20Caesar Questia edition.]</ref> Although Roman society did not allow women to gain official political power, it did allow them to enter business.<ref>A Casebook on Roman Family Law Frier+McGinn pg 461</ref>\n\nEven women of wealth were not supposed to be idle ladies of leisure. Among the aristocracy, women as well as men lent money to their peers to avoid resorting to a moneylender. When Pliny was considering buying an estate, he factored in a loan from his mother-in-law as a guarantee rather than an option.<ref>Law and Life of Rome, J.A. Crook pg.172</ref> Women also joined in funding public works, as is frequently documented by inscriptions during the Imperial period.  The \"lawless\" Politta, who appears in the ''Martyrdom of [[Pionius]]'', owned estates in the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]]. Inscriptions record her generosity in funding the renovation of the [[Sardis]] gymnasium.<ref>Christians and Pagans, Fox, Pg. 464</ref>\n\nBecause women had the right to own property, they might engage in the same business transactions and management practices as any landowner. As with their male counterparts, their management of slaves appears to have varied from relative care to negligence and outright abuse. During the [[First Servile War]], Megallis and her husband Damophilus were both killed by their slaves on account of their brutality, but their daughter was spared because of her kindness and granted safe passage out of Sicily, along with an armed escort.<ref>The Gracchi Marius and Sulla, A.H. Beesley, pg. 21 on the first Serville War</ref>\n\n[[File:Pompeii - Fullonica of Veranius Hypsaeus 2 - MAN.jpg|thumb|left|Women and a man working alongside one another at a dye shop (''fullonica''), on a wall painting from Pompeii]]\nUnlike landholding, industry was not considered an honorable profession for those of [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank. [[Cicero]] suggested that in order to gain respectability a merchant should buy land. Attitudes changed during the Empire, however, and [[Claudius]] created legislation to encourage the upper classes to engage in shipping. Women of the upper classes are documented as owning and running shipping corporations.\n\nTrade and manufacturing are not well represented in Roman literature, which was produced for and largely by the elite, but funerary inscriptions sometimes record the profession of the deceased, including women.<ref>See ''Ancient Roman Life as Illustrated by Latin Inscriptions'' by Brian K.

The need to buy prepared food meant that takeaway food was a thriving business.

The political system in ancient Rome involved men exclusively\u2014from senators to magistrates. Women were even prevented from voting. They were not seen as fit to be part of the political sphere as men believed them to be only suited for \"elegance, adornment, and finery.\"<ref name=\":13\"/> However, elite women could manipulate their husbands and through them exercise control over the political world. In some cases, women were viewed as a threat to male rule. [[Cato the Elder|Cato the elder]] went so far as to prevent boys from attending senatorial meetings in fear that they would relay the news to their inquisitive mothers.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society|last=Hallet|first=Judith|publisher=Princeton University|year=1984|isbn=|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=8, 10}}</ref>\n\nDuring the civil wars that ended the Republic, [[Appian]] reports the heroism of wives who saved their husbands.  An [[epitaph]] known as the ''[[Laudatio Turiae]]'' preserves a husband's [[laudatio funebris|eulogy]] for his wife, who during the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war following the death of Julius Caesar]] endangered her own life and relinquished her jewelry to send support to her husband in exile.<ref>Arthur Ernest Gordon, ''Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy'' (University of California Press, 1983), pp. 34, 103.</ref> Both survived the turbulence of the time to enjoy a long marriage. [[Porcia Catonis|Porcia]], the daughter of [[Cato the Younger]] and wife of [[Marcus Brutus|Brutus]] the [[assassination of Julius Caesar|assassin]], came to a less fortunate but (in the eyes of her time) heroic end: she killed herself as the Republic collapsed, just as her father did.\n\nThe rise of [[Augustus]] to sole power in the last decades of the 1st century BCE diminished the power of political officeholders and the [[Roman senate|traditional oligarchy]], but did nothing to diminish and arguably increased the opportunities for women, as well as slaves and [[freedmen]], to exercise influence behind the scenes.<ref>Richard Saller, \"Status and patronage\", ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire, A.D. 70\u2013192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 18.</ref> Before this point, women's political power was extremely curtailed compared to the power men held by preventing their right to vote. However, starting with Augustus' rule, the inability to vote no longer mattered because the senate lost its power. Additionally, the shift from the forum to the palace allowed for women who lived there to gain an upper hand in influencing politics.<ref name=\":13\"/>\n\nOne notable woman was [[Livia Drusilla]] [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]] (58 BCE \u2013 CE 29),  the wife of [[Augustus]] and the most powerful woman in the [[Principate|early Roman Empire]], acting several times as regent and being Augustus' faithful advisor. Several women of the Imperial family, such as Livia's great-granddaughter and Caligula's sister [[Agrippina the Younger]], gained political influence as well as public prominence.\n\nWomen also participated in efforts to overthrow the emperors who abused their power. Shortly after [[Caligula]]'s sister [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]] died, her widower [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] and her sisters [[Agrippina the Younger]] and [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Livilla]] conspired to overthrow Caligula. The plot was discovered, and Lepidus was executed. Agrippina and Livilla were exiled, and returned from exile only when their paternal uncle Claudius came to power after Caligula's assassination in 41 CE.\n\nWomen could also be motivated by less than noble causes. Claudius's third wife [[Valeria Messalina]] conspired with [[Gaius Silius]] to overthrow her husband in the hope of installing herself and her lover in power.\n\n[[Tacitus]] immortalized the woman [[Epicharis (Pisonian conspirator)|Epicharis]] for her part in the [[Pisonian conspiracy]], where she attempted to gain the support of the Roman fleet and was instead arrested.<ref>Tacitus, Annals 15.51</ref> Once the conspiracy was uncovered, she would reveal nothing even under torture, in contrast to the senators, who were not subjected to torture and yet raced to spill the details. Tacitus also praises [[Egnatia Maximilla]] for sacrificing her fortune in order to stand by her innocent husband against Nero.<ref>Tacitus, Annals 15.71.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' (''Elagabalus'' 4.2 and 12.3) emperor [[Elagabalus]] had his mother or grandmother take part in Senate proceedings. \"And Elagabalus was the only one of all the emperors under whom a woman attended the senate like a man, just as though she belonged to the senatorial order\" (David Magie's translation). According to the same work, Elagabalus also established a women's senate called the ''senaculum'', which enacted rules to be applied to matrons, regarding clothing, chariot riding, the waering of jewelry etc. (''Elagabalus'' 4.3 and ''Aurelian'' 49.6). Before this, [[Agrippina the Younger]], mother of [[Nero]], had been ''listening'' to Senate proceedings, concealed behind a curtain, according to [[Tacitus]] (''Annales'', 13.5).\n\n===Women and the military===\nClassical texts have little to say about women and the Roman army. Emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BC\u2013AD 14) disallowed marriage by ordinary soldiers, a ban that lasted nearly two centuries. However it has been suggested  that  wives and children of centurions lived with them at border and provincial forts.<ref>Allison P. (2011) 'Soldiers\u2019 families in the early Roman Empire', in B.

Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their participation might be limited. As a rule women did not perform [[animal sacrifice]], the central rite of most major public ceremonies,<ref>[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F.

Schultz, ''Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 134\u2013136. In some sense, every head of household was a priest responsible for religious maintenance at home; in Roman patriarchal society, this was the ''paterfamilias''. Public religion, like society and politics in general, reflected the hierarchy of the household, since the ''familia'' was the building block of society. See John Scheid, ''An Introduction to Roman Religion'' (Indiana University Press, 2003), p. 129ff.</ref> Some cult practices were reserved for women only, for example, the rites of the Good Goddess ([[Bona Dea]]).<ref>Beard ''et al''., ''Religions of Rome'', vol. 1, pp. 296\u2013297.</ref>\n\nWomen priests played a prominent and crucial role in the official [[Religion in ancient Rome|religion of Rome]].

In addition to conducting certain religious rites, the Vestals participated at least symbolically in every official sacrifice, as they were responsible for preparing the required ritual substance ''[[mola salsa]]''.<ref>Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins,'' pp. 154\u2013155.</ref> The Vestals seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century CE, until the Christian emperors dissolved the order.\n\nA few priesthoods were held jointly by married couples. Marriage was a requirement for the [[Flamen Dialis]], the high priest of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]; his wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own unique priestly attire, and like her husband was placed under obscure magico-religious prohibitions.

The wealthiest families had private baths at home, but most people went to bath houses not only to wash but to socialize, as the larger facilities offered a range of services and recreational activities, among which [[casual sex]] was not excluded. One of the most vexed questions of Roman social life is whether the sexes bathed together in public. Until the late Republic, evidence suggests that women usually bathed in a separate wing or facility, or that women and men were scheduled at different times. But there is also clear evidence of [[mixed bathing]] from the late Republic until the rise of Christian dominance in the later Empire. Some scholars have thought that only lower-class women bathed with men, or those of dubious moral standing such as entertainers or prostitutes, but [[Clement of Alexandria]] observed that women of the highest social classes could be seen naked at the baths. [[Hadrian]] prohibited mixed bathing, but the ban seems not to have endured. Most likely, customs varied not only by time and place, but by facility, so that women could choose to segregate themselves by gender or not.<ref>Garrett G. Fagan, ''Bathing in Public in the Roman World'' (University of Michigan Press, 1999, 2002), pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nFor entertainment women could attend debates at the Forum, the public games (''[[ludi]]''), [[chariot races]], and theatrical performances. By the late Republic, they regularly attended dinner parties, though in earlier times the women of a household dined in private together.<ref>Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 92.</ref> Conservatives such as [[Cato the Elder]] (234\u2013149 BCE) considered it improper for women to take a more active role in public life; his complaints indicated that indeed some women did voice their opinions in the public sphere.<ref>Livius, Titus, A History of Rome, (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Pub, 2006), 182.</ref>\n\nThough the practice was discouraged, Roman generals would sometimes take their wives with them on [[military campaign]]s. [[Caligula]]'s mother [[Agrippina the Elder]] often accompanied her husband [[Germanicus]] on his campaigns in northern Germania, and the emperor [[Claudius]] was born in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] for this reason. Wealthy women might tour the empire, often participating or viewing religious ceremonies and sites around the empire.<ref>Assa, 102.</ref> Rich women traveled to the countryside during the summer when Rome became too hot.<ref>Assa, 96.</ref>\n\nFor more on how women fit into social classes in ancient Rome, see [[Social class in ancient Rome|Social Class in ancient Rome]].\n\n===Attire and adornment===\n[[File:Livia Drusila - Paestum (M.A.N.

They wore cosmetics and made different concoctions for their skin. [[Ovid]] even wrote a [[Medicamina Faciei Femineae|poem about the correct application of makeup]].

The law limited women's possession and display of gold and silver (as money or personal ornament), expensive clothing and their \"unnecessary\" use of chariots and litters. Victory over [[Carthage]] flooded Rome with wealth and in 195 BCE the Lex Oppia was reviewed. The ruling consul, [[Cato the Censor]] argued for its retention: personal morality and self-restraint were self-evidently inadequate controls on indulgence and luxury. Luxury provoked the envy and shame of those less well-off, and was therefore divisive. Roman women, in Cato's view, had showed only too clearly that their appetites once corrupted knew no limits, and must be restrained. Large numbers of Roman matrons thought otherwise, and made concerted public protest. In 193 BCE the laws were abolished: Cato's opposition did not harm his political career. Later, in 42 BCE, Roman women, led by [[Hortensia (orator)|Hortensia]], successfully protested against laws designed to tax Roman women, by use of the argument of [[no taxation without representation]].<ref>Pomeroy, Sarah Jane, ''Women in Classical Antiquity''</ref> Evidence of a lessening on luxury restrictions can also be found; one of the Letters of Pliny is addressed to the woman Pompeia Celerina praising the luxuries she keeps in her villa.<ref>Pliny the Younger, Letters, Book 1 letter IV</ref>\n\n====Body image====\n[[File:Unknown - Mazarin Venus - 54.AA.11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.5|[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], goddess of beauty and love (2nd century)]]\nBased on Roman art and literature, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Breasts|small breasts]] and wide hips were the ideal body type for women considered alluring by Roman men.<ref>Kelly Olson, \"The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl,\" in ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 143.</ref> Roman art from the [[Augustus|Augustan period]] shows idealized women as substantial and fleshy, with a full abdomen and breasts that are rounded,<ref>John R.

Subverting the tradition of male dominance, the love poets of the late Republic and [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan era]] declared their eagerness to submit to \"love slavery\" (''servitium amoris''). [[Catullus]] addresses a number of poems to \"Lesbia,\" a married woman with whom he has an affair, usually identified as a fictionalized [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Metellus)|Clodia]], sister of the prominent [[populares|popularist]] politician [[Clodius Pulcher]]. The affair ends badly, and Catullus's declarations of love turn to attacks on her sexual appetites \u2014 rhetoric that accords with the other hostile source on Clodia's behavior, [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Pro Caelio]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Ars Amatoria|The Art of Love]]'', [[Ovid]] goes a step further, adopting the genre of [[didactic poetry]] for offering instruction in how to pursue, keep, and get over a lover.

Balancing food, exercise, and sexual activity came to be regarded as a choice that women might make. The observation that intensive training was likely to result in amenorrhea implies that there were women who engaged in such regimens.<ref>Hanson, \"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\" p. 260. The ''Gynecology'' of [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]] is central to Hanson's arguments.</ref>\n\nIn the Roman era, medical writers saw a place for exercise in the lives of women in sickness and health.

The outsized phallus of [[Roman art]] was associated with the god [[Priapus]], among others. It was laughter-provoking, grotesque, or used for magical purposes; see David Fredrick, ''The Roman Gaze: Vision, Power, and the Body'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), p. 156. Nude statues of men that were intended to be beautiful or dignified had a small penis.</ref> was considered a symptom of excessive sexuality. Although Hellenistic and Roman medical and other writers refer to [[clitoridectomy]] as primarily an \"Egyptian\" custom, gynecological manuals under the Christian Empire in [[late antiquity]] propose that hypersexuality could be treated by surgery or repeated childbirth.<ref>Hanson, \"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\" p. 267. Clitoridectomy is described in some detail by the Byzantine physicians and medical writers [[A\u00ebtius of Amida]] (''[[wikt:floruit|fl.]]'' mid-5th century/mid-6th century) and [[Paul of Aegina]], as well as the [[Africa (Roman province)|North African]] gynecological writer [[Muscio]] (''ca.'' 500 CE); see Holt N.

A freed slave owed a period of service, the terms of which might be agreed upon as a precondition of freedom, to her former owner, who became her [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]. The patron had obligations in return, such as paying for said services and helping in legal matters. The [[patron-client relationship]] was one of the fundamental social structures of ancient Rome, and failure to fulfill one's obligations brought disapproval and censure.\n\nIn most ways, freedwomen had the same legal status as freeborn women. But because under Roman law a slave had no father, freed slaves had no inheritance rights unless they were named in a will.\n\nThe relationship of a former slave to her patron could be complicated. In one legal case, a woman named Petronia Iusta attempted to show \u2014 without a birth declaration to prove it \u2014 that she had been free-born. Her mother, she acknowledged, had been a slave in the household of Petronius Stephanus and Calatoria Themis, but Iusta maintained that she had been born after her mother's manumission. Calatoria, by now a widow, in turn argued that Iusta was born before her mother was free and that she had been manumitted, therefore owing her former owner the service due a patron. Calatoria could produce no documentation of this supposed manumission, and the case came down to the testimony of witnesses.<ref>J.A. Crook, ''Law and Life of Rome 90 B.C.-A.D. 212'' (Cornell University Press, 1967, 1984), pp. 48\u201350.</ref>\n\nUneducated or unskilled slaves had few opportunities to earn their freedom, and if they became free would lack means of supporting themselves. Therefore, a freedwoman in the workplace could have the advantage in training and skill over a woman born to a free family of [[working poor]].<ref>Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 194.</ref>\n\nThe status of freedwomen, like freedmen, varied widely. [[Caenis]] was a freedwoman and secretary to the Emperor [[Vespasian]]; she was also his concubine. He is said to have lived with her faithfully, but she was not considered a wife.<ref>Crook, ''Law and Life of Rome'', p. 101.</ref>\n\n==Prostitution==\n{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}\nWomen could turn to prostitution to support themselves, but not all prostitutes had freedom to decide. There is some evidence that even slave prostitutes could benefit from their labor.<ref>The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World: A Study of social History and the Brothel By Thomas A. McGinn. pg. 52</ref> Although rape was a crime, the law only punished the rape of a slave if it \"damaged the goods,\" because a slave had no legal standing. The penalty was aimed at providing her owner compensation for the \"damage\" of his property. Because a slave woman was considered property under Roman law, forcing her to be a prostitute was not considered a crime. Prior to [[Septimius Severus]], women who engaged in acts that brought ''infamia'' to them as slaves also suffered ''infamia'' when freed.<ref>Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press. 1998, p. 56.</ref> Sometimes sellers of female slaves attached a ''ne serva'' clause to the slave to prevent her from being prostituted. The Ne Serva clause meant that if the new owner or any owner after him or her used the slave as a prostitute she would be free. Later on the ''ne serva'' agreements became enforceable by law.<ref>Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 293</ref> Prostitution was not limited to slaves or poor citizens; according to Suetonius, Caligula when converting his palace into a brothel employed upper class \"matrons and youths\" as prostitutes. Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula, Tacitus records that during one of Nero's feasts the prefect [[Tigellinus]] had brothels filled with upper class women.<ref>Tacitus, Annals 15.37</ref> Prostitution could also be a punishment instead of an occupation; a law of Augustus allowed that women guilty of adultery could be sentenced to work in brothels as prostitutes. The law was abolished in 389.<ref>Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 171, 310.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[List of Roman women]]\n* [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities]]\n* [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]]\n* [[Women in ancient Sparta]]\n* [[Women in Classical Athens]]\n* [[Women in ancient warfare]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|author=Assa, Janine|title=The Great Roman Ladies|place=New York|publisher=Grove Press|year=1960}}\n* Daehner, Jens (ed.), ''The Herculaneum Women: History, Context, Identities'' (Los Angeles: The [[J.
