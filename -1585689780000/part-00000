It is arguably his most famous short story and is the title story for his collection on the [[Franco-Prussian War]], titled '''''Boule de Suif et Autres Contes de la Guerre''''' (''Dumpling and Other Stories of the War'').\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story is set in the Franco-Pussian War and follows a group of French residents of [[Rouen]], recently occupied by the Prussian army. The ten travellers decide for various reasons to leave Rouen and flee to [[Le Havre]] in a [[stagecoach]]. Sharing the carriage are Boule de Suif or \"Butterball\" (lit. ''[[Suet|suet dumpling]]'', also translated as ''ball of fat''), a prostitute whose real name is Elisabeth Rousset; the strict [[Third Republic of France|Democrat]] Cornudet; a shop-owning couple from the [[petty bourgeoisie]], M. and Mme. Loiseau; a wealthy upper-bourgeoisie factory-owner and his wife, M. and Mme. Carr\u00e9-Lamadon; the [[Count|Comte]] and Comtesse of Br\u00e9ville; and two [[nun]]s. Thus, the carriage constitutes a microcosm of French society, representing different parts of the French population during the late 19th century.\n\nDue to the terrible weather, the coach moves very slowly and by midday has only covered a few miles. The occupants initially snub Boule de Suif, but their attitudes change when she produces a [[picnic]] basket full of lovely food and offers to share its contents with the hungry travellers.\n\nAt the village of T\u00f4tes, the carriage stops at the local [[coaching inn]], and the occupants, hearing a German voice, realise they have blundered into Prussian-held territory. A [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] officer detains the party at the inn indefinitely without telling them why. Over the next two days, the travellers become increasingly impatient, and are finally told by Boule de Suif that they are being detained until she agrees to sleep with the officer. She is repeatedly called before the officer, and always returns in a heightened state of agitation. Initially, the travellers support her and are furious at the officer's arrogance, but their indignation soon disappears as they grow angry at Boule de Suif for not sleeping with the officer so that they can leave. Over the course of the next two days, the travelers use various examples of logic and morality to convince her it is the right thing to do; she finally gives in and sleeps with the officer, who allows them to leave the next morning.\n\nAs they continue on their way to [[Le Havre]], these \"representatives of Virtue\" ignore Boule de Suif and turn to polite topics of conversation, glancing scathingly at the young woman while refusing to even acknowledge her, and refusing to share their food with her the way that she did with them earlier. As the coach travels on into the night, Cornudet starts whistling the ''[[Marseillaise]]'' while Boule de Suif seethes with rage against the other passengers, and finally weeps for her lost dignity.\n\n== Themes ==\n{{Essay-like|section|date=October 2011}}\n{{Original research|section|date=October 2011}}\nThe main theme focuses on French resistance to the German occupiers during the war. During the first half of the story, the narrator explains the background of each of the occupants, with particular emphasis on the petty bourgeois Democrat, Cornudet, who is said to have devised all manner of defences for [[Rouen]]. The overriding theme is that while the occupants talk a great deal about resisting the invaders, they are ultimately running away in a cowardly fashion rather than staying in the town. The first section of the story also establishes that the most fiercely patriotic passenger is Boule de Suif herself, an insignificant and unpopular character in Rouen, while the aristocrats and bourgeois are portrayed as happier to betray their country in order to end the war and return to their comfortable lives. In that respect, Maupassant praises the patriotic fervour of the inhabitants of the provinces, in sharp contrast to other French writers of the period who accused provincial French citizens of being apathetic and cowardly.\n\nBoule de Suif's personal resistance grows throughout the story; when the coach is stopped by the Germans at the village of [[T\u00f4tes]], the other passengers meekly follow the officer's orders while Boule de Suif refuses to co-operate as easily. Boule de Suif's resistance to the officer's sexual advances again shows her patriotism, something which is noticed by the other characters, who comment that although it is Boule de Suif's job to sleep with men, she patriotically refuses to allow herself to be conquered by the German officer.\n\nLike Maupassant's other short stories on the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he tends to stereotype the German soldiers. The troops holding [[Rouen]] are hinted at as dull and slow-witted. The German officer at the inn is portrayed in the same way as Maupassant depicts German officers throughout his stories; the officer is shown as being arrogant, morally dubious, and unfeeling. The description of the officer in his room at the inn suggests that he is pointlessly destructive, uncultured, and boorish. At the same time, there are passages that describe how German troops get about their daily life and long to return home to their own families.\n\nThe theme of class barrier is also tackled in the story. Throughout the story, Maupassant portrays the inhabitants of the coach in various disparaging ways. The aristocratic Comte and Comtesse are revealed to be weak and cowardly in spite of their position as the chief dignitaries of Rouen. The manufacturer and his wife are constantly portrayed as greedy and materialistic, and the manufacturer's wife in particular is always shown to be shocked whenever her husband spends any money.\n\nThe [[petit bourgeois]] wine-seller and his wife are shown as corrupt and morally reprehensible, the most likely of the party to betray their country simply to return to a life of greed in peace. The two nuns travelling in the coach are at first portrayed as quiet and subservient to God, and later show themselves as fiery, patriotic, and doing more for their country than the other occupants of the coach: the nuns claim to be travelling to a military hospital to treat wounded French soldiers, thus offering the deciding argument towards persuading Boule de Suif to abandon her resistance. The narrator offers to excuse their crafty argumentation as accidental stupidity, but the nuns' base behavior as they fail to share food with the courtesan raises a question mark if not necessarily on their story then on their altruistic motivation. Cornudet is repeatedly shown as a man who is little more than a drunken, lecherous, and cowardly man who is not prepared to stand up for his vicious anti-German beliefs when the time comes. In contrast to all of these is Boule de Suif herself, revealed to be the most fiercely patriotic, kind-hearted, and morally admirable character, which Maupassant contrasts with the hypocrisy and snobbery of the other travellers.\n\nDespite being shunned by the other occupants at first, she gladly shares her picnic basket with the hungry occupants of the coach, but at the end of the novel, when she has no food for the other half of the journey, the coach's other occupants refuse to share their food with her, an ingratitude made even worse by the fact that it was Boule de Suif's personal sacrifice that allowed them to leave. Her self-sacrifice in sleeping with the German officer underlines her personal courage and the blind hypocrisy of the other travellers; the travellers go to great lengths to persuade Boule de Suif to sleep with the officer in order that he will let the coach continue its journey, and the travellers fill Boule de Suif's head with arguments, arguing that it is for the good of the country; that it is not morally wrong to sleep with the officer to let the travellers leave; and that the longer she waits, the more young French soldiers will die as the nuns are not there to look after them.\n\nWhen Boule de Suif gives in and sleeps with the officer, the rest of the travellers throw a party without her, and when the coach finally leaves the next morning, they treat her with utter disgust and contempt although she has freed them and they had induced her to lose her dignity.\n\n== Publication history ==\nIt was first published in 1880 in ''[[Les Soir\u00e9es de M\u00e9dan]]'', a collection of Naturalist short stories dealing with the Franco-Prussian war.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe plot has often been adapted, in whole or in part, for films and other media:\n* In 1928 in the US, a silent film version was ''[[The Woman Disputed]]'' by [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]] & [[Sam Taylor (director)|Sam Taylor]].\n* In 1932, also in the US, ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' by [[Josef von Sternberg]], starring Marlene Dietrich, was loosely based on the story, with significant changes.\n* In 1934, the Moscow Art Players, under the auspices of the Soviet studio [[Mosfilm]], produced a silent film version of \"Boule de Suif\" called ''[[Boule de Suif (1934 film)|Pyshka (Dumpling)]]''.

The film was re-released by Mosfilm in 1955 with a narration and sound effects added to it, but remained unknown outside of Russia until its belated premiere in New York in 1958. ''New York Times'' reviewer Howard Thompson describes the film as \"little more than a musty curio\" but with a storyline that \"is still pretty wonderful as a yarn and a scathing commentary on hypocrisy and selfishness\"<ref>Thompson, Howard.

In an added twist, the young woman forgives the outlaw leader for trying to abduct her and tells Paladin to let him go, because, she says, \"He said he had respect for me.\"\n* In 1959 [[Anatole Litvak]]'s \"[[The Journey (1959 film)|The Journey]]\" with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner borrowed heavily from the plot device of a group of travellers detained by an authoritarian foreign officer with a romantic interest in an attractive passenger.\n* In July 2006, the opera ''The Greater Good, or The Passion of Boule de Suif'' opened as a part of the Glimmerglass Opera Festival in Cooperstown, New York.<ref>Tommasini, Anthony. \"Stephen Hartke's First Opera, 'The Greater Good,' Features an Aria for Clanging Soup Spoons.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men military age standards were modified to take on those from 18\u201350 years old.  Later it was found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

[[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19th the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/>With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]](UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and United States [[Marine Corps]].\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry_harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]]. <ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes enroute to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well.

Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.

The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].

After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[ Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Once ashore, before the island was secured, Seabee bulldozers were at work completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days.

The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men military age standards were modified to take on those from 18\u201350 years old.  Later it was found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked be the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for the unofficial trades of souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], float [[pontoons]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}, [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13th, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19th the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/>With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]](UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and United States [[Marine Corps]].\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry_harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]]. <ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes enroute to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April, 1945, p. 46</ref> \n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[ Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dietzenbach 2020-present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 19.0\n|Feb record high C =

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route. Dietzenbach moreover has at its disposal its own town bus network with a central bus station at the ''Dietzenbach Mitte'' S-Bahn station. Bus lines which cross Dietzenbach are the town lines OF-56 and 57, the county lines OF95, 96, 97 and 99 as well as night line n71. ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 459, the [[Autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] and  [[Bundesautobahn 661|A&nbsp;661]] can be reached in a few minutes through the Offenbach [[interchange (road)|interchange]].\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Festival ===\nEach year in Dietzenbach, the following festivals offer a chance to pursue social contacts:\n* ''Apfelbl\u00fctenfest'' is being held in April.\n* ''Fest ohne Grenzen'' (\u201cFestival Without Borders\u201d), held at the Hessentagspark\n* ''Fest der Biere'' (\u201cFestival of Beers\u201d), held at the Harmonieplatz, lasts five days\n* ''Weinfest'' in the New Town Centre, runs ten days\n* ''Nacht der Lichter''(\u201cNight of the Lights\u201d)with \"Museumsnacht\" and \"Heimatfest\" held in the Old Town Centre\n* ''Trinkbornfest'' in the Old Town on the first weekend in September\n* ''Dietzenbacher Kelterfest'' about the \"\u00c4bbelwoi\" and the making of it\n* ''Kerb'' or ''[[Kirchweih]]'', always held on the last weekend in October. It stretches along Landwehrstra\u00dfe from Harmonieplatz to the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Schule (school). The revived tradition of the ''Kerbborsche'' \u2013 a group of young men who perform part of the ceremony<!--Perhaps someone can find out what part.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dietzenbach 2020-present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 14.8\n|Feb record high C =

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

Starting 10 February 2019, Sisi also began serving a one-year term as [[Chairperson of the African Union]], which concluded in 2020.<ref name=cyrilsupport />He is widely known as Akhu sharmuta, a nickname that he often adopts for himself. \n\nSisi was born in [[Cairo]] and after joining the military, held a post in [[Saudi Arabia]] before enrolling in the Egyptian Army's Command and Staff College. In 1992, Sisi trained at the [[Joint Services Command and Staff College]] at [[Watchfield]], [[Oxfordshire]], in the [[United Kingdom]], and then in 2006 trained at the [[United States Army War College]] in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Sisi served as a [[mechanized infantry]] commander and then as director of [[military intelligence]]. After the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]] and election of [[Mohamed Morsi]] to the Egyptian presidency, Sisi was appointed [[List of Ministers of Defence of Egypt|Minister of Defence]] by Morsi on 12 August 2012, replacing the Mubarak-era [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi|Hussein Tantawi]].\n\nAs Minister of Defence, and ultimately Commander-in-Chief of the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]], Sisi was involved in [[2013 Egyptian coup d'\u00e9tat|the military coup]] that removed Morsi from office on 3 July 2013, in response to [[June 2013 Egyptian protests]], called a revolution by its proponents. He dissolved the [[Egyptian Constitution of 2012]] and proposed, along with leading opposition and religious figures, a new political road map, which included the voting for a new constitution, and new parliamentary and presidential elections. Morsi was replaced by an interim president, [[Adly Mansour]], who appointed a [[Beblawi Cabinet|new cabinet]]. The interim government cracked down on the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and its Islamist supporters in the months that followed, and later on certain liberal opponents of the post-Morsi administration.

In his paper, he argues in favour of democracy based on its past successes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.meforum.org/4802/what-egypt-president-sisi-really-thinks|title=What Egypt's President Sisi Really Thinks|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|date=Fall 2014|website=Middle East Forum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Zuhur also had the impression that el-Sisi supported a gradual move towards pluralism.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ambitious men in uniform|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21582564-generals-who-deposed-muslim-brotherhood-are-keener-power-they-let|work=The Economist|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> While at the War College, Sisi sometimes led Friday prayers at the local mosque.<ref name=\"veconomist2\" >{{cite news|author=|title=Egypt's path from autocracy to revolution\u2014and back again|url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/08/11/egypts-path-from-autocracy-to-revolution-and-back-again|work=[[The Economist]]|date=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nSisi described himself as \"a doctor whose diagnoses are sought after by top philosophers and prominent world leaders.\"<ref name=\"middleeasteye.net\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/four-traits-sisi-hitler-and-mussolini-have-common-1427651880|title=The four traits Sisi, Hitler and Mussolini have in common|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/blog/2015/6/8/sisi-declares-himself-egypts-god-send|title=Sisi declares himself Egypt's God-send|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614003241/http://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/blog/2015/6/8/sisi-declares-himself-egypts-god-send|archive-date=14 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Family appointments===\nIn June 2018, one of el-Sisi's sons, [[Mahmoud el-Sisi]], was appointed Deputy Director of the [[General Intelligence Directorate (Egypt)|General Intelligence Directorate]] (GIS), one of the three Egyptian intelligence services.<ref name=\"AJE_Hazem_Ghonim\" /> [[Mohamed Ali (Egyptian contractor)|Mohamed Ali]], the building contractor whose online videos criticising president el-Sisi sparked off the [[2019 Egyptian protests#Late September 2019 protests|September 2019 Egyptian protests]] claimed that Mahmoud el-Sisi was the ''de facto'' real head of the Mukhabarat.<ref name=\"MEE_Sisi_new_palace\" />\n\nOn 20 November 2019, two GIS officials interviewed by ''[[Mada Masr]]'' stated that Mahmoud was to be shifted from GIS to the [[Military Intelligence and Reconnaissance (Egypt)|Military Intelligence agency]] and assigned to a [[Embassy of Egypt in Moscow|diplomatic position in Moscow]] in 2020.<ref name=\"MadaMasr_MahmoudSisi_sidelined\" /> The reason cited for the move and attributed to people close to president el-Sisi was a \"negative impact on [president el-Sisi's] image\" resulting from Mahmoud's alleged ineffectiveness in his responsibilities and visible role in high-level decision-making. The reason attributed to senior [[United Arab Emirates]] government officials is that they saw Mahmoud's role as \"damaging to the president\". Regional and international media attention to Mahmoud's role was cited as significantly harming president el-Sisi's image and threatening the \"stability of the administration\". The proposed move was \"welcomed\" by Russian authorities.<ref name=\"MadaMasr_MahmoudSisi_sidelined\" /> In response to ''Mada Masr''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s report, ''Mada Masr'' journalist [[Shady

Starting 10 February 2019, Sisi also began serving a one-year term as [[Chairperson of the African Union]], which concluded in 2020.<ref name=cyrilsupport />\n\nSisi was born in [[Cairo]] and after joining the military, held a post in [[Saudi Arabia]] before enrolling in the Egyptian Army's Command and Staff College. In 1992, Sisi trained at the [[Joint Services Command and Staff College]] at [[Watchfield]], [[Oxfordshire]], in the [[United Kingdom]], and then in 2006 trained at the [[United States Army War College]] in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Sisi served as a [[mechanized infantry]] commander and then as director of [[military intelligence]]. After the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]] and election of [[Mohamed Morsi]] to the Egyptian presidency, Sisi was appointed [[List of Ministers of Defence of Egypt|Minister of Defence]] by Morsi on 12 August 2012, replacing the Mubarak-era [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi|Hussein Tantawi]].\n\nAs Minister of Defence, and ultimately Commander-in-Chief of the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]], Sisi was involved in [[2013 Egyptian coup d'\u00e9tat|the military coup]] that removed Morsi from office on 3 July 2013, in response to [[June 2013 Egyptian protests]], called a revolution by its proponents. He dissolved the [[Egyptian Constitution of 2012]] and proposed, along with leading opposition and religious figures, a new political road map, which included the voting for a new constitution, and new parliamentary and presidential elections. Morsi was replaced by an interim president, [[Adly Mansour]], who appointed a [[Beblawi Cabinet|new cabinet]]. The interim government cracked down on the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and its Islamist supporters in the months that followed, and later on certain liberal opponents of the post-Morsi administration.

Its on Wikipedia, so its true.\n\nLead vocalist and guitarist [[Blake Schwarzenbach]], bassist Chris Bauermeister, and drummer Adam Pfahler formed the band while students at [[New York University]], later relocating to [[Los Angeles]] where they released their debut album ''[[Unfun]]'' (1990) through [[independent record label]] Shredder Records. Relocating again to [[San Francisco]] the next year, they released 1992's ''[[Bivouac (album)|Bivouac]]'' through the Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.\n\nSchwarzenbach's charisma and personal, frustrated lyrics helped establish him as a [[cult following|cult idol]], even as he underwent surgery to remove painful, voice-threatening [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]]s from his throat. Jawbreaker toured with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] in 1993 and released ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]'' in 1994, attracting the attention of major labels. They signed a $1 million contract with [[DGC Records]] and released 1995's ''[[Dear You]]'', but its polished production and smooth vocals caused significant backlash from the band's core audience.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Internal tensions led to Jawbreaker's dissolution in 1996. On April 19, 2017, the band announced their reunion.<ref name=\"reunion\"/>\n\nFollowing the breakup, the members of Jawbreaker were active in other projects including [[Jets to Brazil]] and [[Whysall Lane]]. Pfahler continued to issue previously-recorded Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, and public interest in the band continued due in part to nationally charting [[pop punk]] and emo acts openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound. In 2004, Pfahler licensed the out-of-print ''Dear You'' from DGC's parent company [[Geffen Records]] and re-released it to a positive response. He has since issued a [[audio mastering|remastered]] version of ''Unfun'', and plans to remaster the rest of the band's catalog.\n\n== History ==\n=== 1986\u201390: Formation and ''Unfun'' ===\nPrior to forming Jawbreaker, [[Blake Schwarzenbach]] and Adam Pfahler were childhood friends in [[Santa Monica, California]] and classmates at [[Crossroads High School]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\">{{Cite journal |last=Kelley |first=Trevor |title=The Oral History of Jawbreaker |journal=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |page=79 |date=September 2010  |volume=25 |issue=266 |location=[[Cleveland]]}}</ref> In 1986 they moved to [[New York City]] to attend [[New York University]] and decided to start a band.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Seeking a [[bassist]], they responded to a [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] posted on campus by Chris Bauermeister.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"It wasn't just this Xeroxed thing\", Pfahler later recalled, \"It was something he had drawn, like a poster. It was all colored and it named all the right bands.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> The trio began practicing together at Giant Studios on [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], with Schwarzenbach on [[guitar]] and Pfahler on [[drum kit|drums]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"It was just us, trying to figure each other out in that hourly room for a while\", recalls Schwarzenbach, \"We went through ''a lot'' of incarnations before we sounded anything like the band we became. I am glad we didn't play live [very much then], because I had to go through my [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] phase.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> They practiced with several singers and went through several names during this time, eventually settling on the name Rise.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1987 Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister took time off from college and moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue Rise, adding Bauermeister's childhood friend Jon Liu on lead vocals.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> This changed, however, when Schwarzenbach wrote and sang \"Shield Your Eyes\" for the band's [[demo (music)|demo]]. It was the first recording on which he sang, and he later noted that it \"kind of defined where we would go as a band\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> According to Liu, \"That was the song where everything worked. The vocal arrangements. The lyrics. It was a perfect piece. But to my detriment, I kind of bristled against it. I was like, 'This is amazing, and I don't think I can do ''anything'' like this.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> The band soon changed their name to Jawbreaker and Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister decided to continue as a trio with Schwarzenbach on vocals.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Bauermeister was given the task of informing Liu that he was no longer in the band, which proved awkward since the two were roommates.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"I am cool with it now,\" reflected Liu in 2010, \"It was to everybody's benefit.

Then there were maybe 25 utterly forgettable metal-club-in-Florida-type shows.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Bauermeister stopped speaking to Pfahler and Schwarzenbach when the tour reached Canada, with several weeks still to go. By the conclusion of the tour, tensions between the members had risen to the point where they announced the band's breakup.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Schwarzenbach and Bauermeister returned to New York University to finish their degrees, and rarely spoke to each other.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\">Kelley, p. 80.</ref>\n\n=== 1991\u201392: Relocation and ''Bivouac'' ===\nPfahler quickly regretted the breakup, while Schwarzenbach and Bauermeister eventually reconciled in New York.<ref>Kelley, pp. 79\u201380.</ref> The trio decided to continue with Jawbreaker and relocate to [[San Francisco]], where they had already earned the acceptance of local acts Econochrist and [[Samiam]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> In 1991 they moved into an apartment complex in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]]; Pfahler and Schwarzenbach shared an apartment across the hall from Bauermeister and [[J Church (band)|J Church]]'s Lance Hahn.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> They recorded their second album, ''[[Bivouac (album)|Bivouac]]'', with [[recording engineer]] [[Billy Anderson (producer)|Billy Anderson]], and it was released in 1992 through the local labels Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Pfahler has described the album as \"varied and ambitious\", noting that it \"took ages to finish\" and \"I think we were trying to prove something with that record.

But it was too late. We had to play or else we would have bankrupted our friends.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> By the time the band reached [[Ireland]], Schwarzenbach's condition had worsened and the tour was put on hold while he had surgery to remove the polyp.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> The tour resumed a week later.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\n=== 1993\u201394: ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' and signing to DGC ===\nUpon returning to San Francisco, Pfahler and Schwarzenbach were homeless and slept in the band's touring van for a brief period.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> They soon found new residences, with Schwarzenbach moving to nearby [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] where he began writing lyrics for the band's third album, ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]''.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Jawbreaker travelled to [[Chicago]] in May 1993 and recorded the bulk of the album with engineer [[Steve Albini]],<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> though the album's production is officially credited on liner notes and packaging to Fluss, Albini's cat. They recorded three additional tracks with [[Billy Anderson (producer)|Billy Anderson]] in San Francisco that August, and the album was released in early 1994 through Tupelo/Communion.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Music journalist [[Andy Greenwald]] and ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Trevor Kelley both cite it as the album most beloved by the band's fans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 24\">Greenwald, p. 24.</ref> \"''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' is arguably Jawbreaker's best album,\" writes Greenwald, \"but it is also far and away its most loved, the best example of Schwarzenbach's innate ability to marry the boozy, bluesy regretfulness of [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] with the loose, seat-of-the-pants attitude of [[924 Gilman Street|Gilman Street]] punk.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 24\"/> As [[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] copies of the album began to circulate in late summer 1993, the band began to earn a devoted fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\n[[File:Ben-weasel2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ben Weasel]] was among the figures in the punk rock community openly critical of Jawbreaker's signing to DGC.]]\nIn October 1993, prior to ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, Jawbreaker were asked to open for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on six dates of their ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\">Kelley, p. 81.</ref> Fans bristled against this, wary that it would result in Jawbreaker\u2014a beloved independent band\u2014signing to major label [[DGC Records]], whom Nirvana were contracted to.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I think we were fortunate [with ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'']\", recalls Schwarzenbach, \"But we ''still'' got some flack. Even at that point, there were people who didn't think we were especially punk-rock, as some people practiced it. I don't think there was any major pushback, though, until we did the Nirvana tour. That's ''officially'' when it started.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Pfahler: \"People really came down on us for going on tour with Nirvana. They really saw it as, 'Okay, here we go. This is the first step. The next thing that happens is that someone from the label sees them and they get snapped up.' Which is kind of what happened.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nFollowing the release of ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' in February 1994, Jawbreaker received contract offers from major record labels.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Though they had already decided to break up following the album's supporting tours due to tiredness and frustration, the band decided to consider the offers, partly due to the major label successes of their peers [[Green Day]] and [[Jawbox]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\">Greenwald, p. 25.</ref> They met with a number of labels over the course of the year, narrowing their options to [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[Capitol Records]], and DGC.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> They signed to DGC in a one million-dollar deal, due in part to the relationship they had developed with [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Mark Kates who they had met on the Nirvana tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Fans and key figures in the punk rock community were quick to denounce the band for the move.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> In an interview for [[Ben Weasel]]'s ''Panic Button'' zine following the Nirvana tour, Schwarzenbach had stated flatly that Jawbreaker was not interested in signing to a major record label. In response to the signing, Weasel took the band to task in a column for ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' accompanied by a photo depicting him eating his own hat, which he had promised to do if the band ever signed to a major.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u201396: ''Dear You'' and breakup ===\nJawbreaker began recording their major-label debut, ''[[Dear You]]'', in February 1995 at [[Fantasy Studios]] in [[Berkeley, California]] with [[Rob Cavallo]], who had [[record producer|produced]] Green Day's breakthrough album ''[[Dookie]]'' the previous year.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Recording sessions lasted two months and resulted in disenchantment and tension within the band, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> After a week of recording drums and bass guitar, Bauermeister and Pfahler were largely absent from the rest of the sessions while Schwarzenbach continued to work on the album with Cavallo.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I didn't even go\", recalled Bauermeister in 2010, \"I just hung out at home with my wife. I was already trying to separate myself from the band, while Blake became more of the major force.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> With a large recording budget at their disposal, Schwarzenbach and Cavallo spent much of their time polishing the record's production value, making the vocals and guitar clear and bringing them to the forefront of the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Cavallo, \"Blake really wanted to be heard. I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently. Then, to me, I thought those songs could benefit from some precision.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n[[File:Rob Cavallo.jpg|thumb|upright|Producer [[Rob Cavallo]] gave ''Dear You'' very polished production value in comparison to Jawbreaker's previous albums.]] \nIn the months leading up to the album's release, a number of music publications positioned Jawbreaker as the next stars of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] punk scene, sometimes referring to them as \"the thinking man's Green Day\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> When ''Dear You'' was released in September 1995, however, its polished production and clear vocals strongly divided the band's fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> \"[''Dear You'']'s production glistened and gleamed,\" says Greenwald, \"Schwarzenbach's voice was sanded and smoothed, and the songs were mellow, introspective affairs. The reaction was harsh\u2014those who had entrusted their emotional lives to Schwarzenbach, had viewed him as a tattered, secular priest to lay their burdens on, felt betrayed.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Ben Weasel was so displeased with the album, particularly the sound of Schwarzenbach's singing, that he wrote Pfahler a letter detailing his complaints with it.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Despite a [[music video]] in rotation to support the [[single (music)|single]] \"Fireman,\" sales of ''Dear You'' were poor.<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/>\n\nAs the band toured in support of the album, audience reaction toward the new material was either lukewarm or outright negative.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I have never seen anything like that\u2014before or since\", said Kates, \"There was a point where they were headlining the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] and there were kids sitting on the floor, with their backs to the stage, when they were playing songs from ''Dear You''. I'm not making that up. If you were to try to explain that to somebody now, it would make no sense.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Jawbreaker continued touring in 1996, opening for the [[Foo Fighters]] that spring, but audience reception did not improve.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Samiam's Sergie Loobkoff cites a show at [[The Warfield]] in San Francisco as a turning point: \"That is when I knew they were ''definitely'' going to break up. It was their hometown; they had put out the big major-label record. But then you're looking around and it was like no one cared.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nAttitudes between the band members continued to sour, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach, who took to traveling in separate vans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Tensions came to a head in [[Salem, Oregon]], culminating in a fistfight between the two which spilled out of the van and onto the sidewalk.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Jordan |title=Jawbreaker / Timmy Hansell (In Honor.org) |date=2008-08-30 |website=Pastepunk.com |url=http://www.pastepunk.com/site/jawbreaker-timmy-hansell-in-honororg/ |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> \"I remember just calling Blake a 'fucking [[prima donna]]' and a 'stupid son of a bitch who thinks it's all about him.'

Pfahler continued to issue previously-recorded Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, and public interest in the band continued due in part to nationally charting [[pop punk]] and emo acts openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound. In 2004, Pfahler licensed the out-of-print ''Dear You'' from DGC's parent company [[Geffen Records]] and re-released it to a positive response. He has since issued a [[audio mastering|remastered]] version of ''Unfun'', and plans to remaster the rest of the band's catalog.\n\n== History ==\n=== 1986\u201390: Formation and ''Unfun'' ===\nPrior to forming Jawbreaker, [[Blake Schwarzenbach]] and Adam Pfahler were childhood friends in [[Santa Monica, California]] and classmates at [[Crossroads High School]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\">{{Cite journal |last=Kelley |first=Trevor |title=The Oral History of Jawbreaker |journal=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |page=79 |date=September 2010  |volume=25 |issue=266 |location=[[Cleveland]]}}</ref> In 1986 they moved to [[New York City]] to attend [[New York University]] and decided to start a band.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Seeking a [[bassist]], they responded to a [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] posted on campus by Chris Bauermeister.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"It wasn't just this Xeroxed thing\", Pfahler later recalled, \"It was something he had drawn, like a poster.

I am glad we didn't play live [very much then], because I had to go through my [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] phase.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> They practiced with several singers and went through several names during this time, eventually settling on the name Rise.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1987 Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister took time off from college and moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue Rise, adding Bauermeister's childhood friend Jon Liu on lead vocals.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> This changed, however, when Schwarzenbach wrote and sang \"Shield Your Eyes\" for the band's [[demo (music)|demo]]. It was the first recording on which he sang, and he later noted that it \"kind of defined where we would go as a band\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> According to Liu, \"That was the song where everything worked. The vocal arrangements. The lyrics. It was a perfect piece. But to my detriment, I kind of bristled against it. I was like, 'This is amazing, and I don't think I can do ''anything'' like this.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> The band soon changed their name to Jawbreaker and Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister decided to continue as a trio with Schwarzenbach on vocals.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Bauermeister was given the task of informing Liu that he was no longer in the band, which proved awkward since the two were roommates.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"I am cool with it now,\" reflected Liu in 2010, \"It was to everybody's benefit.

But it was too late. We had to play or else we would have bankrupted our friends.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> By the time the band reached [[Ireland]], Schwarzenbach's condition had worsened and the tour was put on hold while he had surgery to remove the polyp.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> The tour resumed a week later.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\n=== 1993\u201394: ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' and signing to DGC ===\nUpon returning to San Francisco, Pfahler and Schwarzenbach were homeless and slept in the band's touring van for a brief period.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> They soon found new residences, with Schwarzenbach moving to nearby [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] where he began writing lyrics for the band's third album, ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]''.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Jawbreaker travelled to [[Chicago]] in May 1993 and recorded the bulk of the album with engineer [[Steve Albini]],<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> though the album's production is officially credited on liner notes and packaging to Fluss, Albini's cat. They recorded three additional tracks with [[Billy Anderson (producer)|Billy Anderson]] in San Francisco that August, and the album was released in early 1994 through Tupelo/Communion.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Music journalist [[Andy Greenwald]] and ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Trevor Kelley both cite it as the album most beloved by the band's fans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 24\">Greenwald, p. 24.</ref> \"''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' is arguably Jawbreaker's best album,\" writes Greenwald, \"but it is also far and away its most loved, the best example of Schwarzenbach's innate ability to marry the boozy, bluesy regretfulness of [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] with the loose, seat-of-the-pants attitude of [[924 Gilman Street|Gilman Street]] punk.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 24\"/> As [[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] copies of the album began to circulate in late summer 1993, the band began to earn a devoted fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\n[[File:Ben-weasel2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ben Weasel]] was among the figures in the punk rock community openly critical of Jawbreaker's signing to DGC.]]\nIn October 1993, prior to ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, Jawbreaker were asked to open for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on six dates of their ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\">Kelley, p. 81.</ref> Fans bristled against this, wary that it would result in Jawbreaker\u2014a beloved independent band\u2014signing to major label [[DGC Records]], whom Nirvana were contracted to.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I think we were fortunate [with ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'']\", recalls Schwarzenbach, \"But we ''still'' got some flack. Even at that point, there were people who didn't think we were especially punk-rock, as some people practiced it. I don't think there was any major pushback, though, until we did the Nirvana tour. That's ''officially'' when it started.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Pfahler: \"People really came down on us for going on tour with Nirvana. They really saw it as, 'Okay, here we go. This is the first step. The next thing that happens is that someone from the label sees them and they get snapped up.' Which is kind of what happened.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nFollowing the release of ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' in February 1994, Jawbreaker received contract offers from major record labels.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Though they had already decided to break up following the album's supporting tours due to tiredness and frustration, the band decided to consider the offers, partly due to the major label successes of their peers [[Green Day]] and [[Jawbox]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\">Greenwald, p. 25.</ref> They met with a number of labels over the course of the year, narrowing their options to [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[Capitol Records]], and DGC.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> They signed to DGC in a one million-dollar deal, due in part to the relationship they had developed with [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Mark Kates who they had met on the Nirvana tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Fans and key figures in the punk rock community were quick to denounce the band for the move.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> In an interview for [[Ben Weasel]]'s ''Panic Button'' zine following the Nirvana tour, Schwarzenbach had stated flatly that Jawbreaker was not interested in signing to a major record label. In response to the signing, Weasel took the band to task in a column for ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' accompanied by a photo depicting him eating his own hat, which he had promised to do if the band ever signed to a major.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u201396: ''Dear You'' and breakup ===\nJawbreaker began recording their major-label debut, ''[[Dear You]]'', in February 1995 at [[Fantasy Studios]] in [[Berkeley, California]] with [[Rob Cavallo]], who had [[record producer|produced]] Green Day's breakthrough album ''[[Dookie]]'' the previous year.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Recording sessions lasted two months and resulted in disenchantment and tension within the band, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> After a week of recording drums and bass guitar, Bauermeister and Pfahler were largely absent from the rest of the sessions while Schwarzenbach continued to work on the album with Cavallo.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I didn't even go\", recalled Bauermeister in 2010, \"I just hung out at home with my wife. I was already trying to separate myself from the band, while Blake became more of the major force.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> With a large recording budget at their disposal, Schwarzenbach and Cavallo spent much of their time polishing the record's production value, making the vocals and guitar clear and bringing them to the forefront of the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Cavallo, \"Blake really wanted to be heard. I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently. Then, to me, I thought those songs could benefit from some precision.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n[[File:Rob Cavallo.jpg|thumb|upright|Producer [[Rob Cavallo]] gave ''Dear You'' very polished production value in comparison to Jawbreaker's previous albums.]] \nIn the months leading up to the album's release, a number of music publications positioned Jawbreaker as the next stars of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] punk scene, sometimes referring to them as \"the thinking man's Green Day\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> When ''Dear You'' was released in September 1995, however, its polished production and clear vocals strongly divided the band's fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> \"[''Dear You'']'s production glistened and gleamed,\" says Greenwald, \"Schwarzenbach's voice was sanded and smoothed, and the songs were mellow, introspective affairs. The reaction was harsh\u2014those who had entrusted their emotional lives to Schwarzenbach, had viewed him as a tattered, secular priest to lay their burdens on, felt betrayed.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Ben Weasel was so displeased with the album, particularly the sound of Schwarzenbach's singing, that he wrote Pfahler a letter detailing his complaints with it.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Despite a [[music video]] in rotation to support the [[single (music)|single]] \"Fireman,\" sales of ''Dear You'' were poor.<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/>\n\nAs the band toured in support of the album, audience reaction toward the new material was either lukewarm or outright negative.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I have never seen anything like that\u2014before or since\", said Kates, \"There was a point where they were headlining the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] and there were kids sitting on the floor, with their backs to the stage, when they were playing songs from ''Dear You''. I'm not making that up. If you were to try to explain that to somebody now, it would make no sense.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Jawbreaker continued touring in 1996, opening for the [[Foo Fighters]] that spring, but audience reception did not improve.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Samiam's Sergie Loobkoff cites a show at [[The Warfield]] in San Francisco as a turning point: \"That is when I knew they were ''definitely'' going to break up. It was their hometown; they had put out the big major-label record. But then you're looking around and it was like no one cared.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nAttitudes between the band members continued to sour, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach, who took to traveling in separate vans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Tensions came to a head in [[Salem, Oregon]], culminating in a fistfight between the two which spilled out of the van and onto the sidewalk.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Jordan |title=Jawbreaker / Timmy Hansell (In Honor.org) |date=2008-08-30 |website=Pastepunk.com |url=http://www.pastepunk.com/site/jawbreaker-timmy-hansell-in-honororg/ |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> \"I remember just calling Blake a 'fucking [[prima donna]]' and a 'stupid son of a bitch who thinks it's all about him.'

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990's, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by J.

He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run.

The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey.

The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne stuggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n==== Character ====\n!\n=== Off-Off Broadway (2015) ===\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2016) ===\nThe Elektra Theater\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2017) ===\nNew World Stages\n!\n=== Entertainment Quarter (2019) ===\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990's, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by J. K. Rowling|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The PIT: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run. The production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltsby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne stuggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n==== Character ====\n!\n=== Off-Off Broadway (2015) ===\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2016) ===\nThe Elektra Theater\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2017) ===\nNew World Stages\n!\n=== Entertainment Quarter (2019) ===\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.
