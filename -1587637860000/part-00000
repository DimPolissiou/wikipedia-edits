Threatened with disinheritance if he does not report for work, he discovers that the company is not doing very well, and concludes that someone must expand their sales.\n\nHe reads in his newspaper about the wide use of guns in the [[American West]] of the 1880s, and decides to go there himself to sell [[firearms]] to the locals.\n\nHe ends up at the small lawless town of Fractured Jaw and inadvertently acquires a reputation for quickness on the draw, due to his wrist-mounted [[Derringer]] style weapon. He is innocently drawn into a range war between the \"Box T\" and \"Lazy S\" cattle outfits, both of whom claim sole water rights and, when he proves able to stand up to their hired gunmen, is appointed [[sheriff]].\n\nHe endeavours to clean up the town using what skills he has, and by multilateral diplomacy. He attracts the support of Miss Kate ([[Jayne Mansfield]]), a blonde [[bombshell (sex symbol)|bombshell]] hotel owner, who helps him to fight off the hired guns of both cattle ranches, who all want him dead.\n\nEarning the respect of the local Indian tribe, he becomes a blood brother of theirs, under the name of 'Fleet Iron Hat'. When he and Kate are besieged by the gunmen of both outfits, they come to his rescue and help to arrest the men. The two ranch owners eventually offer a deal to maintain the peace and share the water rights.\n\nWith relative peace restored, Jonathon decides to remain in Fractured Jaw, becomes an American citizen and marries Kate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kenneth More]] as Jonathan Tibbs\n* [[Jayne Mansfield]] as Kate\n* [[Henry Hull]] as Major Masters\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as Jack\n* [[Ronald Squire]] as Toynbee, Uncle Lucius' Solicitor\n* [[William Campbell (film actor)|William Campbell]] as Keeno\n* [[Sid James]] as The Drunk\n* [[Reed De Rouen]] as Clayborne\n* Charles Irwin as Luke\n* [[Donald Stewart (actor)|Donald Stewart]] as The Drummer\n* [[Clancy Cooper]] as The Barber\n* [[Gordon Tanner]] as Bud Wilkins\n* [[Robert Morley]] as Uncle Lucius\n* [[David Horne (actor)|David Horne]] as James, Uncle Lucius' Butler\n* [[Eynon Evans]] as Manager of Tibbs & Co.\n* Jonas Applegarth as Running Deer (as Chief Jonas Applegarth)\n* Joe Buffalo as Red Wolf (as Deputy Chief Joe Buffalo)\n* [[Larry Taylor (actor)|Larry Taylor]] as Gun Guard\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a short story by Jacob Hays published in the Canadian magazine ''[[Maclean's]]'' in June 1954.
