His first manager was [[Chris Kamara]], before playing under [[Paul Jewell]]. He found his time at [[Valley Parade]] a hard one, and found it difficult to break into the first team setup, and he eventually left the club in April 1999 after the club had secured promotion to the [[Premier League]] for the first time in their history.\n\n===Notts County===\nAfter struggling to break into the first team at Bradford, Bolland signed for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], initially on loan, and then permanently for \u00a375,000. Bolland was unexpectedly not given a contract extension by Notts County at the end of the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season, prompting him to join [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].\n\n===Grimsby Town===\nBolland became one of the first new signings for [[Russell Slade]] at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] for the 2005\u201306 season. He slotted into his familiar central midfield role, alongside fellow new signings [[Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala]] and [[Ciaran Toner]]. Bolland was part of the Town side that defeated [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] that same season, and The Mariners went on to finally lose out in the League Two Play Off Final. Paul kept his regular role in the 2006\u201307 season, briefly captaining the side on several occasions under short lived manager [[Graham Rodger]] and his replacement [[Alan Buckley]]. On 15 September 2007, he made his 100th appearance for Grimsby, and later on in the same season, he scored one of his most notable goals which came in the [[Football League Trophy]] semi-final first leg against [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] in a 1\u20130 win at [[Christie Park (Morecambe, England)|Christie Park]]. In the second leg at [[Blundell Park]], Grimsby defended for their lives as they earned a 0\u20130 draw. After the final whistle Bolland was mobbed by fans  as he had played a major part in enabling the Mariners to play at [[Wembley Stadium]] for the third time in their history. In the final, Grimsby Town played [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]], at [[Wembley Stadium]], where they lost 2\u20130. Bolland spent the entire 2008\u201309 season out injured, after picking up an injury in the latter stages of the previous season. Bolland was released by Grimsby in the summer of 2009, with new manager [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] admitting he wanted to give Bolland a chance to prove himself in pre-season, but Bolland decided to leave the club, settling up his contract with one month remaining.

After struggling to hold down a place in the first team, he joined [[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]] on loan.

His first manager was [[Chris Kamara]], before playing under [[Paul Jewell]]. He found his time at [[Valley Parade]] a hard one, and found it difficult to break into the first team setup, and he eventually left the club in April 1999 after the club had secured promotion to the [[Premier League]] for the first time in their history.\n\n===Notts County===\nAfter struggling to break into the first team at Bradford, Bolland signed for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], initially on loan, and then permanently for \u00a375,000. Bolland was unexpectedly not given a contract extension by Notts County at the end of the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season, prompting him to join [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].\n\n===Grimsby Town===\nBolland became one of the first new signings for [[Russell Slade]] at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] for the 2005\u201306 season. He slotted into his familiar central midfield role, alongside fellow new signings [[Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala]] and [[Ciaran Toner]]. Bolland was part of the Town side that defeated [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] that same season, and The Mariners went on to finally lose out in the League Two Play Off Final. Paul kept his regular role in the 2006\u201307 season, briefly captaining the side on several occasions under short lived manager [[Graham Rodger]] and his replacement [[Alan Buckley]]. On 15 September 2007, he made his 100th appearance for Grimsby, and later on in the same season, he scored one of his most notable goals which came in the [[Football League Trophy]] semi-final first leg against [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] in a 1\u20130 win at [[Christie Park (Morecambe, England)|Christie Park]]. In the second leg at [[Blundell Park]], Grimsby defended for their lives as they earned a 0\u20130 draw. After the final whistle Bolland was mobbed by fans  as he had played a major part in enabling the Mariners to play at [[Wembley Stadium]] for the third time in their history. In the final, Grimsby Town played [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]], at [[Wembley Stadium]], where they lost 2\u20130. Bolland spent the entire 2008\u201309 season out injured, after picking up an injury in the latter stages of the previous season. Bolland was released by Grimsby in the summer of 2009, with new manager [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] admitting he wanted to give Bolland a chance to prove himself in pre-season, but Bolland decided to leave the club, settling up his contract with one month remaining.

{"title_page": "Viton", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n[[File:Genuineviton.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Genuine Viton]]\n\n'''Viton''' is a brand of [[FKM]], a [[synthetic rubber]] and [[fluoropolymer]] [[elastomer]]  commonly used in [[Seal (mechanical)|Seals]], chemical-resistant gloves, and other [[Molding (process)|molded]] or [[Plastics extrusion|extruded]] goods. The name is a registered trademark of [[The Chemours Company]] previous Du Pont de Nemours and was introduced in 1957.\n\nViton fluoroelastomers are categorized under the [[ASTM]] D1418 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1629 designation of [[FKM]]. This class of [[elastomer]]s is a family comprising [[copolymer]]s of [[hexafluoropropylene]] (HFP) and [[vinylidene fluoride]] (VDF or VF2), [[copolymer|terpolymers]] of [[tetrafluoroethylene]] (TFE), vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP) as well as perfluoromethylvinylether (PMVE) containing specialties. The [[fluorine]] content of the most common Viton grades varies between 66 and 70%.\n\nWhile Viton can be sometimes distinguished from other types of rubber by its often green or brown colour, a more reliable test is its [[density]] of over {{val|1800|u=kg/m3}},<ref>Gasketing inc., [http://www.gasketing.net/viton.htm], January  2017</ref> significantly higher than most types of rubber<ref>Misumi inc.,  [https://us.misumi-ec.com/maker/misumi/mech/product/ur/detail/detail.html], December 2016</ref><ref>Jaredzone.info - densities of materials [http://www.jaredzone.info/2010/09/densities.html], January  2017</ref> ({{val|1010|-|1520|u=kg/m3}}).\n\n== Varieties ==\nThere are four families of viton polymers:\n# A (dipolymers of VF2/HFP): general-purpose sealing, automotive and aerospace fuels and lubricants. Nominal polymer [[fluorine]] content: 66%.\n# B (terpolymers of VF2/HFP/TFE): chemical process plant, power-utility seals and gaskets. Nominal polymer [[fluorine]] content: 68%.\n# F (terpolymers of VF2/HFP/TFE): oxygenated automotive fuels, concentrated aqueous inorganic acids, water, steam. Nominal polymer [[fluorine]] content: 70%.\n# Specialty types include GLT, GBLT, GFLT & Viton Extreme (copolymers of TFE/propylene and ethylene/TFE/PMVE): automotive, oil exploration, special sealing and ultra-harsh environments.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe performance of fluoroelastomers in aggressive chemicals depends on the nature of the base polymer and the compounding ingredients used for molding the final products (e.g. [[O-ring|o-rings]]). This performance can vary significantly when end-users purchase Viton polymer containing rubber goods from different sources. Viton is generally compatible with [[hydrocarbon]]s, but incompatible with [[ketone]]s such as [[acetone]] and [[methyl ethyl ketone]], [[ester]] solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]], [[amine]]s, and [[organic acid]]s such as [[acetic acid]].

The name is a registered trademark of [[The Chemours Company]] previous Du Pont de Nemours and was introduced in 1957.\n\nViton fluoroelastomers are categorized under the [[ASTM]] D1418 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1629 designation of [[FKM]]. This class of [[elastomer]]s is a family comprising [[copolymer]]s of [[hexafluoropropylene]] (HFP) and [[vinylidene fluoride]] (VDF or VF2), [[copolymer|terpolymers]] of [[tetrafluoroethylene]] (TFE), vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP) as well as perfluoromethylvinylether (PMVE) containing specialties. The [[fluorine]] content of the most common Viton grades varies between 66 and 70%.\n\nWhile Viton can be sometimes distinguished from other types of rubber by its often green or brown colour, a more reliable test is its [[density]] of over {{val|1800|u=kg/m3}},<ref>Gasketing inc., [http://www.gasketing.net/viton.htm], January  2017</ref> significantly higher than most types of rubber<ref>Misumi inc.,  [https://us.misumi-ec.com/maker/misumi/mech/product/ur/detail/detail.html], December 2016</ref><ref>Jaredzone.info - densities of materials [http://www.jaredzone.info/2010/09/densities.html], January  2017</ref> ({{val|1010|-|1520|u=kg/m3}}).\n\n== Varieties ==\nThere are four families of viton polymers:\n# A (dipolymers of VF2/HFP): general-purpose sealing, automotive and aerospace fuels and lubricants. Nominal polymer [[fluorine]] content: 66%.\n# B (terpolymers of VF2/HFP/TFE): chemical process plant, power-utility seals and gaskets. Nominal polymer [[fluorine]] content: 68%.\n# F (terpolymers of VF2/HFP/TFE): oxygenated automotive fuels, concentrated aqueous inorganic acids, water, steam. Nominal polymer [[fluorine]] content: 70%.\n# Specialty types include GLT, GBLT, GFLT & Viton Extreme (copolymers of TFE/propylene and ethylene/TFE/PMVE): automotive, oil exploration, special sealing and ultra-harsh environments.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe performance of fluoroelastomers in aggressive chemicals depends on the nature of the base polymer and the compounding ingredients used for molding the final products (e.g. [[O-ring|o-rings]]). This performance can vary significantly when end-users purchase Viton polymer containing rubber goods from different sources. Viton is generally compatible with [[hydrocarbon]]s, but incompatible with [[ketone]]s such as [[acetone]] and [[methyl ethyl ketone]], [[ester]] solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]], [[amine]]s, and [[organic acid]]s such as [[acetic acid]]. O-rings made of Viton are typically color-coded as black, but new gaskets, seals and O-rings should be green FKM or black FKM, but with a green mark on the outer edge.\n\nViton O-rings have been used safely for some time in [[SCUBA diving]] by divers using gas blends referred to as [[nitrox]].
