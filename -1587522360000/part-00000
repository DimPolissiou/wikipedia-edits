It is available in two basic variants, the four-axle '''Euro 3000''',{{efn-lr|As of 2012 the Euro 3000 DC motor version is unbuilt, except in the 1668mm gauge RENFE 334 equivalent - some of the figures quoted here may be considered speculative.}} and the six-axle '''Euro 4000'''. These locomotives are powered by [[EMD 710|EMD710]] Engines.\n\n==History and background==\nAt the beginning of the 2000s numerous private train operators emerged in mainland Europe, as open-access freight operation was already granted in some European countries before complete liberalization in 2012. These mainly used second-hand diesel locomotives formerly in use with the state railways of the respective country, or new medium-powered diesel locomotives like the [[EMD Class 66]] or [[Vossloh G2000 BB|Vossloh G2000]]. With the success of these operators rising and trains getting heavier, the need of a complete new high-powered diesel locomotive series was becoming high, especially for cross-border freight traffic where absence of, or changes in electrification voltage made electric traction impossible or problematic.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nPrimarily due to environmental issues and high costs, developments for such a new locomotive series were pushed back whenever possible. In the mid-2000s development of a new series finally seemed economically viable; becoming part of Alstom's [[Alstom Prima diesel locomotives|Prima]] locomotive programme. Development of the programme was started under Alstom supervision, but as the Alstom Valencia plant was bought by Vossloh this series got the Vossloh name: Vossloh Euro.<ref>[http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2009/7/4/62819/62696 Diesel heavy haul across Europe] ''eurotrib.com''</ref>\n\nThe family can be traced back to the [[Electro-Motive Diesel]] engined, Valencia built [[Israel Railways JT 42BW|JT 42BW]], [[Israel Railways JT 42CW|JT 42CW]] and [[British Rail Class 67|JT 42HW-HS]] family which were built in various configurations (including 4 and 6 axle variants) for both [[Israel Railways]] and [[DB Cargo UK|English, Welsh and Scottish Railway]] (as the [[British Rail Class 67|Class 67]]); these locomotives used the same GM-EMD engines and traction motors and had similar body shells to the products later built at the Valencia plant under Vossloh's ownership.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 2004 the Valencia plant left [[Alstom]] ownership and was bought by Vossloh; because of this change of ownership there are many similarities between the Vossloh Euro locomotives, the Alsthom/GM-EMD JT42 locomotives.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nAfter the change of ownership the next product to roll off the lines at Valencia was the [[RENFE Class 334]] locomotives which are (excluding minor differences) [[Iberian gauge]] versions of the later Vossloh Euro locomotives.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:Euro 4000 Israel Railways.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Euro 4000 introduced into [[Israel Railways]] service in November 2011]]\nThe common factor between this class of locomotives and its predecessors is the General Motors Electro-motive (now [[Electro-Motive Diesel]], since 2010 a subsidiary of [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]]) [[EMD 710]] engine and EMD D43 electric motors with associated electronic controls (except for the Euro 3000 AC introduced in 2011, which uses EMD AC electric motors). Thus EMD supplies the entire engine (see also [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]) and power transmission system for these locomotives including the [[Electrical generator|generator]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe rigid bodyshell show technical similarities with the predecessors ([[RENFE Class 334]] and [[British Rail Class 67|EWS class 67]]). The design is modular allowing easy access and change of internal components.<ref name=\"esp\">[http://www.vossloh-espana.com/cms/en/products/diesel-electric_locomotives/euro4000/euro4000.html Vossloh Espania Euro locomotives]</ref>\n\nVossloh suggests that the locomotives could be supplied with alternative engines subject to the customers demands.\n\nThe twin cabs have a central driving position with the controls arranged around the drivers seat, the cab is air-conditioned and temperature controlled and designed to minimise noise.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nCold weather variants are available - with additional devices to prevent snow causing problems.<ref name=\"color\">[http://www.railcolor.net/index.php?nav=1405862&lang=1 Vossloh Euro series: Railcolor.net]</ref>\n\nAs the locomotives are designed specifically with the European rail network in mind, they can be fitted a variety of different safety systems<ref>[http://www.vossloh-innotrans.com/cms/media/downloads/pdfs/VL__EURO4000_the_bestseller.pdf Vossloh Euro 4000 fact sheet]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and are prepared for the ETCS ([[European Train Control System]]).\n\nBoth versions are available in passenger and freight versions, and also in {{track gauge|1435mm}} or {{track gauge|1668mm}} gauge.\n\nWhile there have been several orders for the Euro 4000 model, there have only been two orders for the Euro 3000 model, in 2004 and 2011. The Euro 3000 AC units ordered by Israel Railways in 2011 differ considerably from the earlier Euro 3000 model. Their chassis will resemble that of Vossloh's new [[Vossloh Eurolight|Eurolight locomotive]], they will utilize a newer and more advanced variant of the EMD710 12-cylinder 3,300&nbsp;hp engine, will use newer computerized control systems and employ EMD/Siemens AC traction motors (rather than DC engines on the original Euro 3000 model) which will be mounted in a Bo'Bo' bogie of a different design than the earlier Euro 3000 model.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Career and orders==\nThe passenger version Euro 3000 locomotives are essentially the same as [[RENFE Class 334]] ordered prior to the change of ownership of the Valencia plant; they continued production under Vossloh ownership. (The RENFE 334's can be considered members of both the Alstom Prima and Vossloh Euro locomotive families). There have only been two orders for the Euro 3000 model, in 2004 and 2011, with these two Euro 3000 variants differing significantly technically (see 'Technology' section above).\n\nThe Euro 4000 demonstrator locomotive was built in 2006 and was exhibited at the InnoTrans 2006 fair. It was then tested on different German main lines before being sold to Angel Trains Cargo.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Afro 4000===\n[[File:Class Afro4000 4012.jpg|thumb|left|PRASA Class Afro 4000]]\nThe [[South African Class Afro 4000]] is a [[3 ft 6 in gauge railways|Cape gauge]] version of the Euro 4000.

locomotive]]s built by [[Stadler Rail]] for the European market. It is available in two basic variants, the four-axle '''Euro 3000''',{{efn-lr|As of 2012 the Euro 3000 DC motor version is unbuilt, except in the 1668mm gauge RENFE 334 equivalent - some of the figures quoted here may be considered speculative.}} and the six-axle '''Euro 4000'''. These locomotives are powered by [[EMD 710|EMD710]] Engines.\n\n==History and background==\nAt the beginning of the 2000s numerous private train operators emerged in mainland Europe, as open-access freight operation was already granted in some European countries before complete liberalization in 2012. These mainly used second-hand diesel locomotives formerly in use with the state railways of the respective country, or new medium-powered diesel locomotives like the [[EMD Class 66]] or [[Vossloh G2000 BB|Vossloh G2000]]. With the success of these operators rising and trains getting heavier, the need of a complete new high-powered diesel locomotive series was becoming high, especially for cross-border freight traffic where absence of, or changes in electrification voltage made electric traction impossible or problematic.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nPrimarily due to environmental issues and high costs, developments for such a new locomotive series were pushed back whenever possible. In the mid-2000s development of a new series finally seemed economically viable; becoming part of Alstom's [[Alstom Prima diesel locomotives|Prima]] locomotive programme. Development of the programme was started under Alstom supervision, but as the Alstom Valencia plant was bought by Vossloh this series got the Vossloh name: Vossloh Euro.<ref>[http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2009/7/4/62819/62696 Diesel heavy haul across Europe] ''eurotrib.com''</ref>\n\nThe family can be traced back to the [[Electro-Motive Diesel]] engined, Valencia built [[Israel Railways JT 42BW|JT 42BW]], [[Israel Railways JT 42CW|JT 42CW]] and [[British Rail Class 67|JT 42HW-HS]] family which were built in various configurations (including 4 and 6 axle variants) for both [[Israel Railways]] and [[DB Cargo UK|English, Welsh and Scottish Railway]] (as the [[British Rail Class 67|Class 67]]); these locomotives used the same GM-EMD engines and traction motors and had similar body shells to the products later built at the Valencia plant under Vossloh's ownership.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 2004 the Valencia plant left [[Alstom]] ownership and was bought by Vossloh; because of this change of ownership there are many similarities between the Vossloh Euro locomotives, the Alsthom/GM-EMD JT42 locomotives.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nAfter the change of ownership the next product to roll off the lines at Valencia was the [[RENFE Class 334]] locomotives which are (excluding minor differences) [[Iberian gauge]] versions of the later Vossloh Euro locomotives.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:Euro 4000 Israel Railways.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Euro 4000 introduced into [[Israel Railways]] service in November 2011]]\nThe common factor between this class of locomotives and its predecessors is the General Motors Electro-motive (now [[Electro-Motive Diesel]], since 2010 a subsidiary of [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]]) [[EMD 710]] engine and EMD D43 electric motors with associated electronic controls (except for the Euro 3000 AC introduced in 2011, which uses EMD AC electric motors). Thus EMD supplies the entire engine (see also [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]) and power transmission system for these locomotives including the [[Electrical generator|generator]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe rigid bodyshell show technical similarities with the predecessors ([[RENFE Class 334]] and [[British Rail Class 67|EWS class 67]]). The design is modular allowing easy access and change of internal components.<ref name=\"esp\">[http://www.vossloh-espana.com/cms/en/products/diesel-electric_locomotives/euro4000/euro4000.html Vossloh Espania Euro locomotives]</ref>\n\nVossloh suggests that the locomotives could be supplied with alternative engines subject to the customers demands.\n\nThe twin cabs have a central driving position with the controls arranged around the drivers seat, the cab is air-conditioned and temperature controlled and designed to minimise noise.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nCold weather variants are available - with additional devices to prevent snow causing problems.<ref name=\"color\">[http://www.railcolor.net/index.php?nav=1405862&lang=1 Vossloh Euro series: Railcolor.net]</ref>\n\nAs the locomotives are designed specifically with the European rail network in mind, they can be fitted a variety of different safety systems<ref>[http://www.vossloh-innotrans.com/cms/media/downloads/pdfs/VL__EURO4000_the_bestseller.pdf Vossloh Euro 4000 fact sheet]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and are prepared for the ETCS ([[European Train Control System]]).\n\nBoth versions are available in passenger and freight versions, and also in {{track gauge|1435mm}} or {{track gauge|1668mm}} gauge.\n\nWhile there have been several orders for the Euro 4000 model, there have only been two orders for the Euro 3000 model, in 2004 and 2011. The Euro 3000 AC units ordered by Israel Railways in 2011 differ considerably from the earlier Euro 3000 model. Their chassis will resemble that of Vossloh's new [[Vossloh Eurolight|Eurolight locomotive]], they will utilize a newer and more advanced variant of the EMD710 12-cylinder 3,300&nbsp;hp engine, will use newer computerized control systems and employ EMD/Siemens AC traction motors (rather than DC engines on the original Euro 3000 model) which will be mounted in a Bo'Bo' bogie of a different design than the earlier Euro 3000 model.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Career and orders==\nThe passenger version Euro 3000 locomotives are essentially the same as [[RENFE Class 334]] ordered prior to the change of ownership of the Valencia plant; they continued production under Vossloh ownership. (The RENFE 334's can be considered members of both the Alstom Prima and Vossloh Euro locomotive families). There have only been two orders for the Euro 3000 model, in 2004 and 2011, with these two Euro 3000 variants differing significantly technically (see 'Technology' section above).\n\nThe Euro 4000 demonstrator locomotive was built in 2006 and was exhibited at the InnoTrans 2006 fair. It was then tested on different German main lines before being sold to Angel Trains Cargo.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Afro 4000===\n[[File:Class Afro4000 4012.jpg|thumb|left|PRASA Class Afro 4000]]\nThe [[South African Class Afro 4000]] is a [[3 ft 6 in gauge railways|Cape gauge]] version of the Euro 4000.

The term selection is commonly used alongside subcategorization, but the two encode two different types of information.<ref name=\":022\">Grimshaw, J. (2003). Subcategorization and Selection. In International Encyclopedia of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2 Apr. 2020</ref> Selection is used to represent the semantic requirements placed on arguments and subcategorization is used to represent the syntactic requirements placed on complements. Violating the requirements of subcategorization and selection will produce an ill-formed sentence. The following examples are provided in order to distinguish subcategorization from selection accordingly. Example (1) shows the influence of subcategorization while (2), (3), and (4) exemplify that of selection. Keep in mind that an asterisk (*) is used to indicate ungrammaticality.  <blockquote>(1) \"They put the papers {under the desk/*to the desk/*the desk/*tidy}\" (from Grimshaw, 2003).  </blockquote>This example shows that out of the options given, only \"under the desk\" leads to the production of a well-formed sentence. \"They put the papers\" cannot stand alone even though there is an object, \"papers\", that the verb \"put\" is acting on.  <blockquote>(2) \"They tried to kill the {president/person/weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003) \n\n(3) \"They tried to murder the {president/person/*weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003) \n\n(4) \"They tried to assassinate the {president/*person/*weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003) </blockquote>Here we see that the object of the verb \"kill\" can be any living thing, that of \"murder\" must be human, and that of \"assassinate\" must be a famous human.\n\n==Lexical Entries==\nA lexical entry indicates crucial syntactic information about the heard of a phrase, such as what it selects and where it must be positioned. The term lexical entries come from the idea of the \"mental lexicon\", which specifies what speakers know about individual lexical items (Kroger, 2005). We can think of a lexical entry analogously to a dictionary entry. Each lexical item (LI) is associated with a lexical entry, minimally a triplet of features: Phonological, Formal, and Semantic, if not also other grammatical information such as irregular forms or patterns associated with that specific word (Kroger, 2005). Phonological features indicate pronunciation information and whether the LI is free or bound. Formal features indicate syntactic category labels, otherwise known as parts of speech. Finally, semantic features indicate meaning and theta roles. In accordance with X-Bar Theory and the Projection Principle, all of these features must be satisfied by each head in order to create a well formed sentence. For example, a partial lexical entry for the English noun ''dog'' has been illustrated below (Kroger, 2005). \n\n\n''dog'' /d\u00f4g/<br>\n\n'a domesticated carnivorous mammal, typically found with four legs\"<br>\n\n<sub>CAT</sub>: N<br>\n\n[+count]<br>\n\n<sub>PLURAL</sub>: ''dogs''\n\n\n\n===Argument Structure===\nArgument structure is the list of selected arguments associated with a lexical category, such as a verb (SKS, 2015). When every predicate, otherwise known as a verb, is used, it selects a specific set of arguments that need to be fulfilled to create a well-formed sentence (Kroger, 2005). These are arguments such as <small>AGENT</small>, <small>PATIENT</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>RECIPIENT</small>, and <small>STIMULUS</small>. To illustrate this, the sentence ''The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa'', has been broken down into its semantic roles and argument selections below. \n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Category (Head) !! Selection Restriction: Argument Selection\n|-\n| ''ask'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>}\n|-\n| ''pee'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<sub>THEME</sub>}\n|-\n| ''adults'' || N || \n|-\n| ''cats'' || N || \n|-\n| ''sofa'' || N || {(PP<sub>THEME</sub>)}\n|}\n\n\nIt is necessary to understand the fundamentals of argument structure to understand the idea of subcategorization because subcategorization, as noted above, refers to the sub-categories a verb (or other semantic role) requires (Kroger, 2005). For example, the verb ''ask'' from above subcategorizes for a DP<small>AGENT</small> and CP<small>THEME</small>, otherwise known as a subject and direct object, respectively. In this way, subcategorization is an important piece of information to include in any lexical entry.\n\n===Thematic Roles and S-Selection===\n''Theta roles'' identify the meaning relation between the constituent and the selected predicate (SKS, 2015). There are eight theta roles: <small>AGENT</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>CAUSE</small>, <small>POSSESSOR</small>, <small>LOCATION</small>,<small>GOAL</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, and <small>BENEFICIARY</small>. Each term indicates the relationship between the verb, predicate, and one of its arguments. This is what is called ''s-selection'', a shortening of semantic selection. S-Selection is an important addition to any lexical entry in order to make them easier to interpret (SKS, 2015). It is important to understand that, according to the ''Theta Criterion'', every argument bears one and only one theta role (Chomsky, 1965). Below is an example for each theta role (SKS, 2015):\n\n<small>CAUSE</small>: a cause; ''The dog bit the child. This made him cry''\n\n\n<small>AGENT</small>: a person on entity which intentionally is causing or doing something; ''Joshua intentionally hit him''\n\n\n<small>EXPERIENCER</small>: a sentient being inside of, or acquiring, a psychological state; ''Sam hates cats/Josh noticed Alice''\n\n\n<small>LOCATION</small>: a location; ''Marianne leaped through the field''\n\n\n<small>GOAL</small>: a location/being that is the endpoint; ''Moses gave Josh a toothbrush''\n\n\n<small>BENEFICIARY</small>: a beneficiary; ''Susie made cookies for Sarah''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSOR</small>: a possessor; ''Shelly owns cats''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small>: what is possessed; ''Shelly's cats''\n*<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small> is a subset of <small>POSSESSOR</small> which is why it has been included but not given its own role\n\n\n<small>THEME</small>: something that undergoes a change, such as location change, or any kind of progression;''Josie sent Riven cookies/''\n*<small>THEME</small> is also commonly used for things that do not fit any other theta role, such as ''Josie is short'' or ''Sarah said that it is foggy''\n\n===Projection Principle===\nThe Projection Principle states that properties of lexical items must be satisfied in order to create well-formed sentences (SKS, 2015). \n===Locality of Selection===\nLocality of Selection states that if \u03b1 selects \u03b2, then \u03b2 appears as a complement, subject, or adjunct of \u03b1 (SKS, 2015). \n\n\n==Subcategorization Frames==\nIn a notation developed by Chomsky in the 1960s, the basic position of verbs in a phrase structure tree would be shown by assigning it to a subcategorization frame.<ref name=\":1\">Matthews, P. (2014). subcategorization. In The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press.</ref> A transitive verb like \u201cmake\u201d, for example, was assigned the feature [+--NP] meaning that \u201cmake\u201d can (+) appear before (--) a noun phrase (NP).<ref name=\":1\" /> Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\n::work [NP __ ]\n::eat [NP __ (NP)]\n::wait [NP __ (''for'' NP)]\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].\n\n==Occurrences==\nSubcategorization can be observed in any language, including but not limited to:\nFrench\nGerman\nMandarin \n\n==Valency==\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,<ref>See Chomsky (1965).</ref> whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject. As it was originally conceived of, subcategorization did not include the subject, that is, a verb subcategorized for its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]](s) (=object and oblique arguments) but not for its subject.<ref>For examples of theories that exclude the subject from subcategorization frames, see Burton-Roberts (1886:73ff.), Horrocks (1986:34f.), Haegeman (1994:40-42, 45 note 10), Bennet (1995:43ff.), Green and Morgan (1996:68 note 6), Fromkin et al. (2000:230).</ref> Many modern theories now include the subject in the subcategorization frame, however.<ref>For examples of theories that include the subject in the subcategorization frame, see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982:210-212), Cattell (198428ff.), Pollard and Sag (1994:23), Culicover (1997:17), Carnie (2007:50ff.).</ref> Valency, in contrast, included the subject from the start.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:109, chapter 51, paragraph 13) emphasized that from a syntactic point of view, the subject is a complement just like the object.</ref> In this regard, subcategorization is moving in the direction of valency, since many phrase structure grammars now see verbs subcategorizing for their subject as well as for their object(s).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Argument (linguistics)|Argument]]\n*[[Complement (linguistics)|Complement]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Lexical item]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)|Transitivity]]\n*[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n* Bennet, P. 1995.

Selection Restriction: Argument Selection\n|-\n| ''ask'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>}\n|-\n| ''pee'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<sub>THEME</sub>}\n|-\n| ''adults'' || N || \n|-\n| ''cats'' || N || \n|-\n| ''sofa'' || N || {(PP<sub>THEME</sub>)}\n|}\n\n\nIt is necessary to understand the fundamentals of argument structure to understand the idea of subcategorization because subcategorization, as noted above, refers to the sub-categories a verb (or other semantic role) requires (Kroger, 2005). For example, the verb ''ask'' from above subcategorizes for a DP<small>AGENT</small> and CP<small>THEME</small>, otherwise known as a subject and direct object, respectively. In this way, subcategorization is an important piece of information to include in any lexical entry.\n\n===Thematic Roles and S-Selection===\n''Theta roles'' identify the meaning relation between the constituent and the selected predicate (SKS, 2015). There are eight theta roles: <small>AGENT</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>CAUSE</small>, <small>POSSESSOR</small>, <small>LOCATION</small>,<small>GOAL</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, and <small>BENEFICIARY</small>. Each term indicates the relationship between the verb, predicate, and one of its arguments. This is what is called ''s-selection'', a shortening of semantic selection. S-Selection is an important addition to any lexical entry in order to make them easier to interpret (SKS, 2015). It is important to understand that, according to the ''Theta Criterion'', every argument bears one and only one theta role (Chomsky, 1965). Below is an example for each theta role (SKS, 2015):\n\n<small>CAUSE</small>: a cause; ''The dog bit the child. This made him cry''\n\n\n<small>AGENT</small>: a person on entity which intentionally is causing or doing something; ''Joshua intentionally hit him''\n\n\n<small>EXPERIENCER</small>: a sentient being inside of, or acquiring, a psychological state; ''Sam hates cats/Josh noticed Alice''\n\n\n<small>LOCATION</small>: a location; ''Marianne leaped through the field''\n\n\n<small>GOAL</small>: a location/being that is the endpoint; ''Moses gave Josh a toothbrush''\n\n\n<small>BENEFICIARY</small>: a beneficiary; ''Susie made cookies for Sarah''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSOR</small>: a possessor; ''Shelly owns cats''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small>: what is possessed; ''Shelly's cats''\n*<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small> is a subset of <small>POSSESSOR</small> which is why it has been included but not given its own role\n\n\n<small>THEME</small>: something that undergoes a change, such as location change, or any kind of progression;''Josie sent Riven cookies/''\n*<small>THEME</small> is also commonly used for things that do not fit any other theta role, such as ''Josie is short'' or ''Sarah said that it is foggy''\n\n===Projection Principle===\nThe Projection Principle states that properties of lexical items must be satisfied in order to create well-formed sentences (SKS, 2015). \n===Locality of Selection===\nLocality of Selection states that if \u03b1 selects \u03b2, then \u03b2 appears as a complement, subject, or adjunct of \u03b1 (SKS, 2015). \n\n\n==Subcategorization Frames==\nIn a notation developed by Chomsky in the 1960s, the basic position of verbs in a phrase structure tree would be shown by assigning it to a subcategorization frame.<ref name=\":1\">Matthews, P. (2014). subcategorization. In The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press.</ref> A transitive verb like \u201cmake\u201d, for example, was assigned the feature [+--NP] meaning that \u201cmake\u201d can (+) appear before (--) a noun phrase (NP).<ref name=\":1\" /> Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\n::work [NP __ ]\n::eat [NP __ (NP)]\n::wait [NP __ (''for'' NP)]\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].\n==Non-Verbs==\nSubcategorization is mostly applied to verbs, as explained above. However, verbs are not the only semantic role which can be subcategorized. \n==Occurrences==\nSubcategorization can be observed in any language, including but not limited to:\nFrench\nGerman\nMandarin \n\n==Valency==\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,<ref>See Chomsky (1965).</ref> whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject. As it was originally conceived of, subcategorization did not include the subject, that is, a verb subcategorized for its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]](s) (=object and oblique arguments) but not for its subject.<ref>For examples of theories that exclude the subject from subcategorization frames, see Burton-Roberts (1886:73ff.), Horrocks (1986:34f.), Haegeman (1994:40-42, 45 note 10), Bennet (1995:43ff.), Green and Morgan (1996:68 note 6), Fromkin et al. (2000:230).</ref> Many modern theories now include the subject in the subcategorization frame, however.<ref>For examples of theories that include the subject in the subcategorization frame, see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982:210-212), Cattell (198428ff.), Pollard and Sag (1994:23), Culicover (1997:17), Carnie (2007:50ff.).</ref> Valency, in contrast, included the subject from the start.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:109, chapter 51, paragraph 13) emphasized that from a syntactic point of view, the subject is a complement just like the object.</ref> In this regard, subcategorization is moving in the direction of valency, since many phrase structure grammars now see verbs subcategorizing for their subject as well as for their object(s).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Argument (linguistics)|Argument]]\n*[[Complement (linguistics)|Complement]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Lexical item]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)|Transitivity]]\n*[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n* Bennet, P. 1995.

Snyder continued acquiring more land eventually increasing his holdings to almost 1,000 acres of land which included seven lakes, the largest of which was Darien Lake. He stocked one of the smaller lakes, Trout Pond, with fish, increased the number of campsites and added activities for resort guests such as a small petting zoo, horseback and pony rides, paddleboats, skateboarding, tennis courts and miniature golf.<ref>{{cite book |last=Futtrell |first=Jim |date=2006 |title=Amusement Parks of New York |location=Mechanicsburg, Pa. |publisher=Stackpole Books |pages= 188\u2013189|isbn=978-0-8117-3262-8}}</ref>\n\nFrom the late 70s and into the early 80s, Snyder added more attractions, including a set of water slides on a hill near the park's entrance called Rainbow Mountain, creating an amusement park he named Darien Lake Fun Country. Snyder made a deal with [[HUSS Park Attractions]], turning Darien Lake into the North American showcase for the German manufacturer's new rides. Through this deal, the park acquired rides such as the Pirate, [[Ranger (ride)|Ranger]], Thrillbilly and the Corn Popper, for use in the park and to give HUSS a location to display them to potential US and Canadian buyers. In 1982, the newly merged [[Arrow Dynamics|Arrow]] [[HUSS Park Attractions|Huss]] built and opened the park's first major [[roller coaster]], [[Viper (Darien Lake)|Viper]].<ref>{{cite RCDB|coaster_name=Viper|location=Darien Lake|rcdb_number=224|accessdate=December 7, 2016|url=https://rcdb.com/224.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Funtime Parks===\nIn 1983, Snyder sold a fifty-percent stake in the park to [[Funtime Inc.]], which also owned [[Geauga Lake (amusement park)|Geauga Lake]] and [[Zoombezi Bay|Wyandot Lake Park]].<ref name=\"lococo\">{{cite Web|url=http://amusementtoday.com/2015/10/funtime-inc-co-founder-gasper-lococo-has-died|title=Funtime Inc. co-founder Gasper Lococo has died|publisher=Amusement Today|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}</ref> The Fun Country was dropped from the name, and Funtime brought in some major improvements.\n\nFuntime's first purchase was the [[Vekoma]]-built Giant Wheel [[Ferris wheel]], the showcase of the [[1982 World's Fair]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and the largest in the United States at the time, which was permanently installed in the park's center.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rawls Jr.|first=Wendell|title=Knoxville Unveils Its World Fair|journal=New York Times|date=April 25, 1982|publisher=The New York Times Co.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/travel/knoxville-unveils-its-world-s-fair.html?pagewanted=all|location=New York, N.Y.|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> Although no longer the largest in the country, the Giant Wheel is still in operation today.\n\nEntertainment was also added to the park, with the construction of the [[Tops Markets LLC|Tops]] Jubilee Theater (now the Grande Theatre), the Lakeside Amphitheater, a large-scale concert stage on the south side of the main lake, presenting big-name acts including [[The Who]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Black Sabbath]], and Cinema 2000, a wide-angle movie theatre in the back of the park. In the mid-to late 1980s, there was Splashmania, a [[water skiing]] show located on Fun Lake. \nThe improvements continued throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, with the addition of a themed kids area, Adventure Land for Kids in 1988 and in 1989 Grizzly Run replaced a kids ride area that was located where a skatepark was. In 1990, six new slides were added to the back of the water slide complex and the area became known as Barracuda Bay and an extra charge was added to the waterpark as well a new locker area, food complex, shopping area and changing rooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkbrochures.net/1990/dlake1990_2.html |title=Darien Lake \u2013 1990 |publisher=Themeparkbrochures.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref> Following the success of a new wooden rollercoaster at Geauga Lake in 1988, Funtime contracted [[Curtis D.

In 1995, [[Skycoaster]] opened located over Fun Lake. In 1996, Adventure Land was replaced by Popeye's Seaport with all new kiddie rides like a [[Ferris wheel]] made to look like barrels, a hand-cranked train ride, a submarine ride, a ship themed play place (removed in 2004), and a food stand and restrooms in the then new kiddie area in an area that was occupied by miniature golf course. A new miniature golf course opened behind the then-new kiddie area near [[Viper (Darien Lake)|Viper]] which replaced the old golf course. Also a waterpark expansion with new attractions took place in 1996 and 1997 with Hook's Lagoon (opened in 1996) the Crocodile Isle wave pool (opened in 1997) took over Adventure Land's old location by Elk Lake with new changing rooms and a food stand were built, and a bridge was built to connect the Barracuda Bay slides with the then new water park area and a boat tag game was added to the midway. Three of the old Adventure Land rides were moved to another part of the park as the Tiny Trio in 1997.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1999, Premier would also install a new roller coaster each year, Nightmare at Phantom Cave in 1996, Mind Eraser in 1997, [[Boomerang: Coast to Coaster]] in 1998 and [[Superman Ride of Steel]] (the world's first [[Intamin]] [[hypercoaster]]) in 1999. Nightmare was removed in 1998 and relocated to sister park [[The Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom|The Great Escape]].\nIn 1998, Premier purchased [[Six Flags|Six Flags Theme Parks]] and began to rebrand its own parks as Six Flags. In May 1999, Six Flags Darien Lake opened under its new name, with a few major changes. Premier brought Six Flags' own character base, [[Looney Tunes]] and [[DC Comics]], into the parks, renaming Popeye's Seaport to Looney Tunes Seaport, added a show in the vacant former Nightmare at Phantom Cave building called the Batman Thrill Spectacular, and Hydro Force, Pipeline Plunge, Riptide Run, and Torpedo Rapids were removed from Barracuda Bay and Scrambler replaced Cinema 2000. The midway stage was added to replace the boat tag game and The Emporium gift shop opened in Lasso's old location, Crazy Quilt was removed and replaced with Lasso.\n\nPremier Parks formed in 2000, assuming the name \"Six Flags Inc.\", and adding new attractions. The next major attractions installed the Twister in 2000 and Shipwreck Falls in 2002, replacing the old Cascade Canyon water slides on the east side of Barracuda Bay as well as Slingshot behind the 'Cuda Falls water slides; and the Tornado in 2005.\n\n====Troubled times====\n2006 was a year of turmoil for Six Flags and its parks. For the 2006 season, Six Flags moved the Big Kahuna, a family-sized waterslide, from [[Six Flags AstroWorld]] to Darien Lake and also moved the [[Batman The Escape]] roller coaster from Astroworld into storage at Darien Lake, with possible plans to build it. They also added an opportunity to meet with the entire [[Justice League]] at the park.\n\nOnly a month into Darien Lake's season, however, Six Flags began pulling back the Justice League from Darien Lake and announced Darien Lake, along with eight other parks, was being considered for sale. Many parks throughout the chain, not just those for sale, also experienced numerous changes and cutbacks throughout the summer.\n\nIn October 2006, after shortened operating hours and seasons, Six Flags officially announced the parks were being offered for sale as a package. Paul Snyder stated in a radio interview he would have considered purchasing Darien Lake from Six Flags if they allowed the parks to be sold individually.\n\nIn January 2007, Six Flags announced a potential sale of seven of the parks to a new company, PARC 7F (officially called [[PARC Management]]).<ref name=\"PWO-SF7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/232/Six_Flags_sells_seven_parks.html |title=Six Flags sells seven parks |publisher=Park World Online |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2008-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213091315/http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/232/Six_Flags_sells_seven_parks.html |archivedate=2007-12-13 }}</ref> Six Flags chose to retain two parks it had originally considered for sale.<ref name=\"PWO-RD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/385/Randy_Drew.html |title=Randy Drew |publisher=Park World Online |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2008-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130021413/http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/385/Randy_Drew.html |archivedate=2008-01-30 }}</ref>\n\n===PARC Management (2007\u20132010)===\n[[Image:DarienLakesNewLogo.jpg|thumb|right|Former Darien Lake logo used from 2007\u20132012]]In April 2007, [[Six Flags]] completed the sale of Darien Lake and six other parks to [[PARC Management]]. Upon completion of the sale, PARC entered into a fifty-year contract with [[CNL Income Properties]], under which CNL purchased the properties from and lease them back to PARC for operation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBecause of the timing of the final sale with respect to the park's opening, PARC was unable to make many major changes for the 2007 season. The biggest changes for the season were the addition of an all new show, Le Grande Cirque, which replaced the Batman Thrill Spectacular, and the removal of all Six Flags-, [[Looney Tunes]]-, and [[DC Comics]]-themed signage and references.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe park debuted the [[Orange County Choppers MotoCoaster]], its first launched rollercoaster, in 2008. A [[Zamperla]] [[Motocoaster]] coaster, it was the prototype that had been running outside Zamperla's factory in Italy.

Snyder continued acquiring more land eventually increasing his holdings to almost 1,000 acres of land which included seven lakes, the largest of which was Darien Lake. He stocked one of the smaller lakes, Trout Pond, with fish, increased the number of campsites and added activities for resort guests such as a small petting zoo, horseback and pony rides, paddleboats, skateboarding, tennis courts and miniature golf.<ref>{{cite book |last=Futtrell |first=Jim |date=2006 |title=Amusement Parks of New York |location=Mechanicsburg, Pa. |publisher=Stackpole Books |pages= 188\u2013189|isbn=978-0-8117-3262-8}}</ref>\n\nFrom the late 70s and into the early 80s, Snyder added more attractions, including a set of water slides on a hill near the park's entrance called Rainbow Mountain, creating an amusement park he named Darien Lake Fun Country. Snyder made a deal with [[HUSS Park Attractions]], turning Darien Lake into the North American showcase for the German manufacturer's new rides. Through this deal, the park acquired rides such as the Pirate, [[Ranger (ride)|Ranger]], Thrillbilly and the Corn Popper, for use in the park and to give HUSS a location to display them to potential US and Canadian buyers. In 1982, the newly merged [[Arrow Dynamics|Arrow]] [[HUSS Park Attractions|Huss]] built and opened the park's first major [[roller coaster]], [[Viper (Darien Lake)|Viper]].<ref>{{cite RCDB|coaster_name=Viper|location=Darien Lake|rcdb_number=224|accessdate=December 7, 2016|url=https://rcdb.com/224.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Funtime Parks===\nIn 1983, Snyder sold a fifty-percent stake in the park to [[Funtime Inc.]], which also owned [[Geauga Lake (amusement park)|Geauga Lake]] and [[Zoombezi Bay|Wyandot Lake Park]].<ref name=\"lococo\">{{cite Web|url=http://amusementtoday.com/2015/10/funtime-inc-co-founder-gasper-lococo-has-died|title=Funtime Inc. co-founder Gasper Lococo has died|publisher=Amusement Today|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}</ref> The Fun Country was dropped from the name, and Funtime brought in some major improvements.\n\nFuntime's first purchase was the [[Vekoma]]-built Giant Wheel [[Ferris wheel]], the showcase of the [[1982 World's Fair]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and the largest in the United States at the time, which was permanently installed in the park's center.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rawls Jr.|first=Wendell|title=Knoxville Unveils Its World Fair|journal=New York Times|date=April 25, 1982|publisher=The New York Times Co.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/travel/knoxville-unveils-its-world-s-fair.html?pagewanted=all|location=New York, N.Y.|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> Although no longer the largest in the country, the Giant Wheel is still in operation today.\n\nEntertainment was also added to the park, with the construction of the [[Tops Markets LLC|Tops]] Jubilee Theater (now the Grande Theatre), the Lakeside Amphitheater, a large-scale concert stage on the south side of the main lake, presenting big-name acts including [[The Who]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Black Sabbath]], and Cinema 2000, a wide-angle movie theatre in the back of the park. In the mid-to late 1980s, there was Splashmania, a [[water skiing]] show located on Fun Lake. \nThe improvements continued throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, with the addition of a themed kids area, Adventure Land for Kids in 1988 and in 1989 Grizzly Run replaced a kids ride area that was located where a skatepark was. In 1990, six new slides were added to the back of the water slide complex and the area became known as Barracuda Bay and an extra charge was added to the waterpark as well a new locker area, food complex, shopping area and changing rooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkbrochures.net/1990/dlake1990_2.html |title=Darien Lake \u2013 1990 |publisher=Themeparkbrochures.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref> Following the success of a new wooden rollercoaster at Geauga Lake in 1988, Funtime contracted [[Curtis D.

In 1995, [[Skycoaster]] opened located over Fun Lake. In 1996, Adventure Land was replaced by Popeye's Seaport with all new kiddie rides like a [[Ferris wheel]] made to look like barrels, a hand-cranked train ride, a submarine ride, a ship themed play place (removed in 2004), and a food stand and restrooms in the then new kiddie area in an area that was occupied by miniature golf course. A new miniature golf course opened behind the then-new kiddie area near [[Viper (Darien Lake)|Viper]] which replaced the old golf course. Also a waterpark expansion with new attractions took place in 1996 and 1997 with Hook's Lagoon (opened in 1996) the Crocodile Isle wave pool (opened in 1997) took over Adventure Land's old location by Elk Lake with new changing rooms and a food stand were built, and a bridge was built to connect the Barracuda Bay slides with the then new water park area and a boat tag game was added to the midway. Three of the old Adventure Land rides were moved to another part of the park as the Tiny Trio in 1997.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1999, Premier would also install a new roller coaster each year, Nightmare at Phantom Cave in 1996, Mind Eraser in 1997, [[Boomerang: Coast to Coaster]] in 1998 and [[Superman Ride of Steel]] (the world's first [[Intamin]] [[hypercoaster]]) in 1999. Nightmare was removed in 1998 and relocated to sister park [[The Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom|The Great Escape]].\nIn 1998, Premier purchased [[Six Flags|Six Flags Theme Parks]] and began to rebrand its own parks as Six Flags. In May 1999, Six Flags Darien Lake opened under its new name, with a few major changes. Premier brought Six Flags' own character base, [[Looney Tunes]] and [[DC Comics]], into the parks, renaming Popeye's Seaport to Looney Tunes Seaport, added a show in the vacant former Nightmare at Phantom Cave building called the Batman Thrill Spectacular, and Hydro Force, Pipeline Plunge, Riptide Run, and Torpedo Rapids were removed from Barracuda Bay and Scrambler replaced Cinema 2000. The midway stage was added to replace the boat tag game and The Emporium gift shop opened in Lasso's old location, Crazy Quilt was removed and replaced with Lasso.\n\nPremier Parks formed in 2000, assuming the name \"Six Flags Inc.\", and adding new attractions. The next major attractions installed the Twister in 2000 and Shipwreck Falls in 2002, replacing the old Cascade Canyon water slides on the east side of Barracuda Bay as well as Slingshot behind the 'Cuda Falls water slides; and the Tornado in 2005.\n\n====Troubled times====\n2006 was a year of turmoil for Six Flags and its parks. For the 2006 season, Six Flags moved the Big Kahuna, a family-sized waterslide, from [[Six Flags AstroWorld]] to Darien Lake and also moved the [[Batman The Escape]] roller coaster from Astroworld into storage at Darien Lake, with possible plans to build it. They also added an opportunity to meet with the entire [[Justice League]] at the park.\n\nOnly a month into Darien Lake's season, however, Six Flags began pulling back the Justice League from Darien Lake and announced Darien Lake, along with eight other parks, was being considered for sale. Many parks throughout the chain, not just those for sale, also experienced numerous changes and cutbacks throughout the summer.\n\nIn October 2006, after shortened operating hours and seasons, Six Flags officially announced the parks were being offered for sale as a package. Paul Snyder stated in a radio interview he would have considered purchasing Darien Lake from Six Flags if they allowed the parks to be sold individually.\n\nIn January 2007, Six Flags announced a potential sale of seven of the parks to a new company, PARC 7F (officially called [[PARC Management]]).<ref name=\"PWO-SF7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/232/Six_Flags_sells_seven_parks.html |title=Six Flags sells seven parks |publisher=Park World Online |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2008-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213091315/http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/232/Six_Flags_sells_seven_parks.html |archivedate=2007-12-13 }}</ref> Six Flags chose to retain two parks it had originally considered for sale.<ref name=\"PWO-RD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/385/Randy_Drew.html |title=Randy Drew |publisher=Park World Online |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2008-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130021413/http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/385/Randy_Drew.html |archivedate=2008-01-30 }}</ref>\n\n===PARC Management (2007\u20132010)===\n[[Image:DarienLakesNewLogo.jpg|thumb|right|Former Darien Lake logo used from 2007\u20132012]]In April 2007, [[Six Flags]] completed the sale of Darien Lake and six other parks to [[PARC Management]].

[[Cloture]] had not yet been adopted as a rule in the Senate, so there was no way to prevent a minuscule minority from holding up business by refusing to surrender the [[floor (legislative)|floor]]. First [[James Walter Wall]] of New Jersey spoke until midnight, when [[Willard Saulsbury, Sr.]], of Delaware gave Republicans an opportunity to surrender by [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|moving]] to [[adjournment|adjourn]]. That motion was defeated 5\u201331, after which [[Lazarus W. Powell]] of Kentucky began to speak, yielding for a motion to adjourn from [[William Alexander Richardson]] of Illinois forty minutes later, which was also defeated, 5\u201330. Powell continued to speak, entertaining some hostile questions from [[Edgar Cowan]] of Pennsylvania which provoked further discussion, but retaining control of the floor. At seven minutes past two in the morning, [[James A. Bayard, Jr.]], of Delaware motioned to adjourn, the motion again failing, 4\u201335, and Powell retained control of the floor. Powell yielded the floor to Bayard, who then began to speak. At some point later, Powell made a motion to adjourn, but Bayard apparently had not yielded to him for that motion. When this was pointed out, Powell told Bayard to sit down so he could make the motion, assuming that Bayard would retain control of the floor if the motion failed, as it did, 4\u201333. The presiding officer, [[Samuel C. Pomeroy]] of Kansas, immediately [[previous question|called the question]] of concurring in the report of the conference committee and [[voice vote|declared]] that the ayes had it, and Trumbull immediately moved that the Senate move on to other business, which motion was agreed to. The Democrats objected that Bayard still had the floor, that he had merely yielded it for a motion to adjourn, but Pomeroy said he had no record of why Bayard had yielded the floor, meaning the floor was open once Powell's motion to adjourn had failed, meaning that the presiding officer was free to call the question. In this way, the bill cleared the Senate.<ref name=\"CongGlobeSen\" />\n\nThe next day, Senate Democrats protested the manner in which the bill had passed. During the ensuring discussion, the [[president pro tempore]] asked permission \"to sign a large number of enrolled bills\", among which was the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act. The House had already been informed that the Senate had passed the bill, and the engrossed bills were sent to the president, who immediately signed the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act into law.<ref>''Congressional Globe'', Thirty-Seventh Congress, Third Session (1862\u201363), pp.1489\u20131494, 1532.</ref>\n\n==Provisions==\n[[File:US Statutes at Large 12-755.png|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statutes at Large, Volume 12, Page 755, containing the opening text of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act|alt=Scan of page in the Statutes at Large]]The Act allowed the president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus so long as the Civil War was ongoing.<ref name=Section1>Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, {{USStat|12|755}}, sec. 1.</ref> Normally, a judge would issue a writ of habeas corpus to compel a jailer to state the reason for holding a particular prisoner and, if the judge was not satisfied that the prisoner was being held lawfully, could release him.

Milligan was arrested in Indiana on October 5, 1864, for conspiring with four others to steal weapons and invade Union [[prisoner-of-war]] camps to release [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] prisoners. They were tried before a [[military tribunal]], found guilty, and sentenced to hang. In ''[[ex parte Milligan]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act did not authorize military tribunals, that as a matter of [[constitutional law]] the suspension of habeas corpus did not itself authorize trial by military tribunals, and that neither the Act nor the [[laws of war]] permitted the imposition of [[martial law]] where civilian courts were open and operating unimpeded.<ref>''Ex parte Milligan'', {{ussc|71|2|1866|Wall.|4}}.</ref>\n\nThe Court had earlier avoided the questions arising in ''ex parte Milligan'' regarding the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act in a case concerning former Congressman and Ohio [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] politician [[Clement Vallandigham]]. General [[Ambrose E. Burnside]] had him arrested in May 1863 claiming his anti-Lincoln and anti-war speeches continued to give aid to the enemy after his having been warned to cease doing so. Vallandigham was tried by a military tribunal and sentenced to two years in a military prison. Lincoln quickly [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] his sentence to banishment to the Confederacy. Vallandigham appealed his sentence, arguing that the [[Enrollment Act]] did not authorize his trial by a military tribunal rather than in ordinary civilian courts, that he was not ordinarily subject to court martial, and that General Burnside could not expand the jurisdiction of military courts on his own authority. The Supreme Court did not address the substance of Vallandigham's appeal, instead denying that it possessed the jurisdiction to review the proceedings of military tribunals upon a writ of habeas corpus without explicit congressional authorization.<ref>''Ex parte Vallandigham'', {{ussc|68|243|1864|Wall.|1}}.</ref> Vallandigham was subsequently deported to the South where he turned himself in for arrest as a Union citizen behind enemy lines and was placed in a Confederate prison.<ref>The Civil War Day by Day by E.B.

She was sentenced to death but her lawyers Clampitt and Aiken had not finished trying to save their client. On the morning of July 7, they asked a District of Columbia court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the military tribunal had no jurisdiction over their client. The court issued the writ at 3 A.M., and it was served on General Winfield Scott Hancock. Hancock was ordered to produce Surratt by 10 A.M. General Hancock sent an aide to General John F. Hartranft, who commanded the Old Capitol Prison, ordering him not to admit any United States marshal (as this would prevent the marshal from serving a similar writ on Hartranft). President Johnson was informed that the court had issued the writ, and promptly cancelled it at 11:30 A.M. under the authority granted to him by the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863. General Hancock and United States Attorney General James Speed personally appeared in court and informed the judge of the cancellation of the writ. Mary Surratt was hanged, becoming the first woman executed by the United States federal government.\n\nBecause all of the provisions of the Act referred to the Civil War, they were rendered inoperative with the conclusion of the war and no longer remain in effect.

Powell continued to speak, entertaining some hostile questions from [[Edgar Cowan]] of Pennsylvania which provoked further discussion, but retaining control of the floor. At seven minutes past two in the morning, [[James A. Bayard, Jr.]], of Delaware motioned to adjourn, the motion again failing, 4\u201335, and Powell retained control of the floor. Powell yielded the floor to Bayard, who then began to speak. At some point later, Powell made a motion to adjourn, but Bayard apparently had not yielded to him for that motion. When this was pointed out, Powell told Bayard to sit down so he could make the motion, assuming that Bayard would retain control of the floor if the motion failed, as it did, 4\u201333. The presiding officer, [[Samuel C. Pomeroy]] of Kansas, immediately [[previous question|called the question]] of concurring in the report of the conference committee and [[voice vote|declared]] that the ayes had it, and Trumbull immediately moved that the Senate move on to other business, which motion was agreed to. The Democrats objected that Bayard still had the floor, that he had merely yielded it for a motion to adjourn, but Pomeroy said he had no record of why Bayard had yielded the floor, meaning the floor was open once Powell's motion to adjourn had failed, meaning that the presiding officer was free to call the question. In this way, the bill cleared the Senate.<ref name=\"CongGlobeSen\" />\n\nThe next day, Senate Democrats protested the manner in which the bill had passed. During the ensuring discussion, the [[president pro tempore]] asked permission \"to sign a large number of enrolled bills\", among which was the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act.

On the morning of July 7, they asked a District of Columbia court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the military tribunal had no jurisdiction over their client. The court issued the writ at 3 A.M., and it was served on General Winfield Scott Hancock. Hancock was ordered to produce Surratt by 10 A.M. General Hancock sent an aide to General John F. Hartranft, who commanded the Old Capitol Prison, ordering him not to admit any United States marshal (as this would prevent the marshal from serving a similar writ on Hartranft). President Johnson was informed that the court had issued the writ, and promptly cancelled it at 11:30 A.M. under the authority granted to him by the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863.

At ''Harper\u2019s Magazine'', Hedges tried to lift material from Matt Katz before their Editor in Chief and publisher stepped in. At the time, Hedges told the fact checker that Katz approved of the manuscript where he lifted Katz work, only to find out later that Katz had never actually seen the draft.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"The Troubling Case of Chris Hedges\" |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118114/chris-hedges-pulitzer-winner-lefty-hero-plagiarist |website=The New Republic |publisher=The New Republic |accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref> Ross, the fact checker also said that the Hedges manuscript \u201ccould not have been anything but intentional. Specific language, specific sentence structure, specific topics. He went to all the same places as this reporter [Matt Katz], and talked to the same people. Some of it was just taken from the reporter\u2019s articles. There were sentences that were exactly the same.\u201d He elaborated \u201cHedges not only used another journalist\u2019s quotes but he used them in first-person scenes, claiming he himself gathered the quotes. It was one of the worst things I\u2019d ever seen as a fact-checker at the magazine.\u201d At the time of being caught, Hedges tried to go around the ''Harper\u2019s Magazine'' editor, Theodore Ross, by appealing to ''Harper\u2019s'' publisher Rick MacArthur who was his friend at the time. \n\n'''War is the Force That Gives us Meaning'''\n\nIn his most famous book ''War is the Force that Gives us Meaning'', parts were found out to be directly lifted from Hemingway\u2019s ''A Farewell to Arms''. There is no citation of Hemingway in Hedges' text, endnotes or bibliography. University of Texas classics professor Thomas Palaima, who caught the lift of words and ideas, said that when talking to Hedges about the lift he had  \u201cnever encountered a case where an unattributed use of another intellectual\u2019s ideas and wording was solved by altering the wording in a subsequent printing without attribution.\u201d\nOnce the plagiarism was discovered Hedges claimed that it was too costly for the publisher to add the Hemingway credit because text would have to be repaginated. \n\nHedges has also been caught lifting passages from Petra Bartosiewicz, a writer for ''Harper\u2019s Magazine''. In his article, he refers to Bartosiewic\u2019s article but doesn\u2019t explain that he had copied an entire paragraphs of hers. Hedges claimed that it was not formatted to show he correctly quoted her. Hedges never explained why he made small changes to the text if it was a block quote such as changing phrases of \u201cmy local reporter\u201d to \u201ca local reporter\u201d. \n\nIn his columns, Hedges lifted language and ideas from Neil Postman\u2019s \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death\u201d but failed to include a citation. \n\n==NDAA lawsuit==\n{{Main|Hedges v. Obama}}\n\nIn 2012, after the Obama Administration signed the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012|National Defense Authorization Act]], or NDAA, Hedges sued members of the U.S. government, asserting that section 2021 of the law unconstitutionally allowed presidential authority for indefinite detention without ''[[habeas corpus]]''. He was later joined in the suit, ''[[Hedges v. Obama]]'', by activists including [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. In May 2012 Judge [[Katherine B.

The defector whom Hedges quoted, who had identified himself as Lt. General Jamal al-Ghurairy, was a former sergeant. The real Ghurairy had never left Iraq. Hedges said that he had taken on reporting this account at the request of [[Lowell Bergman]] of ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]]'', who wanted the defectors for his show but could not go to Beirut for the interview. The trip had been organized by [[Ahmed Chalabi]], whom Hedges considered to be unreliable. Hedges said he had done the piece as a favor to Bergman, explaining, \"There has to be a level of trust between reporters. We cover each other's sources when it's a good story because otherwise everyone would get hold of it.\" Hedges had relied on the U.S. embassy in Turkey for further confirmation of the man's identity.<ref name=\"heroes in error\"/>\n\nHedges wrote two more articles that year that were informed by Chalabi-coached defectors. The second one, claiming that Iraq still held 80 Kuwaitis captured in the 1991 Gulf War in a secret underground prison, was also found to be baseless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0316-02.htm |author1=Jonathan S.
