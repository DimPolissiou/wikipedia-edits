A source from SM Entertainment confirmed the news and released a statement, saying, \u201cChangmin is currently working hard, with the goal of releasing his solo album in April. Please anticipate it.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=609&aid=0000257465|script-title=ko:SM \uce21 \u201c\ub3d9\ubc29\uc2e0\uae30 \ucd5c\uac15\ucc3d\ubbfc, 4\uc6d4 \uc194\ub85c\uc568\ubc94 \ubc1c\ub9e4 \uc900\ube44\uc911\u2026\uae30\ub300 \ubd80\ud0c1\u201d(\uacf5\uc2dd)|last=Hwang|first=Hyejin|work=Newsen|date=March 13, 2020|language=ko|accessdate=April 20, 2020|via=[[Naver]]}}</ref>\n\nOn March 23, 2020, SM Entertainment announced that Changmin would be making his Korean solo debut with his first mini album titled ''Chocolate'' and title track of the same name.

When he was asked where he gets his inspiration from, he said, \u201cUsually when I write songs, I will hear a word in the demo and get inspiration from that to tell a story. That was the case for \u2018Chocolate\u2019 as well. For me, the word \"chocolate\" feels like a word full of desire. It\u2019s not always necessary in a dessert, but if it\u2019s there, you find yourself getting addicted and eating it. I wanted to compare chocolate to the desire of wanting to meet someone you\u2019re attracted to.\u201d He went on to add, \u201cI also heard an artist saying how they write lyrics with life advice they want to give their son, so I often wrote lyrics with the hopes of conveying a message to my fans that will give them strength.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=112&aid=0003285572|title=\ub3d9\ubc29\uc2e0\uae30 \ucd5c\uac15\ucc3d\ubbfc \"\uccab \uc194\ub85c \uae30\ubed0..\uc720\ub178\uc724\ud638 \ubb34\uc5b8\uc758 \uc751\uc6d0 \uac10\uc0ac\"(\uc77c\ubb38\uc77c\ub2f5)|work=entertain naver|date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nOn March 24, 2020, SM Entertainment and TVXQ released a time table for Changmin's first extended play through their official homepage and [[Social networking service|SNS]], which shows the singer's promotion schedule beginning March 31 until the release of their album on April 6.

Around 1157 it was held by [[Albert the Bear]], the first Margrave of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. When Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] deposed the Saxon duke, [[Henry the Lion]] in 1180, the [[Duchy of Wittenberg|Wittenberg lands]] belonged to Albert's youngest son, Count [[Bernhard, Count of Anhalt|Bernhard of Anhalt]], who assumed the Saxon ducal title. Bernard's eldest son, [[Albert I, Duke of Saxony|Albert I]], ceded the territory known as, [[Anhalt]] to his younger brother, [[Henry I, Count of Anhalt|Henry]], retaining the ducal title and attached to this territory the lordship of [[Lauenburg]]. His sons divided the territory into the duchies of [[Saxe-Wittenberg]] and [[Saxe-Lauenburg]]. Both lines claimed the Saxon ''electoral dignity'' or privilege, which led to confusion during the 1314 election of the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] duke, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis of Bavaria]] as [[King of the Romans]] against his [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] rival, Duke [[Frederick the Fair]] of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], as both candidates received one vote each from each of the two rival Ascanian branches.\n\n[[File:Goldene Bulle Handschrift.jpg|thumb|left|A page from the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] of King Wenceslas, [[National Library of Austria]]]]\nLouis was succeeded by the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] king, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Bohemia]]. After his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1355, Charles issued the ''Golden Bull of 1356'', the fundamental law of the Empire settling the method of electing the ''German King'' by seven [[Prince-elector]]s. The rival Wittelsbach and Habsburg dynasties got nothing, instead the Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg, [[Marshal|Archmarshal]] of the Empire, received the right to elect the King of the Romans and the prospective Emperor, together with six other elector [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Princes of the Empire]]. Thus, the country, though small in area, gained influence far beyond its extent.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nThe electoral privilege also contained the obligation of male [[primogeniture]]. That is, only the eldest son could succeed as ruler. It therefore forbade the division of the territory among several heirs, in order to prevent the disintegration of the country. The importance of this stipulation is shown by the history of most of the fragmented German principalities (e.g. the Saxon [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]) which were not constituted as [[Prince elector|electorates]].{{r|Sacher}}\n\n==Wettin rule==\n{{Main|Margravate of Meissen}}\n[[File:Saxony (Division of Leipzig) - DE.png|thumb|left|280px|Saxony partitioned according to the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig:{{legend|#d40000|Ernestine lands: Wittenberg and southern Thuringia}}{{legend|#fc0|Albertine lands: Dresden and northern Thuringia}}]]\nThe Ascanian line of Saxe-Wittenberg became extinct with the death of Elector [[Albert III, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg|Albert III]] in 1422, after which Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] granted the country and electoral privilege upon Margrave [[Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|Frederick IV of Meissen]], who had been a loyal supporter in the [[Hussite Wars]]. The late Albert's Ascanian relative, Duke [[Eric V, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg|Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg]] protested in vain. Frederick, one of the seven Prince-electors, was a member of the [[House of Wettin]], which since 1089 had ruled over the adjacent [[Margravate of Meissen]] up the Elbe river - established under Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] in 965 - and also over the [[Landgraviate of Thuringia|Landgravate of Thuringia]] since 1242. Thus, in 1423, Saxe-Wittenberg, the Margravate of Meissen and Thuringia were [[personal union|united under one ruler]], and as a unified territory gradually became known as, ''[[Upper Saxony]]''.<ref>Cordula Bornefeld, \"Die Herz\u00f6ge von Sachsen-Lauenburg\", in: ''Die F\u00fcrsten des Landes: Herz\u00f6ge und Grafen von Schleswig, Holstein und Lauenburg'' [De slevigske hertuger; German], Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen (ed.) on behalf of the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schleswig-Holsteinische Geschichte, Neum\u00fcnster: Wachholtz, 2008, pp. 373-389. {{ISBN|978-3-529-02606-5}}</ref>\n\nWhen Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] died in 1464, his two surviving sons overrode the ''primogeniture principle'' and divided his territories by the [[Treaty of Leipzig]] on 26 August 1485. This resulted in the already separated Wettin dynasty becoming the [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine]] and Albertine branches. The elder [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]], founder of the ''Ernestine line'', received large parts of the former Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg with the electoral privilege attached to it, and the southern Landgravate of Thuringia. While the younger [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony|Albert]], founder of the ''Albertine line'', received northern Thuringia and the lands of the former Margravate of Meissen. Thus, although the ''Ernestine line'' had initially had greater authority until the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] in 1547, the electoral privilege and territory then fell to the ''Albertine line'', which later also became a [[royal house]] when Saxony was proclaimed a kingdom in the 19th century. This partition was to decisively enfeeble the Wettin dynasty in relation to the then rising [[House of Hohenzollern]]. It had already achieved its own ''electoral privilege'' as Margraves of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] since 1415.{{r|Sacher}}\n\n== Protestant Reformation ==\n{{see also|Martin Luther|History of Lutheranism}}\n[[File:Wittenberg Schlosskirche.JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Castle church in Wittenberg]], where [[Martin Luther]] nailed his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'']]\n[[File:Lucas Cranach d. \u00c4. 097.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]] protected Luther from the manhunt]]\nThe [[Protestantism|Protestant movement]] of the 16th century largely spread under the protection of the Saxon rulers. Ernest's son, Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick the Wise]] established in 1502 the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|University at Wittenberg]], where the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monk, [[Martin Luther]], was appointed professor of philosophy in 1508. At the same time he became one of the preachers at the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|castle church]] in Wittenberg. On 31 October 1517, he enclosed in a protest letter to [[Albert of Brandenburg]] the [[Archbishop of Mainz]], ''[[The Ninety-five Theses]]'' against the sale of [[indulgence]]s and other [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] practices, an action that marked the start of what came to be called the ''[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]''. Although the Elector did not at first share the new attitude, he granted his protection to Luther anyway. Owing to this intervention, [[Pope Leo X]] decided against summoning Luther to [[Rome]] in 1518, and the Elector secured for Luther Imperial safe-conduct to the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521. When Luther was declared  [[Imperial ban|banned in the entire empire]] by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Elector had him brought to live in [[Wartburg Castle]] on his Thuringian estate. Lutheran doctrines spread first in ''Ernestine'' Saxony.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nIn 1525, Frederick died, possibly never having officially left the Catholic Church, unless on his deathbed in 1525, but he was sympathetic towards Lutheranism by the time of his death.<ref>Bacon, Paul M. \u201cArt Patronage and Piety in Electoral Saxony: Frederick the Wise Promotes the Veneration of His Patron, St. Bartholomew.\u201d ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'', vol. 39, no. 4, 2008, pp. 973\u20131001.

He exercised full authority over the ''new church'' introduced as, the \"[[Lutheran Confessions|Lutheran Confession]]\", and ordered the dismissal of all priests who continued in the Catholic faith. He directed the use of the ''[[Vernacular Liturgy]]'' drawn up by Luther. In 1531 he formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] with a number of other ruling princes for the continuation of the ''[[Protestantism|Protestant doctrine]]'' and for a joint defence against the Habsburg Emperor Charles V, a fierce opponent of the Reformation. John was followed in 1532 by his son, [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick the Magnanimous]] (died 1554), who was also one of the leaders of the Schmalkaldic League. In 1542, he seized the [[Diocese of Naumburg|Diocese of Naumburg-Zeitz]], and confiscated the secular possessions of the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen|Meissen]] and [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|Hildesheim]]. Lutheranism, as it came to be organised in Saxony, would serve as an example for future Protestant states throughout Europe.{{r|Sacher}}<ref>Elizabeth Plummer. \"Martin Luther and the Saxon Electors\" in ''Oxford Research Encyclopedias''.

However, George's brother and successor, Duke [[Henry IV, Duke of Saxony|Henry IV of Saxony]] (1539\u201341), was finally won over to Protestantism under the influence of his wife, [[Catherine of Mecklenburg]], and thus the Catholic diocese of Meissen came to be abolished. Henry's son and successor, Duke [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Maurice]], was one of the most controversial figures of the Reformation period. Although a zealous Protestant, ambition and desire to increase his wealth led him to join the Emperor against the [[Schmalkaldic League]], established by his ''Ernestine'' cousin, John Frederick.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Schmalkaldic War]] Elector John Frederick was placed under an Imperial ban and was finally defeated and captured by Emperor Charles V at the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] on 24 April 1547. The [[Capitulation of Wittenberg]] of May 19 obliged him to cede former Saxe-Wittenberg with its electoral privilege to his ''Albertine'' cousin, Duke Maurice, who had switched sides as fortunes reversed.  After the Capitulation, the Ernestine branch of the Wettin family only retained its possessions in Thuringia, that owing to repeated divisions among the heirs from 1572 onwards, was soon cut up into the minor [[Ernestine duchies]] of [[Saxe-Weimar]], [[Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach]] et al.{{r|Sacher}} Those still in existence at the time of the 1918 [[German Revolution]] after [[World War I]] were the [[grand duchy|Grand Duchy]] of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] and the duchies of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], [[Saxe-Meiningen]] and [[Saxe-Altenburg]].\n\nAfter the Wittenberg Capitulation the Saxon Electorate consisted of former Saxe-Wittenberg and Meissen now united, and remained under the authority of the ''Albertine line'' of the Wettin family. Maurice again became estranged from Charles V partly out of resentment for not receiving what was left of the Ernestine possessions, but even more on account of his motivation to see a Protestant at the head of the empire. After the Emperor had issued the [[Augsburg Interim]], Maurice concluded an alliance with King [[Henry II of France]] and through the [[Treaty of Chambord]] 1552 ceded the [[Three Bishoprics]] of [[Diocese of Metz|Metz]], [[Diocese of Toul|Toul]], and [[Diocese of Verdun|Verdun]] in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] to France. Maurice secretly took part in all the princely conspiracies against the Emperor, who only escaped capture by fleeing. During the same year, Charles V was obliged by the [[Peace of Passau]] to grant freedom of religion to the Protestant states.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nMaurice died in 1553 at the age of 32. His brother and successor, Elector [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony|Augustus]], seized the Catholic dioceses of [[Bishopric of Merseburg|Merseburg]] and [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|Naumburg-Zeitz]] for himself.  The last Bishop of Merseburg, Michael Helding called Sidonius, died at [[Vienna]] in 1561. The Emperor demanded the election of a new bishop, but Augustus forced the election of his son Alexander, who was eight years old, as administrator. After Alexander had died in 1565, he administered the diocese himself. Similarly, after the death in 1564 of [[Julius von Pflug]], the last Catholic Bishop of Naumburg, the Elector confiscated the bishopric and forbade adherence to the Catholic religion. Those cathedral canons who were still Catholic were only permitted to practice their religion for ten more years. In 1581, [[John IX of Haugwitz|John of Haugwitz]], the last [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen|Bishop of Meissen]], resigned his office. In 1587 he became a Protestant. The episcopal domains fell likewise to Saxony, and the cathedral chapter ceased to exist.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nDuring the reigns of the Elector Augustus (1553\u201386) and [[Christian I, Elector of Saxony|Christian]] (1586\u201391), a movement called [[Crypto-Calvinism]] gained strength in the electorate. As [[Christian II, Elector of Saxony|Christian II]] (1591\u20131611) was too young to rule, his mother, [[Sophie of Brandenburg]] became [[regent]] in 1591 and was the only woman to act as \"Elector\". She was vehemently opposed to the \"new\" movement. Just as her young son was assuming the reins of power in 1601, the Saxon chancellor, [[Nikolaus Krell]], who had been spreading the other Protestant doctrine, was overthrown and beheaded in 1601.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110719065438/http://www.neumarkt-dresden.de/nikolaus-krell.html (in German)</ref> A more strict adherence to Lutheranism was reintroduced and with it a religious oath.{{r|Sacher}}\n\n== Thirty Years' War ==\n[[File:Locator Electoral Saxony within the Holy Roman Empire (1618).svg|left|thumb|Saxony in 1618, at the war's outbreak.]]\n[[File:Electorate of Saxony 1648.jpg|thumb|280px|Saxony (pink) in 1648, with Lusatian acquisitions]]\nThe [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) occurred during the reign of Elector [[John George I, Elector of Saxony|John George]] (1611\u201356). In this struggle, the Elector was at first neutral, and for a long time he would not listen to the overtures of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]]. Not until the Imperial General [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly|Johann Tserclaes of Tilly]] advanced into Saxony did the Elector join the forces of the [[Swedish Empire]]. However, after the 1634 [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]], the Elector concluded the [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]] with Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] in 1635. By this treaty, Saxony received the Margravates of [[Upper Lusatia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lusatia]] as a [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian]] fiefdom, and the condition of the Church lands that had been secularized was not altered. The Swedes, for their part, took revenge with ten years of plunder.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nBy the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] Saxony retained its Lusatian possessions as an Imperial fiefdom. However, it lost forever the possibility of extending its territory along the lower course of the Elbe into the lands of the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]],  even though they were under the administration of the Wettin Duke, [[Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels|Augustus of Saxe-Weissenfels]]. Upon his death in 1680, the secularised [[Duchy of Magdeburg]] fell to the \"Great Elector\" [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William of Brandenburg]], which confirmed the primacy of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] under the Protestant Hohenzollern dynasty. In 1653, the Saxon elector became the head of the ''[[Corpus Evangelicorum]]'', the union of the Protestant Imperial Estates. Under the following Electors, religious questions were not as prominent. A rigid Lutheranism remained the prevailing faith, and the practice of any other faith was strictly prohibited. About the middle of the 17th century, [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italian]] merchants were the first Catholics to reappear in the country. They settled in [[Dresden]], the capital, and in [[Leipzig]], the most important commercial city. The practice of [[Roman Catholicism]] was, however, not permitted to them.{{r|Sacher}}\n[[File:Coat of arms of Augustus III of Poland as vicar of the Holy Roman Empire.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of Augustus the Strong, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elector of Saxony]]\n\n==Saxony-Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania==\n[[File:August II the Strong by Marcello Bacciarelli.PNG|thumb|left|150px|[[Augustus II the Strong]] oil by [[Marcello Bacciarelli|Baciarelli]]]]\nOn 1 June 1697, Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]], \"the Strong\" (1694\u20131733) converted to Catholicism and was subsequently elected [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] and [[Grand duke of Lithuania]].

The conversion of the Elector raised fears among many Lutherans that Catholicism would now be re-established in Saxony. In response, the Elector transferred his authority over Lutheran institutions (which, until then, had been exercised by the sovereign) to a government board, the [[Privy Council]]. The Privy Council was composed exclusively of Protestants. Even after his conversion, the Elector remained the head of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)#Religious bodies|Protestant body in the Reichstag]], despite an unsuccessful attempt by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] to take over the position in 1717\u20131720.{{r|Sacher}}\n\n[[File:August III.jpg|thumb|right|150px|August III of Poland as Crown Prince]]\nHis son, Elector [[August III the Saxon|Frederick Augustus II]] (1733\u201363), was received into the Catholic Church, while still heir-apparent, on 28 November 1712, in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]]. With this conversion, which on account of the excitable sentiment of the Lutheran population, had to be kept secret for five years, the ruling family of Saxony once more became Catholic. He too was controversially \"elected King of Poland and [[Grand duke of Lithuania]]\", that is monarch of the [[Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania]] against the French candidate, [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois, Prince of Conti]], who, on learning the result, attempted to claim the throne arriving by sea at the port of [[Gda\u0144sk]].

Another collateral line founded in 1657 was that of [[Saxe-Zeitz]], which became extinct in 1759. Members of this line who became Catholic were Christian Augustus (died 1725), Cardinal [[Archbishop of Gran]] in [[Esztergom]], [[Hungary]] and Maurice Adolphus, [[Bishop of Leitmeritz]] in Bohemia (died 1759).\n\nThe most zealous promoter of the Catholic faith in Saxony was the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] Archduchess [[Maria Josepha]], daughter of Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], who in 1719 married Frederick Augustus, later the second elector of that name. The [[Katholische Hofkirche|Court Church]] of Dresden was built 1739\u201351 by the Italian architect [[Gaetano Chiaveri|Chiaveri]] in the Roman [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. It was heavily damaged during the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] and subsequently rebuilt. Notwithstanding the faith of its rulers, Saxony remained an entirely Protestant country. The few Catholics who settled there remained without any political or civil rights.\n\n===Fighting for survival===\n{{Further|Third Silesian War|Kingdom of Saxony}}\n[[File:Kurf\u00fcrst Friedrich August III. von Sachsen, genannt der Gerechte.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Kurf\u00fcrst [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus III]], last Elector of Saxony and first King of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]]] \nIn 1756, during the [[Third Silesian War]] between [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and Austria (part of the Seven Years' War), Saxony was invaded and overrun by the forces of King [[Frederick II of Prussia]], who took Dresden and after the [[Siege of Pirna]] forced the Saxon army to surrender and join his [[Prussian Army]]. Many later deserted, and a force of Saxon troops fought to restore their independence. The [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]] in 1763 eventually restored Saxony as an entity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nWhen in 1806 [[Napoleon]] began a war with Prussia, Saxony at first allied itself with his long-time rival, but afterwards joined Napoleon and entered the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Elector [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus III]] (1763\u20131827) was formally the last Elector of Saxony.

Around 1157 it was held by [[Albert the Bear]], the first Margrave of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. When Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] deposed the Saxon duke, [[Henry the Lion]] in 1180, the [[Duchy of Wittenberg|Wittenberg lands]] belonged to Albert's youngest son, Count [[Bernhard, Count of Anhalt|Bernhard of Anhalt]], who assumed the Saxon ducal title. Bernard's eldest son, [[Albert I, Duke of Saxony|Albert I]], ceded the territory known as, [[Anhalt]] to his younger brother, [[Henry I, Count of Anhalt|Henry]], retaining the ducal title and attched to this territory the lordship of [[Lauenburg]]. His sons divided the territory into the duchies of [[Saxe-Wittenberg]] and [[Saxe-Lauenburg]]. Both lines claimed the Saxon ''electoral dignity'' or privilege, which led to confusion during the 1314 election of the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] duke, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis of Bavaria]] as [[King of the Romans]] against his [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] rival, Duke [[Frederick the Fair]] of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], as both candidates received one vote each from each of the two rival Ascanian branches.\n\n[[File:Goldene Bulle Handschrift.jpg|thumb|left|A page from the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] of King Wenceslas, [[National Library of Austria]]]]\nLouis was succeeded by the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] king, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Bohemia]]. After his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1355, Charles issued the ''Golden Bull of 1356'', the fundamental law of the Empire settling the method of electing the ''German King'' by seven [[Prince-elector]]s. The rival Wittelsbach and Habsburg dynasties got nothing, instead the Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg, [[Marshal|Archmarshal]] of the Empire, received the right to elect the King of the Romans and the prospective Emperor, together with six other elector [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Princes of the Empire]]. Thus, the country, though small in area, gained influence far beyond its extent.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nThe electoral privilege also contained the obligation of male [[primogeniture]]. That is, only the eldest son could succeed as ruler. It therefore forbade the division of the territory among several heirs, in order to prevent the disintegration of the country. The importance of this stipulation is shown by the history of most of the fragmented German principalities (e.g. the Saxon [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]) which were not constituted as [[Prince elector|electorates]].{{r|Sacher}}\n\n==Wettin rule==\n{{Main|Margravate of Meissen}}\n[[File:Saxony (Division of Leipzig) - DE.png|thumb|left|280px|Saxony partitioned according to the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig:{{legend|#d40000|Ernestine lands: Wittenberg and southern Thuringia}}{{legend|#fc0|Albertine lands: Dresden and northern Thuringia}}]]\nThe Ascanian line of Saxe-Wittenberg became extinct with the death of Elector [[Albert III, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg|Albert III]] in 1422, after which Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] granted the country and electoral privilege upon Margrave [[Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|Frederick IV of Meissen]], who had been a loyal supporter in the [[Hussite Wars]]. The late Albert's Ascanian relative, Duke [[Eric V, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg|Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg]] protested in vain. Frederick, one of the seven Prince-electors, was a member of the [[House of Wettin]], which since 1089 had ruled over the adjacent [[Margravate of Meissen]] up the Elbe river - established under Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] in 965 - and also over the [[Landgraviate of Thuringia|Landgravate of Thuringia]] since 1242. Thus, in 1423, Saxe-Wittenberg, the Margravate of Meissen and Thuringia were [[personal union|united under one ruler]], and as a unified territory gradually became known as, ''[[Upper Saxony]]''.<ref>Cordula Bornefeld, \"Die Herz\u00f6ge von Sachsen-Lauenburg\", in: ''Die F\u00fcrsten des Landes: Herz\u00f6ge und Grafen von Schleswig, Holstein und Lauenburg'' [De slevigske hertuger; German], Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen (ed.) on behalf of the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schleswig-Holsteinische Geschichte, Neum\u00fcnster: Wachholtz, 2008, pp. 373-389. {{ISBN|978-3-529-02606-5}}</ref>\n\nWhen Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] died in 1464, his two surviving sons overrode the ''primogeniture principle'' and divided his territories by the [[Treaty of Leipzig]] on 26 August 1485. This resulted in the already separated Wettin dynasty becoming the [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine]] and Albertine branches. The elder [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]], founder of the ''Ernestine line'', received large parts of the former Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg with the electoral privilege attached to it, and the southern Landgravate of Thuringia. While the younger [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony|Albert]], founder of the ''Albertine line'', received northern Thuringia and the lands of the former Margravate of Meissen. Thus, although the ''Ernestine line'' had initially had greater authority until the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] in 1547, the electoral privilege and territory then fell to the ''Albertine line'', which later also became a [[royal house]] when Saxony was proclaimed a kingdom in the 19th century. This partition was to decisively enfeeble the Wettin dynasty in relation to the then rising [[House of Hohenzollern]]. It had already achieved its own ''electoral privilege'' as Margraves of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] since 1415.{{r|Sacher}}\n\n== Protestant Reformation ==\n{{see also|Martin Luther|History of Lutheranism}}\n[[File:Wittenberg Schlosskirche.JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Castle church in Wittenberg]], where [[Martin Luther]] nailed his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'']]\n[[File:Lucas Cranach d. \u00c4. 097.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]] protected Luther from the manhunt]]\nThe [[Protestantism|Protestant movement]] of the 16th century largely spread under the protection of the Saxon rulers. Ernest's son, Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick the Wise]] established in 1502 the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|University at Wittenberg]], where the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monk, [[Martin Luther]], was appointed professor of philosophy in 1508. At the same time he became one of the preachers at the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|castle church]] in Wittenberg. On 31 October 1517, he enclosed in a protest letter to [[Albert of Brandenburg]] the [[Archbishop of Mainz]], ''[[The Ninety-five Theses]]'' against the sale of [[indulgence]]s and other [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] practices, an action that marked the start of what came to be called the ''[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]''. Although the Elector did not at first share the new attitude, he granted his protection to Luther anyway. Owing to this intervention, [[Pope Leo X]] decided against summoning Luther to [[Rome]] in 1518, and the Elector secured for Luther Imperial safe-conduct to the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521. When Luther was declared  [[Imperial ban|banned in the entire empire]] by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Elector had him brought to live in [[Wartburg Castle]] on his Thuringian estate. Lutheran doctrines spread first in ''Ernestine'' Saxony.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nIn 1525, Frederick died, possibly never having officially left the Catholic Church, unless on his deathbed in 1525, but he was sympathetic towards Lutheranism by the time of his death.<ref>Bacon, Paul M. \u201cArt Patronage and Piety in Electoral Saxony: Frederick the Wise Promotes the Veneration of His Patron, St. Bartholomew.\u201d ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'', vol. 39, no. 4, 2008, pp. 973\u20131001.

He directed the use of the ''[[Vernacular Liturgy]]'' drawn up by Luther. In 1531 he formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] with a number of other ruling princes for the continuation of the ''[[Protestantism|Protestant doctrine]]'' and for a joint defence against the Habsburg Emperor Charles V, a fierce opponent of the Reformation. John was followed in 1532 by his son, [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick the Magnanimous]] (died 1554), who was also one of the leaders of the Schmalkaldic League. In 1542, he seized the [[Diocese of Naumburg|Diocese of Naumburg-Zeitz]], and confiscated the secular possessions of the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen|Meissen]] and [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|Hildesheim]].

However, George's brother and successor, Duke [[Henry IV, Duke of Saxony|Henry IV of Saxony]] (1539\u201341), was finally won over to Protestantism under the influence of his wife, [[Catherine of Mecklenburg]], and thus the Catholic diocese of Meissen came to be abolished. Henry's son and successor, Duke [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Maurice]], was one of the most controversial figures of the Reformation period. Although a zealous Protestant, ambition and desire to increase his wealth led him to join the Emperor against the [[Schmalkaldic League]], established by his ''Ernestine'' cousin, John Frederick.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Schmalkaldic War]] Elector John Frederick was placed under an Imperial ban and was finally defeated and captured by Emperor Charles V at the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] on 24 April 1547. The [[Capitulation of Wittenberg]] of May 19 obliged him to cede former Saxe-Wittenberg with its electoral privilege to his ''Albertine'' cousin, Duke Maurice, who had switched sides as fortunes reversed.  After the Capitulation, the Ernestine branch of the Wettin family only retained its possessions in Thuringia, that owing to repeated divisions among the heirs from 1572 onwards, was soon cut up into the minor [[Ernestine duchies]] of [[Saxe-Weimar]], [[Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach]] et al.{{r|Sacher}} Those still in existence at the time of the 1918 [[German Revolution]] after [[World War I]] were the [[grand duchy|Grand Duchy]] of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] and the duchies of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], [[Saxe-Meiningen]] and [[Saxe-Altenburg]].\n\nAfter the Wittenberg Capitulation the Saxon Electorate consisted of former Saxe-Wittenberg and Meissen now united, and remained under the authority of the ''Albertine line'' of the Wettin family. Maurice again became estranged from Charles V partly out of resentment for not receiving what was left of the Ernestine possessions, but even more on account of his motivation to see a Protestant at the head of the empire. After the Emperor had issued the [[Augsburg Interim]], Maurice concluded an alliance with King [[Henry II of France]] and through the [[Treaty of Chambord]] 1552 ceded the [[Three Bishoprics]] of [[Diocese of Metz|Metz]], [[Diocese of Toul|Toul]], and [[Diocese of Verdun|Verdun]] in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] to France. Maurice secretly took part in all the princely conspiracies against the Emperor, who only escaped capture by fleeing. During the same year, Charles V was obliged by the [[Peace of Passau]] to grant freedom of religion to the Protestant states.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nMaurice died in 1553 at the age of 32. His brother and successor, Elector [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony|Augustus]], seized the Catholic dioceses of [[Bishopric of Merseburg|Merseburg]] and [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|Naumburg-Zeitz]] for himself.  The last Bishop of Merseburg, Michael Helding called Sidonius, died at [[Vienna]] in 1561. The Emperor demanded the election of a new bishop, but Augustus forced the election of his son Alexander, who was eight years old, as administrator. After Alexander had died in 1565, he administered the diocese himself. Similarly, after the death in 1564 of [[Julius von Pflug]], the last Catholic Bishop of Naumburg, the Elector confiscated the bishopric and forbade adherence to the Catholic religion. Those cathedral canons who were still Catholic were only permitted to practice their religion for ten more years. In 1581, [[John IX of Haugwitz|John of Haugwitz]], the last [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen|Bishop of Meissen]], resigned his office. In 1587 he became a Protestant. The episcopal domains fell likewise to Saxony, and the cathedral chapter ceased to exist.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nDuring the reigns of the Elector Augustus (1553\u201386) and [[Christian I, Elector of Saxony|Christian]] (1586\u201391), a movement called [[Crypto-Calvinism]] gained strength in the electorate. As [[Christian II, Elector of Saxony|Christian II]] (1591\u20131611) was too young to rule, his mother, [[Sophie of Brandenburg]] became [[regent]] in 1591 and was the only woman to act as \"Elector\". She was vehemently opposed to the \"new\" movement. Just as her young son was assuming the reins of power in 1601, the Saxon chancellor, [[Nikolaus Krell]], who had been spreading the other Protestant doctrine, was overthrown and beheaded in 1601.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110719065438/http://www.neumarkt-dresden.de/nikolaus-krell.html (in German)</ref> A more strict adherence to Lutheranism was reintroduced and with it a religious oath.{{r|Sacher}}\n\n== Thirty Years' War ==\n[[File:Locator Electoral Saxony within the Holy Roman Empire (1618).svg|left|thumb|Saxony in 1618, at the war's outbreak.]]\n[[File:Electorate of Saxony 1648.jpg|thumb|280px|Saxony (pink) in 1648, with Lusatian acquisitions]]\nThe [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) occurred during the reign of Elector [[John George I, Elector of Saxony|John George]] (1611\u201356). In this struggle, the Elector was at first neutral, and for a long time he would not listen to the overtures of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]]. Not until the Imperial General [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly|Johann Tserclaes of Tilly]] advanced into Saxony did the Elector join the forces of the [[Swedish Empire]]. However, after the 1634 [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]], the Elector concluded the [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]] with Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] in 1635. By this treaty, Saxony received the Margravates of [[Upper Lusatia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lusatia]] as a [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian]] fiefdom, and the condition of the Church lands that had been secularized was not altered. The Swedes, for their part, took revenge with ten years of plunder.{{r|Sacher}}\n\nBy the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] Saxony retained its Lusatian possessions as an Imperial fiefdom. However, it lost forever the possibility of extending its territory along the lower course of the Elbe into the lands of the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]],  even though they were under the administration of the Wettin Duke, [[Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels|Augustus of Saxe-Weissenfels]]. Upon his death in 1680, the secularised [[Duchy of Magdeburg]] fell to the \"Great Elector\" [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William of Brandenburg]], which confirmed the primacy of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] under the Protestant Hohenzollern dynasty. In 1653, the Saxon elector became the head of the ''[[Corpus Evangelicorum]]'', the union of the Protestant Imperial Estates. Under the following Electors, religious questions were not as prominent. A rigid Lutheranism remained the prevailing faith, and the practice of any other faith was strictly prohibited. About the middle of the 17th century, [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italian]] merchants were the first Catholics to reappear in the country. They settled in [[Dresden]], the capital, and in [[Leipzig]], the most important commercial city. The practice of [[Roman Catholicism]] was, however, not permitted to them.{{r|Sacher}}\n[[File:Coat of arms of Augustus III of Poland as vicar of the Holy Roman Empire.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of Augustus the Strong, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elector of Saxony]]\n\n==Saxony-Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania==\n[[File:August II the Strong by Marcello Bacciarelli.PNG|thumb|left|150px|[[Augustus II the Strong]] oil by [[Marcello Bacciarelli|Baciarelli]]]]\nOn 1 June 1697, Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]], \"the Strong\" (1694\u20131733) converted to Catholicism and was subsequently elected [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] and [[Grand duke of Lithuania]].

The conversion of the Elector raised fears among many Lutherans that Catholicism would now be re-established in Saxony. In response, the Elector transferred his authority over Lutheran institutions (which, until then, had been exercised by the sovereign) to a government board, the [[Privy Council]]. The Privy Council was composed exclusively of Protestants. Even after his conversion, the Elector remained the head of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)#Religious bodies|Protestant body in the Reichstag]], despite an unsuccessful attempt by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] to take over the position in 1717\u20131720.{{r|Sacher}}\n\n[[File:August III.jpg|thumb|right|150px|August III of Poland as Crown Prince]]\nHis son, Elector [[August III the Saxon|Frederick Augustus II]] (1733\u201363), was received into the Catholic Church, while still heir-apparent, on 28 November 1712, in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]]. With this conversion, which on account of the excitable sentiment of the Lutheran population, had to be kept secret for five years, the ruling family of Saxony once more became Catholic. He too was controversially \"elected King of Poland and [[Grand duke of Lithuania]]\", that is monarch of the [[Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania]] against the French candidate, [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois, Prince of Conti]], who, on learning the result, attempted to claim the throne arriving by sea at the port of [[Gda\u0144sk]].

Another collateral line founded in 1657 was that of [[Saxe-Zeitz]], which became extinct in 1759. Members of this line who became Catholic were Christian Augustus (died 1725), Cardinal [[Archbishop of Gran]] in [[Esztergom]], [[Hungary]] and Maurice Adolphus, [[Bishop of Leitmeritz]] in Bohemia (died 1759).\n\nThe most zealous promoter of the Catholic faith in Saxony was the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] Archduchess [[Maria Josepha]], daughter of Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], who in 1719 married Frederick Augustus, later the second elector of that name. The [[Katholische Hofkirche|Court Church]] of Dresden was built 1739\u201351 by the Italian architect [[Gaetano Chiaveri|Chiaveri]] in the Roman [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. It was heavily damaged during the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] and subsequently rebuilt.
