{"title_page": "Analytical mechanics", "text_new": "{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Formulations}}\n\nIn [[theoretical physics]] and [[mathematical physics]], '''analytical mechanics''', or '''theoretical mechanics''' is a collection of closely related alternative formulations of [[classical mechanics]]. It was developed by many scientists and mathematicians during the 18th century and onward, after [[Newtonian mechanics]]. Since Newtonian mechanics considers [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities of motion, particularly [[acceleration]]s, [[Momentum|momenta]], [[force]]s, of the constituents of the system, an alternative name for the mechanics governed by [[Newton's laws]] and [[Euler's laws]] is ''vectorial mechanics''.\n\nBy contrast, analytical mechanics uses ''[[Scalar (physics)|scalar]]'' properties of motion representing the system as a whole\u2014usually its total [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]]\u2014not Newton's vectorial forces of individual particles.<ref name=Lanczos>{{cite book |title=The variational principles of mechanics |last=Lanczos |first=Cornelius |page=Introduction, pp. xxi\u2013xxix |edition=4th |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location= New York |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&pg=PR4&dq=isbn=0486650677#PPR21,M1 |nopp=true}}</ref> A scalar is a quantity, whereas a vector is represented by quantity and direction.  The [[equations of motion]] are derived from the scalar quantity by some underlying principle about the scalar's [[calculus of variations|variation]].\n\nAnalytical mechanics takes advantage of a system's ''constraints'' to solve problems. The constraints limit the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] the system can have, and can be used to reduce the number of coordinates needed to solve for the motion. The formalism is well suited to arbitrary choices of coordinates, known in the context as [[generalized coordinates]]. The kinetic and potential energies of the system are expressed using these generalized coordinates or momenta, and the equations of motion can be readily set up, thus analytical mechanics allows numerous mechanical problems to be solved with greater efficiency than fully vectorial methods. It does not always work for non-[[conservative force]]s or dissipative forces like [[friction]], in which case one may revert to Newtonian mechanics.\n\nTwo dominant branches of analytical mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics]] (using generalized coordinates and corresponding generalized velocities in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]) and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (using coordinates and corresponding momenta in [[phase space]]). Both formulations are equivalent by a [[Legendre transformation#Hamilton\u2013Lagrange mechanics|Legendre transformation]] on the generalized coordinates, velocities and momenta, therefore both contain the same information for describing the dynamics of a system. There are other formulations such as [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi theory]], [[Routhian mechanics]], and [[Appell's equation of motion]]. All equations of motion for particles and fields, in any formalism, can be derived from the widely applicable result called the [[principle of least action]]. One result is [[Noether's theorem]], a statement which connects [[conservation law]]s to their associated [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]].\n\nAnalytical mechanics does not introduce new physics and is not more general than Newtonian mechanics. Rather it is a collection of equivalent formalisms which have broad application. In fact the same principles and formalisms can be used in [[relativistic mechanics]] and [[general relativity]], and with some modifications, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].\n\nAnalytical mechanics is used widely, from fundamental physics to [[applied mathematics]], particularly [[chaos theory]].\n\nThe methods of analytical mechanics apply to discrete particles, each with a finite number of degrees of freedom. They can be modified to describe continuous fields or fluids, which have infinite degrees of freedom. The definitions and equations have a close analogy with those of mechanics.\n\n==Intrinsic motion==\n\n;[[Generalized coordinates]] and constraints\n\nIn [[Newtonian mechanics]], one customarily uses all three [[Cartesian coordinates]], or other 3D [[coordinate system]], to refer to a body's [[position (vector)|position]] during its motion.  In physical systems, however, some structure or other system usually constrains the body's motion from taking certain directions and pathways.  So a full set of Cartesian coordinates is often unneeded, as the constraints determine the evolving relations among the coordinates, which relations can be modeled by equations corresponding to the constraints.  In the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, the constraints are incorporated into the motion's geometry, reducing the number of coordinates to the minimum needed to model the motion.  These are known as ''generalized coordinates'', denoted ''q<sub>i</sub>'' (''i'' = 1, 2, 3...).<ref>''The Road to Reality'', Roger Penrose, Vintage books, 2007, {{ISBN|0-679-77631-1}}</ref>\n\n'''Difference between [[Curvilinear coordinates|curvillinear]] and [[generalized coordinates]]'''\n\nGeneralized coordinates incorporate constraints on the system. There is one generalized coordinate ''q<sub>i</sub>'' for each [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] (for convenience labelled by an index ''i'' = 1, 2...''N''), i.e. each way the system can change its [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]]; as curvilinear lengths or angles of rotation. Generalized coordinates are not the same as curvilinear coordinates. The number of ''curvilinear'' coordinates equals the [[dimension]] of the position space in question (usually 3 for 3d space), while the number of ''generalized'' coordinates is not necessarily equal to this dimension; constraints can reduce the number of degrees of freedom (hence the number of generalized coordinates required to define the configuration of the system), following the general rule:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L.N. Hand, J.D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57572-0}}</ref>\n\n:''['''dimension of position space''' (usually 3)] \u00d7 [number of '''constituents''' of system (\"particles\")] \u2212 (number of '''constraints''')''\n:''= (number of '''degrees of freedom''') = (number of '''generalized coordinates''')''\n\nFor a system with ''N'' degrees of freedom, the generalized coordinates can be collected into an ''N''-[[tuple]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{q} = (q_1,q_2,\\cdots q_N) </math>\n\nand the [[time derivative]] (here denoted by an overdot) of this tuple give the ''generalized velocities'':\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\mathbf{q}}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{dq_1}{dt},\\frac{dq_2}{dt},\\cdots \\frac{dq_N}{dt}\\right) \\equiv \\mathbf{\\dot{q}} = (\\dot{q}_1,\\dot{q}_2,\\cdots \\dot{q}_N) </math>.\n\n;[[D'Alembert's principle]]\n\nThe foundation which the subject is built on is ''D'Alembert's principle''.\n\nThis principle states that infinitesimal ''[[virtual work]]'' done by a force across reversible displacements is zero, which is the work done by a force consistent with ideal constraints of the system.

It was developed by many scientists and mathematicians during the 18th century and onward, after [[Newtonian mechanics]]. Since Newtonian mechanics considers [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities of motion, particularly [[acceleration]]s, [[Momentum|momenta]], [[force]]s, of the constituents of the system, an alternative name for the mechanics governed by [[Newton's laws]] and [[Euler's laws]] is ''vectorial mechanics''.\n\nBy contrast, analytical mechanics uses ''[[Scalar (physics)|scalar]]'' properties of motion representing the system as a whole\u2014usually its total [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]]\u2014not Newton's vectorial forces of individual particles.<ref name=Lanczos>{{cite book |title=The variational principles of mechanics |last=Lanczos |first=Cornelius |page=Introduction, pp. xxi\u2013xxix |edition=4th |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location= New York |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&pg=PR4&dq=isbn=0486650677#PPR21,M1 |nopp=true}}</ref> A scalar is a quantity, whereas a vector is represented by quantity and direction.  The [[equations of motion]] are derived from the scalar quantity by some underlying principle about the scalar's [[calculus of variations|variation]].\n\nAnalytical mechanics takes advantage of a system's ''constraints'' to solve problems. The constraints limit the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] the system can have, and can be used to reduce the number of coordinates needed to solve for the motion. The formalism is well suited to arbitrary choices of coordinates, known in the context as [[generalized coordinates]]. The kinetic and potential energies of the system are expressed using these generalized coordinates or momenta, and the equations of motion can be readily set up, thus analytical mechanics allows numerous mechanical problems to be solved with greater efficiency than fully vectorial methods. It does not always work for non-[[conservative force]]s or dissipative forces like [[friction]], in which case one may revert to Newtonian mechanics.\n\nTwo dominant branches of analytical mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics]] (using generalized coordinates and corresponding generalized velocities in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]) and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (using coordinates and corresponding momenta in [[phase space]]). Both formulations are equivalent by a [[Legendre transformation#Hamilton\u2013Lagrange mechanics|Legendre transformation]] on the generalized coordinates, velocities and momenta, therefore both contain the same information for describing the dynamics of a system. There are other formulations such as [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi theory]], [[Routhian mechanics]], and [[Appell's equation of motion]]. All equations of motion for particles and fields, in any formalism, can be derived from the widely applicable result called the [[principle of least action]]. One result is [[Noether's theorem]], a statement which connects [[conservation law]]s to their associated [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]].\n\nAnalytical mechanics does not introduce new physics and is not more general than Newtonian mechanics. Rather it is a collection of equivalent formalisms which have broad application. In fact the same principles and formalisms can be used in [[relativistic mechanics]] and [[general relativity]], and with some modifications, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].\n\nAnalytical mechanics is used widely, from fundamental physics to [[applied mathematics]], particularly [[chaos theory]].\n\nThe methods of analytical mechanics apply to discrete particles, each with a finite number of degrees of freedom. They can be modified to describe continuous fields or fluids, which have infinite degrees of freedom. The definitions and equations have a close analogy with those of mechanics.\n\n==Intrinsic motion==\n\n;[[Generalized coordinates]] and constraints\n\nIn [[Newtonian mechanics]], one customarily uses all three [[Cartesian coordinates]], or other 3D [[coordinate system]], to refer to a body's [[position (vector)|position]] during its motion.  In physical systems, however, some structure or other system usually constrains the body's motion from taking certain directions and pathways.  So a full set of Cartesian coordinates is often unneeded, as the constraints determine the evolving relations among the coordinates, which relations can be modeled by equations corresponding to the constraints.  In the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, the constraints are incorporated into the motion's geometry, reducing the number of coordinates to the minimum needed to model the motion.  These are known as ''generalized coordinates'', denoted ''q<sub>i</sub>'' (''i'' = 1, 2, 3...).<ref>''The Road to Reality'', Roger Penrose, Vintage books, 2007, {{ISBN|0-679-77631-1}}</ref>\n\n'''Difference between [[Curvilinear coordinates|curvillinear]] and [[generalized coordinates]]'''\n\nGeneralized coordinates incorporate constraints on the system. There is one generalized coordinate ''q<sub>i</sub>'' for each [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] (for convenience labelled by an index ''i'' = 1, 2...''N''), i.e. each way the system can change its [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]]; as curvilinear lengths or angles of rotation. Generalized coordinates are not the same as curvilinear coordinates. The number of ''curvilinear'' coordinates equals the [[dimension]] of the position space in question (usually 3 for 3d space), while the number of ''generalized'' coordinates is not necessarily equal to this dimension; constraints can reduce the number of degrees of freedom (hence the number of generalized coordinates required to define the configuration of the system), following the general rule:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L.N.

If the Lagrangian of a system has ''s'' cyclic coordinates '''q''' = ''q''<sub>1</sub>, ''q''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''q<sub>s</sub>'' with conjugate momenta '''p''' = ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''p<sub>s</sub>'', with the rest of the coordinates non-cyclic and denoted '''\u03b6''' = ''\u03b6''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03b6''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''\u03b6<sub>N \u2212 s</sub>'', they can be removed by introducing the ''Routhian'':\n\n:<math>R=\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\dot{q}} - L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{p}, \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}, \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}})\\,,</math>\n\nwhich leads to a set of 2''s'' Hamiltonian equations for the cyclic coordinates '''q''',\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\mathbf{q}} = +\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}\\,,\\quad \\dot{\\mathbf{p}} = -\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}}\\,,</math>\n\nand ''N'' \u2212 ''s'' Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates '''\u03b6'''.\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial R }{\\partial\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}} = \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}\\,.</math>\n\nSet up in this way, although the Routhian has the form of the Hamiltonian, it can be thought of a Lagrangian with ''N'' \u2212 ''s'' degrees of freedom.\n\nThe coordinates '''q''' do not have to be cyclic, the partition between which coordinates enter the Hamiltonian equations and those which enter the Lagrangian equations is arbitrary. It is simply convenient to let the Hamiltonian equations remove the cyclic coordinates, leaving the non cyclic coordinates to the Lagrangian equations of motion.\n\n==Appellian mechanics==\n\n'''[[Appell's equation of motion]]''' involve generalized accelerations, the second time derivatives of the generalized coordinates:\n\n:<math>\\alpha_r = \\ddot{q}_r = \\frac{d^2 q_r}{dt^2}\\,,</math>\n\nas well as generalized forces mentioned above in D'Alembert's principle. The equations are\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{Q}_{r} = \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\alpha_{r}}\\,, \\quad S = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\mathbf{a}_{k}^{2}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a}_k = \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_k = \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{r}_k}{dt^2}</math>\n\nis the acceleration of the ''k'' particle, the second time derivative of its position vector. Each acceleration '''a'''<sub>''k''</sub> is expressed in terms of the generalized accelerations ''\u03b1<sub>r</sub>'', likewise each '''r'''<sub>k</sub> are expressed in terms the generalized coordinates ''q<sub>r</sub>''.\n\n==Extensions to classical field theory==\n\n;[[Lagrangian field theory]]\n\nGeneralized coordinates apply to discrete particles. For ''N'' [[scalar field]]s ''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>''('''r''', ''t'') where ''i'' = 1, 2, ... ''N'', the '''[[Lagrangian density]]''' is a function of these fields and their space and time derivatives, and possibly the space and time coordinates themselves:\n\n<math>\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}(\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots \\nabla\\phi_1, \\nabla\\phi_2, \\ldots \\partial\\phi_1/\\partial t, \\partial\\phi_2/\\partial t, \\ldots  \\mathbf{r}, t)\\,.</math>\n\nand the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations have an analogue for fields:\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial(\\partial_\\mu \\phi_i)}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\phi_i}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere ''\u2202<sub>\u03bc</sub>'' denotes the [[4-gradient]] and the [[summation convention]] has been used. For ''N'' scalar fields, these Lagrangian field equations are a set of ''N'' second order partial differential equations in the fields, which in general will be coupled and nonlinear.\n\nThis scalar field formulation can be extended to [[vector field]]s, [[tensor field]]s, and [[spinor field]]s.\n\nThe Lagrangian is the [[volume integral]] of the Lagrangian density:<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/><ref>Gravitation, J.A. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne, W.H. Freeman & Co, 1973, {{ISBN|0-7167-0344-0}}</ref>\n\n:<math>L = \\int_\\mathcal{V} \\mathcal{L} \\, dV \\,.</math>\n\nOriginally developed for classical fields, the above formulation is applicable to all physical fields in classical, quantum, and relativistic situations: such as [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian gravity]], [[classical electromagnetism]], [[general relativity]], and [[quantum field theory]]. It is a question of determining the correct Lagrangian density to generate the correct field equation.\n\n;[[Hamiltonian field theory]]\n\nThe corresponding \"momentum\" field densities conjugate to the ''N'' scalar fields ''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>''('''r''', ''t'') are:<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\n:<math>\\pi_i(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}_i}\\,\\quad\\dot{\\phi}_i\\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\phi_i}{\\partial t}.</math>\n\nwhere in this context the overdot denotes a partial time derivative, not a total time derivative. The '''Hamiltonian density''' <math>\\mathcal{H}</math> is defined by analogy with mechanics:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H}(\\phi_1, \\phi_2,\\ldots, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\ldots,\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\dot{\\phi}_i(\\mathbf{r},t)\\pi_i(\\mathbf{r},t) - \\mathcal{L}\\,.</math>\n\nThe equations of motion are:\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\phi}_i = +\\frac{\\delta\\mathcal{H}}{\\delta \\pi_i}\\,,\\quad \\dot{\\pi}_i = - \\frac{\\delta\\mathcal{H}}{\\delta \\phi_i} \\,, </math>\n\nwhere the [[variational derivative]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\phi_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi_i} - \\partial_\\mu \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial (\\partial_\\mu \\phi_i)} </math>\n\nmust be used instead of merely partial derivatives. For ''N'' fields, these Hamiltonian field equations are a set of 2''N'' first order partial differential equations, which in general will be coupled and nonlinear.\n\nAgain, the volume integral of the Hamiltonian density is the Hamiltonian\n\n:<math>H = \\int_\\mathcal{V} \\mathcal{H} \\, dV \\,.</math>\n\n==Symmetry, conservation, and Noether's theorem==\n\n;[[symmetry (physics)|Symmetry transformations]] in classical space and time\n\nEach transformation can be described by an operator (i.e. function acting on the position '''r''' or momentum '''p''' variables to change them).
