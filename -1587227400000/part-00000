Schiavone,Louis J. Scerri,Maltese Biographies Of The Twentieth Century, Page 421, Malta 1997</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBorn on 20 September 1885 in [[Valletta]], Enrico Mizzi was the son of Maria Sofia (Marie Sophie) Folliero de Luna, daughter of the vice-consul of [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Naples]],<ref>[http://www.genmarenostrum.com/pagine-lettere/letteraf/folliero.htm Gen Mare Nostrum]</ref> and of [[Fortunato Mizzi]], a pro-Italian Maltese politician, founder of the ''Partit Anti-Riformista''. His mother died in 1903 and his father in 1905, when Enrico was only 17 and 19 respectively. \n\nEnrico studied in the Gozo seminary, and read law at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] and at the [[University of Urbino]]. He graduated in literature and science at the [[University of Malta|Royal University of Malta]] in 1906, and in Law at Urbino in 1911.\n\nIn 1926 Enrico Mizzi married Bice Vassallo; they had one son, Fortunat Mizzi (1927-2017),<ref name=bio/> who became a priest in 1952 and founded the [[Moviment Azzjoni Socjali (MAS)]] in 1955<ref>Michael J. Schiavone, Louis J. Scerri,Maltese Biographies Of The Twentieth Century,Page 416, Malta 1997 </ref>.\n\n==Politics==\nDespite completing his legal studies in Rome, Mizzi had little chance to practice law. He was drawn instead to politics and journalism. \nIn 1915 Enrico Mizzi was elected member of the ''Comitato Patriottico Maltese'' and founded the newspaper ''L'Eco di Malta'', organ of the Committee itself.\n\nHe stood as a parliamentary candidate for Gozo in 1915, and was successfully elected. <ref name=bio/> He worked tirelessly to develop a Constitution that was independent of English rule at the time.\n\nIn 1916 he was arrested and sentenced to a year in prison for proclaiming himself a representative of the Italian nationality of Malta - his sentence was reduced to a reprimand by the Governor of the time due to suspected interference. In May 1917 he was arrested and court-martialled for sedition during wartime, found guilty of all charges and imprisoned for a year. Although this sentence was again reduced, he lost his right to practice law in the country.<ref name=rudolf>{{cite book |last1=Rudolf |first1=Uwe Jens |title=Historical dictionary of Malta |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |isbn=9781538119174 |edition=Third}}</ref>\n \n=== Leader of the Partit Nazzjonalista ===\nAfter the end of the First World War, Mizzi was part of the large and moderate coalition called the [[Maltese Political Union]] (''Unjoni Politika Maltija'', UPM), led by [[Ugo Pasquale Mifsud]]. It splintered from it, together with the more extremist and pro-Italian current, to form the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Malta, 1921\u201326)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] (''Partit Demokratiku Nazzjonalista'', PDN), led by Mizzi.\n\nThe two movements participated separately in the [[1921 Maltese general election]], but adopted a form of desistance so as not to damage each other; the PDN elected 4 MPs from Gozo.<ref>Remig Sacco, L-Elezzjonijiet Generali 1849-1986, Page 64, Malta 1986</ref> \n\nUPM and PDN run once again separately, albeit in coalition, in the [[1924 Maltese general election|1924 elections]]. \nAfter the elections of 1924, Mizzi's party formed a government in coaltion with the Unione Politica Maltese and they elected 15 parliamentary seats.

As a result, the U.S. GDP per capita converged on and eventually surpassed that of the UK, as well as other nations that it previously trailed economically. The economy maintained high wages, attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn the early 1800s, the United States was largely agricultural with more than 80 percent of the population in farming. Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of transformation of raw materials with lumber and saw mills, textiles and boots and shoes leading the way. The rich resource endowments contributed to the rapid economic expansion during the nineteenth century. Ample land availability allowed the number of farmers to keep growing, but activity in manufacturing, services, transportation and other sectors grew at a much faster pace. Thus, by 1860 the share of the farm population in the U.S. had fallen from over 80 percent to roughly 50 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Many firms grew large by taking advantage of economies of scale and better communication to run nationwide operations. Concentration in these industries raised fears of monopoly that would drive prices higher and output lower, but many of these firms were cutting costs so fast that trends were towards lower price and more output in these industries. Lots of workers shared the success of these large firms, which typically offered the highest wages in the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s. From the [[New Deal]] era that began in 1933, to the [[Great Society]] initiatives of the 1960s, national policy makers relied principally on [[fiscal policy]] to influence the economy.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[File:B-24 Liberator Consolidated-Vultee Plant, Fort Worth Texas.jpg|thumb|[[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s at the Consolidated-Vultee Plant, [[Fort Worth, Texas]], 1943]]\nDuring the world wars of the twentieth century, the United States fared better than the rest of the combatants because none of the First World War and relatively little of the Second World War was fought on American territory (and none on the then 48 states). Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military, paid half wages, and roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Homeowners were borrowing against their bubble-priced homes to fuel consumption, driving up their debt levels while providing an unsustainable boost to GDP.

The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], 62 million lower-income persons via [[Medicaid]], and 15 million military veterans via the [[Veteran's Administration]]. About 178 million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]] or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.<ref name=\"Census2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=census.gov}}</ref>\n\nMultiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016 due to expanded [[Medicaid]] eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as the \"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\". According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65 population) who were without health insurance. Following the implementation of major ACA provisions in 2013, this figure fell by 18.3 million or 40%, to 27.3 million by 2016 or 8.6% of the under-65 population.<ref name=\"Census_HistTable\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html|title=Health Insurance Historical Tables \u2013HIC Series|first=US Census|last=Bureau|publisher=Census}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun to reverse. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] estimated in May 2018 that the number of uninsured increased by 4 million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income adults. Regionally, the South and West had higher uninsured rates than the North and East.

Regulation falls into two general categories.\n\nSome efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated [[monopoly|monopolies]] such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries\u2014trucking and, later, airlines\u2014successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called [[regulatory capture]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Regulation and Control in the U.S. Economy: About.com</ref>\n\nAnother form of economic regulation, [[Competition law|antitrust law]], seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government\u2014and, sometimes, private parties\u2014have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Bank regulation in the United States]] is highly fragmented compared to other [[Group of Ten (economic)|G10]] countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.\n\nSince the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] provides and enforces standards for workplace safety, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides standards and regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards of disclosure for food products.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAmerican attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally favored economic [[deregulation]] during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with [[free enterprise]], increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhere legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly.

When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted black Americans from [[Southern United States|southern]] farms in the first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].\n\nIn the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of [[mass production]], corporations, such as [[General Electric]], have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the [[stock market]], American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of [[globalization]], American investors and corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the [[Hoover Dam]]), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.\n\n===Aging===\nThe U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/sunday-review/work-age-economy.html?|title=This Economy Is Not Aging Gracefully |last=Porter |first=Eduardo |date=June 15, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages.

However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1,799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1,005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the state of California, which alone concentrates 28% of U.S. research.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America.

Other countries are given for comparison. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030]]\nThe United States of America invests more funds in research and development (R&D) in absolute terms than the other G7 nations combined: 17.2% more in 2012. Since 2000, gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in the USA has increased by 31.2%, enabling it to maintain its share of GERD among the G7 nations at 54.0% (54.2% in 2000).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Impact of recession on research spending ===\nGenerally speaking, U.S. investment in R&D rose with the economy in the first years of the century before receding slightly during the economic recession then rising again as growth resumed. At its peak in 2009, GERD amounted to US$ 406 billion (2.82% of GDP). Despite the recession, it was still at 2.79% in 2012 and will slide only marginally to 2.73% in 2013, according to provisional data, and should remain at a similar level in 2014.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe federal government is the primary funder of basic research, at 52.6% in 2012; state governments, universities and other non-profits funded 26%. Experimental development, on the other hand, is primarily funded by industry: 76.4% to the federal government's 22.1% in 2012.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:World shares of GDP, GERD, researchers and publications for the G20, 2009 and 2013.svg|thumb|World shares of GDP, research spending, researchers and scientific publications, 2009 and 2013.

American supremacy is eroding in this respect, even as other nations\u2014China, in particular\u2014are carrying their own investment in R&D to new heights. Between 2009 and 2012, the United States' world share of research expenditure receded slightly from 30.5% to 28.1%. Several countries now devote more than 4% of GDP to R&D (Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea) and others plan to raise their own GERD/GDP ratio to 4% by 2020 (Finland and Sweden).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Business spending on research ===\nBusiness enterprises contributed 59.1 % of U.S. GERD in 2012, down from 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute a small fraction of total R&D, 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:R&D budget by US agency, 1994\u20132014.svg|thumb|US research and development budget by government agency, 1994\u20132014.

The economic recession of 2008\u20132009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of business 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1\u20132% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending were in agriculture production: \u22123.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R&D had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending at the state level ===\n{{See also|List of U.S. states by research and development spending}}\nThe level of research spending varies considerably from one state to another. Six states (New Mexico, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, California and Michigan) each devoted 3.9% or more of their GDP to R&D in 2010, together contributing 42% of national research expenditure. In 2010, more than one quarter of R&D was concentrated in California (28.1%), ahead of Massachusetts (5.7%), New Jersey (5.6%), Washington State (5.5%), Michigan (5.4%), Texas (5.2%), Illinois (4.8%), New York (3.6%) and Pennsylvania (3.5%). Seven states (Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Dakota and Wyoming) devoted less than 0.8% of GDP to R&D.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Science and engineering in the USA by state, 2010.svg|thumb|Science and engineering in the United States of America by state. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.6, based on data from American Association for the Advancement of Science]]\nCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley, the name given to the area hosting the leading corporations and start-ups in information technology. This state also hosts dynamic biotechnology clusters in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. The main biotechnology clusters outside California are the cities of Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, Maryland, suburban Washington, DC, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Chicago. California supplies 13.7% of all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business focus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route 128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are located in the state of Michigan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending by multinational corporations ===\nThe federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage them to engage in research and development (R&D). Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Google. Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the first time in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Global top 50 companies by R&D volume and intensity, 2014'''\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> R&D intensity is defined as R&D expenditure divided by net sales.\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Although incorporated in the Netherlands, Airbus's principal manufacturing facilities are located in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nSource: ''UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030'' (2015), Table 9.3, based on Hern\u00e1ndez ''et. al'' (2014) ''EU R&D Scoreboard: the 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard''.

Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere. Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.\n\nThe United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Notable companies and markets==\n{{See also|Forbes 500|Fortune 500}}\n[[File:Walmart exterior.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Walmart discount department store (location: [[Laredo, Texas]]).]]\nIn 2011, the 20 [[List of companies by revenue|largest U.S.-based companies by revenue]] were [[Walmart]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Fannie Mae]], [[General Electric]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Cargill]], [[McKesson Corporation]], [[Bank of America]], [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Verizon]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and [[Cardinal Health]].\n\nIn 2013, eight of the world's ten [[List of corporations by market capitalization|largest companies by market capitalization]] were American: [[Apple Inc.]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Walmart]], [[General Electric]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], and [[Chevron Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/indepth/ft500|title=FT 500 2013|work=ft.com}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Fortune Global 500]] 2011, the [[List of largest employers|ten largest U.S. employers]] were [[Walmart]], [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[McDonald's]], [[Target Corporation]], [[Kroger]], [[The Home Depot]], [[General Electric]], and [[Sears Holdings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/2011/|title=Global 500 |work=Fortune}}</ref>\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Microsoft]] are the world's five most valuable brands in an index published by Millward Brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509|title=Apple usurps Google as world's most valuable brand|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\nA 2012 Deloitte report published in ''STORES'' magazine indicated that of the world's top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010, 32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32% accounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.<ref>Deloitte, ''Switching Channels: Global Powers of Retailing 2012'', ''STORES'', January 2012, G20.</ref>\n[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] is the world's largest online retailer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2013/07/24/alibaba-a-threat-to-amazon-ebay-walmart-and-everyone-else/ |title=Alibaba Is A Threat To Amazon, eBay, Walmart And Everyone Else |magazine=Forbes.com |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |first=Walter |last=Loeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/04/23/wal-mart-vs-amazon-worlds-biggest-e-commerce-battle-could-boil-down-to-vegetables/ |title=Wal-Mart Vs.

As a result, the U.S. GDP per capita converged on and eventually surpassed that of the UK, as well as other nations that it previously trailed economically. The economy maintained high wages, attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn the early 1800s, the United States was largely agricultural with more than 80 percent of the population in farming. Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of transformation of raw materials with lumber and saw mills, textiles and boots and shoes leading the way. The rich resource endowments contributed to the rapid economic expansion during the nineteenth century. Ample land availability allowed the number of farmers to keep growing, but activity in manufacturing, services, transportation and other sectors grew at a much faster pace.

Many firms grew large by taking advantage of economies of scale and better communication to run nationwide operations. Concentration in these industries raised fears of monopoly that would drive prices higher and output lower, but many of these firms were cutting costs so fast that trends were towards lower price and more output in these industries.

Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s. From the [[New Deal]] era that began in 1933, to the [[Great Society]] initiatives of the 1960s, national policy makers relied principally on [[fiscal policy]] to influence the economy.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[File:B-24 Liberator Consolidated-Vultee Plant, Fort Worth Texas.jpg|thumb|[[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s at the Consolidated-Vultee Plant, [[Fort Worth, Texas]], 1943]]\nDuring the world wars of the twentieth century, the United States fared better than the rest of the combatants because none of the First World War and relatively little of the Second World War was fought on American territory (and none on the then 48 states). Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military, paid half wages, and roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], 62 million lower-income persons via [[Medicaid]], and 15 million military veterans via the [[Veteran's Administration]]. About 178 million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]] or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.<ref name=\"Census2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=census.gov}}</ref>\n\nMultiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016 due to expanded [[Medicaid]] eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as the \"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\". According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65 population) who were without health insurance. Following the implementation of major ACA provisions in 2013, this figure fell by 18.3 million or 40%, to 27.3 million by 2016 or 8.6% of the under-65 population.<ref name=\"Census_HistTable\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html|title=Health Insurance Historical Tables \u2013HIC Series|first=US Census|last=Bureau|publisher=Census}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun to reverse. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] estimated in May 2018 that the number of uninsured increased by 4 million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income adults. Regionally, the South and West had higher uninsured rates than the North and East.

Regulation falls into two general categories.\n\nSome efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated [[monopoly|monopolies]] such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries\u2014trucking and, later, airlines\u2014successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called [[regulatory capture]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Regulation and Control in the U.S. Economy: About.com</ref>\n\nAnother form of economic regulation, [[Competition law|antitrust law]], seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government\u2014and, sometimes, private parties\u2014have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Bank regulation in the United States]] is highly fragmented compared to other [[Group of Ten (economic)|G10]] countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.\n\nSince the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] provides and enforces standards for workplace safety, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides standards and regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards of disclosure for food products.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAmerican attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhile leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally favored economic [[deregulation]] during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with [[free enterprise]], increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhere legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly.

When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted black Americans from [[Southern United States|southern]] farms in the first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].\n\nIn the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of [[mass production]], corporations, such as [[General Electric]], have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the [[stock market]], American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of [[globalization]], American investors and corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the [[Hoover Dam]]), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.\n\n===Aging===\nThe U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/sunday-review/work-age-economy.html?|title=This Economy Is Not Aging Gracefully |last=Porter |first=Eduardo |date=June 15, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages.

However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1,799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1,005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the state of California, which alone concentrates 28% of U.S. research.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America.

Other countries are given for comparison. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030]]\nThe United States of America invests more funds in research and development (R&D) in absolute terms than the other G7 nations combined: 17.2% more in 2012. Since 2000, gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in the USA has increased by 31.2%, enabling it to maintain its share of GERD among the G7 nations at 54.0% (54.2% in 2000).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Impact of recession on research spending ===\nGenerally speaking, U.S. investment in R&D rose with the economy in the first years of the century before receding slightly during the economic recession then rising again as growth resumed. At its peak in 2009, GERD amounted to US$ 406 billion (2.82% of GDP). Despite the recession, it was still at 2.79% in 2012 and will slide only marginally to 2.73% in 2013, according to provisional data, and should remain at a similar level in 2014.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe federal government is the primary funder of basic research, at 52.6% in 2012; state governments, universities and other non-profits funded 26%. Experimental development, on the other hand, is primarily funded by industry: 76.4% to the federal government's 22.1% in 2012.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:World shares of GDP, GERD, researchers and publications for the G20, 2009 and 2013.svg|thumb|World shares of GDP, research spending, researchers and scientific publications, 2009 and 2013.

American supremacy is eroding in this respect, even as other nations\u2014China, in particular\u2014are carrying their own investment in R&D to new heights. Between 2009 and 2012, the United States' world share of research expenditure receded slightly from 30.5% to 28.1%. Several countries now devote more than 4% of GDP to R&D (Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea) and others plan to raise their own GERD/GDP ratio to 4% by 2020 (Finland and Sweden).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Business spending on research ===\nBusiness enterprises contributed 59.1 % of U.S. GERD in 2012, down from 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute a small fraction of total R&D, 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[File:R&D budget by US agency, 1994\u20132014.svg|thumb|US research and development budget by government agency, 1994\u20132014.

The economic recession of 2008\u20132009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of business 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1\u20132% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending were in agriculture production: \u22123.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R&D had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending at the state level ===\n{{See also|List of U.S. states by research and development spending}}\nThe level of research spending varies considerably from one state to another. Six states (New Mexico, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, California and Michigan) each devoted 3.9% or more of their GDP to R&D in 2010, together contributing 42% of national research expenditure. In 2010, more than one quarter of R&D was concentrated in California (28.1%), ahead of Massachusetts (5.7%), New Jersey (5.6%), Washington State (5.5%), Michigan (5.4%), Texas (5.2%), Illinois (4.8%), New York (3.6%) and Pennsylvania (3.5%). Seven states (Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Dakota and Wyoming) devoted less than 0.8% of GDP to R&D.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Science and engineering in the USA by state, 2010.svg|thumb|Science and engineering in the United States of America by state. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.6, based on data from American Association for the Advancement of Science]]\nCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley, the name given to the area hosting the leading corporations and start-ups in information technology. This state also hosts dynamic biotechnology clusters in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. The main biotechnology clusters outside California are the cities of Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, Maryland, suburban Washington, DC, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Chicago. California supplies 13.7% of all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business focus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route 128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are located in the state of Michigan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Research spending by multinational corporations ===\nThe federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage them to engage in research and development (R&D). Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Google. Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the first time in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Global top 50 companies by R&D volume and intensity, 2014'''\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> R&D intensity is defined as R&D expenditure divided by net sales.\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Although incorporated in the Netherlands, Airbus's principal manufacturing facilities are located in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\nSource: ''UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030'' (2015), Table 9.3, based on Hern\u00e1ndez ''et. al'' (2014) ''EU R&D Scoreboard: the 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard''.

Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere. Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.\n\nThe United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Notable companies and markets==\n{{See also|Forbes 500|Fortune 500}}\n[[File:Walmart exterior.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Walmart discount department store (location: [[Laredo, Texas]]).]]\nIn 2011, the 20 [[List of companies by revenue|largest U.S.-based companies by revenue]] were [[Walmart]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Fannie Mae]], [[General Electric]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Cargill]], [[McKesson Corporation]], [[Bank of America]], [[Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Verizon]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and [[Cardinal Health]].\n\nIn 2013, eight of the world's ten [[List of corporations by market capitalization|largest companies by market capitalization]] were American: [[Apple Inc.]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Walmart]], [[General Electric]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], and [[Chevron Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/indepth/ft500|title=FT 500 2013|work=ft.com}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Fortune Global 500]] 2011, the [[List of largest employers|ten largest U.S. employers]] were [[Walmart]], [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[McDonald's]], [[Target Corporation]], [[Kroger]], [[The Home Depot]], [[General Electric]], and [[Sears Holdings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/2011/|title=Global 500 |work=Fortune}}</ref>\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Microsoft]] are the world's five most valuable brands in an index published by Millward Brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509|title=Apple usurps Google as world's most valuable brand|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\nA 2012 Deloitte report published in ''STORES'' magazine indicated that of the world's top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010, 32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32% accounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.<ref>Deloitte, ''Switching Channels: Global Powers of Retailing 2012'', ''STORES'', January 2012, G20.</ref>\n[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] is the world's largest online retailer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2013/07/24/alibaba-a-threat-to-amazon-ebay-walmart-and-everyone-else/ |title=Alibaba Is A Threat To Amazon, eBay, Walmart And Everyone Else |magazine=Forbes.com |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |first=Walter |last=Loeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/04/23/wal-mart-vs-amazon-worlds-biggest-e-commerce-battle-could-boil-down-to-vegetables/ |title=Wal-Mart Vs.

The character was introduced by executive producer [[Leonard Lewis]] and appeared initially from 1993 to 1999, when Palmer opted to leave. In 2002 executive producer [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] brought the character back for a special spin-off show. She returned to ''EastEnders'' as a full-time character in April 2008, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]]. Palmer took maternity leave in 2010 and Bianca left the series in January 2011. The character returned in December 2011 after Palmer signed a \"working mums\" contract, which granted her leave from the soap between April and November 2012. The actress quit ''EastEnders'' in 2014 and Bianca departed in September that year. Palmer reprised the role in 2019 and 2020 for two respective guest stints.\n\nDuring her first run on the show during the 1990s, she was known for her bizarre sense of style, her sharp tongue, fiery temper and for screaming \"Rickaaaaaaay!\"<ref>\"{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7068667.stm|title=Owen to join Palmer in EastEnders|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> at her husband. Bianca has been featured in storylines including affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, spina bifida and abortion; two problematic marriages to [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) \u2013 the first of which ended after it transpired that she had a previous affair with her mother's boyfriend [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]); her troubled and dysfunctional reconciliation with her estranged biological father [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]); her friendship with [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]); discovering her 15-year-old stepdaughter, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), is being sexually abused by her finac\u00e9, [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), and his subsequent arrest for paedophilia; and forming a relationship with [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n===1993\u20131999===\nBianca arrives with her family, mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), Carol's partner [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]), and her half-siblings [[Robbie Jackson]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) and [[Billie Jackson]] ([[Devon Anderson]]).  She initially works at her uncle [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) fish and chip shop before becoming the market assistant of [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay Kapoor]] ([[Deepak Verma]]). Later she runs her own clothing stall on Bridge Street market. Bianca has a short relationship with an older man, [[Richard Cole (EastEnders)|Richard Cole]] ([[Ian Reddington]]), but he swiftly dumps her when he grows bored and Bianca gets revenge by harassing him with [[prank]]s and stealing his credit card.<ref name=\"20years\"/> [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) then enjoys mutual flirtation with Bianca until Carol informs David that Bianca is his daughter. Horrified, David promptly keeps his distance, and Bianca remains unaware of their biological relationship.<ref name=\"who\"/> Bianca enters into a relationship with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and they move into a bedsit together. Bianca spends much time clubbing with her childhood friend [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]) and Ricky starts an affair with Bianca's other childhood friend [[Natalie Evans|Natalie Price]] ([[Lucy Speed]]). When Bianca discovers the affair, she breaks up with Ricky and drives Natalie from Walford. One night an intoxicated Bianca is nearly assaulted. She is rescued by David and when she tries to kiss him, he confesses that he is her father. Bianca is left stunned and humiliated. Initially she feels hostile and resentful over David's absence for the majority of her life. Eventually, Bianca has a change of heart and comes to accept David as her father, becoming keen to bond with him. The relationship is further complicated, when during July 1995 David confides in the Samaritans charity (unbeknownst to any of his family) that he still feels sexually attracted to Bianca despite the knowledge that he is her biological father. A case of [[Genetic Sexual Attraction|GSA]], this was one of ''EastEnders''{{'}} most controversial and daring storylines at this point in the show's history. There is further tension when Bianca makes David uncomfortable by reconciling with and dating his stepbrother Ricky again. Bianca is confused by David's unexplained strange and occasionally hostile behaviour. David never admits to Bianca the truth behind his initial feelings towards her, but she and David eventually bond naturally as a father and daughter.<ref name=\"20years\"/>\n\nRicky and Bianca reunite and get engaged but she has sex with [[Lenny Wallace]] ([[Des Coleman]]), but soon regrets it when she fears she is pregnant by him. It's a false alarm, but she realises how much Ricky means to her, so she marries him. She becomes pregnant, but a prenatal scan shows her unborn child has spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Distraught, Bianca has an abortion, which strains her marriage. Ricky learns of her infidelity with Lenny after a [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]] scare. Ricky considers ending their marriage, but Bianca convinces him to give her another chance and she becomes pregnant again. She gives birth to baby [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] on Christmas Day in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], helped by her enemy [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), her best friend Tiffany's volatile husband. Carol returns to [[Albert Square]] with her new fianc\u00e9 [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]), unaware that Bianca had a past relationship with him when she was underage (although Dan was unaware of this fact). Bianca and Dan rekindle their affair behind Carol and Ricky's backs, until Carol discovers she is pregnant by Dan. Bianca and Ricky plan to move to [[Manchester]] so Bianca can attend fashion college there. After finding an old photo of Bianca and Dan together, Carol demands to know their history. Dan tells Carol they had a romance years ago and swears on his unborn child's life that it's all over, but Bianca confesses when questioned and is disowned by Carol. Bianca leaves for Manchester after confessing to Ricky that she no longer loves him.<ref name=\"20years\"/>\n\n===\"Ricky & Bianca\"===\n\nIn the two-part special episode, \"[[Ricky & Bianca]]\", Ricky visits Bianca in Manchester in 2002, to discuss Liam. Bianca has been expelled from university and is working in a nightclub. Struggling to support Liam, Bianca gets caught up in a plan to steal \u00a350,000 from her drug-dealing boss, Vince. Ricky persuades her to return the money but Vince catches them and forces them to become his drug couriers. He sets them up, the dealers turn violent, and Bianca and Ricky narrowly escape when armed police raid the establishment. Fleeing, Ricky and Bianca spend the night together in a hotel room and decide to reunite. Ricky breaks the news to his fianc\u00e9e Cassie, who refuses to let him go and tries to convince Bianca that she'll be bored with Ricky and to give Ricky custody of Liam. Bianca decides that this is right, and Ricky looks on heartbroken as she hitches a ride in a car and departs for a destination unknown.<ref name=\"r&b\">{{cite episode |title=EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca|series=EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=13 May 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Off-screen events (2002\u20132008)===\n\nOff-screen, unbeknownst to Ricky, Bianca is pregnant. She starts a relationship with trucker Nathan Dean, who believes her unborn child is his. Bianca acts as stepmother to Nathan's daughter [[Whitney Dean|Whitney]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), but Nathan is killed in a traffic accident. Bianca becomes Whitney's guardian and gives birth to a daughter, [[Tiffany Butcher|Tiffany]] ([[Maisie Smith]]), named after her deceased best friend, but struggles financially. She becomes pregnant again during a brief relationship with [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]). Bianca meets [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), who supports her through her pregnancy and adopts Ray's son, [[Morgan Butcher|Morgan Jackson-King]] (Devon Higgs), when he is born. Tony appears to be a good father figure to her children; however, he is a paedophile. Tony [[Child grooming|grooms]] a 12-year-old Whitney and they begin a sexual relationship. After giving birth to Morgan, Liam returns to live with Bianca when Ricky begins dating a woman named [[Melinda (EastEnders)|Melinda]] ([[Siobhan Hayes]]), who does not like children. Tony and Whitney's relationship continues secretly until Tony is imprisoned for assaulting a boy who propositions Whitney.\n\n===2008\u20132014===\n\nBianca is evicted from her home and her children are taken into care. Bianca moves in with her grandmother [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) in Walford and with Ricky's help, she gets her children back and a waitress job. She rebuffs Ricky's declaration of love, deciding to stand by imprisoned lover Tony. When he is released, Tony resumes his affair with Whitney while Bianca wants to set a date for their wedding. He eventually agrees after winding down his affair with Whitney, to whom he is no longer attracted. Whitney tells Bianca about their relationship, just as she thinks that she and Tony will run away together. There is a massive row and Tony leaves but he is arrested by the police on suspicion of rape of a minor. Bianca and Whitney's relationship is tested while they deal with what has happened but they eventually bond again and Bianca supports Whitney through Tony's trial.\n\nA [[DNA paternity testing|DNA paternity test]], confirms that Ricky is Tiffany's father. Bianca slowly realises she is in love with him, but her attempt to rekindle their romance is ruined when Ricky announces his engagement to [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Knowing Sam is evading a prison sentence, Bianca reports her whereabouts and Sam is arrested. A rift forms between Bianca and Ricky when the truth is revealed. However, Bianca's discovery that Sam is cheating on Ricky ends the engagement and Bianca and Ricky reunite, when Ricky accepts her marriage proposal. The couple remarry. During the ceremony, Carol arrives and brawls with Bianca but they settle their differences and begin to rebuild their relationship. When Bianca's younger brother, Billie, dies from [[alcohol poisoning]], Carol is distraught. She is comforted by Billie's friend, [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]), and they begin an affair, while Connor is also dating Whitney. Bianca vows to remove Connor from her family's life and attacks Connor, leaving him hospitalised and eventually turns herself in to the police, refusing bail. She is sentenced to six months imprisonment. Bianca is released for Christmas and is devastated when Pat dies from [[pancreatic cancer]]. When Bianca discovers Ricky had sex with [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) in her absence, they separate and he leaves Walford. Bianca struggles as a single parent and gets into debt. Owing money, Bianca steals from a market trader in desperation, but she is caught and sent back to prison. In prison, she passes a hair and beauty course and on her release, is offered a trial at [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Cross]]' ([[Jo Joyner]]) salon. However, Bianca struggles to cope and breaks down when she is alone.\n\nBianca and [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) form a friendship and set up a market stall together. Liam plays truant from school and Bianca worries when the police tell her she may face prison again if Liam does not return. Bianca discovers that Liam is involved in a mugging and that he has some dubious new friends. When Liam does not come home, she goes to an estate to confront the gang and collect Liam  but he decides to stay with the gang and when he does come home, Bianca locks him in his room to stop him seeing the gang. She seeks advice from [[Ava Hartman]] ([[Clare Perkins]]), whose son [[Dexter Hartman|Dexter]] (Khali Best) used to be in a gang. Liam returns to the gang and eventually they are arrested and released on police bail. They blame Liam and he is stabbed but is not seriously injured. When Bianca lets Liam stay at home alone, Kane sneaks in and invites Liam back to the gang. Bianca finds them as Kane is attacking Liam and attacks Kane; he is arrested. Bianca allows Liam to stay with his father. When Bianca, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) break into Ian's restaurant, Shirley accidentally starts a fire. Bianca worries that she could go back to prison, and tells Whitney, who has been blamed for it. Jean tells Ian what happened and Ian agrees not to involve the police on the condition that Tiffany and Bobby are no longer friends.\n\nWhen Carol sees that Bianca is still interested in fashion, she arranges for her to attend a course in Manchester. During this time Bianca's father, David, returns and moves in. When Bianca returns, she surprises her family by announcing that her new boyfriend, [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]), and his children, [[TJ Spraggan]] (George Sargeant) and [[Rosie Spraggan]] (Jerzey Swingler), are moving in. Bianca is devastated when Carol learns that she has [[breast cancer]]. Carol and David get engaged and Bianca learns that she has not inherited Carol's faulty cancer gene and supports her mother throughout her cancer. She ends her relationship with Terry due to the jealousy of his former wife, [[Nikki Spraggan]] (Rachel Wilde), and David leaves before marrying Carol. Bianca and Terry continue their relationship in secret and she learns that he is planning to move out of London. Terry and Bianca reunite, and at the last minute, Bianca gives Liam and Whitney her blessing to stay with Carol before taking Tiffany and Morgan to live in [[Milton Keynes]].\n\nThe following year, Robbie moves with his son [[Sami Jackson]] (Shiven Shankar) to Milton Keynes near Bianca. Bianca is invited to Whitney's wedding to [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) the following year, however, she cannot attend and Tiffany and Morgan attend instead. Whitney later visits Bianca after her engagement to [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) ends. Months later, Bianca is informed that Abi has died, but cannot attend. When Tiffany returns to Walford, she reveals that Bianca has tried to kill herself, but later confesses that she is lying and actually feels neglected by Bianca and Terry; Bianca consequently agrees to Tiffany living with Whitney. When Tiffany becomes involved in a drug ring, Sonia informs Bianca, who is unable to return to help.\n\n=== 2019\u22122020 ===\nBianca returns to Walford for Whitney's wedding to [[Callum Highway]] (Tony Clay) and wakes up in a police cell with Kat after a night out. Bianca mentions she has recently been released from prison. When [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden) arrives at the venue and reveals the truth about his affair with Callum, Bianca threatens him. She then tries to discourage Whitney from marrying Callum but Whitney, albeit doubtful, is determined. Whilst at the wedding reception, Bianca witnesses a man giving Tiffany a kiss on the cheek and threatens him to stay away. She attempts to make amends with Tiffany, who is upset with her for her absence. When Bianca sees Whitney getting drunk at The Queen Vic, she suggests that she attends her honeymoon alone to take her mind off Callum. Bianca then arranges a spa day with Tiffany, and when she sees the man from the wedding again, she threatens him to stay away, revealing him to be Tony's son, [[Leo King (EastEnders)|Leo King]] (Tom Wells). Leo reveals that Bianca inherited his grandmother's money and threatens to hurt Whitney and Tiffany if Bianca does not give him the money. After spending time with Sonia and Robbie, Bianca leaves Walford for a holiday for Tiffany. Bianca later returns off-screen to console Whitney after she learns Leo, who she has been dating, is Tony's son.\n\n== Creation ==\n=== Background ===\nIn his book ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration'', ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] describes 1994 as a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April, a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them were the Jackson family, created by [[Tony McHale]]:<ref name=\"All of Me\" /> mother [[Carol Jackson|Carol]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), her four children, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), [[Robbie Jackson|Robbie]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), and [[Billie Jackson|Billie]] ([[Devon Anderson]]), as well as Carol's partner [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]). Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. It later transpired that [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) was Bianca's father.\n\nVarious members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of [[Albert Square]].

At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line \"I can't believe you just said that.\" The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition.

The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer [[Simon Ashdown]] and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to ''EastEnders''. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by an image of a woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering \"What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family\".<ref name=\"controversial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/13/eastenders.television|title=Dark days in Albert Square |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Aida |last=Edemariam|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> They pitched the idea to [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]], controller of BBC drama production, who said that \"It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most ''EastEnders'' stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\" However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk.<ref name=\"controversial\"/> Diederick Santer commented, \"We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show.\"<ref name=\"controversial\"/> It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although ''EastEnders'' had broached it in 2001 with [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and her abusive uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.<ref name=\"controversial\"/>\n\nYorke was initially unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He  commented to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008, \"My standpoint has always been that there has to be a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason.\"<ref name=\"controversial\"/> However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that \"it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform\".<ref name=\"controversial\"/> It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was \"a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas.\" ''EastEnders'' worked closely with [[NSPCC]] when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced \"sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust\". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases.<ref name=\"controversial\"/> The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+CRITIC%3a+Taking+on+big+issues.-a0190453951|title=Taking on big issues.|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=13 December 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, [[ChildLine]]. A ChildLine director, Julie Crossan, said, \"Child sex abuse storylines on programmes such as EastEnders also encourage children to speak out.

He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender. The males regarded Bianca as a \"saucy cow\", with implications of unacceptable assertiveness in women. They disliked that Ricky was pushed around by Bianca and treated as a subordinate by her friends. The author comments that \"such a relationship appears to these boys as the world turned upside down.\" Girls also viewed Bianca unfavourably in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"she can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri/page/144 144]|quote=eastenders bianca natalie.|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-20150-2}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote_box |width=35% |align=right|quote=\"Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game.

In 2002 executive producer [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] brought the character back for a special spin-off show. She returned to ''EastEnders'' as a full-time character in April 2008, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]]. Palmer took maternity leave in 2010 and Bianca left the series in January 2011. The character returned in December 2011 after Palmer signed a \"working mums\" contract, which granted her leave from the soap between April and November 2012. The actress quit ''EastEnders'' in 2014 and Bianca departed in September that year. Palmer reprised the role in 2019 and 2020 for two respective guest stints.\n\nDuring her first run on the show during the 1990s, she was known for her bizarre sense of style, her sharp tongue, fiery temper and for screaming \"Rickaaaaaaay!\"<ref>\"{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7068667.stm|title=Owen to join Palmer in EastEnders|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> at her husband. Bianca has been featured in storylines including affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, spina bifida and abortion; two problematic marriages to [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) \u2013 the first of which ended after it transpired that she had a previous affair with her mother's boyfriend [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]); her troubled and dysfunctional reconciliation with her estranged biological father [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]); her friendship with [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]); discovering her 15-year-old stepdaughter, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), is being sexually abused by her finac\u00e9, [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), and his subsequent arrest for paedophilia; and forming a relationship with [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n===1993\u20131999===\nBianca arrives with her family, mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), Carol's partner [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]), and her half-siblings [[Robbie Jackson]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) and [[Billie Jackson]] ([[Devon Anderson]]).  She initially works at her uncle [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) fish and chip shop before becoming the market assistant of [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay Kapoor]] ([[Deepak Verma]]). Later she runs her own clothing stall on Bridge Street market. Bianca has a short relationship with an older man, [[Richard Cole (EastEnders)|Richard Cole]] ([[Ian Reddington]]), but he swiftly dumps her when he grows bored and Bianca gets revenge by harassing him with [[prank]]s and stealing his credit card.<ref name=\"20years\"/> [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) then enjoys mutual flirtation with Bianca until Carol informs David that Bianca is his daughter. Horrified, David promptly keeps his distance, and Bianca remains unaware of their biological relationship.<ref name=\"who\"/> Bianca enters into a relationship with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and they move into a bedsit together. Bianca spends much time clubbing with her childhood friend [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]) and Ricky starts an affair with Bianca's other childhood friend [[Natalie Evans|Natalie Price]] ([[Lucy Speed]]). When Bianca discovers the affair, she breaks up with Ricky and drives Natalie from Walford. One night an intoxicated Bianca is nearly assaulted. She is rescued by David and when she tries to kiss him, he confesses that he is her father. Bianca is left stunned and humiliated. Initially she feels hostile and resentful over David's absence for the majority of her life. Eventually, Bianca has a change of heart and comes to accept David as her father, becoming keen to bond with him. The relationship is further complicated, when during July 1995 David confides in the Samaritans charity (unbeknownst to any of his family) that he still feels sexually attracted to Bianca despite the knowledge that he is her biological father. A case of [[Genetic Sexual Attraction|GSA]], this was one of ''EastEnders''{{'}} most controversial and daring storylines at this point in the show's history. There is further tension when Bianca makes David uncomfortable by reconciling with and dating his stepbrother Ricky again. Bianca is confused by David's unexplained strange and occasionally hostile behaviour. David never admits to Bianca the truth behind his initial feelings towards her, but she and David eventually bond naturally as a father and daughter.<ref name=\"20years\"/>\n\nRicky and Bianca reunite and get engaged but she has sex with [[Lenny Wallace]] ([[Des Coleman]]), but soon regrets it when she fears she is pregnant by him. It's a false alarm, but she realises how much Ricky means to her, so she marries him. She becomes pregnant, but a prenatal scan shows her unborn child has spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Distraught, Bianca has an abortion, which strains her marriage. Ricky learns of her infidelity with Lenny after a [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]] scare. Ricky considers ending their marriage, but Bianca convinces him to give her another chance and she becomes pregnant again. She gives birth to baby [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] on Christmas Day in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], helped by her enemy [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), her best friend Tiffany's volatile husband. Carol returns to [[Albert Square]] with her new fianc\u00e9 [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]), unaware that Bianca had a past relationship with him when she was underage (although Dan was unaware of this fact). Bianca and Dan rekindle their affair behind Carol and Ricky's backs, until Carol discovers she is pregnant by Dan. Bianca and Ricky plan to move to [[Manchester]] so Bianca can attend fashion college there. After finding an old photo of Bianca and Dan together, Carol demands to know their history. Dan tells Carol they had a romance years ago and swears on his unborn child's life that it's all over, but Bianca confesses when questioned and is disowned by Carol. Bianca leaves for Manchester after confessing to Ricky that she no longer loves him.<ref name=\"20years\"/>\n\n===\"Ricky & Bianca\"===\n\nIn the two-part special episode, \"[[Ricky & Bianca]]\", Ricky visits Bianca in Manchester in 2002, to discuss Liam. Bianca has been expelled from university and is working in a nightclub. Struggling to support Liam, Bianca gets caught up in a plan to steal \u00a350,000 from her drug-dealing boss, Vince. Ricky persuades her to return the money but Vince catches them and forces them to become his drug couriers. He sets them up, the dealers turn violent, and Bianca and Ricky narrowly escape when armed police raid the establishment. Fleeing, Ricky and Bianca spend the night together in a hotel room and decide to reunite. Ricky breaks the news to his fianc\u00e9e Cassie, who refuses to let him go and tries to convince Bianca that she'll be bored with Ricky and to give Ricky custody of Liam. Bianca decides that this is right, and Ricky looks on heartbroken as she hitches a ride in a car and departs for a destination unknown.<ref name=\"r&b\">{{cite episode |title=EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca|series=EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=13 May 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Off-screen events (2002\u20132008)===\n\nOff-screen, unbeknownst to Ricky, Bianca is pregnant.

Bianca becomes Whitney's guardian and gives birth to a daughter, [[Tiffany Butcher|Tiffany]] ([[Maisie Smith]]), named after her deceased best friend, but struggles financially.

Bianca meets [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), who supports her through her pregnancy and adopts Ray's son, [[Morgan Butcher|Morgan Jackson-King]] (Devon Higgs), when he is born. Tony appears to be a good father figure to her children; however, he is a paedophile. Tony [[Child grooming|grooms]] a 12-year-old Whitney and they begin a sexual relationship. After giving birth to Morgan, Liam returns to live with Bianca when Ricky begins dating a woman named [[Melinda (EastEnders)|Melinda]] ([[Siobhan Hayes]]), who does not like children. Tony and Whitney's relationship continues secretly until Tony is imprisoned for assaulting a boy who propositions Whitney.\n\n===2008\u20132014===\n\nBianca is evicted from her home and her children are taken into care. Bianca moves in with her grandmother [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) in Walford and with Ricky's help, she gets her children back and a waitress job. She rebuffs Ricky's declaration of love, deciding to stand by imprisoned lover Tony. When he is released, Tony resumes his affair with Whitney while Bianca wants to set a date for their wedding. He eventually agrees after winding down his affair with Whitney, to whom he is no longer attracted. Whitney tells Bianca about their relationship, just as she thinks that she and Tony will run away together. There is a massive row and Tony leaves but he is arrested by the police on suspicion of rape of a minor. Bianca and Whitney's relationship is tested while they deal with what has happened but they eventually bond again and Bianca supports Whitney through Tony's trial.\n\nA [[DNA paternity testing|DNA paternity test]], confirms that Ricky is Tiffany's father. Bianca slowly realises she is in love with him, but her attempt to rekindle their romance is ruined when Ricky announces his engagement to [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Knowing Sam is evading a prison sentence, Bianca reports her whereabouts and Sam is arrested. A rift forms between Bianca and Ricky when the truth is revealed. However, Bianca's discovery that Sam is cheating on Ricky ends the engagement and Bianca and Ricky reunite, when Ricky accepts her marriage proposal. The couple remarry. During the ceremony, Carol arrives and brawls with Bianca but they settle their differences and begin to rebuild their relationship. When Bianca's younger brother, Billie, dies from [[alcohol poisoning]], Carol is distraught. She is comforted by Billie's friend, [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]), and they begin an affair, while Connor is also dating Whitney. Bianca vows to remove Connor from her family's life and attacks Connor, leaving him hospitalised and eventually turns herself in to the police, refusing bail. She is sentenced to six months imprisonment. Bianca is released for Christmas and is devastated when Pat dies from [[pancreatic cancer]]. When Bianca discovers Ricky had sex with [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) in her absence, they separate and he leaves Walford. Bianca struggles as a single parent and gets into debt. Owing money, Bianca steals from a market trader in desperation, but she is caught and sent back to prison. In prison, she passes a hair and beauty course and on her release, is offered a trial at [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Cross]]' ([[Jo Joyner]]) salon. However, Bianca struggles to cope and breaks down when she is alone.\n\nBianca and [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) form a friendship and set up a market stall together. Liam plays truant from school and Bianca worries when the police tell her she may face prison again if Liam does not return. Bianca discovers that Liam is involved in a mugging and that he has some dubious new friends. When Liam does not come home, she goes to an estate to confront the gang and collect Liam  but he decides to stay with the gang and when he does come home, Bianca locks him in his room to stop him seeing the gang. She seeks advice from [[Ava Hartman]] ([[Clare Perkins]]), whose son [[Dexter Hartman|Dexter]] (Khali Best) used to be in a gang. Liam returns to the gang and eventually they are arrested and released on police bail. They blame Liam and he is stabbed but is not seriously injured. When Bianca lets Liam stay at home alone, Kane sneaks in and invites Liam back to the gang. Bianca finds them as Kane is attacking Liam and attacks Kane; he is arrested. Bianca allows Liam to stay with his father. When Bianca, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) break into Ian's restaurant, Shirley accidentally starts a fire. Bianca worries that she could go back to prison, and tells Whitney, who has been blamed for it. Jean tells Ian what happened and Ian agrees not to involve the police on the condition that Tiffany and Bobby are no longer friends.\n\nWhen Carol sees that Bianca is still interested in fashion, she arranges for her to attend a course in Manchester. During this time Bianca's father, David, returns and moves in. When Bianca returns, she surprises her family by announcing that her new boyfriend, [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]), and his children, [[TJ Spraggan]] (George Sargeant) and [[Rosie Spraggan]] (Jerzey Swingler), are moving in. Bianca is devastated when Carol learns that she has [[breast cancer]]. Carol and David get engaged and Bianca learns that she has not inherited Carol's faulty cancer gene and supports her mother throughout her cancer. She ends her relationship with Terry due to the jealousy of his former wife, [[Nikki Spraggan]] (Rachel Wilde), and David leaves before marrying Carol. Bianca and Terry continue their relationship in secret and she learns that he is planning to move out of London. Terry and Bianca reunite, and at the last minute, Bianca gives Liam and Whitney her blessing to stay with Carol before taking Tiffany and Morgan to live in [[Milton Keynes]].\n\nThe following year, Robbie moves with his son [[Sami Jackson]] (Shiven Shankar) to Milton Keynes near Bianca. Bianca is invited to Whitney's wedding to [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) the following year, however, she cannot attend and Tiffany and Morgan attend instead. Whitney later visits Bianca after her engagement to [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) ends. Months later, Bianca is informed that Abi has died, but cannot attend. When Tiffany returns to Walford, she reveals that Bianca has tried to kill herself, but later confesses that she is lying and actually feels neglected by Bianca and Terry; Bianca consequently agrees to Tiffany living with Whitney. When Tiffany becomes involved in a drug ring, Sonia informs Bianca, who is unable to return to help.\n\n=== 2019\u22122020 ===\nBianca returns to Walford for Whitney's wedding to [[Callum Highway]] (Tony Clay) and wakes up in a police cell with Kat after a night out. Bianca mentions she has recently been released from prison. When [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden) arrives at the venue and reveals the truth about his affair with Callum, Bianca threatens him. She then tries to discourage Whitney from marrying Callum but Whitney, albeit doubtful, is determined. Whilst at the wedding reception, Bianca witnesses a man giving Tiffany a kiss on the cheek and threatens him to stay away. She attempts to make amends with Tiffany, who is upset with her for her absence. When Bianca sees Whitney getting drunk at The Queen Vic, she suggests that she attends her honeymoon alone to take her mind off Callum. Bianca then arranges a spa day with Tiffany, and when she sees the man from the wedding again, she threatens him to stay away, revealing him to be Tony's son, [[Leo King (EastEnders)|Leo King]] (Tom Wells). Leo reveals that Bianca inherited his grandmother's money and threatens to hurt Whitney and Tiffany if Bianca does not give him the money. After spending time with Sonia and Robbie, Bianca leaves Walford for a holiday for Tiffany. Bianca later returns off-screen to console Whitney after she learns Leo, who she has been dating, is Tony's son.\n\n== Creation ==\n=== Background ===\nIn his book ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration'', ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] describes 1994 as a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April, a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them were the Jackson family, created by [[Tony McHale]]:<ref name=\"All of Me\" /> mother [[Carol Jackson|Carol]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), her four children, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), [[Robbie Jackson|Robbie]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), and [[Billie Jackson|Billie]] ([[Devon Anderson]]), as well as Carol's partner [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]). Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. It later transpired that [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) was Bianca's father.\n\nVarious members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of [[Albert Square]].

At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line \"I can't believe you just said that.\" The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition.

She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family\".<ref name=\"controversial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/13/eastenders.television|title=Dark days in Albert Square |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Aida |last=Edemariam|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> They pitched the idea to [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]], controller of BBC drama production, who said that \"It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most ''EastEnders'' stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\" However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk.<ref name=\"controversial\"/> Diederick Santer commented, \"We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show.\"<ref name=\"controversial\"/> It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although ''EastEnders'' had broached it in 2001 with [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and her abusive uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.<ref name=\"controversial\"/>\n\nYorke was initially unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He  commented to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008, \"My standpoint has always been that there has to be a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason.\"<ref name=\"controversial\"/> However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that \"it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform\".<ref name=\"controversial\"/> It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was \"a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas.\" ''EastEnders'' worked closely with [[NSPCC]] when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced \"sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust\". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases.<ref name=\"controversial\"/> The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+CRITIC%3a+Taking+on+big+issues.-a0190453951|title=Taking on big issues.|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=13 December 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, [[ChildLine]].

In 2000, she commented, \"[Bianca] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think.\"<ref name=\"life\"/> Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to ''EastEnders'', as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, \"It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [to ''EastEnders''] for everyone else's sake.\"<ref name=\"life\"/> When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the ''[[Birmingham Post|Birmingham Evening Post]]'' said \"Good riddance!\" She described Bianca as a \"king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain\" and a \"prize slapper [who] tormented all those whose paths [she] crossed.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60218751|title= Good riddance!; Bianca bows out of Albert Square in EastEnders tonight|work=[[Birmingham Post|Birmingham Evening Post]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] | date = 10 September 1999| accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Chris Barker carried out television research on post-transmission perspectives of [[British Asian]] teenage viewers of ''EastEnders'', using the character Bianca as one of the focus points. He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender. The males regarded Bianca as a \"saucy cow\", with implications of unacceptable assertiveness in women. They disliked that Ricky was pushed around by Bianca and treated as a subordinate by her friends. The author comments that \"such a relationship appears to these boys as the world turned upside down.\" Girls also viewed Bianca unfavourably in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"she can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri/page/144 144]|quote=eastenders bianca natalie.|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-20150-2}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote_box |width=35% |align=right|quote=\"Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game.
