A sequel album\u2014''[[Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music]]''\u2014was later released independently via the Internet, and limited quantities for the physical version.\n\nAs with its predecessor, ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]'', ''Machina'' represented a drastic image and sound change for the band that failed to reconnect them with chart-topping success. However, after the relatively brief ''Adore'' tour, the new line-up with Chamberlin and the former [[Hole (band)|Hole]] bass guitarist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] mounted longer international tours that returned the live incarnation of the band to a guitar-driven [[hard rock]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/archive/2000/2k02/wk1/ReviewSmashingPumpkinsPla.html |title=Review: Smashing Pumpkins Play Visceral Show in Northern California (02/7/2000) |last=Reiley |first=Laura |date=February 7, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000229191724/http://www.livedaily.com/archive/2000/2k02/wk1/ReviewSmashingPumpkinsPla.html |archivedate=February 29, 2000 |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Background and concept ==\nAfter the ''Adore'' tour ended in the second half of 1998, lead singer/guitarist [[Billy Corgan]] immediately began to work on new material, playing new songs as early as October of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spfc.org/tours/date.html?tour_id=633 |title=spfc.org : Tour History \u2013 Dates : 1998/10/31 |work=spfc.org |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}</ref> In the same month, the four original band members convened, and decided that Jimmy Chamberlin would rejoin the band, and that a final album and tour would be mounted before the group disbanded permanently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kot |first=Greg |title=Pumpkin Seeds |journal=Guitar World |date=January 2002}}</ref> \"If you want to know what Jimmy brings back to the band,\" Corgan told ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', \"then listen to ''Adore'' and this new record back-to-back.

Corgan later said, \"This put a stress obviously on the full integrity of the project, because it was connected to the band not only bringing the music to fruition fully, but also the public component of being in character.

A sequel album\u2014''[[Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music]]''\u2014was later released independently via the Internet, and limited quantities for the physical version.\n\nAs with its predecessor, ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]'', ''Machina'' represented a drastic image and sound change for the band that failed to reconnect them with chart-topping success. However, after the relatively brief ''Adore'' tour, the new line-up with Chamberlin and the former [[Hole (band)|Hole]] bass guitarist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] mounted longer international tours that returned the live incarnation of the band to a guitar-driven [[hard rock]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/archive/2000/2k02/wk1/ReviewSmashingPumpkinsPla.html |title=Review: Smashing Pumpkins Play Visceral Show in Northern California (02/7/2000) |last=Reiley |first=Laura |date=February 7, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000229191724/http://www.livedaily.com/archive/2000/2k02/wk1/ReviewSmashingPumpkinsPla.html |archivedate=February 29, 2000 |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Background and concept ==\nAfter the ''Adore'' tour ended in the second half of 1998, lead singer/guitarist [[Billy Corgan]] immediately began to work on new material, playing new songs as early as October of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spfc.org/tours/date.html?tour_id=633 |title=spfc.org : Tour History \u2013 Dates : 1998/10/31 |work=spfc.org |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}</ref> In the same month, the four original band members convened, and decided that Jimmy Chamberlin would rejoin the band, and that a final album and tour would be mounted before the group disbanded permanently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kot |first=Greg |title=Pumpkin Seeds |journal=Guitar World |date=January 2002}}</ref> \"If you want to know what Jimmy brings back to the band,\" Corgan told ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', \"then listen to ''Adore'' and this new record back-to-back.
