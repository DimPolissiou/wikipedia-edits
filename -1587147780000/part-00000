The dam was expected to have a reservoir of around 70&nbsp;billion cubic meters, which was scheduled to start filling in 2014.

Any assets that could be used by the enemy may be targeted. This usually includes obvious weapons, transport vehicles, communication sites, and industrial resources. However, anything useful to the advancing enemy can be targeted including food stores and agricultural areas, water sources, and even the local people themselves, although this has been banned under the [[Additional Protocol II|1977 Geneva Conventions]]. The practice can be carried out by the [[military]] in enemy territory, or in its own home territory while being invaded. It may overlap with, but it is not the same as, punitive destruction of the enemy's resources, which is usually done as part of political strategy, rather than operational strategy.\n\nThe concept of ''scorched earth'' is sometimes applied figuratively to the business world, where a firm facing a takeover attempt will make itself less valuable by selling off its assets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Willcox|first1=Tilton|date=January 1988|title=The Use and Abuse of Executive Powers in Warding off Corporate Raiders|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=7|issue=1/2|pages=51}}</ref>\n\nNotable historic examples of scorched-earth tactics include [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William Tecumseh Sherman's]] [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in [[the American Civil War]], Colonel [[Kit Carson]]'s subjugation of the American Navajo Indians, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener's]] advance against the [[Boers]], the setting of fire to 605-732 oil wells by retreating [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraqi]] military forces in the [[Gulf War]]. Also notable were the Russian army's strategies during the failed [[Swedish invasion of Russia]], the failed [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleonic invasion of Russia]], as well as the initial Soviet retreat commanded by [[Joseph Stalin]] during the German Army's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Second World War]],<ref>John Graham Royde-Smith, Encyclopedia Britannica online. Operation Barbarossa. https://www.britannica.com/event/Operation-Barbarossa . Accessed Aug 12, 2017.</ref> and the subsequent [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] retreat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nThe strategy of destroying the food and water supply of the civilian population in an area of conflict has been banned under Article 54 of [[Protocol I]] of the 1977 [[Geneva Conventions]]. The relevant passage says:\n\n{{quote|It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm |title=Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Convention, 1977 |publisher=Deoxy.org |date=1954-05-14 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ancient history==\nThe [[Scythians]] used scorched-earth methods against King [[Darius the Great]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], during [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his European Scythian campaign]]. The Scythians, who were nomadic herders, evaded the Persians and retreated into the depths of the Steppes, destroying food supplies and [[Well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Many of Darius' troops died from starvation and dehydration.\n\nThe Greek general [[Xenophon]] records in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' that the [[Armenians]] burned their crops and food supplies as they withdrew before the advance of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]].\n\nThe Greek mercenary general [[Memnon of Rhodes|Memnon]] suggested to the Persian [[Satraps]] the use of the scorched-earth policy against Alexander as he moved into Asia Minor. He was refused.\n\n===Roman warfare===\nThe system of punitive destruction of property and subjugation of people when accompanying a military campaign was known as ''vastatio''. Two of the first uses of scorched earth recorded both happened in the [[Gallic Wars]]. The first was used when the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Helvetii]] were forced to evacuate their homes in Southern Germany and Switzerland because of incursions of unfriendly Germanic tribes: to add incentive to the march, the Helvetii destroyed everything they could not bring.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard A. |last=Billows |title=Julius Caesar: The Colossus of Rome |isbn=9781134318322|date=2008 }}</ref> After the Helvetii were defeated by a combined Roman-Gallic force, the Helvetii were forced to rebuild themselves on the shattered German{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and Swiss plains they themselves had destroyed.\n\nThe second case shows actual military value: during the [[Battle of Alesia|Great Gallic War]] the [[Gauls]] under [[Vercingetorix]] planned to lure the Roman armies into Gaul and then trap and obliterate them. They thus ravaged the countryside of what are now the [[Benelux]] countries and France. That caused immense problems for the Romans, but the Roman military triumphs over the Gallic alliance showed that alone not to be enough to save Gaul from subjugation by Rome.\n\nDuring the [[Second Punic War]] in 218\u2013202 BC, the Carthaginians used the method selectively while storming through [[Ancient Rome|Italy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Dexter |last=Hoyos |title=A Companion to the Punic Wars |isbn=9781444393705|date=2011}}</ref> After the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, the Roman Senate also elected to use this method to permanently destroy the Carthaginian capital city, [[Carthage]] (near modern-day [[Tunis]]). The buildings were torn down, their stones scattered so not even rubble remained, and the fields were burned. However, the story that they [[salt the earth|salted the earth]] is [[apocryphal]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ridley |first=R.

Julian might expect, that a conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion, steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, the rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted. Wherever they moved... the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert. This desperate but effectual method of defence can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their independence to their property; or by the rigor of an arbitrary government, which consults the public safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Gibbon |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=f8-2ONV-foQC |page=158 }} |title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |year=1788 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Post-classical history==\n\n===Early European warfare===\nBritish monk [[Gildas]], whose sixth-century treatise \"On the Ruin of Britain\"  wrote about an earlier invasion \"For the fire of vengeance\u200a\u2026\u200aspread from sea to sea\u200a\u2026\u200aand did not cease, until, destroying the neighbouring towns and lands, it reached the other side of the island.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/11/gold-hoard/alexander-text |title=Magical Mystery Treasure |publisher=nationalgeographic}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First Fitna|First Islamic Civil War]] (656-661), [[Muawiyah I]] sent [[Busr ibn Abi Artat]] to a campaign in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]] to ravage territory loyal to Muawiyah's opponent [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. According to [[Al-Tabari|Tabari]], 30,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed during this campaign. Muawiyah also sent [[Sufyan ibn Awf]] to [[Iraq]] to burn the crops and homes of Ali's supporters.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=15TZsW4gTY0C&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=busr+ibn+abi+artat#v=onepage&q=busr+ibn+abi+artat&f=true|title=History of al-Tabari Vol. 18, The: Between Civil Wars: The Caliphate of Mu'awiyah A.D. 661\u2013680/A.H. 40\u201360|date=2015|publisher=SUNY Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781438413600}}</ref>\n\nDuring the great Viking invasion of England opposed by [[Alfred the Great]] and various other Saxon and Welsh rulers, the Viking chieftain [[Hastein]] in late summer 893 marched his men to [[Chester]] to occupy the ruined Roman fortress there. The refortified fortress should have made an excellent base for raiding northern [[Mercia]], but the Mercians are recorded as having taken the drastic measure of destroying all crops and livestock in the surrounding countryside in order to starve the Danes out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dot-domesday.me.uk/wessex_three.htm |title=871\u2013899 Alfred ('the Great') |publisher=dot-domesday.me.uk}}</ref> The Danes left Chester next year and marched into Wales.\n\n====Harrying of the North====\nIn the [[Harrying of the North]], [[William the Conqueror]]'s solution to stop a rebellion in 1069 was the brutal conquest and subjugation of the North of England. William's men burnt whole villages from the [[Humber]] to [[Tees]], and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial massacre would soon succumb to starvation over the winter. The destruction is depicted in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyinanhour.com/2010/06/17/the-harrying-of-the-north-a-great-medieval-massacre-1069/ |title=A Great Medieval Massacre, 1069 |publisher=historyinanhour.com}}</ref> The survivors were reduced to [[cannibalism]],<ref>Forester, Thomas, ed., [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=gpR0iz5GjYgC }} ''The Chronicle of Florence of Worcester''], London: Henry G.

Prince [[Mircea I of Wallachia]] used it against the Ottomans in 1395 and Prince [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] scorched the earth in his country as the Ottoman army advanced in 1475 and 1476.\n\n[[File:Corfe Castke 57.JPG|thumb|[[Corfe Castle]] was slighted during the [[English Civil War]] so that its defences could not be reused.]]\nA [[slighting]] is the deliberate destruction, partial or complete, of a [[fortification]] without opposition.

Much of the province of [[Munster]] was laid waste. The poet [[Edmund Spenser]] left an account of it:\n\n{{quote|In those late wars in Munster; for notwithstanding that the same was a most rich and plentiful country, full of corn and cattle, that you would have thought they could have been able to stand long, yet ere one year and a half they were brought to such wretchedness, as that any stony heart would have rued the same. Out of every corner of the wood and glens they came creeping forth upon their hands, for their legs could not bear them; they looked Anatomies [of] death, they spoke like ghosts, crying out of their graves; they did eat of the carrions, happy where they could find them, yea, and one another soon after, in so much as the very carcasses they spared not to scrape out of their graves; and if they found a plot of water-cresses or shamrocks, there they flocked as to a feast for the time, yet not able long to continue therewithal; that in a short space there were none almost left, and a most populous and plentiful country suddenly left void of man or beast.}}\n\nIn 1630, [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field-Marshal General]] [[Torquato Conti]] was in command of [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] forces during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Forced to retreat from the advancing Swedish army of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], Conti ordered his troops to burn houses, destroy villages and generally cause as much harm to property and people as possible. His actions were remembered thus:<ref name=\"Schiller\">''The history of the Thirty Years' War in Germany'' by Friedrich Schiller (translated by Christoph Martin Wieland, printed for W. Miller, 1799)</ref>\n\n{{quote|To revenge himself upon the Duke of Pomerania, the imperial general permitted his troops, upon his retreat, to exercise every barbarity on the unfortunate inhabitants of Pomerania, who had already suffered but too severely from his avarice.

[[Vlad the Impaler]] retreated to [[Transylvania]]. During his departure, he conducted scorched-earth tactics to ward off Sultan Mehmed II's approach. When the Ottoman forces approached [[Tirgoviste]], they encountered over 20,000 people [[impalement|impaled]] by the forces of Vlad the Impaler, creating a \"forest\" of dead or dying bodies on stakes. This atrocious, gut-wrenching sight caused Sultan Mehmed II to withdraw from battle and instead send Radu, Vlad's brother, to fight Vlad the Impaler.\n\n===Great Siege of Malta===\nIn early 1565, Grandmaster [[Jean Parisot de Valette]] ordered the harvesting of all the crops in Malta, including unripened grain, to deprive the Ottomans of any local food supplies since spies had warned of an imminent Ottoman attack. Furthermore, the Knights [[Well poisoning|poisoned all wells]] with bitter herbs and dead animals. The Ottomans arrived on 18 May of that year, and the [[Great Siege of Malta]] began. The Ottomans managed to capture one fort but were eventually defeated by the Knights, the Maltese militia and a Spanish relief force.\n\n===Nine Years' War===\nIn 1688, France attacked the German [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. The German states responded to this by forming an alliance and assembling a sizeable armed force to push the French out of Germany. The French had not prepared for such an eventuality. Realising that the war in Germany was not going to end quickly and that the Rhineland ''blitz'' would not be a brief and decisive parade of French glory, [[Louis XIV]] and his War Minister [[Marquis de Louvois]] resolved upon a scorched-earth policy in the Palatinate, [[Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], intent on denying enemy troops local resources and prevent them from invading French territory.<ref name=\"childs17\">Childs (1991), p. 17.</ref> By 20 December 1688 Louvois had selected all the cities, towns, villages and ch\u00e2teaux intended for destruction.

(Although effective food-preserving techniques had recently been invented, they were still not fit for military use because a suitably rugged container had not yet been invented.)<ref>{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Von Pivka |title=The King's German Legion |isbn=9781472801692|date=2013}}</ref> The command was obeyed as a result of French plundering and general ill-treatment of civilians in the previous invasions, the poor, angered people would rather destroy anything that had to be left behind rather than leaving it to the French.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Bussaco|Bussaco]], Massen\u00e1's army marched on to [[Coimbra]] where much of the [[University of Coimbra|city's old university]] and library were vandalised, houses and furniture were destroyed and the few civilians that did not seek refuge further south were murdered. While there were instances of similar behavior by British soldiers, considering that Portugal was their ally, such crimes were generally investigated, and those found punished. Coimbra's sack made the populace even more determined in leaving nothing and when the French armies reached the [[Lines of Torres Vedras]] on the way to [[Lisbon]], French soldiers reported that the country \"seemed to empty ahead of them\".  When Massen\u00e1 reached the city of [[Viseu]], wanting to replenish his armies' dwindling food supplies, none of the inhabitants remained, and all there was to eat were grapes and lemons that, if eaten in large quantities, would be better laxatives than sources of calories. Low morale, hunger, disease, and indiscipline rendered the French Army of Portugal into a much weaker force and compelled their retreat next spring.

Encountering only desolate and useless land [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grand Army]] was prevented from using its accustomed doctrine of living off the lands it conquered. Pushing relentlessly on despite dwindling numbers, the Grand Army met with disaster as the invasion progressed. Napoleon's army arrived in a virtually abandoned Moscow, which was a tattered starving shell of its former self that was largely due to the use of scorched-earth tactics by retreating Russians. Having essentially conquered nothing, Napoleon's troops retreated, and again the scorched-earth policy came into effect because even though some large supply dumps had been established on the advance, the route between these had both been scorched and marched over once already, so the French army starved as it marched along the resource-depleted invasion route.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/1812/Russia/c_bridges.html |title=Rivers and the Destruction of Napoleon's Grand Army |publisher=napoleon-series.org}}</ref>\n\n===South American War of Independence===\nIn August 1812, [[Argentina|Argentine]] General [[Manuel Belgrano]] led the [[Jujuy Exodus]], a massive forced displacement of people from the present-day [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]] provinces to the south. The Jujuy Exodus was conducted by the patriot forces of the [[Army of the North]] that were battling a [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] army.\n\nBelgrano, faced with the prospect of total defeat and territorial loss, ordered all people to pack their necessities, including food and furniture, and follow him, in carriages or on foot, together with whatever cattle and beasts of burden could endure the journey. The rest (houses, crops, food stocks, and also any objects made of iron) was to be burned, so as to deprive the loyalists of resources, following a strict scorched-earth policy. On 29 July 1812, Belgrano asked the people of Jujuy to \"show their [[hero]]ism\" and join the march of the army under his command \"if, as you assure, you want to be free\". The punishment for ignoring the order was execution and the destruction of the defector's properties. Belgrano labored to win the support of the populace and later reported that most of the people had willingly followed him without the need of force.\n\nThe exodus started on 23 August and gathered people from [[San Salvador de Jujuy|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]]; people travelled south about 250&nbsp;km, finally arriving at the banks of the Pasaje River, in the province of [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]], on the early hours of 29 August. The Patriots applied a scorched-earth policy so the Spaniards advanced into a wasteland.

Instructions were always given to take provisions and forage under the direction of commissioned officers who should give receipts to owners, if at home, and turn the property over to officers of the quartermaster or commissary departments to be issued as if furnished from our Northern depots.

The Russian troops, retreating along a front of more than 600 miles, destroyed anything that might be of use to their enemy, including crops, houses, railways and entire cities. They also forcibly removed huge numbers of people.

Since a scorched-earth campaign requires that there be a war of movement, the Western Front of World War I provided little opportunity in general for this policy as it was a stalemated war fought mostly in the same concentrated area for its entire duration.\n\n===Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)===\n{{main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)#Greek scorched earth policy}}\n\nDuring the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]], the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war.{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}}  Historian of the Middle East, [[Sydney Nettleton Fisher]] wrote that: \"The Greek army in retreat pursued a burned-earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless Turkish villagers in its path.\"{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}} [[Norman Naimark|Norman M.

Due to the Japanese scorched-earth policy, immense environmental and infrastructure damage have been recorded. Additionally, it contributed to the complete destruction of entire villages and partial destruction of entire cities like [[Bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing]] or [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing]].\n\nThe Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] destroyed dams and levees in an attempt to flood the land to slow down the advancement of Japanese soldiers, further adding to the environmental impact.

In some cases fighting took place in areas familiar to the actual Finnish soldiers fighting it. There were accounts of soldiers burning down their very own homes and parishes. One of the burned parishes was [[Battle of Suomussalmi|Suomussalmi]].\n\nWhen [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941]], many district governments took the initiative to begin a 'partial' scorched-earth policy in order to deny the invaders access to electrical, telecommunications, rail, and industrial resources. Parts of the telegraph network were destroyed, some rail and road bridges were blown up, most electrical generators were sabotaged through the removal of key components, and many mineshafts were collapsed. {{citation needed|reason=If Stalin ordered this there should be a clear source for his order as they are public by now|date=October 2015}} The process was repeated later in the war by the German forces of [[Army Group North]] and [[Erich von Manstein]]'s [[Army Group Don]], which stole crops, destroyed farms, and razed settlements of at least city size and smaller during several military operations. The rationale for this policy was that it would slow pursuing Soviet forces by forcing them to save their own civilians, though in [[Verlorene Siege|Manstein's postwar memoirs]] at the very least the policy was justified as a means of preventing the Soviets from stealing the food and shelter from their own civilians. The best-known victims of the German scorched-earth policy were the people of the historic city of [[Novgorod]], whose hometown was razed during the Winter of 1944 to cover Army Group North's retreat from [[Leningrad]].\n\nNear the end of the Summer of 1944, [[Finland]], which had made a separate peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], was required to evict the German forces, which had been fighting against the Soviets alongside Finnish troops in the Northern part of the country. The Finnish forces, under the leadership of general [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], struck aggressively in August 1944 by making a landfall at [[Tornio]]. This accelerated the German retreat, and by November 1944 the Germans had left most of northern Finland. The German forces, forced to retreat due to an overall strategic situation, covered their retreat towards [[Norway]] by devastating large areas of northern Finland using scorched-earth strategy. More than one-third of the dwellings in the area were destroyed, and the provincial capital [[Battle of Rovaniemi|Rovaniemi]] was burned to the ground. All but two bridges in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland Province]] were blown up and all roads were mined.<ref>See [[Lapland War]]</ref> In Northern Norway which was at the same time invaded by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in pursuit of the retreating German army in 1944, the Germans also undertook a scorched-earth policy, destroying every building that could offer shelter and thus interposing a belt of \"scorched earth\" between themselves and the allies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Derry |first=T.

Any assets that could be used by the enemy may be targeted. This usually includes obvious weapons, transport vehicles, communication sites, and industrial resources. However, anything useful to the advancing enemy can be targeted including food stores and agricultural areas, water sources, and even the local people themselves, although this has been banned under the [[Additional Protocol II|1977 Geneva Conventions]]. The practice can be carried out by the [[military]] in enemy territory, or in its own home territory while being invaded. It may overlap with, but it is not the same as, punitive destruction of the enemy's resources, which is usually done as part of political strategy, rather than operational strategy.\n\nThe concept of ''scorched earth'' is sometimes applied figuratively to the business world, where a firm facing a takeover attempt will make itself less valuable by selling off its assets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Willcox|first1=Tilton|date=January 1988|title=The Use and Abuse of Executive Powers in Warding off Corporate Raiders|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=7|issue=1/2|pages=51}}</ref>\n\nNotable historic examples of scorched-earth tactics include [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William Tecumseh Sherman's]] [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in [[the American Civil War]], Colonel [[Kit Carson]]'s subjugation of the American Navajo Indians, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener's]] advance against the [[Boers]], the setting of fire to 605-732 oil wells by retreating [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraqi]] military forces in the [[Gulf War]]. Also notable were the Russian army's strategies during the failed [[Swedish invasion of Russia]], the failed [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleonic invasion of Russia]], as well as the initial Soviet retreat commanded by [[Joseph Stalin]] during the German Army's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Second World War]],<ref>John Graham Royde-Smith, Encyclopedia Britannica online. Operation Barbarossa. https://www.britannica.com/event/Operation-Barbarossa . Accessed Aug 12, 2017.</ref> and the subsequent [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] retreat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nThe strategy of destroying the food and water supply of the civilian population in an area of conflict has been banned under Article 54 of [[Protocol I]] of the 1977 [[Geneva Conventions]]. The relevant passage says:\n\n{{quote|It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm |title=Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Convention, 1977 |publisher=Deoxy.org |date=1954-05-14 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ancient history==\nThe [[Scythians]] used scorched-earth methods against King [[Darius the Great]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], during [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his European Scythian campaign]]. The Scythians, who were nomadic herders, evaded the Persians and retreated into the depths of the Steppes, destroying food supplies and [[Well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Many of Darius' troops died from starvation and dehydration.\n\nThe Greek general [[Xenophon]] records in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' that the [[Armenians]] burned their crops and food supplies as they withdrew before the advance of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]].\n\nThe Greek mercenary general [[Memnon of Rhodes|Memnon]] suggested to the Persian [[Satraps]] the use of the scorched-earth policy against Alexander as he moved into Asia Minor. He was refused.\n\n===Roman warfare===\nThe system of punitive destruction of property and subjugation of people when accompanying a military campaign was known as ''vastatio''. Two of the first uses of scorched earth recorded both happened in the [[Gallic Wars]]. The first was used when the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Helvetii]] were forced to evacuate their homes in Southern Germany and Switzerland because of incursions of unfriendly Germanic tribes: to add incentive to the march, the Helvetii destroyed everything they could not bring.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard A. |last=Billows |title=Julius Caesar: The Colossus of Rome |isbn=9781134318322|date=2008 }}</ref> After the Helvetii were defeated by a combined Roman-Gallic force, the Helvetii were forced to rebuild themselves on the shattered German{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and Swiss plains they themselves had destroyed.\n\nThe second case shows actual military value: during the [[Battle of Alesia|Great Gallic War]] the [[Gauls]] under [[Vercingetorix]] planned to lure the Roman armies into Gaul and then trap and obliterate them. They thus ravaged the countryside of what are now the [[Benelux]] countries and France. That caused immense problems for the Romans, but the Roman military triumphs over the Gallic alliance showed that alone not to be enough to save Gaul from subjugation by Rome.\n\nDuring the [[Second Punic War]] in 218\u2013202 BC, the Carthaginians used the method selectively while storming through [[Ancient Rome|Italy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Dexter |last=Hoyos |title=A Companion to the Punic Wars |isbn=9781444393705|date=2011}}</ref> After the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, the Roman Senate also elected to use this method to permanently destroy the Carthaginian capital city, [[Carthage]] (near modern-day [[Tunis]]). The buildings were torn down, their stones scattered so not even rubble remained, and the fields were burned. However, the story that they [[salt the earth|salted the earth]] is [[apocryphal]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ridley |first=R.

Julian might expect, that a conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion, steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, the rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted. Wherever they moved... the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert. This desperate but effectual method of defence can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their independence to their property; or by the rigor of an arbitrary government, which consults the public safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Gibbon |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=f8-2ONV-foQC |page=158 }} |title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |year=1788 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Post-classical history==\n\n===Early European warfare===\nBritish monk [[Gildas]], whose sixth-century treatise \"On the Ruin of Britain\"  wrote about an earlier invasion \"For the fire of vengeance\u200a\u2026\u200aspread from sea to sea\u200a\u2026\u200aand did not cease, until, destroying the neighbouring towns and lands, it reached the other side of the island.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/11/gold-hoard/alexander-text |title=Magical Mystery Treasure |publisher=nationalgeographic}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First Fitna|First Islamic Civil War]] (656-661), [[Muawiyah I]] sent [[Busr ibn Abi Artat]] to a campaign in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]] to ravage territory loyal to Muawiyah's opponent [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]].

Much of the province of [[Munster]] was laid waste. The poet [[Edmund Spenser]] left an account of it:\n\n{{quote|In those late wars in Munster; for notwithstanding that the same was a most rich and plentiful country, full of corn and cattle, that you would have thought they could have been able to stand long, yet ere one year and a half they were brought to such wretchedness, as that any stony heart would have rued the same. Out of every corner of the wood and glens they came creeping forth upon their hands, for their legs could not bear them; they looked Anatomies [of] death, they spoke like ghosts, crying out of their graves; they did eat of the carrions, happy where they could find them, yea, and one another soon after, in so much as the very carcasses they spared not to scrape out of their graves; and if they found a plot of water-cresses or shamrocks, there they flocked as to a feast for the time, yet not able long to continue therewithal; that in a short space there were none almost left, and a most populous and plentiful country suddenly left void of man or beast.}}\n\nIn 1630, [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field-Marshal General]] [[Torquato Conti]] was in command of [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] forces during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Forced to retreat from the advancing Swedish army of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], Conti ordered his troops to burn houses, destroy villages and generally cause as much harm to property and people as possible. His actions were remembered thus:<ref name=\"Schiller\">''The history of the Thirty Years' War in Germany'' by Friedrich Schiller (translated by Christoph Martin Wieland, printed for W.

When the Ottoman forces approached [[Tirgoviste]], they encountered over 20,000 people [[impalement|impaled]] by the forces of Vlad the Impaler, creating a \"forest\" of dead or dying bodies on stakes.

Furthermore, the Knights [[Well poisoning|poisoned all wells]] with bitter herbs and dead animals. The Ottomans arrived on 18 May of that year, and the [[Great Siege of Malta]] began. The Ottomans managed to capture one fort but were eventually defeated by the Knights, the Maltese militia and a Spanish relief force.\n\n===Nine Years' War===\nIn 1688, France attacked the German [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. The German states responded to this by forming an alliance and assembling a sizeable armed force to push the French out of Germany. The French had not prepared for such an eventuality. Realising that the war in Germany was not going to end quickly and that the Rhineland ''blitz'' would not be a brief and decisive parade of French glory, [[Louis XIV]] and his War Minister [[Marquis de Louvois]] resolved upon a scorched-earth policy in the Palatinate, [[Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], intent on denying enemy troops local resources and prevent them from invading French territory.<ref name=\"childs17\">Childs (1991), p. 17.</ref> By 20 December 1688 Louvois had selected all the cities, towns, villages and ch\u00e2teaux intended for destruction.

While there were instances of similar behavior by British soldiers, considering that Portugal was their ally, such crimes were generally investigated, and those found punished. Coimbra's sack made the populace even more determined in leaving nothing and when the French armies reached the [[Lines of Torres Vedras]] on the way to [[Lisbon]], French soldiers reported that the country \"seemed to empty ahead of them\".  When Massen\u00e1 reached the city of [[Viseu]], wanting to replenish his armies' dwindling food supplies, none of the inhabitants remained, and all there was to eat were grapes and lemons that, if eaten in large quantities, would be better laxatives than sources of calories.

Pushing relentlessly on despite dwindling numbers, the Grand Army met with disaster as the invasion progressed. Napoleon's army arrived in a virtually abandoned Moscow, which was a tattered starving shell of its former self that was largely due to the use of scorched-earth tactics by retreating Russians. Having essentially conquered nothing, Napoleon's troops retreated, and again the scorched-earth policy came into effect because even though some large supply dumps had been established on the advance, the route between these had both been scorched and marched over once already, so the French army starved as it marched along the resource-depleted invasion route.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/1812/Russia/c_bridges.html |title=Rivers and the Destruction of Napoleon's Grand Army |publisher=napoleon-series.org}}</ref>\n\n===South American War of Independence===\nIn August 1812, [[Argentina|Argentine]] General [[Manuel Belgrano]] led the [[Jujuy Exodus]], a massive forced displacement of people from the present-day [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]] provinces to the south. The Jujuy Exodus was conducted by the patriot forces of the [[Army of the North]] that were battling a [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] army.\n\nBelgrano, faced with the prospect of total defeat and territorial loss, ordered all people to pack their necessities, including food and furniture, and follow him, in carriages or on foot, together with whatever cattle and beasts of burden could endure the journey. The rest (houses, crops, food stocks, and also any objects made of iron) was to be burned, so as to deprive the loyalists of resources, following a strict scorched-earth policy. On 29 July 1812, Belgrano asked the people of Jujuy to \"show their [[hero]]ism\" and join the march of the army under his command \"if, as you assure, you want to be free\". The punishment for ignoring the order was execution and the destruction of the defector's properties. Belgrano labored to win the support of the populace and later reported that most of the people had willingly followed him without the need of force.\n\nThe exodus started on 23 August and gathered people from [[San Salvador de Jujuy|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]]; people travelled south about 250&nbsp;km, finally arriving at the banks of the Pasaje River, in the province of [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]], on the early hours of 29 August. The Patriots applied a scorched-earth policy so the Spaniards advanced into a wasteland.

Promiscuous pillaging, however, was discouraged and punished. Instructions were always given to take provisions and forage under the direction of commissioned officers who should give receipts to owners, if at home, and turn the property over to officers of the quartermaster or commissary departments to be issued as if furnished from our Northern depots.

The Russian troops, retreating along a front of more than 600 miles, destroyed anything that might be of use to their enemy, including crops, houses, railways and entire cities. They also forcibly removed huge numbers of people.

Since a scorched-earth campaign requires that there be a war of movement, World War I provided little opportunity in general for this policy as it was a stalemated war fought mostly in the same concentrated area for its entire duration.\n\n===Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)===\n{{main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)#Greek scorched earth policy}}\n\nDuring the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]], the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war.{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}}  Historian of the Middle East, [[Sydney Nettleton Fisher]] wrote that: \"The Greek army in retreat pursued a burned-earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless Turkish villagers in its path.\"{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}} [[Norman Naimark|Norman M.

Due to the Japanese scorched-earth policy, immense environmental and infrastructure damage have been recorded. Additionally, it contributed to the complete destruction of entire villages and partial destruction of entire cities like [[Bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing]] or [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing]].\n\nThe Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] destroyed dams and levees in an attempt to flood the land to slow down the advancement of Japanese soldiers, further adding to the environmental impact.

In some cases fighting took place in areas familiar to the actual Finnish soldiers fighting it. There were accounts of soldiers burning down their very own homes and parishes. One of the burned parishes was [[Battle of Suomussalmi|Suomussalmi]].\n\nWhen [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941]], many district governments took the initiative to begin a 'partial' scorched-earth policy in order to deny the invaders access to electrical, telecommunications, rail, and industrial resources. Parts of the telegraph network were destroyed, some rail and road bridges were blown up, most electrical generators were sabotaged through the removal of key components, and many mineshafts were collapsed. {{citation needed|reason=If Stalin ordered this there should be a clear source for his order as they are public by now|date=October 2015}} The process was repeated later in the war by the German forces of [[Army Group North]] and [[Erich von Manstein]]'s [[Army Group Don]], which stole crops, destroyed farms, and razed settlements of at least city size and smaller during several military operations. The rationale for this policy was that it would slow pursuing Soviet forces by forcing them to save their own civilians, though in [[Verlorene Siege|Manstein's postwar memoirs]] at the very least the policy was justified as a means of preventing the Soviets from stealing the food and shelter from their own civilians. The best-known victims of the German scorched-earth policy were the people of the historic city of [[Novgorod]], whose hometown was razed during the Winter of 1944 to cover Army Group North's retreat from [[Leningrad]].\n\nNear the end of the Summer of 1944, [[Finland]], which had made a separate peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], was required to evict the German forces, which had been fighting against the Soviets alongside Finnish troops in the Northern part of the country. The Finnish forces, under the leadership of general [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], struck aggressively in August 1944 by making a landfall at [[Tornio]]. This accelerated the German retreat, and by November 1944 the Germans had left most of northern Finland. The German forces, forced to retreat due to an overall strategic situation, covered their retreat towards [[Norway]] by devastating large areas of northern Finland using scorched-earth strategy. More than one-third of the dwellings in the area were destroyed, and the provincial capital [[Battle of Rovaniemi|Rovaniemi]] was burned to the ground. All but two bridges in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland Province]] were blown up and all roads were mined.<ref>See [[Lapland War]]</ref> In Northern Norway which was at the same time invaded by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in pursuit of the retreating German army in 1944, the Germans also undertook a scorched-earth policy, destroying every building that could offer shelter and thus interposing a belt of \"scorched earth\" between themselves and the allies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Derry |first=T.

They struggled for the next few seasons, but went on to be crowned [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] champions in 1938\u201339. [[World War II]] meant they had to wait until the 1946\u201347 season to take their place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], though they were relegated at the end of the campaign.

The bottom 12 teams from the Third Division North and South were placed in the new division, with the remainder forming the revived [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].

[[Len Ashurst]] was manager from 1978 to 1982, the club's most successful period in its history and under the chairmanship of Richard Ford. In the [[1978\u201379 FA Cup]] County beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 2\u20131 in round three before losing 1\u20130 to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] in a fourth round replay. In [[1979\u201380 Newport County A.F.C. season|1980]], promotion was finally achieved from the Football League Fourth Division, the club being only five points from being crowned champions although never being in contention to win the league and never being top. County sealed promotion in the last match of the season with a 4\u20132 win at high-flying [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Walsall finished second in the league and were also promoted.\n\nThe team included a young [[John Aldridge]] who later became one of the most prolific goal-scorers in English football history, most famous for helping [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] win the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title in 1988 and FA Cup in 1989, as well as helping [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] win two successive promotions and the [[Football League Cup]].\n<!--<gallery>\n[[Image:county_past31.JPEG|thumb|alt=A Tommy Tynan scores the final goal to clinch promotion to Division 3 in Season 1979/80.]]\n[[Image:county_past32.JPEG|thumb|alt=A A Civic ride through Newport to celebrate the promotion and Welsh Cup win. 1979/80.]]\n</gallery>-->\n\nAlso in the promotion-winning team was [[Tommy Tynan]], one of the leading lower-league strikers of his era, who scored the all-important goal that sealed County's promotion.<ref name=\"countypast\" /> [[Dave Gwyther]] completed the trio of prolific goalscorers whilst captain [[Keith Oakes]] provided strength in cental defence.

The second round against [[SK Haugar]] of [[Norway]] was even more convincing: after a 0\u20130 draw away, the home leg was won 6\u20130, taking the club into the quarter-finals against [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena|Carl Zeiss Jena F.C.]] of [[East Germany]]. Aldridge was injured for both matches against Carl Zeiss Jena, though he was a non-playing substitute in the 2nd leg. The quarter-final away leg was drawn 2\u20132 with Tommy Tynan scoring both goals, including his equaliser in the 90th minute. However, despite dominating the home leg, Newport lost 1\u20130 in front of 18,000 fans at Somerton Park, denying them a high-profile semi-final with [[S.L. Benfica]]. Carl Zeiss Jena went on to be the eventual cup runners-up, losing the final to [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe Newport County squad for the first leg was: 1 [[Gary Plumley]], 2 [[Richard Walden]], 3 [[John Relish]], 4 [[Grant Davies (footballer)|Grant Davies]], 5 [[Keith Oakes]] (Captain), 6 [[Tommy Tynan]], 7 [[Nigel Vaughan]], 8 [[Steve Lowndes]], 9 [[Dave Gwyther]], 10 [[Karl Elsey]], 11 [[Kevin Moore (footballer born 1956)|Kevin Moore]], 12 [[Neil Bailey]], 13 [[Steve Warriner]], 14 [[Dave Bruton (footballer)|Dave Bruton]], 15 [[Robert Ward (footballer)|Bobby Ward]], 16 [[Mark Kendall (footballer, born 1958)|Mark Kendall]].\n\nIn the [[1982\u201383 Newport County A.F.C. season|1982\u201383 season]] [[Colin Addison]], in his second spell as manager, led Newport County to their highest post-war league finish \u2013 4th in the Third Division, just four points behind third-placed [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. Huddersfield were promoted to the Second Division, along with champions [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and local rivals [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. County had actually gone top of the table in early April after a 1\u20130 win over Cardiff in front of 16,052 fans at Somerton Park, but a return of only four points from the last seven games meant County missed out on promotion. County faced [[Football League First Division|First-Division]] team [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the third round of the [[1982\u201383 FA Cup]].

In 2017 Peter Madigan and Mark Crook were co-opted to serve as unelected directors.\n\nIn 2017 a leaked resignation letter by director Charlie Hopkins made allegations against some serving directors which were refuted by the Trust Board.<ref>https://www.newport-county.co.uk/news/2017/october/club-statement-26102017/</ref>\n\n[[File:Newport County directors 2016-2022.svg|2048px|804px|Timeline showing the tenures of Newport County directors 2016-2022]]\n\n==Supporters==\n[[Image:Spytty the Dog.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Club mascot Spytty the Dog]]\nNewport County draws its main support from the city of Newport but also from the wider surrounding historic [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] area, as reflected in the original club name of ''Newport & Monmouth County A.F.C''. The club's supporters refer to themselves as the Amber Army, in reference to the traditional club colour, and the sporting colours more widely associated with Newport. Since 2009 the club has operated the popular and successful [[Internet radio]] commentary service for supporters.\n\nThe supporters' unofficial anthem is ''Come on the County'', written by Ken Buck and Eric Thomas. Originally released in 1973, it was re-recorded in 1999 and 2010. The 1999 release included the song ''Carl Zeiss Jena'' by Newport band Flyscreen, celebrating County's 1981 European campaign. The 2010 release included reworkings of ''Come on the County'' by The Tenants Supermen, who are ardent County fans. For the 2012 FA Trophy final, singer-songwriter Tracey Curtis wrote and released the song ''A Hundred Years of Football (And We're Off To Wembley)''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/9624971.Song_celebrates_County_s_Wembley_dream/|title=Song celebrates County's Wembley dream|publisher=[[South Wales Argus]]|date=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s comedian [[Frank Carson]] was appointed as a director and vice president in order to raise the profile of the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-17137248|title=Frank Carson death: Newport County on how comic's laughter lifted club|work=BBC News}}</ref> Newport-based rappers [[Goldie Lookin' Chain]] are supporters of the club and were the team's shirt sponsors for the [[2004\u201305 Newport County A.F.C. season|2004\u201305 season]] [[FAW Premier Cup]] matches<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3954739.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 UK \u2013 Wales \u2013 South East Wales \u2013 Rappers GLC sponsor football kit|work=BBC}}</ref>\n\n===Rivalries===\n{{Main|South Wales derby}}\nCounty fans consider their main rival to be [[South Wales]] rivals [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], however, the two sides have rarely met since the 1980s due to the league gap between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/fiercest-rivalries-biggest-local-grudge-11379193|title=These are the fiercest rivalries and biggest local grudge matches in the whole of Wales|work=Wales Online}}</ref> Other rivals, to a lesser extent, include Welsh rivals [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] as well as relatively local rivals [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] and [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]].

They immediately won the [[Hellenic Football League|Hellenic League]] in 1989\u201390 and were promoted out of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League Midland Division]] in 1994\u201395.

Newcastle player [[Len Shackleton]] remarked \"they were lucky to get nil\". Despite victories over [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], the club needed four wins out of the last four games to have any hope of safety. Despite a revenge victory over Newcastle United, defeats to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] sealed their fate.

The bottom 12 teams from the Third Division North and South were placed in the new division, with the remainder forming the revived [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].

However, the team continued to struggle until [[Colin Addison]] took over in January 1977.

[[Len Ashurst]] was manager from 1978 to 1982, the club's most successful period in its history and under the chairmanship of Richard Ford. In the [[1978\u201379 FA Cup]] County beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 2\u20131 in round three before losing 1\u20130 to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] in a fourth round replay. In [[1979\u201380 Newport County A.F.C. season|1980]], promotion was finally achieved from the Football League Fourth Division, the club being only five points from being crowned champions although never being in contention to win the league and never being top. County sealed promotion in the last match of the season with a 4\u20132 win at high-flying [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Walsall finished second in the league and were also promoted.\n\nThe team included a young [[John Aldridge]] who later became one of the most prolific goal-scorers in English football history, most famous for helping [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] win the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title in 1988 and FA Cup in 1989, as well as helping [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] win two successive promotions and the [[Football League Cup]].\n<!--<gallery>\n[[Image:county_past31.JPEG|thumb|alt=A Tommy Tynan scores the final goal to clinch promotion to Division 3 in Season 1979/80.]]\n[[Image:county_past32.JPEG|thumb|alt=A A Civic ride through Newport to celebrate the promotion and Welsh Cup win. 1979/80.]]\n</gallery>-->\n\nAlso in the promotion-winning team was [[Tommy Tynan]], one of the leading lower-league strikers of his era, who scored the all-important goal that sealed County's promotion.<ref name=\"countypast\" /> [[Dave Gwyther]] completed the trio of prolific goalscorers whilst captain [[Keith Oakes]] provided strength in cental defence. Youth team products [[Steve Lowndes]] and [[Nigel Vaughan]] went on to attain international caps for [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. This was also the year that County [[1980 Welsh Cup Final|won the Welsh Cup]], entitling them to play in the 1980\u201381 season [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]].\n\nThe [[1980\u201381 European Cup Winners' Cup]] turned out to be quite eventful \u2013 the first round against [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] of [[Northern Ireland]] was won 4\u20130 on aggregate (4\u20130 at home and 0\u20130 away). The second round against [[SK Haugar]] of [[Norway]] was even more convincing: after a 0\u20130 draw away, the home leg was won 6\u20130, taking the club into the quarter-finals against [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena|Carl Zeiss Jena F.C.]] of [[East Germany]]. Aldridge was injured for both matches against Carl Zeiss Jena, though he was a non-playing substitute in the 2nd leg. The quarter-final away leg was drawn 2\u20132 with Tommy Tynan scoring both goals, including his equaliser in the 90th minute. However, despite dominating the home leg, Newport lost 1\u20130 in front of 18,000 fans at Somerton Park, denying them a high-profile semi-final with [[S.L. Benfica]]. Carl Zeiss Jena went on to be the eventual cup runners-up, losing the final to [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe Newport County squad for the first leg was: 1 [[Gary Plumley]], 2 [[Richard Walden]], 3 [[John Relish]], 4 [[Grant Davies (footballer)|Grant Davies]], 5 [[Keith Oakes]] (Captain), 6 [[Tommy Tynan]], 7 [[Nigel Vaughan]], 8 [[Steve Lowndes]], 9 [[Dave Gwyther]], 10 [[Karl Elsey]], 11 [[Kevin Moore (footballer born 1956)|Kevin Moore]], 12 [[Neil Bailey]], 13 [[Steve Warriner]], 14 [[Dave Bruton (footballer)|Dave Bruton]], 15 [[Robert Ward (footballer)|Bobby Ward]], 16 [[Mark Kendall (footballer, born 1958)|Mark Kendall]].\n\nIn the [[1982\u201383 Newport County A.F.C. season|1982\u201383 season]] [[Colin Addison]], in his second spell as manager, led Newport County to their highest post-war league finish \u2013 4th in the Third Division, just four points behind third-placed [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. Huddersfield were promoted to the Second Division, along with champions [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and local rivals [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. County had actually gone top of the table in early April after a 1\u20130 win over Cardiff in front of 16,052 fans at Somerton Park, but a return of only four points from the last seven games meant County missed out on promotion. County faced [[Football League First Division|First-Division]] team [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the third round of the [[1982\u201383 FA Cup]]. After a 1\u20131 draw at Newport, Everton won the replay 2\u20131.\n\nIn 1986 County reached the FA Cup third round under manager [[Bobby Smith (footballer, born 1944)|Bobby Smith]], losing 2\u20130 to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].

They failed to finish their [[1988\u201389 Newport County A.F.C. season|first season]] in the [[National League (English football)|Conference]] and finally went out of business on 27 February 1989 with debts of \u00a3330,000. They were then expelled from the Conference for failing to fulfil their fixtures. Their record (four wins, seven draws and 19 points from 29 games) was expunged.\n\nThe BBC Wales current affairs programme ''Week in Week Out'' broadcast a documentary in 1989 about the winding up of Newport County and its controversial owner at the time, American Jerry Sherman.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/8562788.stm|author=BBC Sport|title=Jerry Sherman interview | work=BBC News | date=11 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1989 onwards===\n\n====Reformation and exile====\n[[Image:Newport Stadium - larger.jpg|right|thumb|Newport Stadium, 2004]]\n\nIn June 1989 the club was reformed by 400 supporters including David Hando as chairman; later club president. Former manager [[John Relish]] was re-appointed team manager and they were elected to the [[Hellenic Football League|Hellenic League]] (then four divisions below the Football League). The club's main aim was to regain the Football League status lost in 1988.

guidance from the UK Government backed charity [[Supporters Direct]]. The Society is established as a trust<ref>https://mutuals.fca.org.uk/Search/Society/8809</ref> with an elected board, yearly elections, regular AGMs, and fee-based supporter ownership.\n\nAs a Registered Society under the [[Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014]]) the group acquired a majority shareholding<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newport-county-fans-ready-take-10163183|title=Newport County fans ready to take over club, but battles ahead at Rodney Parade|last=Wathan|first=Chris|date=30 September 2015|website=walesonline|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> in the football club's trading body, Newport Association Football Club Limited.<ref>https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02395863</ref>\n\nAs a result of this model, the supporters trust members elect a board of between 6 and 12 Directors. The board has established that it will aim to operate with 9 directors, with a mixed model of elected and co-opted (unelected) directors. Directors are elected to three-year terms. In 2017 Peter Madigan and Mark Crook were co-opted to serve as unelected directors.\n\nIn 2017 a leaked resignation letter by director Charlie Hopkins made allegations against some serving directors which were refuted by the Trust Board.<ref>https://www.newport-county.co.uk/news/2017/october/club-statement-26102017/</ref>\n\n[[File:Newport County directors 2016-2022.svg|2048px|804px|Timeline showing the tenures of Newport County directors 2016-2022]]\n\n==Supporters==\n[[Image:Spytty the Dog.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Club mascot Spytty the Dog]]\nNewport County draws its main support from the city of Newport but also from the wider surrounding historic [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] area, as reflected in the original club name of ''Newport & Monmouth County A.F.C''. The club's supporters refer to themselves as the Amber Army, in reference to the traditional club colour, and the sporting colours more widely associated with Newport. Since 2009 the club has operated the popular and successful [[Internet radio]] commentary service for supporters.\n\nThe supporters' unofficial anthem is ''Come on the County'', written by Ken Buck and Eric Thomas. Originally released in 1973, it was re-recorded in 1999 and 2010. The 1999 release included the song ''Carl Zeiss Jena'' by Newport band Flyscreen, celebrating County's 1981 European campaign. The 2010 release included reworkings of ''Come on the County'' by The Tenants Supermen, who are ardent County fans. For the 2012 FA Trophy final, singer-songwriter Tracey Curtis wrote and released the song ''A Hundred Years of Football (And We're Off To Wembley)''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/9624971.Song_celebrates_County_s_Wembley_dream/|title=Song celebrates County's Wembley dream|publisher=[[South Wales Argus]]|date=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s comedian [[Frank Carson]] was appointed as a director and vice president in order to raise the profile of the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-17137248|title=Frank Carson death: Newport County on how comic's laughter lifted club|work=BBC News}}</ref> Newport-based rappers [[Goldie Lookin' Chain]] are supporters of the club and were the team's shirt sponsors for the [[2004\u201305 Newport County A.F.C. season|2004\u201305 season]] [[FAW Premier Cup]] matches<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3954739.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 UK \u2013 Wales \u2013 South East Wales \u2013 Rappers GLC sponsor football kit|work=BBC}}</ref>\n\n===Rivalries===\n{{Main|South Wales derby}}\nCounty fans consider their main rival to be [[South Wales]] rivals [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], however, the two sides have rarely met since the 1980s due to the league gap between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/fiercest-rivalries-biggest-local-grudge-11379193|title=These are the fiercest rivalries and biggest local grudge matches in the whole of Wales|work=Wales Online}}</ref> Other rivals, to a lesser extent, include Welsh rivals [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] as well as relatively local rivals [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] and [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]].

From the 1990s onwards, Atherton started to mainly focus on film editing.\n\nShe met with [[Chantal Akerman]] in 1984 on the occasion of the theater adaptation of ''[[Letters Home: Correspondence 1950\u20131963|Letters Home: Correspondence 1950-1963]]'' by [[Sylvia Plath]] which was played by [[Delphine Seyrig]] at the Petit th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Paris.

Their sloops were gaff-rigged, until the first triangular sails were introduced ca. 1840. The sloops were constructed in a range of sizes up to {{Convert|70|ft|m}}.

''Journal of Maritime Archaeology'', 2 (2) (October): 83\u201392.</ref> Cedar was favoured over oak as the latter would rot in about 10 years, while cedar would last for nigh on 30 years and was considerably lighter than oak.<ref name=\"evans\" /> When the ships needed to be de-fouled from seaweed and barnacles, pirates needed a safe haven on which to [[Careening|careen]] the ship. Sloops were well suited for this because they were able to sail in shallow areas where larger ships would either run aground or be unable to sail through at all. These shallow waters also provided protection from ships of the British [[Royal Navy]], which tended to be larger and required deep water to sail safely.<ref name=\"evans\" />\n\nLater in the 19th century, the design of Bermudian vessels had largely dispensed with square topsails and gaff rig, replacing them with triangular main sails and jibs. The Bermuda rig had traditionally been used on vessels with two or more masts, with the gaff rig favoured for single-masted vessels. The reason for this was the increased height necessary for a single mast, which led to too much canvas. The solid wooden masts at that height were also too heavy, and not sufficiently strong. Single-masted sloops quickly became the norm in Bermudian racing, with the introduction of hollow masts and other refinements.<ref name=\"Drower\">''Boats, Boffins and Bowlines: The Stories of Sailing Inventors and Innovations'', by George Drower. The History Press. 1 May 2011. {{ISBN|075246065X}}</ref>\n\nThe colony's lightweight [[Juniperus bermudiana|Bermuda cedar]] vessels were widely prized for their agility and speed, especially upwind. The high, raked masts and long bowsprits and booms favoured in Bermuda allowed its vessels of all sizes to carry vast areas of sail when running down-wind with spinnakers and multiple jibs, allowing great speeds to be reached. Bermudian work boats, mostly small sloops, were ubiquitous on the archipelago's waters in the 19th century, moving freight, people, and everything else about. The rig was eventually adopted almost universally on small sailing craft in the 20th Century, although as seen on most modern vessels it is very much less extreme than on traditional Bermudian designs, with lower, vertical masts, shorter booms, omitted bowsprits, and much less area of canvas.<ref name=Drower/>\n\n==Merchant and privateering use==\nThe Bermuda sloop became the predominant type of sailing vessel both in the Bermudian colony and among [[sloop|sloop rigs]] worldwide as Bermudian traders visited foreign nations. Soon, shipbuilding became one of the primary trades on the island and ships were exported throughout the English colonies on the American seaboard, in the [[West Indies]], and eventually to [[Europe]]. Bermudians, largely slaves, built roughly a thousand ships during the 18th century. Although many of these were sold abroad, the colony maintained its own large merchant fleet which, thanks partly to the domination of trade in many American seaboard ports by branches of wealthy Bermudian families and partly to the suitability and availability of Bermudian vessels, carried much of the produce exported from the American south to Bermuda and to the West Indies aboard Bermudian mostly slave-manned vessels sailed southwest (more-or-less upwind) to the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Turk Islands]], where salt was harvested. This salt was carried to North American ports and sold at high profits. Bermudian vessels also developed a trade in moving goods such as grain, cocoa, brandy, wine and more from the [[Atlantic seaboard]] colonies to the [[West Indies]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/heritage-heritage/bermuda-in-the-privateering-business/|title=Bermuda in the Privateering Business|last=Shorto|first=Gavin|date=2018-04-05|work=The Bermudian Magazine|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe threat of [[pirate|piracy]] and [[privateering]] was a large problem for mariners of all nations during the 17th and 18th centuries, but it was also as widely popular an enterprise. During wartime, much of Bermuda's merchant fleet turned to more lucrative labors: privateering. The evasive capabilities highly prized by merchantmen also made Bermuda sloops the ship of choice for the pirates themselves, earlier in the 18th century, as well as for smugglers. They often carried sufficient crew out to return with several prizes, and these extra crew were useful both as movable ballast, and in handling the labor-intensive sloops. The shape of the ship enabled Bermudian mariners to excel. The same abilities allowed Bermuda sloops to escape from better-armed privateers and even larger [[Man-of-war]] British naval ships which, with their [[square rig]]s, could not sail as closely to windward. The ability of the sloop rig in general to sail upwind meant a Bermuda sloop could outrun most other sailing ships by simply turning upwind and leaving its pursuers floundering in its wake.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite Bermudian privateers preying heavily on American shipping during the [[American War of Independence]], some historians credit the large number of Bermuda sloops (reckoned at well over a thousand) built in Bermuda as privateers and sold illegally to the Americans as enabling the rebellious colonies to win their independence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Slavery and the Bermuda sloop==\nThe commercial success of the Bermuda sloop must be credited to the contribution of Bermuda's free and [[slavery|enslaved]] Blacks. For most of the 17th century, Bermuda's agricultural economy was reliant on indentured servants. This meant that slavery did not play the same role as in many other colonies, though privateers based in Bermuda often brought enslaved blacks and Native Americans who had been captured along with ships of enemy nations. The first large influx of blacks was of free men who came as indentured servants in the middle of the century from former Spanish colonies in the West Indies (the increasing numbers of black, Spanish-speaking probable-Catholics alarmed the white Protestant majority, who were also alarmed by native Irish sent to Bermuda to be sold into servitude after the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], and measures were taken to discourage black immigration and to ban the importation of Irish). After 1684, Bermuda turned wholesale to a maritime economy, and slaves, black, Amerindian, and Irish (the various minorities merged into a single demographic group, known as ''coloured'', which included anyone who was not defined as entirely of European extraction), played an increasing role in this. [[Black Bermudian]]<nowiki/>s became highly skilled shipwrights, blacksmiths and joiners. Many of the shipwrights who helped to develop shipbuilding in the American South, especially on the [[Virginia]] shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] (Bermuda, also known as ''Virgineola'', had once been part of Virginia, and had maintained close connections ever since), were black Bermudian slaves, and the design and success of the area's schooners owes something to them, also.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIjfAAAAMAAJ|title=Tidewater Triumph: The Development and Worldwide Success of the Chesapeake Bay Pilot Schooner|last=Footner|first=Geoffrey M.|date=1998|publisher=Tidewater Publishers|isbn=9780870335112|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDue to the large number of white Bermudian men who were away at sea at any one time (and possibly due as much to fear of the larger number of enslaved black Bermudian men left behind) it was mandated that blacks must make up a percentage of the crew of every Bermudian vessel.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLrqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA526|title=In the Eye of All Trade: Bermuda, Bermudians, and the Maritime Atlantic World, 1680-1783|last=Jarvis|first=Michael J.|date=2012|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807895887|language=en}}</ref> By the American War of Independence, the use of many able black slaves as sailors added considerably to the power of the Bermudian merchant fleet due to their highly needed skill set, and these included the crews of Bermudian privateers. When the Americans captured the Bermudian privateer ''Regulator'', they discovered that virtually all of her crew were black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but nearly all of the 70 captives elected to be treated as [[Prisoner of War|prisoners of war]], claiming slavery was all they knew and out of fear for their families who were still in Bermuda.

Motor vehicles were banned in Bermuda until after the [[Second World War]], and the roads were few and poor until the requirements of that war advanced their development. Boats, as a consequence, remained the primary method of moving people and materials around Bermuda well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1djAAAAMAAJ|title=The Bermuda Maritime Museum and the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|last=Arnell|first=J.

Spinnaker booms and multiple jibs are rarely seen.

The ability of the sloop rig in general to sail upwind meant a Bermuda sloop could outrun most other sailing ships by simply turning upwind and leaving its pursuers floundering in its wake.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite Bermudian privateers preying heavily on American shipping during the [[American War of Independence]], some historians credit the large number of Bermuda sloops (reckoned at well over a thousand) built in Bermuda as privateers and sold illegally to the Americans as enabling the rebellious colonies to win their independence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Slavery and the Bermuda sloop==\nThe commercial success of the Bermuda sloop must be credited to the contribution of Bermuda's free and [[slavery|enslaved]] Blacks. For most of the 17th century, Bermuda's agricultural economy was reliant on indentured servants. This meant that slavery did not play the same role as in many other colonies, though privateers based in Bermuda often brought enslaved blacks and Native Americans who had been captured along with ships of enemy nations. The first large influx of blacks was of free men who came as indentured servants in the middle of the century from former Spanish colonies in the West Indies (the increasing numbers of black, Spanish-speaking probable-Catholics alarmed the white Protestant majority, who were also alarmed by native Irish sent to Bermuda to be sold into servitude after the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], and measures were taken to discourage black immigration and to ban the importation of Irish). After 1684, Bermuda turned wholesale to a maritime economy, and slaves, black, Amerindian, and Irish (the various minorities merged into a single demographic group, known as ''coloured'', which included anyone who was not defined as entirely of European extraction), played an increasing role in this. [[Black Bermudian]]<nowiki/>s became highly skilled shipwrights, blacksmiths and joiners. Many of the shipwrights who helped to develop shipbuilding in the American South, especially on the [[Virginia]] shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] (Bermuda, also known as ''Virgineola'', had once been part of Virginia, and had maintained close connections ever since), were black Bermudian slaves, and the design and success of the area's schooners owes something to them, also.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIjfAAAAMAAJ|title=Tidewater Triumph: The Development and Worldwide Success of the Chesapeake Bay Pilot Schooner|last=Footner|first=Geoffrey M.|date=1998|publisher=Tidewater Publishers|isbn=9780870335112|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDue to the large number of white Bermudian men who were away at sea at any one time (and possibly due as much to fear of the larger number of enslaved black Bermudian men left behind) it was mandated that blacks must make up a percentage of the crew of every Bermudian vessel.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLrqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA526|title=In the Eye of All Trade: Bermuda, Bermudians, and the Maritime Atlantic World, 1680-1783|last=Jarvis|first=Michael J.|date=2012|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807895887|language=en}}</ref> By the American War of Independence, the use of many able black slaves as sailors added considerably to the power of the Bermudian merchant fleet due to their highly needed skill set, and these included the crews of Bermudian privateers.

Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but nearly all of the 70 captives elected to be treated as [[Prisoner of War|prisoners of war]], claiming slavery was all they knew and out of fear for their families who were still in Bermuda.

The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. ''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such \"in conformity with the world\"; omniscience, and the ability to \"suppress karma\".{{sfn|Jones|1956|p=}} As noted by Andrew Skilton, the Buddha was often described as being superhuman, including descriptions of him having the 32 major and 80 minor marks of a \"great man,\" and the idea that the Buddha could live for as long as an aeon if he wished (see DN 16).{{sfn|Skilton|2004|pp=64\u201365}} \n\nThe ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the [[Jain Agamas (\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara)|Jain scriptures]], and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in [[History of India|Indian history]] for which significant accounts exist.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=15}} British author [[Karen Armstrong]] writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.{{sfn|Armstrong|2000|p=xii}} Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of \"birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death\" must be true.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=}}\n\n== Previous lives ==\n[[File:Ascetic Sumedha and Dipankara Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary Jataka collections depict the Buddha-to-be in a previous life prostrating before the past Buddha [[Dipankara]], making a resolve to be a Buddha, and receiving a prediction of future Buddhahood.]]\nLegendary biographies like the Pali ''[[Buddhava\u1e43sa]]'' and the Sanskrit ''J\u0101takam\u0101l\u0101'' depict the Buddha's (referred to as \"[[bodhisattva]]\" before his awakening) career as spanning hundreds of lifetimes before his last birth as Gautama.

He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed, and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is \"subtle, deep and hard to grasp.\" However, the god [[Brahma (Buddhism)#Brahm\u0101 Sahampati|Brahm\u0101 Sahampati]] convinced him, arguing that at least some \"with little dust in their eyes\" will understand it. The Buddha relented and agreed to teach.

This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the [[Vassa]] rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled.

He is said to have gifted [[Jetavana|Jeta's grove]] (''Jetavana'') to the sangha at great expense (the Theravada Vinaya speaks of thousands of gold coins).<ref>[[\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 91.</ref><ref>[[John S.

As noted by Analayo's comparative study of this topic, there are various versions of this event depicted in the different early Buddhist texts.<ref>Analayo (2016), pp. 40\u201341. Analayo draws from seven early sources: \"the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in Four Parts, preserved in Chinese; \u2013 a *Vinayam\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101 preserved in Chinese translation, which some scholars suggest represents the Haimavata tradition; the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika-Lokottarav\u0101da Vinaya, preserved in Sanskrit; \u2013 the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya in Five Parts, preserved in Chinese; \u2013 the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Vinaya, where the episode is extant in Chinese and Tibetan translation, with considerable parts also preserved in Sanskrit fragments; \u2013 a discourse in the Madhyama-\u0101gama, preserved in Chinese, probably representing the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition; a P\u0101li discourse found among the Eights of the A\u1e45guttara-nik\u0101ya; the same account is also found in the Therav\u0101da Vinaya preserved in P\u0101li.\"  </ref>\n\nAccording to all the major versions surveyed by Analayo, [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b Gautam\u012b]], Buddha's step-mother, is initially turned down by the Buddha after requesting ordination for her and some other women. Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b and her followers then shave their hair, don robes and begin following the Buddha on his travels. The Buddha is eventually convinced by \u0100nanda to grant ordination to Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b on her acceptance of [[Eight Garudhammas|eight conditions called gurudharmas]] which focus on the relationship between the new order of nuns and the monks.<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 43. </ref>\n\nAccording to Analayo, the only argument common to all the versions that Ananda uses to convince the Buddha is that women have the same ability to reach all stages of awakening.<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 79.</ref> Analayo also notes that some modern scholars have questioned the authenticity of the eight gurudharmas in their present form due to various inconsistencies. He holds that the historicity of the current lists of eight is doubtful, but that they may have been based on earlier injunctions by the Buddha.<ref>[[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo, Bhikkhu]] (2013). \"The Gurudharmaon Bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b Ordination in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Tradition\" (PDF).

Due to this, the gurudharma injunctions may have been a way to place \"the newly founded order of nuns in a relationship to its male counterparts that resembles as much as possible the protection a laywoman could expect from her male relatives.\"<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 127.</ref>\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Procession of Prasenajit of Kosala leaving Sravasti to meet the Buddha.jpg|thumb|Procession of King [[Prasenajit]] of [[Kosala]] leaving [[Sravasti]] to meet the Buddha.

Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 136.</ref>\n\nAs the sangha grew in size, the need for a standardized set of monastic rules arose and the Buddha seems to have developed a set of regulations for the sangha. These are preserved in various texts called \"[[Pratimok\u1e63a|Pratimoksa]]\" which were recited by the community every fortnight. The Pratimoksa includes general ethical precepts, as well as rules regarding the essentials of monastic life, such as bowls and robes.<ref>[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 134.</ref>\n\nIn his later years, the Buddha's fame grew and he was invited to important royal events, such as the inauguration of the new council hall of the Shakyans (as seen in MN 53) and the inauguration of a new palace by Prince Bodhi (as depicted in MN 85).<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], pp. 232\u201333.</ref> The early texts also speak of how during the Buddha's old age, the kingdom of Magadha was usurped by a new king, [[Ajatashatru|Ajatasattu]], who overthrew his father [[Bimbisara]]. According to the ''Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta,'' the new king spoke with different ascetic teachers and eventually took refuge in the Buddha.<ref>Jain, Kailash Chand (1991), ''Lord Mah\u0101v\u012bra and His Times'', p. 79, [[Motilal Banarsidass]], {{ISBN|978-81-208-0805-8}}</ref> However, Jain sources also claim his allegiance, and it is likely he supported various religious groups, not just the Buddha's sangha exclusively.<ref>Mahajan V.D.

The ''Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta'' identifies six such sects.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 215.</ref>\n\nThe early texts also depict the elderly Buddha as suffering from back pain. Several texts depict him delegating teachings to his chief disciples since his body now needed more rest.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 232.</ref> However, the Buddha continued teaching well into his old age.  \n\nOne of the most troubling events during the Buddha's old age was [[Devadatta|Devadatta's]] schism. Early sources speak of how the Buddha's cousin, Devadatta, attempted to take over leadership of the order and then left the sangha with several Buddhist monks and formed a rival sect. This sect is said to have also been supported by King Ajatasattu.<ref>Analayo (2011).

The [[Sthavira nik\u0101ya|Sthavira]] texts generally focus on \"five points\" which are seen as excessive ascetic practices, while the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghika]] Vinaya speaks of a more comprehensive disagreement, which has Devadatta alter the discourses as well as monastic discipline.<ref>Bhikkhu Sujato (2012), ''[http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WhyDevadattaWasNoSaint.pdf \"Why Devadatta Was No Saint, A critique of Reginald Ray\u2019s thesis of the \u2018condemned saint\u2019\"]'' </ref>\n\nAt around the same time of Devadatta's schism, there was also war between Ajatasattu's Kingdom of Magadha, and Kosala, led by an elderly king Pasenadi.<ref>[[\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 280.</ref> Ajatasattu seems to have been victorious, a turn of events the Buddha is reported to have regretted.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 239.</ref>\n\n=== Last days and ''parinirvana''  ===\n[[File:040 Ananda worships Buddha (25595318747).jpg|thumb|This East Javanese relief depicts the Buddha in his final days, and [[\u0100nanda]], his chief attendant. |alt=Metal relief |upright=1.3]]\n\nThe main narrative of the Buddha's last days, death and the events following his death is contained in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]'' (DN 16) and its various parallels in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan.<ref>[[John S.

It also depicts him as stating that he cannot promote anyone to be his successor. When \u0100nanda requested this, the ''Mahaparinibbana'' records his response as follows:<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 246.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Ananda, why does the Order of monks expect this of me? I have taught the Dhamma, making no distinction of \u201cinner\u201d and \u201c outer\u201d: the Tathagata has no \u201cteacher\u2019s fist\u201d (in which certain truths are held back). If there is anyone who thinks: \u201cI shall take charge of the Order\u201d, or \u201cthe Order is under my leadership\u201d, such a person would have to make arrangements about the Order. The Tathagata does not think in such terms. Why should the Tathagata make arrangements for the Order? I am now old, worn out . . . I have reached the term of life, I am turning eighty years of age. Just as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps, so the Tathagata's body is kept going by being bandaged up . . . Therefore, Ananda, you should live as islands unto yourselves, being your own refuge, seeking no other refuge; with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, seeking no other refuge. . . Those monks who in my time or afterwards live thus, seeking an island and a refuge in themselves and in the Dhamma and nowhere else, these zealous ones are truly my monks and will overcome the darkness (of rebirth).</blockquote>\n[[File:Dying Buddha (Mahaparinirvana), Gandhara, 3rd or 4th century AD, gray schist - John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art - Sarasota, FL - DSC00665.jpg|thumb|[[Parinirvana|Mahaparinirvana]], Gandhara, 3rd or 4th century CE, gray schist]]\n[[File:19th_century_sketch_and_21st_century_photo_collage,_Cave_26_Ajanta,_Buddha_Parinirvana.jpg|thumb|Mahaparinibbana scene, from the [[Ajanta caves]]]]\n\nAfter traveling and teaching some more, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named [[Cunda (Buddhism)|Cunda]].

Various conditions are outlined in the early texts, such as [[Ta\u1e47h\u0101|craving (''ta\u1e47h\u0101'')]], but the three most basic ones are [[Three poisons|greed, aversion and delusion]].<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>\n*If the conditions for dukkha cease, dukkha also ceases. This is \"[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]\" (literally 'blowing out' or 'extinguishing').<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 75.</ref>\n*There is path to follow that leads to Nirvana. \n\nAccording to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], the four truths schema appears to be based \"on an analogy with [[Ayurveda|Indian medical]] diagnosis\" (with the form: \"disease, pathogen, health, cure\") and this comparison is \"explicitly made in several early Buddhist texts\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn another Pali sutta, the Buddha outlines how \"eight worldly conditions\", \"keep the world turning around...Gain and loss, fame and disrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain.\" He then explains how the difference between a noble (''arya'') person and an uninstructed worldling is that a noble person reflects on and understands the impermanence of these conditions.<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 32-33.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's analysis of existence includes an understanding that [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] are part of life. According to the Buddha, the constant cycle of dying and being reborn (i.e. sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) according to one's karma is just dukkha and the ultimate spiritual goal should be liberation from this cycle.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 12.</ref> According to the Pali suttas, the Buddha stated that \"this sa\u1e43s\u0101ra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.\"<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 39.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's teaching of karma differed to that of the Jains and Brahmins, in that on his view, karma is primarily mental intention (as opposed to mainly physical action or ritual acts).<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> The Buddha is reported to have said \"By karma I mean intention.\"<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 49.</ref> Richard Gombrich summarizes the Buddha's view of karma as follows: \"all thoughts, words, and deeds derive their moral value, positive or negative, from the intention behind them.\"<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 13.</ref>\n\nFor the Buddha, our karmic acts also affected the rebirth process in a positive or negative way. This was seen as an impersonal natural law similar to how certain seeds produce certain plants and fruits (in fact, the result of a karmic act was called its \"fruit\" by the Buddha).<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 19.</ref> However, it is important to note that the Buddha did not hold that everything that happens is the result of karma alone. In fact when the Buddha was asked to state the causes of pain and pleasure he listed various physical and environmental causes alongside karma.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 20.</ref>\n\n====Dependent Origination====\n[[File:Buddha teaching Dharma, on lion throne.jpg|thumb|150px|Schist Buddha statue with the famed [[Ye Dharma Hetu]] [[dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b]] around the head, which was used as a common summary of Dependent Origination. It states: \"Of those experiences that arise from a cause, The Tath\u0101gata has said: 'this is their cause, And this is their cessation': This is what the Great \u015arama\u1e47a teaches.\"]]\nIn the early texts, the process of the arising of dukkha is most thoroughly explained by the Buddha through the teaching of [[Dependent Origination]].<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> At its most basic level, Dependent Origination is an empirical teaching on the nature of phenomena which says that nothing is experienced independently of its conditions.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe most basic formulation of Dependent Origination is given in the early texts as: 'It being thus, this comes about' (Pali: ''evam sati idam hoti'').<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref> This can be taken to mean that certain phenomena only arise when there are other phenomena present (example: when there is craving, suffering arises), and so, one can say that their arising is \"dependent\" on other phenomena. In other words, nothing in experience exists without a cause.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn numerous early texts, this basic principle is expanded with a list of phenomena that are said to be conditionally dependent.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>{{refn|group=note|One common basic list of twelve elements in the Early Buddhist Texts goes as follows: \"Conditioned by (1) ignorance are (2) formations, conditioned by formations is (3) consciousness, conditioned by consciousness is (4) mind-and-body, conditioned by mind-and-body are (5) the six senses, conditioned by the six senses is (6) sense-contact, conditioned by sense-contact is (7) feeling, conditioned by feeling is (8) craving, conditioned by craving is (9) grasping, conditioned by grasping is (10) becoming, conditioned by becoming is (11) birth, conditioned by birth is (12) old-age and death-grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair come into being. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.\"<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>}} These phenomena are supposed to provide an analysis of the cycle of dukkha as experienced by sentient beings. The philosopher Mark Siderits has outlined the basic idea of the Buddha's teaching of Dependent Origination of dukkha as follows: \n\n<blockquote>given the existence of a fully functioning assemblage of psycho-physical elements (the parts that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the three characteristics of sentient existence\u2014suffering, impermanence and non-self\u2014will lead, in the course of normal interactions with the environment, to appropriation (the identification of certain elements as \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018mine\u2019). This leads in turn to the formation of attachments, in the form of desire and aversion, and the strengthening of ignorance concerning the true nature of sentient existence. These ensure future rebirth, and thus future instances of old age, disease and death, in a potentially unending cycle.<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Buddha saw his analysis of Dependent Origination as a \"Middle Way\" between \"eternalism\" (''sassatavada'', the idea that some essence exists eternally) and \"annihilationism\" (''ucchedavada'', the idea that we go completely out of existence at death).<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref> This middle way is basically the view that, conventionally speaking, persons are just a causal series of impermanent psycho-physical elements.<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\n==== Metaphysics and personal identity ====\nClosely connected to the idea that experience is dependently originated is the Buddha's teaching that there is no independent or permanent self (Sanskrit: [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|''atman'']], Pali: ''atta'').<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 22.</ref>\n\nDue to this view which (termed [[anatta|''anatta'']]), the Buddha's teaching was opposed to all soul theories of his time, including the Jain theory of a ''\"[[jiva]]\"'' (\"life monad\") and the Brahmanical theories of atman and [[purusha]]. All of these theories held that there was an eternal unchanging [[essence]] to a person which transmigrated from life to life.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 20.</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 62\u201364.</ref><ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\nWhile Brahminical teachers affirmed atman theories in an attempt to answer the question of what really exists ultimately, the Buddha saw this question as not being useful, as illustrated in [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|the parable of the poisoned arrow]].<ref>Hamilton (2000) pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n\nFor the Buddha's contemporaries, the atman was also seen to be the unchanging constant which was separate from all changing experiences and the inner controller in a person.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> The Buddha instead held that all things in the world of our experience are transient and that there is no unchanging part to a person.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 9, 67.</ref> According to Richard Gombrich, the Buddha's position is simply that \"everything is process\".<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 10.</ref> However, this [[Anti-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] view still includes an understanding of continuity through rebirth, it is just the rebirth of a process (karma), not an essence like the atman.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most important way the Buddha analyzed individual experience in the early texts was by way of the [[Skandha|five 'aggregates' or 'groups' (''khandha'')]] of physical and mental processes.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 135.</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 114.</ref> The [[Buddhist_philosophy#Anatta|Buddha's arguments against an unchanging self]] rely on these five aggregate schema, as can be seen in the Pali ''[[Anattalakkha\u1e47a Sutta]]'' (and its parallels in Gandhari and Chinese)''.''<ref>Hamilton (2000) pp. 19\u201320.</ref><ref>Andrew Glass, Mark Allon (2007).

Also, since they are all impermanent, one cannot regard any of the psycho-physical processes as an unchanging self.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 136-137.</ref><ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> Even mental processes such as [[Vij\u00f1\u0101na|consciousness]] and will ([[cetana|''cetana'']]) are seen as being dependently originated and impermanent and thus do not qualify as a self (''atman'').<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\nAs noted by Gombrich, in the early texts the Buddha teaches that all five aggregates, including consciousness (''[[Vij\u00f1\u0101na|vi\u00f1\u00f1ana]]'', which was held by Brahmins to be eternal), arise dependent on causes.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 119-120.</ref> That is, existence is based on processes that are subject to dependent origination. He compared samsaric existence to a fire, which is dynamic and requires fuel (the ''khandas'', literally: \"heaps\") in order to keep burning.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 124-125.</ref>\n\nAs [[Rupert Gethin]] explains, for the Buddha:\n\n<blockquote>I am a complex flow of physical and mental phenomena, but peel away these phenomena and look behind them and one just does not find a constant self that one can call one's own. My sense of self is both logically and emotionally just a label that I impose on these physical and mental phenomena in consequence of their connectedness.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 139.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Buddha saw the belief in a self as arising from our grasping at and identifying with the various changing phenomena, as well as from ignorance about how things really are.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 146-147.</ref> Furthermore, the Buddha held that we experience suffering because we hold on to erroneous self views.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 148.</ref><ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 27.</ref>\n\n====Worldly happiness====\nAs noted by [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the Buddha as depicted in the Pali suttas does not exclusively teach a world transcending goal, but also teaches laypersons how to achieve worldly [[happiness]] (''sukha'').<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 107\u2013109.</ref> \n\nAccording to Bodhi, the \"most comprehensive\" of the suttas that focus on how to live as a layperson is the ''[[Sig\u0101lov\u0101da Sutta]]'' (DN 31). This sutta outlines how a layperson behaves towards six basic social relationships: \"parents and children, teacher and pupils, husband and wife, friend and friend, employer and workers, lay follower and religious guides.\" <ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 109.</ref> This Pali text also has parallels in Chinese and in Sanskrit fragments.<ref>Pannasiri, Bhadanta (1950). \"Sig\u0101lov\u0101da-Sutta\", Visva-Bharati Annals, 3:\n150\u2013228. </ref><ref>Martini, Giuliana (2013). \"Bodhisattva Texts, Ideologies and Rituals in Khotan in the Fifth and Sixth Centuries\", in Buddhism among the Iranian Peoples\nof Central Asia, M.

First, there is the happiness visible in this very life. The Buddha states that four things lead to this happiness: \"The accomplishment of persistent effort, the accomplishment of protection, good friendship, and balanced living.\"<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 124</ref> Similarly, in several other suttas, the Buddha teaches on how to improve family relationships, particularly on the importance of filial love and gratitude as well as marital well-being.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 110</ref>\n\nRegarding the happiness of the next life, the Buddha (in the ''[[D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u Sutta]]'') states that the virtues which lead to a good rebirth are: [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] (in the Buddha and the teachings), moral discipline, especially keeping the [[five precepts]], generosity, and wisdom (knowledge of the arising and passing of things).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 111, 125.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Buddha of the suttas then, achieving a good rebirth is based on cultivating wholesome or skillful (''kusala'') karma, which leads to a good result, and avoiding unwholesome (''akusala'') karma. A common list of good karmas taught by the Buddha is the list of ten courses of action (''[[kammapatha]]'') as outlined in MN 41 ''Saleyyaka Sutta'' (and its Chinese parallel in S\u0100 1042).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 146\u2013148, 156.</ref><ref>Analayo (2011). \"A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nik\u0101ya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),\" p. 263.</ref>\n\nGood karma is also termed [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit (''pu\u00f1\u00f1a'')]], and the Buddha outlines three bases of meritorious actions: giving, moral discipline and meditation (as seen in AN 8:36).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 151, 167.</ref>\n\n==== The Path to Liberation ====\n[[File:Seated_Buddha,_Pakistan_or_Afghanistan,_Ghandhara_region,_2nd_-_3rd_century,_gray_schist,_HAA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Gandharan]] sculpture depicting the Buddha in the [[Lotus position|full lotus]] seated meditation posture, 2nd-3rd century CE]]\n[[File:20160124_Sri_Lanka_3769_Polonnaruwa_sRGB_(25144212713).jpg|thumb|200px|Buddha Statues from [[Gal Vihara]].

Various suttas discuss the different drawbacks of sensuality. In the ''Potaliya Sutta'' (MN 54) sensual pleasures are said by the Buddha to be a cause of conflict for all humans beings.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 195</ref> They are said to be unable to satisfy one's craving, like a clean meatless bone given to a dog.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 199</ref> Sensuality is also compared to a torch held against the wind, since it burns the person holding on to it.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 200</ref> According to the Buddha, there is \"a delight apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, which surpasses even divine bliss.\" The Buddha thus taught that one should take delight in the higher spiritual pleasures instead of sensual pleasure.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 204.</ref> This is explained with the simile the leper, who cauterizes his skin with fire to get relief from the pain of leprosy, but after he is cured, avoids the same flames he used to enjoy before (see MN 75, ''Magandiya Sutta'').<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 205.</ref>\n\nNumerous scholars such as Vetter have written on the centrality of the practice of [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|''dhy\u0101na'']] to the teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988a|pp=xxx, xxxv\u2013xxxvi, 4\u20135}} It is the training of the mind, commonly translated as [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], to withdraw the mind from the automatic responses to sense-impressions, and leading to a \"state of perfect [[Upekkha|equanimity]] and awareness (''upekkh\u0101-sati-parisuddhi'').\"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}} Dhyana is preceded and supported by various aspects of the path such as seclusion and sense restraint.<ref>Analayo (2017). \"Early Buddhist meditation studies,\" pp. 80, 128, 135.</ref>\n\nAnother important mental training in the early texts is the practice of [[mindfulness]] (''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]''), which was mainly taught using the schemas of the \"Four Ways of Mindfulness\" (''[[Satipatthana]]'', as taught in the Pali ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' and its various parallel texts) and the sixteen elements of \"Mindfulness of Breath\" (''[[Anapanasati]]'', as taught in the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]'' and its various parallels).<ref>For a comparative survey of Satipatthana in the Pali, Tibetan and Chinese sources, see: ''Analayo (2014), \"Perspectives on Satipatthana.\"'' For a comparative survey of Anapanasati, see: ''Dhammajoti KL (2008), \"Sixteen-mode Mindfulness of Breathing\", JCBSSL v.

This is because he did not see these questions as being useful on the path and as not being \"connected to the goal\".<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 66.</ref>\n\n====Monasticism====\nThe early Buddhist texts depict the Buddha as promoting the life of a homeless and [[Celibacy|celibate]] \"''sramana''\", or mendicant, as the ideal way of life for the practice of the path.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 85, 88.</ref> He taught that mendicants or \"beggars\" ([[Bhikkhu|''bhikkhus'']]) were supposed to give up all possessions and to own just a begging bowl and three robes. <ref>Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.</ref> As part of the Buddha's monastic discipline, they were also supposed to rely on the wider lay community for the basic necessities (mainly food, clothing, and lodging).<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 85</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's teachings on monastic discipline were preserved in the various [[Vinaya]] collections of the different early schools.<ref>Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.</ref>\n\nBuddhist monastics, which included both monks and nuns, were supposed to beg for their food, were not allowed to store up food or eat after noon and they were not allowed to use gold, silver or any valuables.<ref>Heirman, Ann (2019). \"Vinaya rules for monks and nuns.\"</ref><ref>Gethin (1998), p. 87</ref>\n\n====Socio-political teachings====\nThe early texts depict the Buddha as giving a deflationary account of the importance of politics to human life. Politics is inevitable and is probably even necessary and helpful, but it is also a tremendous waste of time and effort, as well as being a prime temptation to allow ego to run rampant. Buddhist political theory denies that people have a moral duty to engage in politics except to a very minimal degree (pay the taxes, obey the laws, maybe vote in the elections), and it actively portrays engagement in politics and the pursuit of enlightenment as being conflicting paths in life.<ref>Matthew J. Moore, ''Buddhism and Political Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2016  {{ISBN|9780190465513}} p.2</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta]]'', the Buddha teaches a history of how monarchy arose which according to Matthew J. Moore is \"closely analogous to a social contract.\" The ''Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta'' also provides a social explanation of how different classes arose, in contrast to the Vedic views on social caste.<ref name=\":7\">Moore, Matthew J.

This ideal leader is one who promotes Dharma through his governance. He can only achieve his status through moral purity and must promote morality and Dharma to maintain his position. According to the ''Cakkavatti-S\u012bhan\u0101da Sutta'', the key duties of a Cakkavatti are: \"establish guard, ward, and protection according to Dhamma for your own household, your troops, your nobles, and vassals, for Brahmins and householders, town and country folk, ascetics and Brahmins, for beasts and birds. let no crime prevail in your kingdom, and to those who are in need, give property.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> The sutta explains the injunction to give to the needy by telling how a line of wheel-turning monarchs falls because they fail to give to the needy, and thus the kingdom falls into infighting as poverty increases, which then leads to stealing and violence.{{refn|group=note|\"thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, poverty became rife, from the growth of poverty, the taking of what was not given increased, from the increase of theft, the use of weapons increased, from the increased use of weapons, the taking of life increased \u2014 and from the increase in the taking of life, people\u2019s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and [as] a result of this decrease of life-span and beauty, the children of those whose life-span had been eighty-thousand years lived for only forty thousand.\"<ref>Moore, Matthew J. ''\"Political theory in Canonical Buddhism.\"'' Philosophy East & West Volume 65, Number 1 January 2015 36\u201364</ref>}}\n\nIn the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta,'' the Buddha outlines several principles that he promoted among the Vajjian tribal federation, which had a quasi-republican form of government. He taught them to \u201chold regular and frequent assemblies\u201d, live in harmony and maintain their traditions. The Buddha then goes on to promote a similar kind of republican style of government among the Buddhist Sangha, where all monks had equal rights to attend open meetings and there would be no single leader, since The Buddha also chose not to appoint one.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some scholars have argued that this fact signals that the Buddha preferred a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government, while others disagree with this position.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Scholarly views on the earliest teachings ===\n{{Main|Presectarian Buddhism}}\n[[File:Kanishka Buddha detail.jpg|thumb|150px|The Buddha on a coin of [[Kanishka I]], {{circa|130}} CE.]]\n\nNumerous scholars of early Buddhism argue that most of the teachings found in the Early Buddhist texts date back to the Buddha himself. One of these is [[Richard Gombrich]], who argues that since the content of the earliest texts \u201cpresents such originality, intelligence, grandeur and\u2014most relevantly\u2014coherence...it is hard to see it as a composite work.\" Thus he concludes they are \"the work of one genius.\"<ref>Gombrich, Richard (2006). ''\"Therav\u0101da Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo,\"'' p. 21. The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices Series. Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> \n\n[[Peter Harvey]] also agrees that \u201cmuch\u201d of the Pali Canon \u201cmust derive from his [the Buddha\u2019s] teachings.\u201d<ref>Harvey, Peter (1990). ''\"An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices,\"'' p. 3. Introduction to Religion. Cambridge University Press.</ref> Likewise, [[A.\u200aK. Warder]] has written that \u201cthere is no evidence to suggest that it [the shared teaching of the early schools] was formulated by anyone other than the Buddha and his immediate followers.\u201d<ref>Warder, A.K (2000). \"''Indian Buddhism,\"'' inside flap''.'' Buddhism Series. Motilal Banarsidass.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Alexander Wynne argues that \"the internal evidence of the early Buddhist literature proves its historical authenticity.\"<ref>Wynne, Alexander. \u201cThe Historical Authenticity of Early Buddhist Literature\u201d. In: Vienna Journal of South Asian Studies XLIX (2005), pp. 35\u201370</ref>\n\nHowever, other scholars of Buddhist studies have disagreed with the mostly positive view that the early Buddhist texts reflect the teachings of the historical Buddha. For example, [[Edward Conze]] argued that the attempts of European scholars to reconstruct the original teachings of the Buddha were \u201call mere guesswork.\u201d<ref>Conze, Edward (2000). \"Buddhism: A Short History.\" From Buddhism to Sufism Series. Oneworld.</ref>\n\nOther scholars argue that some teachings contained in the early texts are the authentic teachings of the Buddha, but not others. For example, according to Tilmann Vetter, the earliest core of the Buddhist teachings is the meditative practice of ''dhy\u0101na''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988b|p=xxx, xxxv\u2013xxxvi, 4\u20135}}{{refn|group=note|Vetter: \"However, if we look at the last, and in my opinion the most important, component of this list [the noble eightfold path], we are still dealing with what according to me is the real content of the middle way, dhyana-meditation, at least the stages two to four, which are said to be free of contemplation and reflection. Everything preceding the eighth part, i.e. right samadhi, apparently has the function of preparing for the right samadhi.\"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}}}} Vetter argues that \"liberating insight\" became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition at a later date. He posits that the Fourth Noble Truths, the Eightfold path and Dependent Origination, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv\u2013xxxvii}}  \n\n[[Lambert Schmithausen]] similarly argues that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \"liberating insight\", which is attained after mastering the four ''dhy\u0101nas'', is a later addition.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} Also, according to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]], the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}}\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n{{Main |Physical characteristics of the Buddha}}\n=== In early sources ===\n[[File:Mahapragya exiled 1926 wk.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks from Nepal. According to the earliest sources, the Buddha looked like a typical shaved man from northeast India.]]\n\nEarly sources depict the Buddha's as similar to other Buddhist monks. Various discourses describe how he \"cut off his hair and beard\" when renouncing the world. Likewise, Digha Nikaya 3 has a Brahmin describe the Buddha as a shaved or bald (''mundaka'') man.<ref>Olivelle, Patrick (1974), ''\"The Origin and the Early Development of Buddhist Monachism\"'', p. 19.</ref> Digha Nikaya 2 also describes how king Ajatasattu is unable to tell which of the monks is the Buddha when approaching the sangha and must ask his minister to point him out. Likewise, in MN 140, a mendicant who sees himself as a follower of the Buddha meets the Buddha in person but is unable to recognize him.<ref>Mazard, Eisel (2010). [https://www.newmandala.org/the-buddha-was-bald/ \"The Buddha was bald,\"] New Mandala.</ref> \n\nThe Buddha is also described as being handsome and with a clear complexion (Digha I:115; Anguttara I:181), at least in his youth. In old age, however, he is described as having a stooped body, with slack and wrinkled limbs.<ref>S. Dhammika, \"The Buddha and his disciples.\" pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\n=== The 32 Signs ===\nVarious Buddhist texts attribute to the Buddha a series of extraordinary physical characteristics, known as \"the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#32 Signs of a Great Man|32 Signs of the Great Man]]\" (Skt. ''mah\u0101puru\u1e63a lak\u1e63a\u1e47a''). \n\nAccording to Analayo, when they first appear in the Buddhist texts, these physical marks were initially held to be imperceptible to the ordinary person, and required special training to detect. Later though, they are depicted as being visible by regular people and as inspiring faith in the Buddha.<ref>Analayo (2017), \"Buddhapada and the Bodhisattva Path\", pp. 137\u2013138.</ref>\n\nThese characteristics are described in the [[Digha Nikaya]]'s ''{{IAST |Lakkha\u1e47a Sutta}}'' (D, I:142).{{sfn|Walshe|1995|pp = 441\u201360}}\n\n== Gautama Buddha in other religions ==\n[[File:Avatarbuddha.jpg|right|thumb|Buddha depicted as the 9th [[avatar]] of god [[Vishnu]] in a traditional Hindu representation]]\n[[File:Buddha_statue_at_Dwaraka_Tirumala_Temple_02.jpg|thumb|Buddha as an avatar at [[Dwaraka Tirumala]] temple, [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]\n{{Main|Gautama Buddha in world religions}}\n\nSome [[Hindus]] [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|regard Gautama]] as the 9th [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].<ref group=note name=\"google260\" />{{sfn |Gopal| 1990|p=73}}{{sfn|Doniger|1993|p=243}} However, Buddha's teachings deny the authority of the [[Vedas]] and the concepts of [[Brahman]]-[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]].<ref name=\"sep\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Buddha |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buddha/ |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref>Sushil Mittal & Gene Thursby (2004), ''The Hindu World'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-77227-3}}, pp. 729\u201330</ref><ref>C.

According to the works on Buddhism by [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u2013after 1050), views regarding the exact identity of Buddha was diverse. Accordingly, some regarded him as the divine incarnate, others as an apostle of the angels or as an [[Ifrit]] and others as an apostle of God sent to human race. By the 12th century, [[al-Shahrastani]] even compared Buddha to [[Khidr]], described as an ideal human. [[Ibn Nadim]], who was also familiar with [[Manichaeism|Manichean teachings]], even identifies Buddha as a prophet, who taught a religion to \"banish [[Satan]]\", although not mention it explicitly.

The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. ''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such \"in conformity with the world\"; omniscience, and the ability to \"suppress karma\".{{sfn|Jones|1956|p=}} As noted by Andrew Skilton, the Buddha was often described as being superhuman, including descriptions of him having the 32 major and 80 minor marks of a \"great man,\" and the idea that the Buddha could live for as long as an aeon if he wished (see DN 16).{{sfn|Skilton|2004|pp=64\u201365}} \n\nThe ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the [[Jain Agamas (\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara)|Jain scriptures]], and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in [[History of India|Indian history]] for which significant accounts exist.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=15}} British author [[Karen Armstrong]] writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.{{sfn|Armstrong|2000|p=xii}} Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of \"birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death\" must be true.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=}}\n\n== Previous lives ==\n[[File:Ascetic Sumedha and Dipankara Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary Jataka collections depict the Buddha-to-be in a previous life prostrating before the past Buddha [[Dipankara]], making a resolve to be a Buddha, and receiving a prediction of future Buddhahood.]]\nLegendary biographies like the Pali ''[[Buddhava\u1e43sa]]'' and the Sanskrit ''J\u0101takam\u0101l\u0101'' depict the Buddha's (referred to as \"[[bodhisattva]]\" before his awakening) career as spanning hundreds of lifetimes before his last birth as Gautama.

He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed, and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is \"subtle, deep and hard to grasp.\" However, the god [[Brahma (Buddhism)#Brahm\u0101 Sahampati|Brahm\u0101 Sahampati]] convinced him, arguing that at least some \"with little dust in their eyes\" will understand it. The Buddha relented and agreed to teach. According to Analayo, the Chinese parallel to MN 26, M\u0100 204, does not contain this story, but this event does appear in other parallel texts, such as in an ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottarika-\u0101gama]]'' discourse, in the ''Catusparisat-s\u016btra'', and in the ''Lalitavistara''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAccording to MN 26 and M\u0100 204, after deciding to teach, the Buddha initially intended to visit his former teachers, [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Udaka Ramaputta]], to teach them his insights, but they had already died, so he decided to visit his five former companions.<ref>Analayo (2011).

This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the [[Vassa]] rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled.

As noted by Analayo's comparative study of this topic, there are various versions of this event depicted in the different early Buddhist texts.<ref>Analayo (2016), pp. 40\u201341. Analayo draws from seven early sources: \"the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in Four Parts, preserved in Chinese; \u2013 a *Vinayam\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101 preserved in Chinese translation, which some scholars suggest represents the Haimavata tradition; the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika-Lokottarav\u0101da Vinaya, preserved in Sanskrit; \u2013 the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya in Five Parts, preserved in Chinese; \u2013 the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Vinaya, where the episode is extant in Chinese and Tibetan translation, with considerable parts also preserved in Sanskrit fragments; \u2013 a discourse in the Madhyama-\u0101gama, preserved in Chinese, probably representing the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition; a P\u0101li discourse found among the Eights of the A\u1e45guttara-nik\u0101ya; the same account is also found in the Therav\u0101da Vinaya preserved in P\u0101li.\"  </ref>\n\nAccording to all the major versions surveyed by Analayo, [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b Gautam\u012b]], Buddha's step-mother, is initially turned down by the Buddha after requesting ordination for her and some other women. Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b and her followers then shave their hair, don robes and begin following the Buddha on his travels. The Buddha is eventually convinced by \u0100nanda to grant ordination to Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b on her acceptance of [[Eight Garudhammas|eight conditions called gurudharmas]] which focus on the relationship between the new order of nuns and the monks.<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 43. </ref>\n\nAccording to Analayo, the only argument common to all the versions that Ananda uses to convince the Buddha is that women have the same ability to reach all stages of awakening.<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 79.</ref> Analayo also notes that some modern scholars have questioned the authenticity of the eight gurudharmas in their present form due to various inconsistencies. He holds that the historicity of the current lists of eight is doubtful, but that they may have been based on earlier injunctions by the Buddha.<ref>[[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo, Bhikkhu]] (2013). \"The Gurudharmaon Bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b Ordination in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Tradition\" (PDF).

Due to this, the gurudharma injunctions may have been a way to place \"the newly founded order of nuns in a relationship to its male counterparts that resembles as much as possible the protection a laywoman could expect from her male relatives.\"<ref>Analayo (2016). \"The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,\" projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 127.</ref>\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Procession of Prasenajit of Kosala leaving Sravasti to meet the Buddha.jpg|thumb|Procession of King [[Prasenajit]] of [[Kosala]] leaving [[Sravasti]] to meet the Buddha.

Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 136.</ref>\n\nAs the sangha grew in size, the need for a standardized set of monastic rules arose and the Buddha seems to have developed a set of regulations for the sangha. These are preserved in various texts called \"[[Pratimok\u1e63a|Pratimoksa]]\" which were recited by the community every fortnight. The Pratimoksa includes general ethical precepts, as well as rules regarding the essentials of monastic life, such as bowls and robes.<ref>[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 134.</ref>\n\nIn his later years, the Buddha's fame grew and he was invited to important royal events, such as the inauguration of the new council hall of the Shakyans (as seen in MN 53) and the inauguration of a new palace by Prince Bodhi (as depicted in MN 85).<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], pp. 232\u201333.</ref> The early texts also speak of how during the Buddha's old age, the kingdom of Magadha was usurped by a new king, [[Ajatashatru|Ajatasattu]], who overthrew his father [[Bimbisara]]. According to the ''Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta,'' the new king spoke with different ascetic teachers and eventually took refuge in the Buddha.<ref>Jain, Kailash Chand (1991), ''Lord Mah\u0101v\u012bra and His Times'', p. 79, [[Motilal Banarsidass]], {{ISBN|978-81-208-0805-8}}</ref> However, Jain sources also claim his allegiance, and it is likely he supported various religious groups, not just the Buddha's sangha exclusively.<ref>Mahajan V.D.

The ''Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta'' identifies six such sects.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 215.</ref>\n\nThe early texts also depict the elderly Buddha as suffering from back pain. Several texts depict him delegating teachings to his chief disciples since his body now needed more rest.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 232.</ref> However, the Buddha continued teaching well into his old age.  \n\nOne of the most troubling events during the Buddha's old age was [[Devadatta|Devadatta's]] schism. Early sources speak of how the Buddha's cousin, Devadatta, attempted to take over leadership of the order and then left the sangha with several Buddhist monks and formed a rival sect.

The [[Sthavira nik\u0101ya|Sthavira]] texts generally focus on \"five points\" which are seen as excessive ascetic practices, while the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghika]] Vinaya speaks of a more comprehensive disagreement, which has Devadatta alter the discourses as well as monastic discipline.<ref>Bhikkhu Sujato (2012), ''[http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WhyDevadattaWasNoSaint.pdf \"Why Devadatta Was No Saint, A critique of Reginald Ray\u2019s thesis of the \u2018condemned saint\u2019\"]'' </ref>\n\nAt around the same time of Devadatta's schism, there was also war between Ajatasattu's Kingdom of Magadha, and Kosala, led by an elderly king Pasenadi.<ref>[[\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 280.</ref> Ajatasattu seems to have been victorious, a turn of events the Buddha is reported to have regretted.<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 239.</ref>\n\n=== Last days and ''parinirvana''  ===\n[[File:040 Ananda worships Buddha (25595318747).jpg|thumb|This East Javanese relief depicts the Buddha in his final days, and [[\u0100nanda]], his chief attendant. |alt=Metal relief |upright=1.3]]\n\nThe main narrative of the Buddha's last days, death and the events following his death is contained in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]'' (DN 16) and its various parallels in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan.<ref>[[John S.

The Buddha says that the Sangha will prosper as long as they \"hold regular and frequent assemblies, meet in harmony, do not change the rules of training, honor their superiors who were ordained before them, do not fall prey to worldly desires, remain devoted to forest hermitages, and preserve their personal mindfulness.\" He then gives further lists of important virtues to be upheld by the Sangha. <ref>[[John S.

It also depicts him as stating that he cannot promote anyone to be his successor. When \u0100nanda requested this, the ''Mahaparinibbana'' records his response as follows:<ref>[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 246.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Ananda, why does the Order of monks expect this of me?

If there is anyone who thinks: \u201cI shall take charge of the Order\u201d, or \u201cthe Order is under my leadership\u201d, such a person would have to make arrangements about the Order. The Tathagata does not think in such terms. Why should the Tathagata make arrangements for the Order? I am now old, worn out . . . I have reached the term of life, I am turning eighty years of age. Just as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps, so the Tathagata's body is kept going by being bandaged up . . . Therefore, Ananda, you should live as islands unto yourselves, being your own refuge, seeking no other refuge; with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, seeking no other refuge. . . Those monks who in my time or afterwards live thus, seeking an island and a refuge in themselves and in the Dhamma and nowhere else, these zealous ones are truly my monks and will overcome the darkness (of rebirth).</blockquote>\n[[File:Dying Buddha (Mahaparinirvana), Gandhara, 3rd or 4th century AD, gray schist - John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art - Sarasota, FL - DSC00665.jpg|thumb|[[Parinirvana|Mahaparinirvana]], Gandhara, 3rd or 4th century CE, gray schist]]\n[[File:19th_century_sketch_and_21st_century_photo_collage,_Cave_26_Ajanta,_Buddha_Parinirvana.jpg|thumb|Mahaparinibbana scene, from the [[Ajanta caves]]]]\n\nAfter traveling and teaching some more, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named [[Cunda (Buddhism)|Cunda]].

Various conditions are outlined in the early texts, such as [[Ta\u1e47h\u0101|craving (''ta\u1e47h\u0101'')]], but the three most basic ones are [[Three poisons|greed, aversion and delusion]].<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>\n*If the conditions for dukkha cease, dukkha also ceases. This is \"[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]\" (literally 'blowing out' or 'extinguishing').<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 75.</ref>\n*There is path to follow that leads to Nirvana. \n\nAccording to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], the four truths schema appears to be based \"on an analogy with [[Ayurveda|Indian medical]] diagnosis\" (with the form: \"disease, pathogen, health, cure\") and this comparison is \"explicitly made in several early Buddhist texts\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn another Pali sutta, the Buddha outlines how \"eight worldly conditions\", \"keep the world turning around...Gain and loss, fame and disrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain.\" He then explains how the difference between a noble (''arya'') person and an uninstructed worldling is that a noble person reflects on and understands the impermanence of these conditions.<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 32-33.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's analysis of existence includes an understanding that [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] are part of life. According to the Buddha, the constant cycle of dying and being reborn (i.e. sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) according to one's karma is just dukkha and the ultimate spiritual goal should be liberation from this cycle.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 12.</ref> According to the Pali suttas, the Buddha stated that \"this sa\u1e43s\u0101ra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.\"<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 39.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's teaching of karma differed to that of the Jains and Brahmins, in that on his view, karma is primarily mental intention (as opposed to mainly physical action or ritual acts).<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> The Buddha is reported to have said \"By karma I mean intention.\"<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 49.</ref> Richard Gombrich summarizes the Buddha's view of karma as follows: \"all thoughts, words, and deeds derive their moral value, positive or negative, from the intention behind them.\"<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 13.</ref>\n\nFor the Buddha, our karmic acts also affected the rebirth process in a positive or negative way. This was seen as an impersonal natural law similar to how certain seeds produce certain plants and fruits (in fact, the result of a karmic act was called its \"fruit\" by the Buddha).<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 19.</ref> However, it is important to note that the Buddha did not hold that everything that happens is the result of karma alone. In fact when the Buddha was asked to state the causes of pain and pleasure he listed various physical and environmental causes alongside karma.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 20.</ref>\n\n====Dependent Origination====\n[[File:Buddha teaching Dharma, on lion throne.jpg|thumb|150px|Schist Buddha statue with the famed [[Ye Dharma Hetu]] [[dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b]] around the head, which was used as a common summary of Dependent Origination. It states: \"Of those experiences that arise from a cause, The Tath\u0101gata has said: 'this is their cause, And this is their cessation': This is what the Great \u015arama\u1e47a teaches.\"]]\nIn the early texts, the process of the arising of dukkha is most thoroughly explained by the Buddha through the teaching of [[Dependent Origination]].<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> At its most basic level, Dependent Origination is an empirical teaching on the nature of phenomena which says that nothing is experienced independently of its conditions.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe most basic formulation of Dependent Origination is given in the early texts as: 'It being thus, this comes about' (Pali: ''evam sati idam hoti'').<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref> This can be taken to mean that certain phenomena only arise when there are other phenomena present (example: when there is craving, suffering arises), and so, one can say that their arising is \"dependent\" on other phenomena. In other words, nothing in experience exists without a cause.<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn numerous early texts, this basic principle is expanded with a list of phenomena that are said to be conditionally dependent.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>{{refn|group=note|One common basic list of twelve elements in the Early Buddhist Texts goes as follows: \"Conditioned by (1) ignorance are (2) formations, conditioned by formations is (3) consciousness, conditioned by consciousness is (4) mind-and-body, conditioned by mind-and-body are (5) the six senses, conditioned by the six senses is (6) sense-contact, conditioned by sense-contact is (7) feeling, conditioned by feeling is (8) craving, conditioned by craving is (9) grasping, conditioned by grasping is (10) becoming, conditioned by becoming is (11) birth, conditioned by birth is (12) old-age and death-grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair come into being. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.\"<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>}} These phenomena are supposed to provide an analysis of the cycle of dukkha as experienced by sentient beings. The philosopher Mark Siderits has outlined the basic idea of the Buddha's teaching of Dependent Origination of dukkha as follows: \n\n<blockquote>given the existence of a fully functioning assemblage of psycho-physical elements (the parts that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the three characteristics of sentient existence\u2014suffering, impermanence and non-self\u2014will lead, in the course of normal interactions with the environment, to appropriation (the identification of certain elements as \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018mine\u2019). This leads in turn to the formation of attachments, in the form of desire and aversion, and the strengthening of ignorance concerning the true nature of sentient existence. These ensure future rebirth, and thus future instances of old age, disease and death, in a potentially unending cycle.<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Buddha saw his analysis of Dependent Origination as a \"Middle Way\" between \"eternalism\" (''sassatavada'', the idea that some essence exists eternally) and \"annihilationism\" (''ucchedavada'', the idea that we go completely out of existence at death).<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 131.</ref> This middle way is basically the view that, conventionally speaking, persons are just a causal series of impermanent psycho-physical elements.<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\n==== Metaphysics and personal identity ====\nClosely connected to the idea that experience is dependently originated is the Buddha's teaching that there is no independent or permanent self (Sanskrit: [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|''atman'']], Pali: ''atta'').<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 22.</ref>\n\nDue to this view which (termed [[anatta|''anatta'']]), the Buddha's teaching was opposed to all soul theories of his time, including the Jain theory of a ''\"[[jiva]]\"'' (\"life monad\") and the Brahmanical theories of atman and [[purusha]]. All of these theories held that there was an eternal unchanging [[essence]] to a person which transmigrated from life to life.<ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 20.</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 62\u201364.</ref><ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\nWhile Brahminical teachers affirmed atman theories in an attempt to answer the question of what really exists ultimately, the Buddha saw this question as not being useful, as illustrated in [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|the parable of the poisoned arrow]].<ref>Hamilton (2000) pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n\nFor the Buddha's contemporaries, the atman was also seen to be the unchanging constant which was separate from all changing experiences and the inner controller in a person.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> The Buddha instead held that all things in the world of our experience are transient and that there is no unchanging part to a person.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 9, 67.</ref> According to Richard Gombrich, the Buddha's position is simply that \"everything is process\".<ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 10.</ref> However, this [[Anti-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] view still includes an understanding of continuity through rebirth, it is just the rebirth of a process (karma), not an essence like the atman.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most important way the Buddha analyzed individual experience in the early texts was by way of the [[Skandha|five 'aggregates' or 'groups' (''khandha'')]] of physical and mental processes.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 135.</ref><ref>Gombrich (2009), p. 114.</ref> The [[Buddhist_philosophy#Anatta|Buddha's arguments against an unchanging self]] rely on these five aggregate schema, as can be seen in the Pali ''[[Anattalakkha\u1e47a Sutta]]'' (and its parallels in Gandhari and Chinese)''.''<ref>Hamilton (2000) pp. 19\u201320.</ref><ref>Andrew Glass, Mark Allon (2007).

Also, since they are all impermanent, one cannot regard any of the psycho-physical processes as an unchanging self.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 136-137.</ref><ref>Siderits (2019)</ref> Even mental processes such as [[Vij\u00f1\u0101na|consciousness]] and will ([[cetana|''cetana'']]) are seen as being dependently originated and impermanent and thus do not qualify as a self (''atman'').<ref>Siderits (2019)</ref>\n\nAs noted by Gombrich, in the early texts the Buddha teaches that all five aggregates, including consciousness (''[[Vij\u00f1\u0101na|vi\u00f1\u00f1ana]]'', which was held by Brahmins to be eternal), arise dependent on causes.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 119-120.</ref> That is, existence is based on processes that are subject to dependent origination. He compared samsaric existence to a fire, which is dynamic and requires fuel (the ''khandas'', literally: \"heaps\") in order to keep burning.<ref>Gombrich (2009), pp. 124-125.</ref>\n\nAs [[Rupert Gethin]] explains, for the Buddha:\n\n<blockquote>I am a complex flow of physical and mental phenomena, but peel away these phenomena and look behind them and one just does not find a constant self that one can call one's own. My sense of self is both logically and emotionally just a label that I impose on these physical and mental phenomena in consequence of their connectedness.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 139.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Buddha saw the belief in a self as arising from our grasping at and identifying with the various changing phenomena, as well as from ignorance about how things really are.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 146-147.</ref> Furthermore, the Buddha held that we experience suffering because we hold on to erroneous self views.<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 148.</ref><ref>Hamilton (2000) p. 27.</ref>\n\n====Worldly happiness====\nAs noted by [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the Buddha as depicted in the Pali suttas does not exclusively teach a world transcending goal, but also teaches laypersons how to achieve worldly [[happiness]] (''sukha'').<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 107\u2013109.</ref> \n\nAccording to Bodhi, the \"most comprehensive\" of the suttas that focus on how to live as a layperson is the ''[[Sig\u0101lov\u0101da Sutta]]'' (DN 31). This sutta outlines how a layperson behaves towards six basic social relationships: \"parents and children, teacher and pupils, husband and wife, friend and friend, employer and workers, lay follower and religious guides.\" <ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 109.</ref> This Pali text also has parallels in Chinese and in Sanskrit fragments.<ref>Pannasiri, Bhadanta (1950). \"Sig\u0101lov\u0101da-Sutta\", Visva-Bharati Annals, 3:\n150\u2013228. </ref><ref>Martini, Giuliana (2013). \"Bodhisattva Texts, Ideologies and Rituals in Khotan in the Fifth and Sixth Centuries\", in Buddhism among the Iranian Peoples\nof Central Asia, M.

First, there is the happiness visible in this very life. The Buddha states that four things lead to this happiness: \"The accomplishment of persistent effort, the accomplishment of protection, good friendship, and balanced living.\"<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 124</ref> Similarly, in several other suttas, the Buddha teaches on how to improve family relationships, particularly on the importance of filial love and gratitude as well as marital well-being.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 110</ref>\n\nRegarding the happiness of the next life, the Buddha (in the ''[[D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u Sutta]]'') states that the virtues which lead to a good rebirth are: [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] (in the Buddha and the teachings), moral discipline, especially keeping the [[five precepts]], generosity, and wisdom (knowledge of the arising and passing of things).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 111, 125.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Buddha of the suttas then, achieving a good rebirth is based on cultivating wholesome or skillful (''kusala'') karma, which leads to a good result, and avoiding unwholesome (''akusala'') karma. A common list of good karmas taught by the Buddha is the list of ten courses of action (''[[kammapatha]]'') as outlined in MN 41 ''Saleyyaka Sutta'' (and its Chinese parallel in S\u0100 1042).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 146\u2013148, 156.</ref><ref>Analayo (2011). \"A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nik\u0101ya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),\" p. 263.</ref>\n\nGood karma is also termed [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit (''pu\u00f1\u00f1a'')]], and the Buddha outlines three bases of meritorious actions: giving, moral discipline and meditation (as seen in AN 8:36).<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 151, 167.</ref>\n\n==== The Path to Liberation ====\n[[File:Seated_Buddha,_Pakistan_or_Afghanistan,_Ghandhara_region,_2nd_-_3rd_century,_gray_schist,_HAA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Gandharan]] sculpture depicting the Buddha in the [[Lotus position|full lotus]] seated meditation posture, 2nd-3rd century CE]]\n[[File:20160124_Sri_Lanka_3769_Polonnaruwa_sRGB_(25144212713).jpg|thumb|200px|Buddha Statues from [[Gal Vihara]].

In the ''Potaliya Sutta'' (MN 54) sensual pleasures are said by the Buddha to be a cause of conflict for all humans beings.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 195</ref> They are said to be unable to satisfy one's craving, like a clean meatless bone given to a dog.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 199</ref> Sensuality is also compared to a torch held against the wind, since it burns the person holding on to it.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 200</ref> According to the Buddha, there is \"a delight apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, which surpasses even divine bliss.\" The Buddha thus taught that one should take delight in the higher spiritual pleasures instead of sensual pleasure.<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 204.</ref> This is explained with the simile the leper, who cauterizes his skin with fire to get relief from the pain of leprosy, but after he is cured, avoids the same flames he used to enjoy before (see MN 75, ''Magandiya Sutta'').<ref>Bodhi (2005), p. 205.</ref>\n\nNumerous scholars such as Vetter have written on the centrality of the practice of [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|''dhy\u0101na'']] to the teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988a|pp=xxx, xxxv\u2013xxxvi, 4\u20135}} It is the training of the mind, commonly translated as [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], to withdraw the mind from the automatic responses to sense-impressions, and leading to a \"state of perfect [[Upekkha|equanimity]] and awareness (''upekkh\u0101-sati-parisuddhi'').\"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}} Dhyana is preceded and supported by various aspects of the path such as seclusion and sense restraint.<ref>Analayo (2017). \"Early Buddhist meditation studies,\" pp. 80, 128, 135.</ref>\n\nAnother important mental training in the early texts is the practice of [[mindfulness]] (''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]''), which was mainly taught using the schemas of the \"Four Ways of Mindfulness\" (''[[Satipatthana]]'', as taught in the Pali ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' and its various parallel texts) and the sixteen elements of \"Mindfulness of Breath\" (''[[Anapanasati]]'', as taught in the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]'' and its various parallels).<ref>For a comparative survey of Satipatthana in the Pali, Tibetan and Chinese sources, see: ''Analayo (2014), \"Perspectives on Satipatthana.\"'' For a comparative survey of Anapanasati, see: ''Dhammajoti KL (2008), \"Sixteen-mode Mindfulness of Breathing\", JCBSSL v. VI.''</ref>\n\nBecause getting others to practice the path was the central goal of the Buddha's message, the early texts depict the Buddha as refusing to answer [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]] which his contemporaries were preoccupied with, (such as \"is the world eternal?\"). This is because he did not see these questions as being useful on the path and as not being \"connected to the goal\".<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 66.</ref>\n\n====Monasticism====\nThe early Buddhist texts depict the Buddha as promoting the life of a homeless and [[Celibacy|celibate]] \"''sramana''\", or mendicant, as the ideal way of life for the practice of the path.<ref>Gethin (1998), pp. 85, 88.</ref> He taught that mendicants or \"beggars\" ([[Bhikkhu|''bhikkhus'']]) were supposed to give up all possessions and to own just a begging bowl and three robes. <ref>Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.</ref> As part of the Buddha's monastic discipline, they were also supposed to rely on the wider lay community for the basic necessities (mainly food, clothing, and lodging).<ref>Gethin (1998), p. 85</ref>\n\nThe Buddha's teachings on monastic discipline were preserved in the various [[Vinaya]] collections of the different early schools.<ref>Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.</ref>\n\nBuddhist monastics, which included both monks and nuns, were supposed to beg for their food, were not allowed to store up food or eat after noon and they were not allowed to use gold, silver or any valuables.<ref>Heirman, Ann (2019). \"Vinaya rules for monks and nuns.\"</ref><ref>Gethin (1998), p. 87</ref>\n\n====Socio-political teachings====\nThe early texts depict the Buddha as giving a deflationary account of the importance of politics to human life. Politics is inevitable and is probably even necessary and helpful, but it is also a tremendous waste of time and effort, as well as being a prime temptation to allow ego to run rampant. Buddhist political theory denies that people have a moral duty to engage in politics except to a very minimal degree (pay the taxes, obey the laws, maybe vote in the elections), and it actively portrays engagement in politics and the pursuit of enlightenment as being conflicting paths in life.<ref>Matthew J. Moore, ''Buddhism and Political Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2016  {{ISBN|9780190465513}} p.2</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta]]'', the Buddha teaches a history of how monarchy arose which according to Matthew J. Moore is \"closely analogous to a social contract.\" The ''Agga\u00f1\u00f1a Sutta'' also provides a social explanation of how different classes arose, in contrast to the Vedic views on social caste.<ref name=\":7\">Moore, Matthew J.

This ideal leader is one who promotes Dharma through his governance. He can only achieve his status through moral purity and must promote morality and Dharma to maintain his position. According to the ''Cakkavatti-S\u012bhan\u0101da Sutta'', the key duties of a Cakkavatti are: \"establish guard, ward, and protection according to Dhamma for your own household, your troops, your nobles, and vassals, for Brahmins and householders, town and country folk, ascetics and Brahmins, for beasts and birds. let no crime prevail in your kingdom, and to those who are in need, give property.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> The sutta explains the injunction to give to the needy by telling how a line of wheel-turning monarchs falls because they fail to give to the needy, and thus the kingdom falls into infighting as poverty increases, which then leads to stealing and violence.{{refn|group=note|\"thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, poverty became rife, from the growth of poverty, the taking of what was not given increased, from the increase of theft, the use of weapons increased, from the increased use of weapons, the taking of life increased \u2014 and from the increase in the taking of life, people\u2019s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and [as] a result of this decrease of life-span and beauty, the children of those whose life-span had been eighty-thousand years lived for only forty thousand.\"<ref>Moore, Matthew J. ''\"Political theory in Canonical Buddhism.\"'' Philosophy East & West Volume 65, Number 1 January 2015 36\u201364</ref>}}\n\nIn the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta,'' the Buddha outlines several principles that he promoted among the Vajjian tribal federation, which had a quasi-republican form of government. He taught them to \u201chold regular and frequent assemblies\u201d, live in harmony and maintain their traditions. The Buddha then goes on to promote a similar kind of republican style of government among the Buddhist Sangha, where all monks had equal rights to attend open meetings and there would be no single leader, since The Buddha also chose not to appoint one.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some scholars have argued that this fact signals that the Buddha preferred a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government, while others disagree with this position.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Scholarly views on the earliest teachings ===\n{{Main|Presectarian Buddhism}}\n[[File:Kanishka Buddha detail.jpg|thumb|150px|The Buddha on a coin of [[Kanishka I]], {{circa|130}} CE.]]\n\nNumerous scholars of early Buddhism argue that most of the teachings found in the Early Buddhist texts date back to the Buddha himself. One of these is [[Richard Gombrich]], who argues that since the content of the earliest texts \u201cpresents such originality, intelligence, grandeur and\u2014most relevantly\u2014coherence...it is hard to see it as a composite work.\" Thus he concludes they are \"the work of one genius.\"<ref>Gombrich, Richard (2006). ''\"Therav\u0101da Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo,\"'' p. 21. The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices Series. Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> \n\n[[Peter Harvey]] also agrees that \u201cmuch\u201d of the Pali Canon \u201cmust derive from his [the Buddha\u2019s] teachings.\u201d<ref>Harvey, Peter (1990). ''\"An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices,\"'' p. 3. Introduction to Religion. Cambridge University Press.</ref> Likewise, [[A.\u200aK. Warder]] has written that \u201cthere is no evidence to suggest that it [the shared teaching of the early schools] was formulated by anyone other than the Buddha and his immediate followers.\u201d<ref>Warder, A.K (2000). \"''Indian Buddhism,\"'' inside flap''.'' Buddhism Series. Motilal Banarsidass.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Alexander Wynne argues that \"the internal evidence of the early Buddhist literature proves its historical authenticity.\"<ref>Wynne, Alexander. \u201cThe Historical Authenticity of Early Buddhist Literature\u201d. In: Vienna Journal of South Asian Studies XLIX (2005), pp. 35\u201370</ref>\n\nHowever, other scholars of Buddhist studies have disagreed with the mostly positive view that the early Buddhist texts reflect the teachings of the historical Buddha. For example, [[Edward Conze]] argued that the attempts of European scholars to reconstruct the original teachings of the Buddha were \u201call mere guesswork.\u201d<ref>Conze, Edward (2000). \"Buddhism: A Short History.\" From Buddhism to Sufism Series. Oneworld.</ref>\n\nOther scholars argue that some teachings contained in the early texts are the authentic teachings of the Buddha, but not others. For example, according to Tilmann Vetter, the earliest core of the Buddhist teachings is the meditative practice of ''dhy\u0101na''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988b|p=xxx, xxxv\u2013xxxvi, 4\u20135}}{{refn|group=note|Vetter: \"However, if we look at the last, and in my opinion the most important, component of this list [the noble eightfold path], we are still dealing with what according to me is the real content of the middle way, dhyana-meditation, at least the stages two to four, which are said to be free of contemplation and reflection. Everything preceding the eighth part, i.e. right samadhi, apparently has the function of preparing for the right samadhi.\"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}}}} Vetter argues that \"liberating insight\" became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition at a later date. He posits that the Fourth Noble Truths, the Eightfold path and Dependent Origination, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv\u2013xxxvii}}  \n\n[[Lambert Schmithausen]] similarly argues that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \"liberating insight\", which is attained after mastering the four ''dhy\u0101nas'', is a later addition.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} Also, according to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]], the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}}\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n{{Main |Physical characteristics of the Buddha}}\n=== In early sources ===\n[[File:Mahapragya exiled 1926 wk.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks from Nepal. According to the earliest sources, the Buddha looked like a typical shaved man from northeast India.]]\n\nEarly sources depict the Buddha's as similar to other Buddhist monks. Various discourses describe how he \"cut off his hair and beard\" when renouncing the world. Likewise, Digha Nikaya 3 has a Brahmin describe the Buddha as a shaved or bald (''mundaka'') man.<ref>Olivelle, Patrick (1974), ''\"The Origin and the Early Development of Buddhist Monachism\"'', p. 19.</ref> Digha Nikaya 2 also describes how king Ajatasattu is unable to tell which of the monks is the Buddha when approaching the sangha and must ask his minister to point him out. Likewise, in MN 140, a mendicant who sees himself as a follower of the Buddha meets the Buddha in person but is unable to recognize him.<ref>Mazard, Eisel (2010). [https://www.newmandala.org/the-buddha-was-bald/ \"The Buddha was bald,\"] New Mandala.</ref> \n\nThe Buddha is also described as being handsome and with a clear complexion (Digha I:115; Anguttara I:181), at least in his youth. In old age, however, he is described as having a stooped body, with slack and wrinkled limbs.<ref>S. Dhammika, \"The Buddha and his disciples.\" pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\n=== The 32 Signs ===\nVarious Buddhist texts attribute to the Buddha a series of extraordinary physical characteristics, known as \"the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#32 Signs of a Great Man|32 Signs of the Great Man]]\" (Skt. ''mah\u0101puru\u1e63a lak\u1e63a\u1e47a''). \n\nAccording to Analayo, when they first appear in the Buddhist texts, these physical marks were initially held to be imperceptible to the ordinary person, and required special training to detect. Later though, they are depicted as being visible by regular people and as inspiring faith in the Buddha.<ref>Analayo (2017), \"Buddhapada and the Bodhisattva Path\", pp. 137\u2013138.</ref>\n\nThese characteristics are described in the [[Digha Nikaya]]'s ''{{IAST |Lakkha\u1e47a Sutta}}'' (D, I:142).{{sfn|Walshe|1995|pp = 441\u201360}}\n\n== Gautama Buddha in other religions ==\n[[File:Avatarbuddha.jpg|right|thumb|Buddha depicted as the 9th [[avatar]] of god [[Vishnu]] in a traditional Hindu representation]]\n[[File:Buddha_statue_at_Dwaraka_Tirumala_Temple_02.jpg|thumb|Buddha as an avatar at [[Dwaraka Tirumala]] temple, [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]\n{{Main|Gautama Buddha in world religions}}\n\nSome [[Hindus]] [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|regard Gautama]] as the 9th [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].<ref group=note name=\"google260\" />{{sfn |Gopal| 1990|p=73}}{{sfn|Doniger|1993|p=243}} However, Buddha's teachings deny the authority of the [[Vedas]] and the concepts of [[Brahman]]-[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]].<ref name=\"sep\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Buddha |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buddha/ |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref>Sushil Mittal & Gene Thursby (2004), ''The Hindu World'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-77227-3}}, pp. 729\u201330</ref><ref>C.

According to the works on Buddhism by [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u2013after 1050), views regarding the exact identity of Buddha was diverse. Accordingly, some regarded him as the divine incarnate, others as an apostle of the angels or as an [[Ifrit]] and others as an apostle of God sent to human race. By the 12th century, [[al-Shahrastani]] even compared Buddha to [[Khidr]], described as an ideal human. [[Ibn Nadim]], who was also familiar with [[Manichaeism|Manichean teachings]], even identifies Buddha as a prophet, who taught a religion to \"banish [[Satan]]\", although not mention it explicitly.

It intends to measure the '''state of democracy''' in 167 countries, of which 166 are [[sovereign state]]s and 164 are [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]].\n\nThe index was first published in 2006, with updates for 2008, 2010 and later years. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[civil liberties]] and [[political culture]]. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorises each country in one of four regime types: ''full democracies'', ''flawed democracies'', ''[[hybrid regime]]s'' and ''authoritarian regimes''.\n\n==Method==\n{{Democracy}}\nAs described in the report,<ref name=\"index2012\" /> the [[democracy]] index is a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] based on the answers of 60 questions, each one with either two or three permitted alternative answers. Most answers are experts' assessments. Some answers are provided by public-opinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar countries, and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps.\n\nThe questions are grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture. Each answer is converted to a score, either 0 or 1, or for the three-answer questions, 0, 0.5 or 1. With the exceptions mentioned below, within each category, the scores are added, multiplied by ten, and divided by the total number of questions within the category. There are a few modifying dependencies, which are explained much more precisely than the main rule procedures. In a few cases, an answer yielding zero for one question voids another question; e.g. if the elections for the national legislature and head of government are not considered free (question 1), then the next question, \"''Are elections... fair?''\", is not considered, but automatically scored zero. Likewise, there are a few questions considered so important that a low score on them yields a penalty on the total score sum for their respective categories, namely:\n\n#\"Whether [[nation]]al [[election]]s are free and fair\";\n#\"The [[security]] of [[Voting|voters]]\";\n#\"The influence of foreign powers on government\";\n#\"The capability of the [[Civil service|civil servant]]s to implement policies\".\n\nThe five category indices, which are listed in the report, are then averaged to find the Democracy Index for a given country. Finally, the Democracy Index, [[rounding|rounded]] to two [[decimals]], decides the regime type classification of the country.\n\nThe report discusses other indices of democracy, as defined, e.g. by [[Freedom House]], and argues for some of the choices made by the team from the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. In this comparison, a higher emphasis is placed on the public opinion and attitudes, as measured by [[Survey (human research)|survey]]s, but on the other hand, economic living standards are not weighted as one criterion of democracy (as seemingly some other investigators have done).<ref name=\"index2010\" /><ref name=\"index2006\" />\n\nThe report is widely cited in the international press as well as in [[peer review]]ed academic journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last3=Manaev|first3=Oleg|last4=Manayeva|first4=Natalie|last5=Dzmitry|first5=Yuran|title=More State than Nation: Lukashenko's Belarus {{!}} JIA SIPA|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1 December 2011|volume=65|issue=1|pages=93\u2013113|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|accessdate=26 January 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221152959/https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Classification definitions==\n'''[[Liberal democracy|Full democracies]]''' are nations where civil liberties and fundamental political freedoms are not only respected but also reinforced by a political culture conducive to the thriving of democratic principles. These nations have a valid system of governmental checks and balances, an independent judiciary whose decisions are enforced, governments that function adequately, and diverse and independent media. These nations have only limited problems in democratic functioning.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Illiberal democracy|Flawed democracies]]''' are nations where elections are fair and free and basic civil liberties are honoured but may have issues (e.g. media freedom infringement and minor suppression of political opposition and critics). These nations have significant faults in other democratic aspects, including underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Hybrid regime]]s''' are nations with regular [[electoral fraud]]s, preventing them from being fair and free democracy. These nations commonly have governments that apply pressure on political opposition, non-independent judiciaries, widespread corruption, harassment and pressure placed on the media, anaemic rule of law, and more pronounced faults than flawed democracies in the realms of underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Authoritarian regime]]s''' are nations where political pluralism has vanished or is extremely limited. These nations are often [[absolute monarchies]] or [[dictatorship]]s, may have some conventional institutions of democracy but with meagre significance, infringements and abuses of civil liberties are commonplace, elections (if they take place) are not fair and free, the media is often state-owned or controlled by groups associated with the ruling regime, the judiciary is not independent, and there are omnipresent censorship and suppression of governmental criticism.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n==Democracy Index by country 2019==\nListing by country is available on ''The Economist''

To generate the index, the Economist Intelligence Unit has a scoring system in which various experts are asked to answer 60 questions and assign each reply a number, with the weighted average deciding the ranking. However, the final report does not indicate what kinds of experts, nor their number, nor whether the experts are employees of the Economist Intelligence Unit or independent scholars, nor the nationalities of the experts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/NAR/Articles/Peter-Tasker-The-flawed-science-behind-democracy-rankings|title=Peter Tasker: The flawed 'science' behind democracy rankings|website=asia.nikkei.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074457/https://asia.nikkei.com/NAR/Articles/Peter-Tasker-The-flawed-science-behind-democracy-rankings|archive-date=2019-02-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Democracy Index by regime type==\nThe following table gives the number and percentage of countries and the percentage of the world population for each regime type in 2018:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracy2018|title=Democracy Index 2018: Me Too?|last=The Economist Intelligence Unit|first=|date=8 January 2019|website=The Economist Intelligence Unit|url-access=registration|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202212334/https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=Democracy2018|archive-date=2 February 2019|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref>\n<!--\nchanges to this table will be reverted, if the data does not match that provided in the 2014 survey\nDo you mean 2018?\n-->\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based company. It intends to measure the '''state of democracy''' in 167 countries, of which 166 are [[sovereign state]]s and 164 are [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]].\n\nThe index was first published in 2006, with updates for 2008, 2010 and later years. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[civil liberties]] and [[political culture]]. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorises each country in one of four regime types: ''full democracies'', ''flawed democracies'', ''[[hybrid regime]]s'' and ''authoritarian regimes''.\n\n==Method==\n{{Democracy}}\nAs described in the report,<ref name=\"index2012\" /> the [[democracy]] index is a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] based on the answers of 60 questions, each one with either two or three permitted alternative answers. Most answers are experts' assessments. Some answers are provided by public-opinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar countries, and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps.\n\nThe questions are grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture. Each answer is converted to a score, either 0 or 1, or for the three-answer questions, 0, 0.5 or 1. With the exceptions mentioned below, within each category, the scores are added, multiplied by ten, and divided by the total number of questions within the category. There are a few modifying dependencies, which are explained much more precisely than the main rule procedures. In a few cases, an answer yielding zero for one question voids another question; e.g. if the elections for the national legislature and head of government are not considered free (question 1), then the next question, \"''Are elections... fair?''\", is not considered, but automatically scored zero. Likewise, there are a few questions considered so important that a low score on them yields a penalty on the total score sum for their respective categories, namely:\n\n#\"Whether [[nation]]al [[election]]s are free and fair\";\n#\"The [[security]] of [[Voting|voters]]\";\n#\"The influence of foreign powers on government\";\n#\"The capability of the [[Civil service|civil servant]]s to implement policies\".\n\nThe five category indices, which are listed in the report, are then averaged to find the Democracy Index for a given country. Finally, the Democracy Index, [[rounding|rounded]] to two [[decimals]], decides the regime type classification of the country.\n\nThe report discusses other indices of democracy, as defined, e.g. by [[Freedom House]], and argues for some of the choices made by the team from the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. In this comparison, a higher emphasis is placed on the public opinion and attitudes, as measured by [[Survey (human research)|survey]]s, but on the other hand, economic living standards are not weighted as one criterion of democracy (as seemingly some other investigators have done).<ref name=\"index2010\" /><ref name=\"index2006\" />\n\nThe report is widely cited in the international press as well as in [[peer review]]ed academic journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last3=Manaev|first3=Oleg|last4=Manayeva|first4=Natalie|last5=Dzmitry|first5=Yuran|title=More State than Nation: Lukashenko's Belarus {{!}} JIA SIPA|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1 December 2011|volume=65|issue=1|pages=93\u2013113|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|accessdate=26 January 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221152959/https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Classification definitions==\n'''[[Liberal democracy|Full democracies]]''' are nations where civil liberties and fundamental political freedoms are not only respected but also reinforced by a political culture conducive to the thriving of democratic principles. These nations have a valid system of governmental checks and balances, an independent judiciary whose decisions are enforced, governments that function adequately, and diverse and independent media. These nations have only limited problems in democratic functioning.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Illiberal democracy|Flawed democracies]]''' are nations where elections are fair and free and basic civil liberties are honoured but may have issues (e.g. media freedom infringement and minor suppression of political opposition and critics). These nations have significant faults in other democratic aspects, including underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Hybrid regime]]s''' are nations with regular [[electoral fraud]]s, preventing them from being fair and free democracy. These nations commonly have governments that apply pressure on political opposition, non-independent judiciaries, widespread corruption, harassment and pressure placed on the media, anaemic rule of law, and more pronounced faults than flawed democracies in the realms of underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Authoritarian regime]]s''' are nations where political pluralism has vanished or is extremely limited. These nations are often [[absolute monarchies]] or [[dictatorship]]s, may have some conventional institutions of democracy but with meagre significance, infringements and abuses of civil liberties are commonplace, elections (if they take place) are not fair and free, the media is often state-owned or controlled by groups associated with the ruling regime, the judiciary is not independent, and there are omnipresent censorship and suppression of governmental criticism.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n==Democracy Index by country 2019==\nListing by country is available on ''The Economist''
