Introduced in the 1991 [[Timothy Zahn]] novel ''Heir to the Empire'', he is an Imperial military commander who has taken control of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s remaining forces five years after the events of the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. Thrawn faces off against classic ''Star Wars'' characters [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Princess Leia]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], and [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''Thrawn'' trilogy (1991\u20131993), but is ultimately defeated. He is seemingly resurrected in the ''Hand of Thrawn'' duology (1997\u201398), and his backstory is explored in various other novels, short stories, comics, and video games in the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]].\n\nThough [[Lucasfilm]] rebranded the Expanded Universe works as ''Star Wars'' Legends in 2014 and declared them non-[[Star Wars canon|canon]] to the franchise, Thrawn was nevertheless reintroduced back into the canon in the third season of the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[Animated series|animated television series]] ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', and was voiced by [[Lars Mikkelsen]]. ''Rebels'' is set at a point in the ''Star Wars'' timeline earlier than Thrawn's storylines in the ''Legends'' continuity. The character is also featured in a new ''Thrawn'' book trilogy by Zahn, consisting of ''[[Star Wars: Thrawn]]'' (2017), ''Thrawn: Alliances'' (2018) and ''Treason'' (2019). Another book trilogy, called ''Thrawn Ascendancy'', will start in May 2020 with ''Book I: Chaos Rising''.\n\nThrawn has been called one of the most significant and popular characters in the ''Legends'' continuity, and several [[Star Wars action figures|''Star Wars'' action figures]] and other merchandising have been produced of the character.\n{{toclimit|4}}\n\n==Character==\nThrawn first appeared in the 1991 [[Timothy Zahn]] novel ''Heir to the Empire'', the first installment of what became known as the ''Thrawn'' trilogy.<ref name=\"SW Heir\">{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/heir-to-the-empire-critical-reaction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714065516/http://www.starwars.com/news/heir-to-the-empire-critical-reaction |title=Critical Opinion: ''Heir to the Empire'' Reviews |website=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 4, 2014 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"SR 2017\">{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/star-wars-thrawn-novel-synopsis-cover-zahn/|title=''Star Wars: Thrawn'' Novel Synopsis \u2013 Grand Admiral's Rise to Power|date=January 21, 2017|first=Corey|last=Hoffmeyer|work=[[Screen Rant]]|accessdate=March 4, 2017}}</ref> He is a grand admiral in the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial Navy]],<ref name=\"EW Rebels\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/16/star-wars-rebels-resurrects-grand-admiral-thrawn |title=''Star Wars Rebels'' resurrects Grand Admiral Thrawn |first=Anthony |last=Breznican |authorlink=Anthony Breznican |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]  |date=July 16, 2016 |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"UT Rebels\">{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/07/16/thrawn-star-wars-rebels-celebration/87180842/ |title=Thrawn to make grand appearance in ''Star Wars Rebels'' |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Brian |last=Truitt |date=July 16, 2016 |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> and categorically \"the most brilliant of the Emperor's minions\".<ref name=\"PW Dark Force Rising\">{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-553-08574-7 |title=Fiction Book Review: ''Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy: Dark Force Rising'' |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=July 21, 2016}}</ref> A member of the alien [[Chiss]] species, Thrawn is described as a tall, solidly built humanoid with blue skin and glowing red eyes who wears the white uniform befitting his rank.<ref name=\"EW Rebels\"/><ref name=\"UT Rebels\"/> He has risen in power thanks to his \"tactical brilliance and cunning\", and has been described as \"one of the most threatening antagonists\" in the ''Star Wars'' universe.<ref name=\"Tor 2016-07\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/2016/07/18/grand-admiral-thrawn-will-be-reintroduced-to-star-wars-canon-through-rebels-new-zhan-book/ |title=Grand Admiral Thrawn Will Be Reintroduced to ''Star Wars'' Canon Through ''Rebels'', New Zahn Book |work=[[Tor.com]] |first=Emmet |last=Asher-Perrin |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 28, 2016}}</ref> He is an unparalleled military strategist and tactical genius who has made extensive study of military intelligence and other cultures, and the ''Thrawn'' trilogy finds him commanding the remnants of the Imperial Fleet in a series of stunning victories against the [[New Republic (Star Wars)#Legends|New Republic]].<ref name=\"Hansen-Raj\">{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/who-is-thrawn |title=Who Is Thrawn? |website=StarWars.com |first=Linda |last=Hansen-Raj |date=August 2, 2016 |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Databank\">{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/grandadmiralthrawn/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604033408/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/grandadmiralthrawn/index.html |title=Grand Admiral Thrawn |website=StarWars.com |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> His full name was given as Mitth'raw'nuruodo.\n\n[[IGN]] described the character as \"diabolical, brilliant and ruthless\".<ref name=\"IGN 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/18/star-wars-top-10-characters-for-tv?page=3 |title=''Star Wars'': Top 10 Characters For TV |date=January 18, 2008 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322225902/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/18/star-wars-top-10-characters-for-tv?page=3 |archivedate=March 22, 2016}}</ref> Zahn describes Thrawn's command style as considerably different from that of [[Darth Vader]] and other typical Imperial commanders; instead of punishing failure and dissent, Thrawn promotes creativity among his crew and accepts ideas from subordinates.<ref name=\"Hansen-Raj\"/> Zahn said in 2017:\n\n{{quote|Most of the Imperial leaders we see in the movies rule through a combination of fear and manipulation.

Approximately five years after the events depicted in ''Return of the Jedi'', the [[Rebel Alliance]], now known as the New Republic, has driven out the remnants of the old Imperial Starfleet to a distant corner of the galaxy, and is attempting to set up a functional government.

He sets his sights on the [[Wayland (Star Wars)|Wayland]] storehouse of the late [[Emperor Palpatine]], which contains a massive array of Spaarti cloning cylinders and a working cloaking shield. To this end, Thrawn and his subordinate [[Gilad Pellaeon]], captain of the [[Star Destroyer]] ''Chimaera'', enlist the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and his second-in-command Mara Jade to obtain several salamander-like creatures called [[ysalamiri]]. Thrawn uses the ysalamiri, which possess the natural ability to disrupt the Force, to subdue the storehouse's guardian [[Joruus C'baoth]], a twisted clone of a [[Jedi Master]] whom the Grand Admiral had killed years before. C'baoth offers his allegiance in exchange for two acolytes to bend to his will: Darth Vader's twin children, Luke and Leia. Thrawn sends some of his [[Noghri]] killers to capture Luke and a pregnant Leia, but their attempts repeatedly fail. Leia defends herself from one attack, and is surprised when the Noghri suddenly surrenders. Thrawn launches his first offensive, a series of hit-and-run attacks into New Republic territory, and then steals a complement of mole miners from [[Lando Calrissian]]'s mining operations on [[Nkllon]]. In need of warships, and with his previous tactics having forced over 100 lightly manned ships to be stationed at the [[Sluis Van]] shipyards as he planned, Thrawn invades. His [[stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] use the stolen miners to board and hijack the ships, but they are thwarted when Lando is able to seize control of the miners remotely.

Introduced in the 1991 [[Timothy Zahn]] novel ''Heir to the Empire'', he is an Imperial military commander who has taken control of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s remaining forces five years after the events of the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. Thrawn faces off against classic ''Star Wars'' characters [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Princess Leia]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], and [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''Thrawn'' trilogy (1991\u20131993), but is ultimately defeated. He is seemingly resurrected in the ''Hand of Thrawn'' duology (1997\u201398), and his backstory is explored in various other novels, short stories, comics, and video games in the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]].\n\nThough [[Lucasfilm]] rebranded the Expanded Universe works as ''Star Wars'' Legends in 2014 and declared them non-[[Star Wars canon|canon]] to the franchise, Thrawn was nevertheless reintroduced back into the canon in the third season of the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[Animated series|animated television series]] ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', voiced by [[Lars Mikkelsen]].

To this end, Thrawn and his subordinate [[Gilad Pellaeon]], captain of the [[Star Destroyer]] ''Chimaera'', enlist the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and his second-in-command Mara Jade to obtain several salamander-like creatures called [[ysalamiri]]. Thrawn uses the ysalamiri, which possess the natural ability to disrupt the Force, to subdue the storehouse's guardian [[Joruus C'baoth]], a twisted clone of a [[Jedi Master]] whom the Grand Admiral had killed years before. C'baoth offers his allegiance in exchange for two acolytes to bend to his will: Darth Vader's twin children, Luke and Leia. Thrawn sends some of his [[Noghri]] killers to capture Luke and a pregnant Leia, but their attempts repeatedly fail. Leia defends herself from one attack, and is surprised when the Noghri suddenly surrenders. Thrawn launches his first offensive, a series of hit-and-run attacks into New Republic territory, and then steals a complement of mole miners from [[Lando Calrissian]]'s mining operations on [[Nkllon]]. In need of warships, and with his previous tactics having forced over 100 lightly manned ships to be stationed at the [[Sluis Van]] shipyards as he planned, Thrawn invades. His [[stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] use the stolen miners to board and hijack the ships, but they are thwarted when Lando is able to seize control of the miners remotely.

He also established the [[CFRB]] radio station in Toronto (later acquired by outside interests). In 1931, he was awarded an experimental television licence in Canada. On May 6, 1939, he was working on radar when he died suddenly due to complications of a hemorrhage, at the age of 38. He left a widow, Velma, and a five-year-old son, Edward (known as Ted).

He also established the [[CFRB]] radio station in Toronto (later acquired by outside interests). In 1931, he was awarded an experimental television licence in Canada. On May 6, 1939, he was working on radar when he died suddenly due to complications of a hemorrhage, at the age of 38. He left a widow, Velma, and a five-year-old son, Edward (known as Ted). While his business interests were subsequently sold, his son later determined to carry on his father's legacy.<ref name=History/>\n\nIn 1960, [[Edward S.

It dates to the 18th century and functioned as a public fountain. It is located a short distance west of the [[Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja do Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento e Sant'Ana}}), also completed in the 18th century. The building is protected as a historic structure by the state of Bahia.<ref name=\"a\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"n\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain dates to the early 18th century. The Senate of the Chamber of Salvador expropriated land belonging to Sergeant Major [[Jos\u00e9 Batista de Carvalho]] in 1724 to build a road to connect the fountain to the historic center of Salvador; the road remains as the Rua do Gravat\u00e1. It once supplied water to the neighborhoods of Mouraria, Palma, and Santana.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\nLu\u00eds dos Santos Vilhena commented in 1801: \n\n<blockquote>Inside the city, just below the Church and Parish of Santa Ana, is the Fonte do Gravat\u00e1, the most filthy and worst of all; it is, however, the most frequented because it is the only public [fountain] within the city.<ref name=\"sipac\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Santa Casa da Misericordia (Salvador)|Santa Casa da Misericordia]] of Salvador claimed ownership of the fountain and its surrounding property in 1846; it lost the case in a court heard by municipal authorities. The city mandated an inspection and repair of all fountains in Salvador after a drought from 1883 to 1885; a reference to the Gravat\u00e1 Fountain appears in the report.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/>\n\nWater testing was performed in the fountain in 2015 and it was found to be crystalline, with a moderate, continuous flow. The fountain is now used as housing by homeless people; it is polluted by human urine, organic, and inorganic pollutants.<ref name=\"a\"/>\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain is located at the intersection of Rua do Gravata and Rua da Fonte do Gravata, a small street that leads up to the Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne. It is located below the second line of hills beyond the historic center of Salvador. The fountain, once located on a hillside, is located below the street level and is accessible by stairs. It is now surrounded by numerous homes of the 19th century.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain has a rectangular plan with a vault, crowned by a simple pediment. It is constructed of stone masonry. Similar to other fountains in Bahia, it is surrounded by an iron fence with a gate. It had two functioning spouts as late as the 1970s, similar to those reported by Lu\u00eds dos Santos Vilhena in 1801.

It dates to the 18th century and functioned as a public fountain. It is located a short distance west of the [[Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja do Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento e Sant'Ana}}), also completed in the 18th century. The building is protected as a historic structure by the state of Bahia.<ref name=\"a\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain dates to the early 18th century. The Senate of the Chamber of Salvador expropriated land belonging to Sergeant Major [[Jos\u00e9 Batista de Carvalho]] in 1724 to build a road to connect the fountain to the historic center of Salvador; the road remains as the Rua do Gravat\u00e1. It once supplied water to the neighborhoods of Mouraria, Palma, and Santana.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\nLu\u00eds dos Santos Vilhena commented in 1801: \n\n<blockquote>Inside the city, just below the Church and Parish of Santa Ana, is the Fonte do Gravat\u00e1, the most filthy and worst of all; it is, however, the most frequented because it is the only public [fountain] within the city.<ref name=\"sipac\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Santa Casa da Misericordia (Salvador)|Santa Casa da Misericordia]] of Salvador claimed ownership of the fountain and its surrounding property in 1846; it lost the case in a court heard by municipal authorities. The city mandated an inspection and repair of all fountains in Salvador after a drought from 1883 to 1885; a reference to the Gravat\u00e1 Fountain appears in the report.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/>\n\nWater testing was performed in the fountain in 2015 and it was found to be crystalline, with a moderate, continuous flow. The fountain is now used as housing by homeless people; it is polluted by human urine, organic, and inorganic pollutants.<ref name=\"a\"/>\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain is located at the intersection of Rua do Gravata and Rua da Fonte do Gravata, a small street that leads up to the Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne. It is located below the second line of hills beyond the historic center of Salvador. The fountain, once located on a hillside, is located below the street level and is accessible by stairs. It is now surrounded by numerous homes of the 19th century.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain has a rectangular plan with a vault, crowned by a simple pediment. It is constructed of stone masonry. Similar to other fountains in Bahia, it is surrounded by an iron fence with a gate. It had two functioning spouts as late as the 1970s, similar to those reported by Lu\u00eds dos Santos Vilhena in 1801. The catchment basin is shallow and slightly below the street level; the fountain has a [[decantation tank]] to regulate water flow.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==Protected status==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain is a protected structure by the [[Bahian Institute of Artistic Culture and Heritage]] (''Instituto do Patrim\u00f4nio Art\u00edstico e Cultural da Bahia'') under Decree no. 001/84 of 1984.<ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==Access==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain is located on the corner of Rua do Gravata and Rua da Fonte do Gravata in a busy commercial district. The fountain is in an advanced state of filth and disrepair.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"a\">{{cite journal|last1=Alves|first1=Helena Maria A.|last2=Martins|first2=Djav\u00e3 De S.|last3=Almeida|first3=Antonio R. de|last4=Garcia|first4=Rui Jesus L.|last5=Monteiro|first5=T\u00e2nia Maria S.|last6=Lima|first6=Claudia Do E.|last7=Sant'Anna|first7=Julia Cardoso|last8=Concei\u00e7\u00e3o|first8=Emily Karle dos S.|last9=Moreira|first9=Ueider A.|title=Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da Qualidade das \u00c1guas das Principais Fontes P\u00fablicas de Salvador (Ba)|journal=Interfaces Cient\u00edficas - Sa\u00fade e Ambiente|volume=5|issue=1|year=2016|pages=65|issn=2316-3798|doi=10.17564/2316-3798.2016v5n1p65-80}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ipac-ba\">{{cite book |last=Secretaria da Ind\u00fastria, Com\u00e9rcio e Turismo (Bahia, Brazil) |title=IPAC-BA: invent\u00e1rio de prote\u00e7\u00e3o do acervo cultural |edition=1 |volume = 1 |location=Salvador, Brazil |publisher=Secretaria da Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio |year=1997 |pages=61\u201362}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"sipac\">{{cite web |url=http://patrimonio.ipac.ba.gov.br/bem/fonte-do-gravata/ |title=Fonte Grande do Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo |language=pt |publisher=Patrim\u00f4nio Cultural da Bahia |date=2020 |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Bahia]]\n[[Category:Fountains in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Portuguese Colonial architecture in Brazil]]\n", "name_user": "Prburley", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravat%C3%A1_Fountain"}
