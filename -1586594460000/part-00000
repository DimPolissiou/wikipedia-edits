incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n*On 20 April 2017, a Australian, Jason Peter Darragh, was involved in an altercation with 2 [[Singapore Police Force|Singapore police force officers]] in the early hours in an intoxicated state. He was jailed for six and half months at a resulting court hearing. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/australian-man-jailed-for-assaulting-policemen-at-changi-airport-9173332|title=Australian man jailed for assaulting policemen at Changi Airport|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 29 November 2017, a tow truck towing a Singapore Airlines [[Boeing 777-200]] caught fire, covering the aircraft in black soot.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers.

incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n*On 20 April 2017, a Australian, Jason Peter Darragh, was involved in an altercation with 2 [[Singapore Police Force|Singapore police force officers]] in the early hours in an intoxicated state. He was jailed for six and half months at a resulting court hearing. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/australian-man-jailed-for-assaulting-policemen-at-changi-airport-9173332|title=Australian man jailed for assaulting policemen at Changi Airport|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 29 November 2017, a tow truck towing a Singapore Airlines [[Boeing 777-200]] caught fire, covering the aircraft in black soot.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers. The system was upgraded in 2007 with new technologies supplied by Mitsubishi, connecting to Terminal 3 and separating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks.\n\n===Inter-terminal transportation===\n[[File:Changi Airport Skytrain Crystal Mover.JPG|thumb|Changi Airport Skytrain]]\n\n[[File:Changi Airport MRT Station (EWL - Changi Branch) - Platform A.jpg|thumb|[[Changi Airport MRT station]] platforms]]\n{{main|Changi Airport Skytrain}}\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected by the free [[Changi Airport Skytrain|Skytrain]] service, which operates from 05:00 to 02:30.

The Etruscan wolf has been described as a small wolf-like dog. The Etruscan wolf is accepted as the ancestor of ''[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' that is the ancestor of the [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus'').<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Canis etruscus 4.JPG|thumb|left|Incomplete mounted skeleton, Museo di Paleontologia di Firenze]] \nThe [[fossil record]] for ancient [[vertebrates]] is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic analysis]] but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.<ref name=sardella2014/> Several species of [[Caninae]] from the Pleistocene of Europe have been described. Most of their [[Systematics|systematic]] and [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationships have not been resolved because of their similar morphology.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\nUpper [[Valdarno]] is the name given to that part of the [[Arno]] valley situated in the provinces of [[Florence]] and [[Arezzo]], Italy. The region is bounded by the [[Pratomagno]] mountain range to the north and east and by the Chianti mountains to the south and west. The Upper Valdarno Basin has provided the remains of three fossil canid species dated to the Late [[Villafranchian]] era of Europe 1.9-1.8 million years ago that arrived with a faunal turnover around that time. The Swiss paleontologist [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]] discovered two species in this region, these being the Falconer's wolf (''[[Canis falconeri]]'' Forsyth Major 1877) that was later reclassified as ''Lycaon falconeri'', and the smaller Etruscan wolf (''C. etruscus'' Forsyth Major 1877).<ref name=lucenti2016/> Forsyth Major did not publish a complete description of the Etruscan wolf,<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> and later Domenico Del Campana worked on expanding Forsyth Major's descriptions when he recognized among the specimens a smaller, [[jackal]]-sized species.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> This he named the [[Canis arnensis|Arno River dog]]<ref name=lucenti2016/> (''C. arnensis'' Del Campana 1913) in honour of the nearby [[Arno]] river.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n===Type Specimen===\n[[File:Canis etruscus restoration.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendition]]\nThe [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] is a cranium from an unrecorded locality of Upper Valdarno. It is housed in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum.

The Etruscan wolf has been described as a small wolf-like dog. The Etruscan wolf is accepted as the ancestor of ''[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' that is the ancestor of the [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus'').<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Canis etruscus 4.JPG|thumb|left|Incomplete mounted skeleton, Museo di Paleontologia di Firenze]] \nThe [[fossil record]] for ancient [[vertebrates]] is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic analysis]] but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.<ref name=sardella2014/> Several species of [[Caninae]] from the Pleistocene of Europe have been described. Most of their [[Systematics|systematic]] and [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationships have not been resolved because of their similar morphology.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\nUpper [[Valdarno]] is the name given to that part of the [[Arno]] valley situated in the provinces of [[Florence]] and [[Arezzo]], Italy. The region is bounded by the [[Pratomagno]] mountain range to the north and east and by the Chianti mountains to the south and west. The Upper Valdarno Basin has provided the remains of three fossil canid species dated to the Late [[Villafranchian]] era of Europe 1.9-1.8 million years ago that arrived with a faunal turnover around that time. The Swiss paleontologist [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]] discovered two species in this region, these being the Falconer's wolf (''[[Canis falconeri]]'' Forsyth Major 1877) that was later reclassified as ''Lycaon falconeri'', and the smaller Etruscan wolf (''C. etruscus'' Forsyth Major 1877).<ref name=lucenti2016/> Forsyth Major did not publish a complete description of the Etruscan wolf,<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> and later Domenico Del Campana worked on expanding Forsyth Major's descriptions when he recognized among the specimens a smaller, [[jackal]]-sized species.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/> This he named the [[Canis arnensis|Arno River dog]]<ref name=lucenti2016/> (''C. arnensis'' Del Campana 1913) in honour of the nearby [[Arno]] river.<ref name=\"cherin2014\"/>\n\n===Type Specimen===\n[[File:Canis etruscus restoration.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendition]]\nThe [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] is a cranium from an unrecorded locality of Upper Valdarno. It is housed in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum.
