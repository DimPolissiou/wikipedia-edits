Lt Gen Hasnain spoke at Singapore on the subject ' Applying Counter Narratives in Conflict Stabilisation : The Heart is My Weapon Doctrine in Kashmir's Conflict Zone'.\n\n==Post-Retirement==\nEver since his superannuation on 30 June 2013, General Hasnain has actively pursued intellectual activities and promoted the cause and perception of the Indian Army. He is a prolific member of Track 2 diplomacy with Pakistan bringing his vast experience of J&K to the meetings. He is a Visiting Fellow of the [[Vivekananda International Foundation]], [[New Delhi]] and Senior Fellow with Delhi Policy Group, two of the most prominent think tanks of New Delhi besides being on the Governing Council of Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.  He writes for ''[[The Times of India ]]'', ''[[The Indian Express]]'', ''[[Swarajya (magazine)|Swarajya]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/ideas/pakistan-in-dangerous-times-but-still-in-denial|title=Pakistan In Dangerous Times But Still In Denial|website=www.swarajyamag.com}}</ref> ''FAUJI INDIA'' and ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'' on various strategic issues. He lectures at the [[Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration|National Academy of Administration]], [[Mussoorie]] and [[National Academy of Customs, Excise and Narcotics]] (NACEN), [[Faridabad]], besides the [[College of Air Warfare]], [[Army War College, Mhow]], [[Defence Services Staff College]] and various institutions under the [[All India Management Association]] and [[Centre for Land Warfare Studies]] (CLAWS). He has recently lectured at [[United Service Institution]] (USI) and [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]] (IDSA).\n\nGen Hasnain introduced the Scholar Warrior concept to the Indian Army and after superannuation has extensively promoted the necessity of incorporating military intellectualism and strategic culture in India. In this regard he is a popular  speaker at corporate events. Among the companies that he has addressed include Deloitte, Deutsche Bank, Ashok Leyland, Larsen & Toubro (Design), Amdocs Pune, Atoc, Sanofi Pasteur, SBI, KPMG and Amit Rathi and Knight Frank India. His talks have been greatly appreciated because of the passion, patriotic fervor and linkages that he establishes between national security, the common citizen and the corporate world. He has spoken at nine chapters of the Young Presidents Organization (YPO) and the Chennai chapter of the Entrepreneur Organisation of India, each on a different subject. He spoke at the Regional Meeting of the Owner's Forum in Mar 2017 and DEc 2018; a reputed international corporate club of families who own business houses. A signature event was his talk to the visiting members of YPO Coastal California, on India-US relations. Gen Hasnain's attraction as a speaker of international repute is his long experience in turbulent zones and ability to handle touchy issues with ease. His vast knowledge of history, politics and international relations allows him to address and explain issues which would need days of individual study to understand and comprehend.\n\n==Awards and Decorations==\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Param Vishisht Seva Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Uttam_Yudh_Seva_Medal_ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|[[File:Ati Vishisht Seva Medal ribbon.svg|105px]]\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Sena_Medal_ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Vishisht Seva Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Samanya_Seva_medal.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Operation_Vijay_star.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Siachen_Glacier_Medal_Ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Special_Service_Medal_Ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Operation_Vijay_medal.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Operation_Parakram_medal.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Sainya_Seva_Medal_Ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_High_Altitude_Medal_Ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Videsh_Seva_Medal_Ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_50th_Anniversary_Independence_medal.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND 30 Years Long Service Ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND 20YearsServiceMedalRibbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND 9YearsServiceMedalRibbon.svg|width=106}}\n|[[File:UNAMIR Medal bar.svg|105px]] \n|[[File:UNTSO Medal bar.gif|105px]] \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|<center>[[Param Vishisht Seva Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Uttam Yudh Seva Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Ati Vishisht Seva Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Sena Medal]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>[[Vishisht Seva Medal]] (Bar)</center>\n|<center>[[Samanya Seva Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Operation Vijay Star]]</center>\n|<center>[[Siachen Glacier Medal]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>[[Indian military decorations#Service and campaign medals|Special Service Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Indian military decorations#Service and campaign medals|Operation Vijay Medal]]\n|<center>[[Operation Parakram Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Sainya Seva Medal]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>[[Indian military decorations#Service and campaign medals|High Altitude Service Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Indian military decorations#Service and campaign medals|Videsh Seva Medal]]\n|<center>[[Indian military decorations#Service and campaign medals|50th Anniversary of Independence Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Indian military decorations#Long service awards|30 Years Long Service Medal]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>[[Indian military decorations#Long service awards|20 Years Long Service Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[Indian military decorations#Long service awards|9 Years Long Service Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[UNAMIR|UN Mission in Rwanda Medal]]</center>\n|<center>[[UNTSO|UN Mission in Middle East Medal]]</center>\n|}</center>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGen.

The energy of motion is converted into [[waste heat]] which must be dispersed.\n\n[[Hydraulic brakes|Hydraulically]] [[Actuator|actuated]] disc brakes are the most commonly used form of brake for motor vehicles, but the principles of a disc brake are applicable to almost any rotating shaft.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:suspension.jpg|thumb|upright|On automobiles, disc brakes are often located within the wheel]]\n[[File:2009-02-10 2008 Yamaha FZ6 front rotor close-up.jpg|thumb|A drilled motorcycle brake disc]]\n\nDevelopment of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. In 1902, the [[Lanchester Motor Company]] designed brakes that looked and operated in a similar way to a modern disc-brake system even though the disc was thin and a cable activated the brake pad.<ref name=\"hemmings1\">{{cite web|last=Lentinello |first =Richard |title=The first car with disc brakes really was . . . |url= https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hsx/2011/04/The-first-car-with-disc-brakes-really-was------/3698201.html |publisher=Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car |date=April 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref> Other designs were not practical or widely available in cars for another 60 years. Successful application began in airplanes before World War II, and even the [[Tiger I|German Tiger]] tank was fitted with discs in 1942. After the war, technological progress began to arrive in the 1950s, leading to a critical demonstration of superiority at the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race, which required braking from high speeds several times per lap. The [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] racing team won, using disc brake equipped cars, with much of the credit being given to the brakes' superior performance over rivals equipped with [[drum brake]]s. Mass production began with the 1955 [[Citro\u00ebn DS]].\n\nCompared to drum brakes, disc brakes offer better stopping performance because the disc is more readily cooled.  As a consequence discs are less prone to the [[brake fade]] caused when brake components overheat.  Disc brakes also recover more quickly from immersion (wet brakes are less effective than dry ones).\n\nMost drum brake designs have at least one leading shoe, which gives a [[Servomechanism|servo-effect]]. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always proportional to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any brake servo, braking pedal, or lever.  This tends to give the driver better \"feel\" and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to \"bell mouthing\" and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.\n\nThe disc is usually made of [[cast iron]], but may in some cases be made of composites such as [[reinforced carbon\u2013carbon]] or [[ceramic matrix composite]]s. This is connected to the ''wheel'' and/or the ''axle''. To slow down the wheel, friction material in the form of [[brake pad]]s, mounted on the [[brake caliper]], is forced mechanically, [[hydraulic brake|hydraulically]], [[pneumatics|pneumatically]], or [[electromagnet]]ically against both sides of the disc. [[Friction]] causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or stop.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early experiments===\nDevelopment of disc brakes began in England in the 1890s.\n\nThe first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by [[Frederick William Lanchester]] in his Birmingham factory in 1902 and used successfully on [[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester cars]]. However, the limited choice of metals in this period meant that he had to use copper as the braking medium acting on the disc. The poor state of the roads at this time, no more than dusty, rough tracks, meant that the copper wore quickly making the system impractical.<ref name=\"hemmings1\"/>\n\nIn 1921, the [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycle company introduced a form of disc brake on the front wheel of their overhead-valve sports models. Patented by the British Motorcycle & Cycle-[https://www.letsdiskuss.com/which-muscle-car-should-i-buy-in-india-and-where-to-get-it Car] Research Association, Douglas described the device as a \"novel wedge brake\" working on a \"bevelled hub flange\", the brake was operated by a [[Bowden cable]]. Front and rear brakes of this type were fitted to the machine on which [[Tom Sheard]] rode to victory in the 1923 [[Senior TT]].<ref>{{cite journal ||date=26 September 1957|title=The Editor's Correspondence - Vintage Disc Brakes|journal=Motor Cycling|publisher=Temple Press Ltd|location=London|pages=669}}</ref>\n\nSuccessful application began on railroad [[streamliner]] passenger trains and in airplanes and tanks before and during World War II. In the US, the [[Budd Company]] introduced disc brakes on the [[General Pershing Zephyr]] for the [[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy|Burlington Railroad]] in 1938. By the early 1950s, disc brakes were being regularly applied to new passenger rolling stock.<ref>D.P. Morgan, \"All About the RDC,\" ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains & Travel]]'' magazine, March 1953</ref> In Britain, the [[Daimler Company]] used disc brakes on its [[Daimler Armoured Car]] of 1939, the disc brakes, made by the [[Lucas Industries#Girling|Girling]] company, were necessary because in that [[four-wheel drive]] (4x4) vehicle the [[Epicyclic gearing|epicyclic]] [[final drive]] was in the wheel hubs and therefore left no room for conventional hub-mounted [[drum brake]]s.<ref>http://daimler-fighting-vehicles.co.uk/DFV-File%20Part%20Af%20-%20DAC%20Design%20&%20Development.pdf</ref>\n\nAt Germany's [[Argus Motoren]], Hermann Klaue (1912-2001) had patented<ref>https://www.google.gg/patents/US2323052 Disk brake for use in motor cars, airplanes, and the like US 2323052 A</ref> disc brakes in 1940. Argus supplied wheels fitted with disc brakes e.g. for the [[Arado Ar 96]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de/Waffen/Ar96.htm|title=Lexikon der Wehrmacht - Ar 96|author=|date=|website=www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> The German [[Tiger I]] heavy tank, was introduced in 1942 with a 55&nbsp;cm Argus-Werke disc<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanhamby.com/transmission.shtml|title=Tiger I Information Center - Transmission and Steering|author=|date=|website=www.alanhamby.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> on each drive shaft.\n\nThe American [[Crosley]] Hot Shot is often given credit for the first automotive production disc brakes. For six months in 1950, Crosley built a car with these brakes, then returned to drum brakes. Lack of sufficient research caused reliability problems, such as sticking and corrosion, especially in regions using salt on winter roads.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> Drum brake conversions for Hot Shots were quite popular.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> The Crosley disc was a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] development, a caliper type with ventilated disc, originally designed for aircraft applications.<ref name=\"hemmings1\"/>\n\n[[Chrysler]] developed a unique braking system, offered from 1949 to 1953. Instead of the disc with caliper squeezing on it, this system used twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast-iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\">{{cite book |last=Langworth |first=Richard M. |title=Chrysler and Imperial: The Postwar Years |publisher=Motorbooks International |year=1994 |isbn=0-87938-034-9}}</ref> The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard [[wheel cylinder]]s.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> Because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown and the [[Chrysler Town & Country (1941\u20131988)|Town and Country Newport]] in 1950.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> This four-wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of [[St. Joseph, Michigan]], under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]].<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> Chrysler discs were \"self energizing,\" in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided brake fade, promoted cooler running, and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler twelve-inch drums.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/> Today's owners consider the [[Ausco_Lambert_disc_brake|Ausco-Lambert]] very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.<ref name=\"Langworth 1996\"/>\n\n===First use in racing===\nThe first use of disc brakes in racing was in 1951, one of the [[BRM Type 15]]s using a Girling-produced set, a first for a [[Formula One]] car. Reliable caliper-type disc brakes later appeared in 1953 on the [[Jaguar C-Type]] racing car. These brakes helped the company to win the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/race/sports-cars/le-mans/le-mans-1953-jaguars-gigantic-leap/ |first=Paul |last=Fearnley |title=Le Mans 1953: Jaguar's gigantic leap - History, Le Mans |publisher=Motor Sport Magazine |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> developed in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. That same year, the aluminum bodied [[Austin-Healey 100#100S|Austin-Healey 100S]], of which 50 were made, was the first car sold to the public to have disc brakes, fitted to all 4 wheels.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Mike |title=A to Z of Sports Cars 1945\u20131990 |publisher=Bay View Books |year=1991 |isbn=978-1-870979-81-8 }}</ref>\n\n===Mass production===\nThe first [[mass production]] use of the modern automotive disc brake was in 1955, on the [[Citro\u00ebn DS]], which featured caliper-type front disc brakes among its many innovations.<ref name=\"hemmings1\"/> These discs were mounted inboard near the transmission, and were powered by the vehicle's central hydraulic system.  This model went on to sell 1.5 million units over 20 years with the same brake setup.\n\nThe [[Jensen 541]], with four-wheel disc brakes, followed in 1956.<ref name=\"hemmings1\"/><ref>{{cite book |publisher=The Motor |title=October 17 |year=1956 }}</ref> Triumph exhibited a 1956 [[Triumph TR3|TR3]]  with disc brakes to the public, but the first production cars with Girling front-disc brakes were made in September 1956.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lentinello |first=Richard |title=The first car with disc brakes really was . . . |journal=Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car |date=April 2011 |url= https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hsx/2011/04/The-first-car-with-disc-brakes-really-was------/3698201.html |accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisc brakes were most popular on [[sports car]]s when they were first introduced, since these vehicles are more demanding about brake performance. Discs have now become the more common form in most passenger vehicles, although many (particularly light weight vehicles) use [[Drum brake|drum brakes]] on the rear wheels to keep costs and weight down as well as to simplify the provisions for a [[parking brake]]. As the front brakes perform most of the braking effort, this can be a reasonable compromise.\n\nMany early implementations for automobiles located the brakes on the [[inboard brake|inboard]] side of the [[driveshaft]], near the [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An inboard location reduces the [[unsprung weight]] and eliminates a source of heat transfer to the tires.\n\nHistorically, brake discs were manufactured throughout the world with a strong concentration in Europe and America. Between 1989 and 2005, manufacturing of brake discs migrated predominantly to China.\n\n===In the U.S.===\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, the United States built another production automobile equipped with disc brakes - the 1963 [[Studebaker Avanti]]<ref name=\"cv\">{{cite web |url= http://www.pointhappy.com/cvcars/avanti.htm |title=The Avanti \u2014 Born in Palm Springs |publisher=Point Happy Interactive |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> (the [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] system was optional on some of the other Studebaker models<ref>{{cite web|title=1963\u20131964 Studebaker Avanti|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-studebaker-avanti.htm |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |author=Auto Editors of''Consumer Guide''|date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref>).

[[MV Agusta]] was the first to offer a front disc brake motorcycle to the public on a small scale in 1965, on their relatively expensive [[MV Agusta 600|600 touring motorcycle]], using a mechanical brake linkage.<ref name=Frank2003>{{cite book |title= Honda Motorcycles |first=Aaron |last=Frank |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI |year=2003 |isbn=0-7603-1077-7 |page=80 }}</ref> In 1969 Honda introduced the more affordable [[Honda CB750|CB750]], which had a single hydraulically-actuated front disc brake (and a rear drum brake), and which sold in huge numbers.<ref name=Frank2003/> Disc brakes are now common on motorcycles, [[moped]]s and even [[mountain bike]]s.\n\n==Brake disc==\n[[File:Detail of - AMC Pacer - right front disc brake and suspension system.jpg|thumb|upright|Front automobile brake with rectangular open slots visible between the disc's friction surfaces]]\nThe brake disc (or rotor) is the rotating part of a wheel's disc brake assembly, against which the brake pads are applied. The material is typically [[gray iron]],<ref name=Intro-Ihm/> a form of [[cast iron]]. The design of the discs varies somewhat. Some are simply solid, but others are hollowed out with fins or vanes joining together the disc's two contact surfaces (usually included as part of a casting process). The weight and power of the vehicle determines the need for ventilated discs.<ref name=\"whatsnewAMC\"/> The \"ventilated\" disc design helps to dissipate the generated heat and is commonly used on the more-heavily loaded front discs.\n\nDiscs for motorcycles, bicycles, and many cars often have holes or slots cut through the disc. This is done for better [[heat dissipation]], to aid surface-water dispersal, to reduce noise, to reduce mass, or for marketing cosmetics.\n\nSlotted discs have shallow channels machined into the disc to aid in removing dust and gas. Slotting is the preferred method in most racing environments to remove gas and water and to deglaze brake pads. Some discs are both drilled and slotted. Slotted discs are generally not used on standard vehicles because they quickly wear down brake pads; however, this removal of material is beneficial to race vehicles since it keeps the pads soft and avoids [[Glass transition|vitrification]] of their surfaces. On the road, drilled or slotted discs still have a positive effect in wet conditions because the holes or slots prevent a film of water building up between the disc and the pads.\n[[File:Upgraded-Disk-brake.JPG|thumb|Example of two piece disc in an aftermarket application]]\nTwo piece discs (rotors) are a disc where the center mounting part of the disc is manufactured separately from the outer friction ring. The central section used for fitment is often referred to as the bell or hat and is commonly manufactured from an alloy such as a [[7005 aluminium alloy|7075 alloy]] and hard [[anodised]] for a lasting finish. The outer disc ring or rotor usually is manufactured from [[Gray iron|grey iron]] but in special applications can be from [[steel]]. Originating from Motorsport but now common in high performance applications and aftermarket upgrades. Two piece discs can be supplied as a fixed assembly with regular nuts, bolts and washers or a more complicated floating system where drive bobbins allow the two parts of the brake disc to expand and contract at different rates therefore reducing the chance a disc will warp from overheating. Key advantages of a two piece disc are a saving in critical [[Un sprung weight|un-sprung weight]] and the [[Dissipation factor|dissipation]] of heat from the disc surface through the alloy bell (hat). Both fixed and floating options have their drawbacks and advantages, floating discs are prone to rattle and collection of debris and best for suited to Motorsport whereas fixed is best for road use. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apracing.com/Info.aspx?InfoID=35&ProductID=1594|title=AP Racing - Race Car - Brake Discs - Ventilated Discs|website=www.apracing.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref>\n\n{{-}}\n===Motorcycles and scooters===\n[[File:W800 disk brake.jpg|thumb|Floating disc brake on [[Kawasaki W800]]]]\n[[File:Brembo Disc brake.jpg|thumb|Radially-mounted brake caliper on a [[Triumph Speed Triple]]]]\n[[Lambretta]] introduced the first high-volume production use of a single, floating, front disc brake, enclosed in a ventilated cast alloy hub and actuated by cable, on the 1962 TV175,<ref>[https://rideapart.com/articles/motorcycle-history-brakes Motorcycle History:Brakes], Ride Apart, 8 December 2013, Retrieved 2 June 2016</ref> followed by the range-topping GT200 in 1964.<ref>[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']], 10 September 1964, p.7 ''Lambretta centrespread advert. \"G.T. 200 The sportsman's choice.

Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior braking performance, such discs rust in the rain and become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc \"floats\" on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.motorcycle.com/how-to/disc-brake-tech-3437.html |title=Disc Brake Tech |first=Michael |last=Kresnicka |publisher=motorcycle.com |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher [[center of mass]]:[[wheelbase]] ratio, so they experience more [[weight transfer]] when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern [[sport bike]]s typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.\n\nEarly disc brakes (such as on the early Honda fours and the [[Norton Commando]]) sited the calipers on top of the disc, ahead of the fork slider. Although this gave the brake pads better cooling, it is now almost universal practice to site the caliper behind the slider (to reduce the angular momentum of the fork assembly). Rear disc calipers may be mounted above (e.g. [[BMW R1100S]]) or below (e.g. [[Yamaha TRX850]]) the swinging arm: a low mount provides for a marginally lower center of gravity, while an upper siting keeps the caliper cleaner and better-protected from road obstacles.\n\nOne problem with motorcycle disc brakes is that when a bike gets into a violent [[tank-slapper]] (high speed oscillation of the front wheel)  the brake pads in the calipers are forced away from the discs, so when the rider applies the brake lever the caliper pistons push the pads towards the discs without actually making contact. The rider immediately brakes harder, which pushes the pads onto the disc much more aggressively than during normal braking. For example, The Michele Pirro incident at Mugello,Italy 1 June 2018. <ref>https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/motogp/motogp-mutterings-mugello</ref> At least one manufacturer has developed a system to counter the pads being forced away.\n\nA modern development, particularly on inverted (\"upside down\", or \"USD\") forks is the radially mounted caliper. Although these are fashionable, there is no evidence that they improve braking performance, nor do they add to the stiffness of the fork. (Lacking the option of a fork brace, USD forks may be best stiffened by an oversize front axle).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n{{clear}}\n===Bicycles===\n{{see also|Bicycle brake#Disc brakes}}\n[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|left|thumb|[[Mountain bike]] front disc brake]]\n[[File:Santa Cruz 2013 Tallboy Al 11.jpg|thumb|upright|Rear disc brake caliper and disc on a mountain bike]]\n[[Mountain bike]] disc brakes may range from simple, mechanical (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on [[Downhill mountain biking|downhill racing bikes]]. Improved technology has seen the creation of vented discs for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid [[Brake fade|heat fade]] on fast alpine descents. Although less common, discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking, although drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sutherland's Handbook for Bicycle Mechanics Chapter 11 - Brakes |first=Howard |last=Sutherland |page=13 |year=2004 |edition=7th |publisher=Sutherland's Bicycle Shop Aids |url= http://www.sutherlandsbicycle.com/Chapter11.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014223452/http://www.sutherlandsbicycle.com/Chapter11.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2013 |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> Discs are thin, often about 2&nbsp;mm. Some use a two-piece floating disc style, others use a floating caliper, others use pads that float in the caliper, and some use one moving pad that makes the caliper slide on its mounts, pulling the other pad into contact with the disc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Because energy efficiency is so important in bicycles, an uncommon feature of bicycle brakes is that the pads retract to eliminate residual drag when the brake is released.{{Clarify|date=May 2017|reason=Don't brake pads retract slightly for all types of disc brakes?}} In contrast, most other brakes drag the pads lightly when released so as to minimise initial operational travel.{{Clarify|date=May 2017|reason=Brake pads usually drag slightly in other applications?}}\n\n===Heavy vehicles===\nDisc brakes are increasingly used on very large and heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One reason is that the disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance.<ref name=\"ganaway\">{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Ganaway |url=http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2002tactical/ganaway.pdf |title=Air Disc Brake Production, Use & Performance |publisher=NDIA Tactical Wheeled Vehicles Conference, Monterey California |date=2002-01-28 |accessdate=2010-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604041202/http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2002tactical/ganaway.pdf |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles.

[[Passenger car (rail)|Passenger rail cars]] and [[light rail vehicle]]s often use disc brakes outboard of the wheels, which helps ensure a free flow of cooling air. Some modern passenger rail cars, such as the [[Amfleet|Amfleet II cars]], use inboard disc brakes. This reduces wear from debris, and provides protection from rain and snow, which would make the discs slippery and unreliable. However, there is still plenty of cooling for reliable operation. Some airplanes have the brake mounted with very little cooling, and the brake gets quite hot in a stop. This is acceptable as there is sufficient time for cooling, where the maximum braking energy is very predictable.\nShould the braking energy exceed the maximum, for example during an emergency occurring during take-off, aircraft wheels can be fitted with a [[fusible plug]]<ref>https://patents.google.com/patent/US4628953A/en</ref> to prevent the tyre bursting. This is a milestone test in aircraft development.<ref>https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2014/07/a350-xwb-msn001-successfully-conducted-maximum-energy-rejected-take-off-test.html</ref>\n\n=== Automotive use ===\nFor automotive use, disc brake discs are commonly made of [[grey iron]].<ref name=Intro-Ihm>{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Ihm |title=Introduction to Gray Cast Iron Brake Rotor Metallurgy |url= http://www.sae.org/events/bce/tutorial-ihm.pdf |publisher=SAE |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> The [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] maintains a specification for the manufacture of grey iron for various applications. For normal car and light-truck applications, SAE specification J431 G3000 (superseded to G10) dictates the correct range of hardness, chemical composition, tensile strength, and other properties necessary for the intended use. Some racing cars and airplanes use brakes with carbon fiber discs and carbon fiber pads to reduce weight. Wear rates tend to be high, and braking may be poor or grabby until the brake is hot.\n\n===Racing===\n[[File:Ferrari F430 Challenge Brake.JPG|thumb|[[Reinforced carbon\u2013carbon|Reinforced carbon]] brake disc on a [[Ferrari F430]] [[Ferrari Challenge|Challenge]] race car]]\nIn racing and very-high-performance road cars, other disc materials have been employed. [[Reinforced carbon\u2013carbon|Reinforced carbon]] discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking systems such as those used on [[Concorde]] were introduced in [[Formula One]] by [[Brabham]] in conjunction with [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Alan |year=1985 |title=Brabham, the Grand Prix Cars |page=163 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=978-0-905138-36-7 }}</ref> Carbon\u2013carbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing [[unsprung weight]], giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid 1990s for example, but need to reach a very high [[operating temperature]] before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use. The extreme heat generated in these systems is visible during night racing, especially at shorter tracks. It is not uncommon to see the brake discs glowing red during use.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Ceramic composites===\n[[File:AMG Carbon Ceramic brake..JPG|thumb|Mercedes-Benz AMG carbon ceramic brake]]\n[[File:PCCB Wiki 9949.jpg|thumb|Porsche Carrera S composite ceramic brake]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[Ceramic]] discs are used in some high-performance cars and heavy vehicles.\n\nThe first development of the modern ceramic brake was made by British engineers for [[TGV]] applications in 1988. The objective was to reduce weight, the number of brakes per axle, as well as provide stable friction from high speeds and all temperatures. The result was a [[Ceramic composite|carbon-fibre-reinforced ceramic process]] which is now used in various forms for automotive, railway, and aircraft brake applications.\n\nDue to the high heat tolerance and mechanical strength of ceramic composite discs, they are often used on exotic vehicles where the cost is not prohibitive. They are also found in industrial applications where the ceramic disc's light weight and low-maintenance properties justify the cost. Composite brakes can withstand temperatures that would damage steel discs.\n\n[[Porsche]]'s Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) are siliconized carbon fiber, with high temperature capability, a 50% weight reduction over iron discs (hence reducing the vehicle's unsprung weight), a significant reduction in dust generation, substantially extended maintenance intervals, and enhanced durability in corrosive environments. Found on some of their more expensive models, it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense. They can be recognized by the bright yellow paintwork on the aluminum six-piston calipers. The discs are internally vented much like cast-iron ones, and cross-drilled.\n\n===Adjustment mechanism===\nIn automotive applications, the piston seal has a square cross section, also known as a square-cut seal.\n\nAs the piston moves in and out, the seal drags and stretches on the piston, causing the seal to twist. The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of a millimeter. The piston is allowed to move out freely, but the slight amount of drag caused by the seal stops the piston from fully retracting to its previous position when the brakes are released, and so takes up the slack caused by the wear of the brake pads, eliminating the need for return springs.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mike |last=Mavrigian |first2=Larry |last2=Carley |year=1998 |title=Brake Systems: OEM & Racing Brake Technology |page=81 |publisher=HP Books |isbn=9781557882813 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Fred |last=Puhn |year=1987 |title=Brake Handbook |page=31 |publisher=HP Trade |isbn=9780895862327 }}</ref>\n\nIn some rear disc calipers, the parking brake activates a mechanism inside the caliper that performs some of the same function.\n\n===Disc damage modes===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nDiscs are usually damaged in one of four ways: scarring, cracking, warping or excessive rusting. Service shops will sometimes respond to any disc problem by changing out the discs entirely, This is done mainly where the cost of a new disc may actually be lower than the cost of labour to resurface the old disc. Mechanically this is unnecessary unless the discs have reached manufacturer's minimum recommended thickness, which would make it unsafe to use them, or vane rusting is severe (ventilated discs only). Most leading vehicle manufacturers recommend brake disc skimming (US: turning) as a solution for lateral run-out, vibration issues and brake noises. The machining process is performed in a brake [[lathe]], which removes a very thin layer off the disc surface to clean off minor damage and restore uniform thickness. Machining the disc as necessary will maximise the mileage out of the current discs on the vehicle.\n\n===Run-out===\n[[Run-out]] is measured using a dial indicator on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc's face. It is typically measured about {{convert|1/2|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around {{convert|0.002|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=out}}. Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining the root cause of the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.\n\nDiscs can be machined to eliminate thickness variation and lateral run-out. Machining can be done in situ (on-car) or off-car (bench lathe). Both methods will eliminate thickness variation. Machining on-car with proper equipment can also eliminate lateral run-out due to hub-face non-perpendicularity.\n\nIncorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs. The disc's retaining bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is sandwiched in place by the wheel) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to fasten lug nuts can be bad practice, unless a torque wrench is used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force the bolts apply and tightening should be done with a [[torque wrench]].\n\nOften uneven pad transfer is confused for disc warping.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stoptech.com/technical-support/technical-white-papers/-warped-brake-disc-and-other-myths |first=Carroll |last=Smith |title=Warped- Brake Disc and Other Myths |publisher=Stoptech.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> The majority of brake discs diagnosed as \"warped\" are actually the result of uneven transfer of pad material. Uneven pad transfer can lead to thickness variation of the disc. When the thicker section of the disc passes between the pads, the pads will move apart and the brake pedal will raise slightly; this is pedal pulsation. The thickness variation can be felt by the driver when it is approximately {{convert|0.17|mm|in|4|abbr=on}} or greater (on automobile discs).\n\nThickness variation has many causes, but there are three primary mechanisms which contribute to the propagation of disc thickness variations. The first is improper selection of brake pads. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking for the first time in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break-in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break-in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc) every time the pads are changed. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is \"pad imprinting.\" This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken-in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.\n\nOnce the disc has some level of variation in thickness, uneven pad deposition can accelerate, sometimes resulting in changes to the crystal structure of the metal that composes the disc. As the brakes are applied, the pads slide over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more force is applied to the pads. The result is that the thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the brake disc heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in further uneven transfer of pad material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc's thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ({{convert|1200|-|1300|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}} <!-- {{convert|1200|-|1300|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off|disp=or}} -->), the metal can undergo a [[Phase transition|phase transformation]] and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as [[cementite]]. This [[iron carbide]] is very different from the cast iron the rest of the disc is composed of. It is extremely hard, brittle, and does not absorb heat well. After cementite is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the cementite within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and uneven heating characteristics of the disc to return.\n\n===Scarring===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nScarring (US: Scoring) can occur if brake pads are not changed promptly when they reach the end of their service life and are considered worn out. Once enough of the friction material has worn away, the pad's steel backing plate (for glued pads) or the pad retainer rivets (for riveted pads) will bear upon the disc's wear surface, reducing braking power and making scratches on the disc. Generally a moderately scarred / scored disc, which operated satisfactorily with existing brake pads, will be equally usable with new pads. If the scarring is deeper but not excessive, it can be repaired by machining off a layer of the disc's surface. This can only be done a limited number of times as the disc has a minimum rated safe thickness. The minimum thickness value is typically cast into the disc during manufacturing on the hub or the edge of the disc. In [[Pennsylvania]], which has one of the most rigorous auto safety inspection programs in North America, an automotive disc cannot pass safety inspection if any scoring is deeper than {{convert|.015|in|mm}}, and must be replaced if machining will reduce the disc below its minimum safe thickness.\n\nTo prevent scarring, it is prudent to periodically inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation is a logical time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel spring or drag tab as part of the pad assembly, which drags on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The produces a moderately loud squealing noise, alerting the driver that service is required. This will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32\".\n\n===Cracking===\nCracking is limited mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled near the edge of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of expansion in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the [[unsprung weight]] of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a [[heat sink]], but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.\nThese cracks occur due to the phenomenon of low cycle fatigue as a result of repeated hard braking.<ref name=\"2013_rashid_discbrakes\">{{cite journal|last1=Rashid|first1=Asim|last2=Str\u00f6mberg|date=2013|title=Sequential simulation of thermal stresses in disc brakes for repeated braking|url=http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A631333&dswid=3084|journal=[[Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part J|Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part J: Journal of Engineering Tribology]]|volume=227|issue=8|pages=919{{ndash}}929|doi=10.1177/1350650113481701|access-date=2019-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012231929/http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:631333/FULLTEXT01.pdf|archive-date=2019-10-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Rusting===\nThe discs are commonly made from cast iron and a certain amount of [[Rust|surface rust]] is normal. The disc contact area for the brake pads will be kept clean by regular use, but a vehicle that is stored for an extended period can develop significant rust in the contact area that may reduce braking power for a time until the rusted layer is worn off again. Rusting can also lead to disc warping when brakes are re-activated after storage because of differential heating between unrusted areas left covered by pads and rust around the majority of the disc area surface. Over time, vented brake discs may develop severe rust corrosion inside the ventilation slots, compromising the strength of the structure and needing replacement.<ref>{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hRmdC6hZ2q0C&pg=PA284 |title=Automotive Brakes |first=Jack |last=Erjavec |publisher=Cengage Learning |year= 2003 |isbn=9781401835262 }}</ref>\n\n==Calipers==\n[[File:Callipers Twin Pot.jpg|thumb|GM disc brake caliper (twin-piston, floating) removed from its mounting for changing pads]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe brake caliper is the assembly which houses the brake pads and pistons. The pistons are usually made of [[plastic]], [[aluminium]] or [[chrome plating|chrome-plated]] [[steel]].\n\nCalipers are of two types, floating or fixed. A fixed caliper does not move relative to the disc and is thus less tolerant of disc imperfections. It uses one or more pairs of opposing pistons to clamp from each side of the disc, and is more complex and expensive than a floating caliper.\n\nA floating caliper (also called a \"sliding caliper\") moves with respect to the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston on one side of the disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.\n\nAnother type of floating caliper is a swinging caliper.\nInstead of a pair of horizontal bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.\n\nVarious types of [[Bicycle brake#Caliper brakes|brake calipers]] are also used on [[Bicycle brake#Rim brakes|bicycle rim brakes]].\n\n===Pistons and cylinders===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe most common caliper design uses a single hydraulically actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use as many as twelve. Modern cars use different [[hydraulic]] circuits to actuate the brakes on each set of wheels as a [[car safety|safety measure]]. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a caliper is often referred to as the number of 'pots', so if a vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each caliper houses six pistons.\n\nBrake failure can result from failure of the piston to retract, which is usually a consequence of not operating the vehicle during prolonged storage outdoors in adverse conditions. On high-mileage vehicles, the piston [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]]s may leak, which must be promptly corrected.\n\n==Brake pads==\n{{main article|Brake pad}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nBrake pads are designed for high [[friction]] with brake pad material embedded in the disc in the process of bedding while wearing evenly. Friction can be divided into two parts. They are: adhesive and abrasive.\n\nDepending on the properties of the material of both the pad and the disc and the configuration and the usage, pad and disc wear rates will vary considerably. The properties that determine material wear involve trade-offs between performance and longevity.\n\nThe brake pads must usually be replaced regularly (depending on pad material, and drivestyle), and some are equipped with a mechanism that alerts drivers that replacement is needed, such as a thin piece of soft metal that rubs against the disc when the pads are too thin causing the brakes to squeal, a soft metal tab embedded in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a warning light when the brake pad gets thin, or an electronic [[sensor]].\n\nGenerally road-going vehicles have two brake pads per caliper, while up to six are installed on each racing caliper, with varying frictional properties in a staggered pattern for optimum performance.\n\nEarly brake pads (and [[Brake lining|linings]]) contained [[asbestos]], producing dust which should not be inhaled. Although newer pads can be made of ceramics, [[Kevlar]], and other plastics, inhalation of brake dust should still be avoided regardless of material.\n\n==Common problems==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Squeal===\nSometimes a loud noise or high pitched squeal occurs when the brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is produced by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as ''force-coupled excitation''). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding [[chamfer]] pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently of each other and thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application.<ref name=\"Hawk\">{{cite web|publisher=Hawk Performance |title=HP Plus - Autocross & Track Brake Compound }}</ref>\n\nCold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.\n\nSome lining wear indicators, located either as a semi-metallic layer within the brake pad material or with an external \"sensor\", are also designed to squeal when the lining is due for replacement. The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used. The wear sensor may only create squeal under braking when it first begins to indicate wear but is still a fundamentally different sound and pitch.<ref name=\"Hawk\"/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Centric Parts |title=FAQ's |date=2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Judder or shimmy===\nBrake judder is usually perceived by the driver as minor to severe vibrations transferred through the chassis during braking.<ref>Abdelahamid, M.K.

(1993), \"Brake roughness \u2013 disc brake torque variation\", disc distortion and vehicle response, SAE Technical Paper Series, no. 930803.</ref>\n\nThe judder phenomenon can be classified into two distinct subgroups: ''hot'' (or ''thermal''), or ''cold'' judder.\n\nHot judder is usually produced as a result of longer, more moderate braking from high speed where the vehicle does not come to a complete stop.<ref>Thoms, E. (1988), \"Disc brakes for heavy vehicles\", ''IMechE'', pp. 133\u2013137.</ref> It commonly occurs when a motorist decelerates from speeds of around {{convert|120|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|60|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, which results in severe vibrations being transmitted to the driver. These vibrations are the result of uneven thermal distributions, or ''hot spots''. Hot spots are classified as concentrated thermal regions that alternate between both sides of a disc that distort it in such a way that produces a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] waviness around its edges. Once the brake pads (friction material/brake lining) come in contact with the sinusoidal surface during braking, severe vibrations are induced, and can produce hazardous conditions for the person driving the vehicle.<ref>Anderson, E., et al. (1990), \"Hot spotting in automotive friction systems\", ''Wear'', v. 135, pp. 319\u2013337.</ref><ref>Barber, R., J. et al.

(1989), \"Friction\u2013induced noise and vibration of disc brakes\", ''Wear'', v. 133, pp. 39\u201345.</ref>\n\nCold judder, on the other hand, is the result of uneven disc wear patterns or disc thickness variation (DTV). These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: waviness and roughness of disc surface,<ref>J. Slavi\u010d, M.D. Bryant and M. Bolte\u017ear (2007), \"A new approach to roughness-induced vibrations on a slider.\", ''J. Sound and Vibration'', Vol. 306, Issues 3\u20135, 9 October 2007, pp. 732\u2013750.</ref> misalignment of axis (runout), elastic deflection, wear and friction material transfers.<ref name=Engel/><ref name=Rhee/><ref>Kim, M.-G. et al. (1996), \"Sensitivity analysis of chassis system to improve shimmy and brake judder vibration on the steering wheel\", SAE Technical Paper Series, no. 960734.</ref>\nEither type could potentially fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface on either side of the brake disc between the wheel hub and brake disc hub before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and brake disc. However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.\n\n===Dust===\n\nWhen braking force is applied, the act of abrasive friction between the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ebcbrakes.com/automotive_product_news/brakes_dust.shtml |title=Brake dust |publisher=EBC Brakes |date= |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off.<ref>\"Brake dust\". EBC Brakes. Retrieved 18 January 2014.</ref> Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake disc wear and brake pad wear.<ref>Hawk Performance. \"HP Plus - Autocross & Track Brake Compound.\" Hawk Performance.

In 1902, the [[Lanchester Motor Company]] designed brakes that looked and operated in a similar way to a modern disc-brake system even though the disc was thin and a cable activated the brake pad.<ref name=\"hemmings1\">{{cite web|last=Lentinello |first =Richard |title=The first car with disc brakes really was . . . |url= https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hsx/2011/04/The-first-car-with-disc-brakes-really-was------/3698201.html |publisher=Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car |date=April 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref> Other designs were not practical or widely available in cars for another 60 years. Successful application began in airplanes before World War II, and even the [[Tiger I|German Tiger]] tank was fitted with discs in 1942. After the war, technological progress began to arrive in the 1950s, leading to a critical demonstration of superiority at the [[1953 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race, which required braking from high speeds several times per lap. The [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] racing team won, using disc brake equipped cars, with much of the credit being given to the brakes' superior performance over rivals equipped with [[drum brake]]s. Mass production began with the 1955 [[Citro\u00ebn DS]].\n\nCompared to drum brakes, disc brakes offer better stopping performance because the disc is more readily cooled.  As a consequence discs are less prone to the [[brake fade]] caused when brake components overheat.  Disc brakes also recover more quickly from immersion (wet brakes are less effective than dry ones).\n\nMost drum brake designs have at least one leading shoe, which gives a [[Servomechanism|servo-effect]]. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always proportional to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any brake servo, braking pedal, or lever.  This tends to give the driver better \"feel\" and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to \"bell mouthing\" and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.\n\nThe disc is usually made of [[cast iron]], but may in some cases be made of composites such as [[reinforced carbon\u2013carbon]] or [[ceramic matrix composite]]s. This is connected to the ''wheel'' and/or the ''axle''. To slow down the wheel, friction material in the form of [[brake pad]]s, mounted on the [[brake caliper]], is forced mechanically, [[hydraulic brake|hydraulically]], [[pneumatics|pneumatically]], or [[electromagnet]]ically against both sides of the disc. [[Friction]] causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or stop.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early experiments===\nDevelopment of disc brakes began in England in the 1890s.\n\nThe first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by [[Frederick William Lanchester]] in his Birmingham factory in 1902 and used successfully on [[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester cars]]. However, the limited choice of metals in this period meant that he had to use copper as the braking medium acting on the disc. The poor state of the roads at this time, no more than dusty, rough tracks, meant that the copper wore quickly making the system impractical.<ref name=\"hemmings1\"/>\n\nIn 1921, the [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycle company introduced a form of disc brake on the front wheel of their overhead-valve sports models. Patented by the British Motorcycle & Cycle-Car Research Association, Douglas described the device as a \"novel wedge brake\" working on a \"bevelled hub flange\", the brake was operated by a [[Bowden cable]]. Front and rear brakes of this type were fitted to the machine on which [[Tom Sheard]] rode to victory in the 1923 [[Senior TT]].<ref>{{cite journal ||date=26 September 1957|title=The Editor's Correspondence - Vintage Disc Brakes|journal=Motor Cycling|publisher=Temple Press Ltd|location=London|pages=669}}</ref>\n\nSuccessful application began on railroad [[streamliner]] passenger trains and in airplanes and tanks before and during World War II. In the US, the [[Budd Company]] introduced disc brakes on the [[General Pershing Zephyr]] for the [[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy|Burlington Railroad]] in 1938. By the early 1950s, disc brakes were being regularly applied to new passenger rolling stock.<ref>D.P.

Discs have now become the more common form in most passenger vehicles, although many (particularly light weight vehicles) use [[Drum brake|drum brakes]] on the rear wheels to keep costs and weight down as well as to simplify the provisions for a [[parking brake]]. As the front brakes perform most of the braking effort, this can be a reasonable compromise.\n\nMany early implementations for automobiles located the brakes on the [[inboard brake|inboard]] side of the [[driveshaft]], near the [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An inboard location reduces the [[unsprung weight]] and eliminates a source of heat transfer to the tires.\n\nHistorically, brake discs were manufactured throughout the world with a strong concentration in Europe and America. Between 1989 and 2005, manufacturing of brake discs migrated predominantly to China.\n\n===In the U.S.===\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, the United States built another production automobile equipped with disc brakes - the 1963 [[Studebaker Avanti]]<ref name=\"cv\">{{cite web |url= http://www.pointhappy.com/cvcars/avanti.htm |title=The Avanti \u2014 Born in Palm Springs |publisher=Point Happy Interactive |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> (the [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] system was optional on some of the other Studebaker models<ref>{{cite web|title=1963\u20131964 Studebaker Avanti|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-studebaker-avanti.htm |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |author=Auto Editors of''Consumer Guide''|date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref>).

[[MV Agusta]] was the first to offer a front disc brake motorcycle to the public on a small scale in 1965, on their relatively expensive [[MV Agusta 600|600 touring motorcycle]], using a mechanical brake linkage.<ref name=Frank2003>{{cite book |title= Honda Motorcycles |first=Aaron |last=Frank |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI |year=2003 |isbn=0-7603-1077-7 |page=80 }}</ref> In 1969 Honda introduced the more affordable [[Honda CB750|CB750]], which had a single hydraulically-actuated front disc brake (and a rear drum brake), and which sold in huge numbers.<ref name=Frank2003/> Disc brakes are now common on motorcycles, [[moped]]s and even [[mountain bike]]s.\n\n==Brake disc==\n[[File:Detail of - AMC Pacer - right front disc brake and suspension system.jpg|thumb|upright|Front automobile brake with rectangular open slots visible between the disc's friction surfaces]]\nThe brake disc (or rotor) is the rotating part of a wheel's disc brake assembly, against which the brake pads are applied. The material is typically [[gray iron]],<ref name=Intro-Ihm/> a form of [[cast iron]]. The design of the discs varies somewhat. Some are simply solid, but others are hollowed out with fins or vanes joining together the disc's two contact surfaces (usually included as part of a casting process). The weight and power of the vehicle determines the need for ventilated discs.<ref name=\"whatsnewAMC\"/> The \"ventilated\" disc design helps to dissipate the generated heat and is commonly used on the more-heavily loaded front discs.\n\nDiscs for motorcycles, bicycles, and many cars often have holes or slots cut through the disc. This is done for better [[heat dissipation]], to aid surface-water dispersal, to reduce noise, to reduce mass, or for marketing cosmetics.\n\nSlotted discs have shallow channels machined into the disc to aid in removing dust and gas. Slotting is the preferred method in most racing environments to remove gas and water and to deglaze brake pads. Some discs are both drilled and slotted. Slotted discs are generally not used on standard vehicles because they quickly wear down brake pads; however, this removal of material is beneficial to race vehicles since it keeps the pads soft and avoids [[Glass transition|vitrification]] of their surfaces. On the road, drilled or slotted discs still have a positive effect in wet conditions because the holes or slots prevent a film of water building up between the disc and the pads.\n[[File:Upgraded-Disk-brake.JPG|thumb|Example of two piece disc in an aftermarket application]]\nTwo piece discs (rotors) are a disc where the center mounting part of the disc is manufactured separately from the outer friction ring. The central section used for fitment is often referred to as the bell or hat and is commonly manufactured from an alloy such as a [[7005 aluminium alloy|7075 alloy]] and hard [[anodised]] for a lasting finish. The outer disc ring or rotor usually is manufactured from [[Gray iron|grey iron]] but in special applications can be from [[steel]]. Originating from Motorsport but now common in high performance applications and aftermarket upgrades. Two piece discs can be supplied as a fixed assembly with regular nuts, bolts and washers or a more complicated floating system where drive bobbins allow the two parts of the brake disc to expand and contract at different rates therefore reducing the chance a disc will warp from overheating. Key advantages of a two piece disc are a saving in critical [[Un sprung weight|un-sprung weight]] and the [[Dissipation factor|dissipation]] of heat from the disc surface through the alloy bell (hat). Both fixed and floating options have their drawbacks and advantages, floating discs are prone to rattle and collection of debris and best for suited to Motorsport whereas fixed is best for road use. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apracing.com/Info.aspx?InfoID=35&ProductID=1594|title=AP Racing - Race Car - Brake Discs - Ventilated Discs|website=www.apracing.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref>\n\n{{-}}\n===Motorcycles and scooters===\n[[File:W800 disk brake.jpg|thumb|Floating disc brake on [[Kawasaki W800]]]]\n[[File:Brembo Disc brake.jpg|thumb|Radially-mounted brake caliper on a [[Triumph Speed Triple]]]]\n[[Lambretta]] introduced the first high-volume production use of a single, floating, front disc brake, enclosed in a ventilated cast alloy hub and actuated by cable, on the 1962 TV175,<ref>[https://rideapart.com/articles/motorcycle-history-brakes Motorcycle History:Brakes], Ride Apart, 8 December 2013, Retrieved 2 June 2016</ref> followed by the range-topping GT200 in 1964.<ref>[[The Motor Cycle|''Motor Cycle'']], 10 September 1964, p.7 ''Lambretta centrespread advert. \"G.T. 200 The sportsman's choice.

Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior braking performance, such discs rust in the rain and become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc \"floats\" on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.motorcycle.com/how-to/disc-brake-tech-3437.html |title=Disc Brake Tech |first=Michael |last=Kresnicka |publisher=motorcycle.com |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher [[center of mass]]:[[wheelbase]] ratio, so they experience more [[weight transfer]] when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern [[sport bike]]s typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.\n\nEarly disc brakes (such as on the early Honda fours and the [[Norton Commando]]) sited the calipers on top of the disc, ahead of the fork slider. Although this gave the brake pads better cooling, it is now almost universal practice to site the caliper behind the slider (to reduce the angular momentum of the fork assembly). Rear disc calipers may be mounted above (e.g. [[BMW R1100S]]) or below (e.g. [[Yamaha TRX850]]) the swinging arm: a low mount provides for a marginally lower center of gravity, while an upper siting keeps the caliper cleaner and better-protected from road obstacles.\n\nOne problem with motorcycle disc brakes is that when a bike gets into a violent [[tank-slapper]] (high speed oscillation of the front wheel)  the brake pads in the calipers are forced away from the discs, so when the rider applies the brake lever the caliper pistons push the pads towards the discs without actually making contact. The rider immediately brakes harder, which pushes the pads onto the disc much more aggressively than during normal braking. For example, The Michele Pirro incident at Mugello,Italy 1 June 2018. <ref>https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/motogp/motogp-mutterings-mugello</ref> At least one manufacturer has developed a system to counter the pads being forced away.\n\nA modern development, particularly on inverted (\"upside down\", or \"USD\") forks is the radially mounted caliper. Although these are fashionable, there is no evidence that they improve braking performance, nor do they add to the stiffness of the fork. (Lacking the option of a fork brace, USD forks may be best stiffened by an oversize front axle).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n{{clear}}\n===Bicycles===\n{{see also|Bicycle brake#Disc brakes}}\n[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|left|thumb|[[Mountain bike]] front disc brake]]\n[[File:Santa Cruz 2013 Tallboy Al 11.jpg|thumb|upright|Rear disc brake caliper and disc on a mountain bike]]\n[[Mountain bike]] disc brakes may range from simple, mechanical (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on [[Downhill mountain biking|downhill racing bikes]]. Improved technology has seen the creation of vented discs for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid [[Brake fade|heat fade]] on fast alpine descents. Although less common, discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking, although drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sutherland's Handbook for Bicycle Mechanics Chapter 11 - Brakes |first=Howard |last=Sutherland |page=13 |year=2004 |edition=7th |publisher=Sutherland's Bicycle Shop Aids |url= http://www.sutherlandsbicycle.com/Chapter11.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014223452/http://www.sutherlandsbicycle.com/Chapter11.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2013 |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> Discs are thin, often about 2&nbsp;mm. Some use a two-piece floating disc style, others use a floating caliper, others use pads that float in the caliper, and some use one moving pad that makes the caliper slide on its mounts, pulling the other pad into contact with the disc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Because energy efficiency is so important in bicycles, an uncommon feature of bicycle brakes is that the pads retract to eliminate residual drag when the brake is released.{{Clarify|date=May 2017|reason=Don't brake pads retract slightly for all types of disc brakes?}} In contrast, most other brakes drag the pads lightly when released so as to minimise initial operational travel.{{Clarify|date=May 2017|reason=Brake pads usually drag slightly in other applications?}}\n\n===Heavy vehicles===\nDisc brakes are increasingly used on very large and heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One reason is that the disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance.<ref name=\"ganaway\">{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Ganaway |url=http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2002tactical/ganaway.pdf |title=Air Disc Brake Production, Use & Performance |publisher=NDIA Tactical Wheeled Vehicles Conference, Monterey California |date=2002-01-28 |accessdate=2010-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604041202/http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2002tactical/ganaway.pdf |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles.

[[Passenger car (rail)|Passenger rail cars]] and [[light rail vehicle]]s often use disc brakes outboard of the wheels, which helps ensure a free flow of cooling air. Some modern passenger rail cars, such as the [[Amfleet|Amfleet II cars]], use inboard disc brakes. This reduces wear from debris, and provides protection from rain and snow, which would make the discs slippery and unreliable. However, there is still plenty of cooling for reliable operation. Some airplanes have the brake mounted with very little cooling, and the brake gets quite hot in a stop. This is acceptable as there is sufficient time for cooling, where the maximum braking energy is very predictable.\nShould the braking energy exceed the maximum, for example during an emergency occurring during take-off, aircraft wheels can be fitted with a [[fusible plug]]<ref>https://patents.google.com/patent/US4628953A/en</ref> to prevent the tyre bursting.

For normal car and light-truck applications, SAE specification J431 G3000 (superseded to G10) dictates the correct range of hardness, chemical composition, tensile strength, and other properties necessary for the intended use. Some racing cars and airplanes use brakes with carbon fiber discs and carbon fiber pads to reduce weight. Wear rates tend to be high, and braking may be poor or grabby until the brake is hot.\n\n===Racing===\n[[File:Ferrari F430 Challenge Brake.JPG|thumb|[[Reinforced carbon\u2013carbon|Reinforced carbon]] brake disc on a [[Ferrari F430]] [[Ferrari Challenge|Challenge]] race car]]\nIn racing and very-high-performance road cars, other disc materials have been employed. [[Reinforced carbon\u2013carbon|Reinforced carbon]] discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking systems such as those used on [[Concorde]] were introduced in [[Formula One]] by [[Brabham]] in conjunction with [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Alan |year=1985 |title=Brabham, the Grand Prix Cars |page=163 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=978-0-905138-36-7 }}</ref> Carbon\u2013carbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing [[unsprung weight]], giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid 1990s for example, but need to reach a very high [[operating temperature]] before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use. The extreme heat generated in these systems is visible during night racing, especially at shorter tracks. It is not uncommon to see the brake discs glowing red during use.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Ceramic composites===\n[[File:AMG Carbon Ceramic brake..JPG|thumb|Mercedes-Benz AMG carbon ceramic brake]]\n[[File:PCCB Wiki 9949.jpg|thumb|Porsche Carrera S composite ceramic brake]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[Ceramic]] discs are used in some high-performance cars and heavy vehicles.\n\nThe first development of the modern ceramic brake was made by British engineers for [[TGV]] applications in 1988. The objective was to reduce weight, the number of brakes per axle, as well as provide stable friction from high speeds and all temperatures. The result was a [[Ceramic composite|carbon-fibre-reinforced ceramic process]] which is now used in various forms for automotive, railway, and aircraft brake applications.\n\nDue to the high heat tolerance and mechanical strength of ceramic composite discs, they are often used on exotic vehicles where the cost is not prohibitive. They are also found in industrial applications where the ceramic disc's light weight and low-maintenance properties justify the cost. Composite brakes can withstand temperatures that would damage steel discs.\n\n[[Porsche]]'s Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) are siliconized carbon fiber, with high temperature capability, a 50% weight reduction over iron discs (hence reducing the vehicle's unsprung weight), a significant reduction in dust generation, substantially extended maintenance intervals, and enhanced durability in corrosive environments. Found on some of their more expensive models, it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense. They can be recognized by the bright yellow paintwork on the aluminum six-piston calipers. The discs are internally vented much like cast-iron ones, and cross-drilled.\n\n===Adjustment mechanism===\nIn automotive applications, the piston seal has a square cross section, also known as a square-cut seal.\n\nAs the piston moves in and out, the seal drags and stretches on the piston, causing the seal to twist. The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of a millimeter. The piston is allowed to move out freely, but the slight amount of drag caused by the seal stops the piston from fully retracting to its previous position when the brakes are released, and so takes up the slack caused by the wear of the brake pads, eliminating the need for return springs.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mike |last=Mavrigian |first2=Larry |last2=Carley |year=1998 |title=Brake Systems: OEM & Racing Brake Technology |page=81 |publisher=HP Books |isbn=9781557882813 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Fred |last=Puhn |year=1987 |title=Brake Handbook |page=31 |publisher=HP Trade |isbn=9780895862327 }}</ref>\n\nIn some rear disc calipers, the parking brake activates a mechanism inside the caliper that performs some of the same function.\n\n===Disc damage modes===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nDiscs are usually damaged in one of four ways: scarring, cracking, warping or excessive rusting. Service shops will sometimes respond to any disc problem by changing out the discs entirely, This is done mainly where the cost of a new disc may actually be lower than the cost of labour to resurface the old disc. Mechanically this is unnecessary unless the discs have reached manufacturer's minimum recommended thickness, which would make it unsafe to use them, or vane rusting is severe (ventilated discs only). Most leading vehicle manufacturers recommend brake disc skimming (US: turning) as a solution for lateral run-out, vibration issues and brake noises. The machining process is performed in a brake [[lathe]], which removes a very thin layer off the disc surface to clean off minor damage and restore uniform thickness. Machining the disc as necessary will maximise the mileage out of the current discs on the vehicle.\n\n===Run-out===\n[[Run-out]] is measured using a dial indicator on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc's face. It is typically measured about {{convert|1/2|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around {{convert|0.002|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=out}}. Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining the root cause of the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.\n\nDiscs can be machined to eliminate thickness variation and lateral run-out. Machining can be done in situ (on-car) or off-car (bench lathe). Both methods will eliminate thickness variation. Machining on-car with proper equipment can also eliminate lateral run-out due to hub-face non-perpendicularity.\n\nIncorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs. The disc's retaining bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is sandwiched in place by the wheel) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to fasten lug nuts can be bad practice, unless a torque wrench is used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force the bolts apply and tightening should be done with a [[torque wrench]].\n\nOften uneven pad transfer is confused for disc warping.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stoptech.com/technical-support/technical-white-papers/-warped-brake-disc-and-other-myths |first=Carroll |last=Smith |title=Warped- Brake Disc and Other Myths |publisher=Stoptech.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> The majority of brake discs diagnosed as \"warped\" are actually the result of uneven transfer of pad material. Uneven pad transfer can lead to thickness variation of the disc. When the thicker section of the disc passes between the pads, the pads will move apart and the brake pedal will raise slightly; this is pedal pulsation. The thickness variation can be felt by the driver when it is approximately {{convert|0.17|mm|in|4|abbr=on}} or greater (on automobile discs).\n\nThickness variation has many causes, but there are three primary mechanisms which contribute to the propagation of disc thickness variations. The first is improper selection of brake pads. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking for the first time in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break-in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break-in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc) every time the pads are changed. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is \"pad imprinting.\" This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken-in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.\n\nOnce the disc has some level of variation in thickness, uneven pad deposition can accelerate, sometimes resulting in changes to the crystal structure of the metal that composes the disc. As the brakes are applied, the pads slide over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more force is applied to the pads. The result is that the thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the brake disc heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in further uneven transfer of pad material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc's thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ({{convert|1200|-|1300|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}} <!-- {{convert|1200|-|1300|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off|disp=or}} -->), the metal can undergo a [[Phase transition|phase transformation]] and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as [[cementite]]. This [[iron carbide]] is very different from the cast iron the rest of the disc is composed of. It is extremely hard, brittle, and does not absorb heat well. After cementite is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the cementite within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and uneven heating characteristics of the disc to return.\n\n===Scarring===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nScarring (US: Scoring) can occur if brake pads are not changed promptly when they reach the end of their service life and are considered worn out. Once enough of the friction material has worn away, the pad's steel backing plate (for glued pads) or the pad retainer rivets (for riveted pads) will bear upon the disc's wear surface, reducing braking power and making scratches on the disc. Generally a moderately scarred / scored disc, which operated satisfactorily with existing brake pads, will be equally usable with new pads. If the scarring is deeper but not excessive, it can be repaired by machining off a layer of the disc's surface. This can only be done a limited number of times as the disc has a minimum rated safe thickness. The minimum thickness value is typically cast into the disc during manufacturing on the hub or the edge of the disc. In [[Pennsylvania]], which has one of the most rigorous auto safety inspection programs in North America, an automotive disc cannot pass safety inspection if any scoring is deeper than {{convert|.015|in|mm}}, and must be replaced if machining will reduce the disc below its minimum safe thickness.\n\nTo prevent scarring, it is prudent to periodically inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation is a logical time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel spring or drag tab as part of the pad assembly, which drags on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The produces a moderately loud squealing noise, alerting the driver that service is required. This will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32\".\n\n===Cracking===\nCracking is limited mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled near the edge of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of expansion in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the [[unsprung weight]] of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a [[heat sink]], but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.\nThese cracks occur due to the phenomenon of low cycle fatigue as a result of repeated hard braking.<ref name=\"2013_rashid_discbrakes\">{{cite journal|last1=Rashid|first1=Asim|last2=Str\u00f6mberg|date=2013|title=Sequential simulation of thermal stresses in disc brakes for repeated braking|url=http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A631333&dswid=3084|journal=[[Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part J|Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part J: Journal of Engineering Tribology]]|volume=227|issue=8|pages=919{{ndash}}929|doi=10.1177/1350650113481701|access-date=2019-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012231929/http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:631333/FULLTEXT01.pdf|archive-date=2019-10-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Rusting===\nThe discs are commonly made from cast iron and a certain amount of [[Rust|surface rust]] is normal. The disc contact area for the brake pads will be kept clean by regular use, but a vehicle that is stored for an extended period can develop significant rust in the contact area that may reduce braking power for a time until the rusted layer is worn off again. Rusting can also lead to disc warping when brakes are re-activated after storage because of differential heating between unrusted areas left covered by pads and rust around the majority of the disc area surface. Over time, vented brake discs may develop severe rust corrosion inside the ventilation slots, compromising the strength of the structure and needing replacement.<ref>{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hRmdC6hZ2q0C&pg=PA284 |title=Automotive Brakes |first=Jack |last=Erjavec |publisher=Cengage Learning |year= 2003 |isbn=9781401835262 }}</ref>\n\n==Calipers==\n[[File:Callipers Twin Pot.jpg|thumb|GM disc brake caliper (twin-piston, floating) removed from its mounting for changing pads]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe brake caliper is the assembly which houses the brake pads and pistons. The pistons are usually made of [[plastic]], [[aluminium]] or [[chrome plating|chrome-plated]] [[steel]].\n\nCalipers are of two types, floating or fixed. A fixed caliper does not move relative to the disc and is thus less tolerant of disc imperfections. It uses one or more pairs of opposing pistons to clamp from each side of the disc, and is more complex and expensive than a floating caliper.\n\nA floating caliper (also called a \"sliding caliper\") moves with respect to the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston on one side of the disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.\n\nAnother type of floating caliper is a swinging caliper.\nInstead of a pair of horizontal bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.\n\nVarious types of [[Bicycle brake#Caliper brakes|brake calipers]] are also used on [[Bicycle brake#Rim brakes|bicycle rim brakes]].\n\n===Pistons and cylinders===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe most common caliper design uses a single hydraulically actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use as many as twelve. Modern cars use different [[hydraulic]] circuits to actuate the brakes on each set of wheels as a [[car safety|safety measure]]. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a caliper is often referred to as the number of 'pots', so if a vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each caliper houses six pistons.\n\nBrake failure can result from failure of the piston to retract, which is usually a consequence of not operating the vehicle during prolonged storage outdoors in adverse conditions. On high-mileage vehicles, the piston [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]]s may leak, which must be promptly corrected.\n\n==Brake pads==\n{{main article|Brake pad}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nBrake pads are designed for high [[friction]] with brake pad material embedded in the disc in the process of bedding while wearing evenly. Friction can be divided into two parts. They are: adhesive and abrasive.\n\nDepending on the properties of the material of both the pad and the disc and the configuration and the usage, pad and disc wear rates will vary considerably. The properties that determine material wear involve trade-offs between performance and longevity.\n\nThe brake pads must usually be replaced regularly (depending on pad material, and drivestyle), and some are equipped with a mechanism that alerts drivers that replacement is needed, such as a thin piece of soft metal that rubs against the disc when the pads are too thin causing the brakes to squeal, a soft metal tab embedded in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a warning light when the brake pad gets thin, or an electronic [[sensor]].\n\nGenerally road-going vehicles have two brake pads per caliper, while up to six are installed on each racing caliper, with varying frictional properties in a staggered pattern for optimum performance.\n\nEarly brake pads (and [[Brake lining|linings]]) contained [[asbestos]], producing dust which should not be inhaled. Although newer pads can be made of ceramics, [[Kevlar]], and other plastics, inhalation of brake dust should still be avoided regardless of material.\n\n==Common problems==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Squeal===\nSometimes a loud noise or high pitched squeal occurs when the brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is produced by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as ''force-coupled excitation''). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding [[chamfer]] pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently of each other and thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application.<ref name=\"Hawk\">{{cite web|publisher=Hawk Performance |title=HP Plus - Autocross & Track Brake Compound }}</ref>\n\nCold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.\n\nSome lining wear indicators, located either as a semi-metallic layer within the brake pad material or with an external \"sensor\", are also designed to squeal when the lining is due for replacement. The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used. The wear sensor may only create squeal under braking when it first begins to indicate wear but is still a fundamentally different sound and pitch.<ref name=\"Hawk\"/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Centric Parts |title=FAQ's |date=2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Judder or shimmy===\nBrake judder is usually perceived by the driver as minor to severe vibrations transferred through the chassis during braking.<ref>Abdelahamid, M.K.

(1993), \"Brake roughness \u2013 disc brake torque variation\", disc distortion and vehicle response, SAE Technical Paper Series, no. 930803.</ref>\n\nThe judder phenomenon can be classified into two distinct subgroups: ''hot'' (or ''thermal''), or ''cold'' judder.\n\nHot judder is usually produced as a result of longer, more moderate braking from high speed where the vehicle does not come to a complete stop.<ref>Thoms, E. (1988), \"Disc brakes for heavy vehicles\", ''IMechE'', pp. 133\u2013137.</ref> It commonly occurs when a motorist decelerates from speeds of around {{convert|120|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|60|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, which results in severe vibrations being transmitted to the driver. These vibrations are the result of uneven thermal distributions, or ''hot spots''. Hot spots are classified as concentrated thermal regions that alternate between both sides of a disc that distort it in such a way that produces a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] waviness around its edges. Once the brake pads (friction material/brake lining) come in contact with the sinusoidal surface during braking, severe vibrations are induced, and can produce hazardous conditions for the person driving the vehicle.<ref>Anderson, E., et al. (1990), \"Hot spotting in automotive friction systems\", ''Wear'', v. 135, pp. 319\u2013337.</ref><ref>Barber, R., J. et al.

(1989), \"Friction\u2013induced noise and vibration of disc brakes\", ''Wear'', v. 133, pp. 39\u201345.</ref>\n\nCold judder, on the other hand, is the result of uneven disc wear patterns or disc thickness variation (DTV). These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: waviness and roughness of disc surface,<ref>J. Slavi\u010d, M.D. Bryant and M. Bolte\u017ear (2007), \"A new approach to roughness-induced vibrations on a slider.\", ''J. Sound and Vibration'', Vol. 306, Issues 3\u20135, 9 October 2007, pp. 732\u2013750.</ref> misalignment of axis (runout), elastic deflection, wear and friction material transfers.<ref name=Engel/><ref name=Rhee/><ref>Kim, M.-G. et al. (1996), \"Sensitivity analysis of chassis system to improve shimmy and brake judder vibration on the steering wheel\", SAE Technical Paper Series, no. 960734.</ref>\nEither type could potentially fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface on either side of the brake disc between the wheel hub and brake disc hub before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and brake disc. However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.\n\n===Dust===\n\nWhen braking force is applied, the act of abrasive friction between the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ebcbrakes.com/automotive_product_news/brakes_dust.shtml |title=Brake dust |publisher=EBC Brakes |date= |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off.<ref>\"Brake dust\". EBC Brakes. Retrieved 18 January 2014.</ref> Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake disc wear and brake pad wear.<ref>Hawk Performance. \"HP Plus - Autocross & Track Brake Compound.\" Hawk Performance.

Written and produced by lead singer and multi-instrumentalist [[Sly Stone]], ''Stand!'' is considered an artistic high-point of the band's career. Released by [[Epic Records]], just before the group's celebrated performance at the [[Woodstock]] festival, it became the band's most commercially successful album to date.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> It includes several well-known songs, among them [[hit single]]s, such as \"[[Sing a Simple Song]]\", \"[[I Want to Take You Higher]]\", \"[[Stand! (song)|Stand!]]\", and \"[[Everyday People (Sly & the Family Stone song)|Everyday People]]\". The album was reissued in 1990 on [[compact disc]] and vinyl, and again in 2007 as a [[remastered]] numbered edition [[digipack]] CD with bonus tracks and, in the UK, as only a [[CD]] with [[bonus tracks]].\n\nThe album sold 500,000 copies in 1969 and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on December 4 of that year. By 1986 it had sold well over 1&nbsp;million copies and was certified platinum in sales by the RIAA on November 26 of that same year.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS RIAA Searchable Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051113/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |date=2007-06-26 }}.

Although the Family Stone's single \"[[Dance to the Music (song)|Dance to the Music]]\" was a top ten hit in early 1968, none of the band's first three albums reached above 100 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Stand!'' reached number thirteen and launched Sly Stone and his bandmates [[Freddie Stone]], [[Larry Graham]], [[Rose Stone]], [[Cynthia Robinson]], [[Jerry Martini]], and [[Greg Errico]] into the pop music mainstream.\n\nMuch of the album was recorded in the [[San Francisco]] area at Pacific High Recording Studios. The band\u2019s [[A&R]] director and photographer [[Stephen Paley]] recalled how \"together\" Sly Stone was while working on ''Stand!'', constantly referring to [[Walter Piston]]'s ''Orchestration'' textbook,<ref name=\"StandRecording\">[[Joel Selvin|Selvin, Joel]] (1998), pp. 69\u201371</ref> unlike his erratic behavior and work after he became dependent upon [[cocaine]] within a year of the album's success.<ref name=\"SlyAddiction\">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 113\u2013115</ref>\n\n==Content==\n''Stand!'' begins with [[Stand! (song)|the title track]] on which Sly sings lead on \"Stand\", a mid-tempo number launching into a gospel break for its final forty-nine seconds.<ref name=\"StandRecording\" /> Most of the Family Stone was unavailable for the session at which this [[coda (music)|coda]] was recorded: Sly, drummer [[Gregg Errico]] and horn players [[Cynthia Robinson]] and [[Jerry Martini]] were augmented by session players instead. Errico recalls that many liked the gospel extension more than they did the song proper, and that; \"People would always ask, 'why didn't you go there and let that be the song?'\"<ref name=\"StandRecording\" /> The second track, titled \"Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey\", has few lyrics save for the chorus ''Don't call me \"[[nigger]]\", whitey/Don't call me \"whitey\", nigger'' and a single verse sung by Rose Stone. On \"[[I Want to Take You Higher]]\" Freddie Stone, Larry Graham, Rose Stone, and Sly Stone take turns delivering the lead vocal and all seven band-members deliver the shouted backing vocals. Sly Stone, Robinson, Freddie Stone, Graham, and Martini all play instrumental solos.\n\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Slyfam-stand-1969.ogg\n |title        = \"Stand!\"\n |description  = The title track and album opener features gospel overtones.\n |filename2    = \n |title2       = \"I Want to Take You Higher\"\n |description2 = The high tempo song is a pulsating dedication to music.\n |filename3    = \n |title3       = \"Everyday People\"\n |description3 = The group's first #1 Pop hit mocks the futility of hatred amongst people.\n}}\n\nOn \"Somebody's Watching You\" Sly Stone, Graham, Freddie Stone, and Rose Stone deliver the vocal in unison.

Written and produced by lead singer and multi-instrumentalist [[Sly Stone]], ''Stand!'' is considered an artistic high-point of the band's career. Released by [[Epic Records]], just before the group's celebrated performance at the [[Woodstock]] festival, it became the band's most commercially successful album to date.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> It includes several well-known songs, among them [[hit single]]s, such as \"[[Sing a Simple Song]]\", \"[[I Want to Take You Higher]]\", \"[[Stand! (song)|Stand!]]\", and \"[[Everyday People (Sly & the Family Stone song)|Everyday People]]\". The album was reissued in 1990 on [[compact disc]] and vinyl, and again in 2007 as a [[remastered]] numbered edition [[digipack]] CD with bonus tracks and, in the UK, as only a [[CD]] with [[bonus tracks]].\n\nThe album sold 500,000 copies in 1969 and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on December 4 of that year. By 1986 it had sold well over 1&nbsp;million copies and was certified platinum in sales by the RIAA on November 26 of that same year.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS RIAA Searchable Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051113/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |date=2007-06-26 }}.

Although the Family Stone's single \"[[Dance to the Music (song)|Dance to the Music]]\" was a top ten hit in early 1968, none of the band's first three albums reached above 100 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Stand!'' reached number thirteen and launched Sly Stone and his bandmates [[Freddie Stone]], [[Larry Graham]], [[Rose Stone]], [[Cynthia Robinson]], [[Jerry Martini]], and [[Greg Errico]] into the pop music mainstream.\n\nMuch of the album was recorded in the [[San Francisco]] area at Pacific High Recording Studios. The band\u2019s [[A&R]] director and photographer [[Stephen Paley]] recalled how \"together\" Sly Stone was while working on ''Stand!'', constantly referring to [[Walter Piston]]'s ''Orchestration'' textbook,<ref name=\"StandRecording\">[[Joel Selvin|Selvin, Joel]] (1998), pp. 69\u201371</ref> unlike his erratic behavior and work after he became dependent upon [[cocaine]] within a year of the album's success.<ref name=\"SlyAddiction\">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 113\u2013115</ref>\n\n==Content==\n''Stand!'' begins with [[Stand! (song)|the title track]] on which Sly sings lead on \"Stand\", a mid-tempo number launching into a gospel break for its final forty-nine seconds.<ref name=\"StandRecording\" /> Most of the Family Stone was unavailable for the session at which this [[coda (music)|coda]] was recorded: Sly, drummer [[Gregg Errico]] and horn players [[Cynthia Robinson]] and [[Jerry Martini]] were augmented by session players instead. Errico recalls that many liked the gospel extension more than they did the song proper, and that; \"People would always ask, 'why didn't you go there and let that be the song?'\"<ref name=\"StandRecording\" /> The second track, titled \"Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey\", has few lyrics save for the chorus ''Don't call me \"[[nigger]]\", whitey/Don't call me \"whitey\", nigger'' and a single verse sung by Rose Stone. On \"[[I Want to Take You Higher]]\" Freddie Stone, Larry Graham, Rose Stone, and Sly Stone take turns delivering the lead vocal and all seven band-members deliver the shouted backing vocals. Sly Stone, Robinson, Freddie Stone, Graham, and Martini all play instrumental solos.\n\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Slyfam-stand-1969.ogg\n |title        = \"Stand!\"\n |description  = The title track and album opener features gospel overtones.\n |filename2    = \n |title2       = \"I Want to Take You Higher\"\n |description2 = The high tempo song is a pulsating dedication to music.\n |filename3    = \n |title3       = \"Everyday People\"\n |description3 = The group's first #1 Pop hit mocks the futility of hatred amongst people.\n}}\n\nOn \"Somebody's Watching You\" Sly Stone, Graham, Freddie Stone, and Rose Stone deliver the vocal in unison.

'Sex Machine,' which precipitated James Brown's, wah-wahs on a bit, but everything else is etched in Stone, from the equally precipitous 'Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey' to the Chaka Khan fave 'Somebody's Watching You' to, yes you can, 'You Can Make It If You Try.'\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> Also appraising the reissue campaign, [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] wrote in ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' that ''Stand!'' was \"the group\u2019s true breakthrough\" as its \"seamless blend of rock, funk and soul, and the soaring mix of black and white voices, made [[crossover (music)|crossover]] seem like Utopia.\" Commenting on the music's historical context, Shapiro added:\n\n{{quote|At a time when the [[civil rights movement|civil rights coalition]] was breaking apart, when [[flower power]] was mutating into [[Black Power movement|armed struggle]], the Family Stone clung desperately to the belief that 'You Can Make it If You Try' and had the gall to deliver the decade's most powerful message of unity as a singsong nursery rhyme. Of course, maybe 'Everyday People' was believable as a nursery rhyme because, on songs like 'Don\u2019t Call Me Nigger, Whitey' and 'Somebody\u2019s Watching You', Sly watches [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the '60s dream]] disintegrate before his eyes.<ref name=\"Uncut\"/>}}\n\n[[Rapper]] [[Ice-T]], [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], and [[Jane's Addiction]] performed \"Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey\" during the 1991 [[Lollapalooza]] tour and in the 1993 [[Perry Farrell]] film ''[[Gift (1993 film)|Gift]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://disinfo.com/2013/06/perry-farrells-gift/ |title=Perry Farrell's film Gift |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |date=25 June 2013 |website=Disinformation |publisher=Disinformation.com |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written, produced and arranged by [[Sly Stone]] for Stone Flower Productions.\n\nSide one\n#\"[[Stand!

He was the brother of [[Abdullah al-Aftah ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq|Abdullah al-Aftah]].\n\nIsma'ili sources say that, after the age of seven, as his father's designated successor, Isma'il was kept apart from his siblings, limited in his contact with the public, with his father taking personal responsibility for his education. Given his father's reputation as a scholar and the number of distinguished students who sought out his tuition, Isma'il would have received excellent training. It is said that whenever Ja'far was ill and unable to fulfill his duties as Imam, he deputized Isma'il, although his role was restricted to the confines of the home.\n\nAccording to Daftary, Isma'il may have taken part in an anti-Abbasid plot in 755 and identified with the more activist, or militant Shi'a (some of whom split off as the Zaydis). He may have been summoned to the Caliph's court with others to face charges but was spared execution, unlike some of his fellow plotters.{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=there were attached citation numbers without refs}}\n\nTo protect him from persecution, his father sent him into hiding and publicly declared him deceased. The majority Twelver groups argue that Isma'il actually died during his father's Imamate in the year 138 AH/756 AD.\n\nIn about 762, Isma'il may have left Medina for Basra, although this is disputed. He is said to have had a full grasp of the esoteric truth, the inner message of Islam. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad, as the 8th Isma'ili Imam, who was about 22 at the time. Some Isma'ilis believe that Muhammad bin Isma'il became \"hidden\" and will return as the Mahdi, to establish universal peace and justice.\n\nAccording to Daftary, Isma'il may have led a revolt against the Abbasids in 815, \"and died shortly afterwards\" in [[Medina]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=attached citation number without ref}} He probably lived in \"southwestern Persia ... from where he dispatched his own Dais to adjoining areas\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=attached citation number without ref}}\n\n==Burial place==\nAccording to some Isma'ili sources,  Isma'il ibn Ja'far is buried in [[Salamiyah]], a city located in [[Syria]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://ismailignosis.com/2014/10/02/who-succeeded-imam-jafar-al-sadiq-seven-proofs-for-the-imamat-of-imam-ismail-ibn-jafar/|title=Who Succeeded Imam Jafar al-Sadiq?

Ivanow, Ismaili ''Tradition Concerning the Rise of the Fatimids'', 1941, p. 275-278</ref> They refused to acknowledge his death, and some even claimed to have seen him after his funeral. However, most Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs later accepted Isma'il ibn Ja\u2019far\u2019s death, and instead followed his son Muhammad ibn Isma'il as the next Imam, since the Imamate could still be continued through Isma'il ibn Ja\u2019far\u2019s lineage. On a theological level, Ismai'lis refuse to acknowledge Imams outside of the lineage of Ismail ibn Ja\u2019far due to the notion of ''na\u1e63\u1e63'' (designation) and ''\u2018i\u0219ma'' (infallibility). Because Shi\u2019as believe that the Imams are infallible and contain special knowledge of the Divine decree, it is inconceivable that Imam Ja'far al-S\u0101diq would have incorrectly chosen Imam Isma'il ibn Ja\u2019far as his successor and then retract his original ''na\u1e63\u1e63''. This would mean that Imam Ja'far al-S\u0101diq either made a major mistake which would make him fallible, or later claims regarding other designations were forged narrations. \n\nIthna-'Asharis, following the early death of Isma'il ibn Ja\u2019far acknowledged the designation of Imam Ja'far al-S\u0101diq\u2019s younger son, M\u016bs\u0101 al-K\u0101\u1e93im, from his slave-wife, \u1e24am\u012bda al-Barbariyya. Various hadith reports from the Twelver Shi\u2019i collection contain narrations about the designation of Imam M\u016bs\u0101 al-K\u0101\u1e93im, along with his exceptional character and wisdom from an early age.<ref>{{cite web |title=Imam Musa b.

''Kitab al-Irshad''. Translated by Seyyid Hossein Nasr, p. 408</ref> While the early followers (later Twelvers) of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq believed that Isma'il ibn Ja'far might have been the Imam due to his beloved status by his father, some argue that he was neither explicitly designated, nor meant to be, due to his early death.  Another mainstream view also purports a \u201cchange\u201d or \u201cabrogation\u201d in the Divine Decree, known as ''bad\u0101\u2019'', in which God may abrogate a previous decree for something better.<ref>Ayoub, Mahmoud.

His mother, Fatima bint al-Hussain'l-Athram bin al-[[Hasan bin Ali]], was the first wife of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. He was the brother of [[Abdullah al-Aftah ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq|Abdullah al-Aftah]].\n\nIsma'ili sources say that, after the age of seven, as his father's designated successor, Isma'il was kept apart from his siblings, limited in his contact with the public, with his father taking personal responsibility for his education. Given his father's reputation as a scholar and the number of distinguished students who sought out his tuition, Isma'il would have received excellent training. It is said that whenever Ja'far was ill and unable to fulfill his duties as Imam, he deputized Isma'il, although his role was restricted to the confines of the home.\n\nAccording to Daftary, Isma'il may have taken part in an anti-Abbasid plot in 755 and identified with the more activist, or militant Shi'a (some of whom split off as the Zaydis). He may have been summoned to the Caliph's court with others to face charges but was spared execution, unlike some of his fellow plotters.{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=there were attached citation numbers without refs}}\n\nTo protect him from persecution, his father sent him into hiding and publicly declared him deceased. The majority Twelver groups argue that Isma'il actually died during his father's Imamate in the year 138 AH/756 AD.\n\nIn about 762, Isma'il may have left Medina for Basra, although this is disputed. He is said to have had a full grasp of the esoteric truth, the inner message of Islam. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad, as the 8th Isma'ili Imam, who was about 22 at the time. Some Isma'ilis believe that Muhammad bin Isma'il became \"hidden\" and will return as the Mahdi, to establish universal peace and justice.\n\nAccording to Daftary, Isma'il may have led a revolt against the Abbasids in 815, \"and died shortly afterwards\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=attached citation number without ref}} He probably lived in \"southwestern Persia ... from where he dispatched his own Dais to adjoining areas\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=attached citation number without ref}}\n\n==Burial place==\nAccording to some Isma'ili sources,  Isma'il ibn Ja'far is buried in [[Salamiyah]], a city located in [[Syria]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://ismailignosis.com/2014/10/02/who-succeeded-imam-jafar-al-sadiq-seven-proofs-for-the-imamat-of-imam-ismail-ibn-jafar/|title=Who Succeeded Imam Jafar al-Sadiq?

Ivanow, Ismaili ''Tradition Concerning the Rise of the Fatimids'', 1941, p. 275-278</ref> They refused to acknowledge his death, and some even claimed to have seen him after his funeral. However, most Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs later accepted Isma'il ibn Ja\u2019far\u2019s death, and instead followed his son Muhammad ibn Isma'il as the next Imam, since the Imamate could still be continued through Isma'il ibn Ja\u2019far\u2019s lineage. On a theological level, Ismai'lis refuse to acknowledge Imams outside of the lineage of Ismail ibn Ja\u2019far due to the notion of ''na\u1e63\u1e63'' (designation) and ''\u2018i\u0219ma'' (infallibility). Because Shi\u2019as believe that the Imams are infallible and contain special knowledge of the Divine decree, it is inconceivable that Imam Ja'far al-S\u0101diq would have incorrectly chosen Imam Isma'il ibn Ja\u2019far as his successor and then retract his original ''na\u1e63\u1e63''. This would mean that Imam Ja'far al-S\u0101diq either made a major mistake which would make him fallible, or later claims regarding other designations were forged narrations. \n\nIthna-'Asharis, following the early death of Isma'il ibn Ja\u2019far acknowledged the designation of Imam Ja'far al-S\u0101diq\u2019s younger son, M\u016bs\u0101 al-K\u0101\u1e93im, from his slave-wife, \u1e24am\u012bda al-Barbariyya. Various hadith reports from the Twelver Shi\u2019i collection contain narrations about the designation of Imam M\u016bs\u0101 al-K\u0101\u1e93im, along with his exceptional character and wisdom from an early age.<ref>{{cite web |title=Imam Musa b.

''Kitab al-Irshad''. Translated by Seyyid Hossein Nasr, p. 408</ref> While the early followers (later Twelvers) of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq believed that Isma'il ibn Ja'far might have been the Imam due to his beloved status by his father, some argue that he was neither explicitly designated, nor meant to be, due to his early death.  Another mainstream view also purports a \u201cchange\u201d or \u201cabrogation\u201d in the Divine Decree, known as ''bad\u0101\u2019'', in which God may abrogate a previous decree for something better.<ref>Ayoub, Mahmoud.
