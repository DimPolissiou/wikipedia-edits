{"title_page": "Ancient Greek religion", "text_new": "{{pp-semi|small=yes}}\n{{short description|religion in ancient Greece}}\n[[File:Oracle of Delphi, red-figure kylix, 440-430 BC, Kodros Painter, Berlin F 2538, 141668.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Aegeus]] at right consults the [[Pythia]] or [[oracle]] of [[Delphi]]. Vase 440\u2013430 BC.  He was told \"Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief\", which at first he did not understand.]]\n{{Ancient Greek religion}}\n\n'''Ancient Greek religion''' encompasses the collection of beliefs, rituals, and [[Greek mythology|mythology]] originating in [[ancient Greece]] in the form of both popular public religion and [[Cult (religious practice)|cult practices]]. These groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or \"cults\" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities.\n\nMost ancient Greeks recognized the [[Twelve Olympians|twelve major Olympian gods and goddesses]]\u2014[[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]], [[Athena]], [[Ares]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]], and either [[Hestia]] or [[Dionysus]]\u2014although philosophies such as [[Stoicism]] and some forms of [[Platonism]] used language that seems to assume a single [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent deity]].  The worship of these deities, and several others, was found across the Greek world, though they often have different [[epithet]]s that distinguished aspects of the deity, and often reflect the absorption of other local deities into the pan-Hellenic scheme.\n\nThe religious practices of the Greeks extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of [[Ionia]] in [[Asia Minor]], to [[Magna Graecia]] (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as [[Marseille|Massalia]] (Marseille).  Early Italian religions such as the [[Etruscan religion]] were influenced by Greek religion and subsequently influenced much of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]].\n\n==Beliefs==\n[[File:7323 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - Artemis - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The (first) [[Piraeus Artemis]], probably the [[cult image]] from a temple, 4th century BC]]\nWhile there were few concepts universal to all the Greek peoples, some common beliefs were shared by many.\n\n===Theology===\n{{Further|List of Greek mythological figures}}\nAncient Greek [[theology]] was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], based on the assumption that there were many gods and goddesses, as well as a range of lesser supernatural beings of various types. There was a hierarchy of deities, with [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, having a level of control over all the others, although he was not almighty. Some deities had dominion over certain aspects of [[nature]]. For instance, Zeus was the sky-god, sending thunder and lightning, [[Poseidon]] ruled over the [[sea]] and [[earthquakes]], [[Hades]] projected his remarkable power throughout the realms of death and the [[Greek Underworld|Underworld]], and [[Helios]] controlled the [[sun]]. Other deities ruled over abstract concepts; for instance [[Aphrodite]] controlled [[love]].  All significant deities were visualized as \"human\" in form, although often able to transform themselves into animals or natural phenomena.<ref>Burkert (1985), 2:1:4</ref>\n\nWhile being immortal, the gods were certainly not [[Omnibenevolence|all-good]] or even [[omnipotence|all-powerful]]. They had to obey [[destiny|fate]], known to Greek mythology as the [[Moirai]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Greek Religion|last=Burkert|first=Walter|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=129|quote=|via=}}</ref> which overrode any of their divine powers or wills. For instance, in mythology, it was [[Odysseus]]' fate to return home to [[Ithaca]] after the [[Trojan War]], and the gods could only lengthen his journey and make it harder for him, but they could not stop him.\n[[File:Aphrodite swan BM D2.jpg|thumb|Aphrodite riding a swan: Attic white-ground red-figured ''[[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'', c. 460, found at Kameiros (Rhodes)]]\n\nThe gods acted like humans and had human [[vice]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Homeric Gods: The Spiritual Significance of Greek Religion|last=Otto|first=W.F.|publisher=Pantheon|year=1954|isbn=|location=New York|pages=131|quote=|via=|title-link=The Homeric Gods}}</ref> They would interact with humans, sometimes even spawning children with them. At times certain gods would be opposed to others, and they would try to outdo each other. In the ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Aphrodite]], [[Ares]] and [[Apollo]] support the Trojan side in the Trojan War, while [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and Poseidon support the Greeks (see [[theomachy]]).\n\nSome gods were specifically associated with a certain city. Athena was associated with the city of [[Athens]], Apollo with [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], Zeus with [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and Aphrodite with [[Corinth]]. But other gods were also worshipped in these cities. Other deities were associated with nations outside of Greece; Poseidon was associated with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Troy]], and Ares with [[Thrace]].\n\nIdentity of names was not a guarantee of a similar [[cult]]us; the Greeks themselves were well aware that the Artemis worshipped at [[Sparta]], the virgin huntress, was a very different deity from the Artemis who was a many-breasted [[fertility rite|fertility goddess]] at [[Ephesus]]. Though the worship of the major deities spread from one locality to another, and though most larger cities boasted temples to several major gods, the identification of different gods with different places remained strong to the end.\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e du Louvre Darafsh (201).jpg|thumb|[[Asclepios]], god of medicine. Marble Roman copy (2nd century AD) of a Greek original of the early 4th century BC. Asclepios was not one of the Twelve Olympians, but popular with doctors like [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and their patients.]]\n\nOur ancient sources for Greek religion tell us a good deal about cult but very little about creed, in no small measure because the Greeks in general considered what one believed to be much less importance than what one did.<ref>Rosivach, Vincent J. (1994).''The System of Public Sacrifice in Fourth Century (B.C.E.) Athens'' Atlanta, Georgia: Scholars Press.\n p. 1.</ref>\n\n===Afterlife===\n{{further|Greek Underworld}}\nThe Greeks believed in an [[underworld]] where the spirits of the dead went after death. One of the most widespread areas of this underworld was ruled over by Hades, a brother of Zeus, and was known as [[Hades]] (originally called 'the place of Hades'). Other well known realms are [[Tartarus]], a place of torment for the damned, and [[Elysium]], a place of pleasures for the virtuous. In the early Mycenean religion all the dead went to Hades, but the rise of mystery cults in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic age]] led to the development of places such as Tartarus and Elysium.\n\nA few Greeks, like [[Achilles]], [[Alcmene]], [[Amphiaraus]] [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Melicertes]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great number of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, were considered to have been physically immortalized and brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean, or beneath the ground. Such beliefs are found in the most ancient of Greek sources, such as [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. This belief remained strong even into the Christian era. For most people at the moment of death there was, however, no hope of anything but continued existence as a disembodied soul.<ref>[[Erwin Rohde]] ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks''. New York: Harper & Row 1925 [1921]</ref>\n\nSome Greeks, such as the philosophers [[Pythagoras]] and [[Plato]], also embraced the idea of [[reincarnation]], though this was only accepted by a few. [[Epicurus]] taught that the soul was simply atoms which were dissolved at death, so one ceased to exist on dying.\n\n===Mythology===\n{{further|Greek mythology}}\n\n[[File:Rubens - Judgement of Paris.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[The Judgement of Paris (Rubens)|''The Judgment of Paris'' by Peter Paul Rubens]] (c. 1636), depicting the goddesses [[Hera]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Athena]], in a competition that causes the [[Trojan War]]. This Baroque painting shows the continuing fascination with Greek mythology]]\n\nGreek religion had an extensive [[mythology]]. It consisted largely of stories of the gods and how they interacted with humans. Myths often revolved around heroes and their actions, such as [[Heracles]] and his [[Twelve Labors|twelve labors]], [[Odysseus]] and his voyage home, [[Jason]] and the quest for the [[Golden Fleece]] and [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]].\n\nMany species existed in Greek mythology. Chief among these were the gods and humans, though the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] (who predated the Olympian gods) also frequently appeared in Greek myths. Lesser species included the half-man-half-horse [[centaur]]s, the nature based [[nymph]]s (tree nymphs were [[dryad]]s, sea nymphs were [[Nereid]]s) and the half man, half goat [[satyr]]s. Some creatures in Greek mythology were monstrous, such as the one-eyed giant [[Cyclopes]], the sea beast [[Scylla]], whirlpool [[Charybdis]], Gorgons, and the half-man, half-bull [[Minotaur]].\n\nThere was not a set Greek [[cosmogony]], or creation myth. Different religious groups believed that the world had been created in different ways. One Greek creation myth was told in Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]''. It stated that at first there was only a primordial deity called [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], who gave birth to various other primordial gods, such as Gaia, Tartarus and Eros, who then gave birth to more gods, the Titans, who then gave birth to the first Olympians.\n\nThe mythology largely survived and was added to in order to form the later [[Roman mythology]]. The Greeks and Romans had been literate societies, and much mythology, although initially shared orally, was written down in the forms of [[epic poetry]] (such as the ''Iliad'', the ''Odyssey'' and the ''[[Argonautica]]'') and plays (such as [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Frogs]]''). The mythology became popular in Christian post-[[Renaissance]] Europe, where it was often used as a basis for the works of artists like [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Rubens]].\n[[File:Atuell en forma d'Afrodita en una petxina, \u00c0tica, necr\u00f2polis de Fanagoria, pin\u00ednsula de Taman. Primer quart del segle IV aC, cer\u00e0mica.JPG|thumb|Pottery vessel in the shape of [[Aphrodite]] inside a shell; from [[Attica]], [[Classical Greece]], discovered in the [[Phanagoria]] cemetery, [[Taman Peninsula]] ([[Bosporan Kingdom]], [[southern Russia]]), 1st quarter of the 4th century BC, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]].]]\n\n===Morality===\nOne of the most important moral concepts to the Greeks was the fear of committing [[hubris]]. Hubris constituted many things, from rape to desecration of a corpse,<ref>Omitowoju {which book?}, p. 36; Cartledge, Millet & Todd, ''Nomos: Essays in Athenian Law, Politics and Society'', 1990, Cambridge UP, p 126</ref> and was a crime in the city-state of Athens. Although pride and vanity were not considered sins themselves, the Greeks emphasized moderation. Pride only became hubris when it went to extremes, like any other vice. The same was thought of eating and drinking. Anything done to excess was not considered proper. Ancient Greeks placed, for example, importance on athletics and intellect equally. In fact many of their competitions included both. Pride was not evil until it became all-consuming or hurtful to others.\n\n===Sacred texts===\nThe Greeks had no [[religious text]]s they regarded as \"revealed\" scriptures of sacred origin, but very old texts including [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', and the [[Homeric hymns]] (regarded as later productions today), Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' and ''[[Works and Days]]'', and [[Pindar]]'s [[Ode]]s were regarded as having authority<ref>Burkert (1985), Introduction:2; [https://books.google.com/books?id=uvtebmqZZDYC&pg=PA634 Religions of the ancient world: a guide]</ref> and perhaps being inspired; they   usually begin with an invocation to the [[Muse]]s for inspiration.  [[Plato]] even wanted to exclude the myths from his ideal state described in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' because of their low moral tone.\n\nWhile some traditions, such as Mystery cults, did uphold certain texts as canonic within their own cult praxis, such texts were respected but not necessarily accepted as canonic outside their circle. In this field, of particular importance are certain texts referring to [[Orphic cults]]: multiple copies, ranging from 450 [[Before Christ|BC]] to 250 [[AD]], have been found in various locations of the Greek world. Even the words of the oracles never turned into a sacred text. Other texts were specially composed for religious events, and some have survived within the lyric tradition; although they had a cult function, they were bound to performance and never developed into a common, standard prayer form comparable to the Christian [[Pater Noster]]. An exception to this rule were the already named Orphic and Mystery rituals, which, in this, set themselves aside from the rest of the Greek religious system. Finally, some texts called ''hieroi logoi'' ({{lang-el|\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03af \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9}}) (sacred texts) by the ancient sources, originated from outside the Greek world, or were supposedly adopted in remote times, representing yet more different traditions within the Greek belief system.\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Tempio di Atena o tempio di Cerere.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Athena (Paestum)|Temple of Athena, Paestum]]]]\n\n===Ceremonies===\nThe lack of a unified priestly class meant that a unified, [[Canon of Scripture|canonic]] form of the religious texts or practices never existed; just as there was no unified, common sacred text for the Greek belief system, there was no standardization of practices. Instead, religious practices were organized on local levels, with priests normally being [[magistrates]] for the city or village, or gaining authority from one of the many sanctuaries. Some priestly functions, like the care for a particular local festival, could be given by tradition to a certain family.  To a large extent, in the absence of \"scriptural\" sacred texts, religious practices derived their authority from tradition, and \"every omission or deviation arouses deep anxiety and calls forth sanctions\".<ref name=\"Burkert 1985, Introduction:3\">Burkert (1985), Introduction:3</ref>\n\n[[Ceremonies of ancient Greece|Greek ceremonies]] and rituals were mainly performed at [[altar]]s. These were typically devoted to one or a few gods, and supported a statue of the particular deity. [[Votive deposit]]s would be left at the altar, such as food, drinks, as well as precious objects. Sometimes [[animal sacrifice]]s would be performed here, with most of the flesh taken for eating, and the [[offal]] burnt as an offering to the gods. [[Libations]], often of wine, would be offered to the gods as well, not only at shrines, but also in everyday life, such as during a [[symposium]].\n\nOne ceremony was [[pharmakos]], a ritual involving expelling a symbolic [[scapegoat]] such as a slave or an animal, from a city or village in a time of hardship. It was hoped that by casting out the ritual scapegoat, the hardship would go with it.\n\n===Sacrifice===\n[[File:Sacrifice to Athena, Amphora from Vulci, 550-540 BC, Berlin F 1686, 141662.jpg|thumb|left|A bull is led to the altar of [[Athena]], whose image is at right.  Vase, c. 545 BC.]]\nWorship in Greece typically consisted of [[animal sacrifice|sacrificing domestic animals]] at the altar with hymn and prayer. The altar was outside any temple building, and might not be associated with a temple at all. The animal, which should be perfect of its kind, was decorated with [[garland]]s and the like, and led in procession to the altar; a girl with a basket on her head containing the concealed knife led the way. After various rituals, the animal was slaughtered over the altar. As it fell, all of the women present \"[cried] out in high, shrill tones\". Its blood was collected and poured over the altar. It was butchered on the spot and various internal organs, bones and other inedible parts burnt as the deity's portion of the offering, while the meat was removed to be prepared for the participants to eat; the leading figures tasted it on the spot. The temple usually kept the skin to sell to tanners. That the humans got more use from the sacrifice than the deity had not escaped the Greeks, and was often the subject of humour in [[Greek comedy]].<ref>Walter Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' (1985), 2:1:1, 2:1:2.  For more exotic local forms of sacrifice, see the [[Laphria (festival)]], [[Xanthika]], and [[Lykaia]].  The advantageous division of the animal was supposed to go back to [[Prometheus]]'s trick on [[Zeus]]</ref>\n\nThe animals used were, in order of preference, bulls or oxen, cows, sheep (the most common sacrifice), goats, pigs (with piglets being the cheapest mammal), and poultry (but rarely other birds or fish).<ref>Walter Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' (1985): 2:1:1; to some extent different animals were thought appropriate for different deities, from bulls for Zeus and Poseidon to doves for Aphrodite, Burkert (1985): 2:1:4</ref>  Horses and asses are seen on some [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Geometric style|vases in the Geometric style]] (900\u2013750 BC), but are very rarely mentioned in literature; they were relatively late introductions to Greece, and it has been suggested that Greek preferences in this matter were established earlier.  The Greeks liked to believe that the animal was glad to be sacrificed, and interpreted various behaviours as showing this.  [[Divination]] by [[haruspex|examining parts of the sacrificed animal]] was much less important than in [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman]] or [[Etruscan religion]], or [[Near Eastern religions]], but [[Greek divination|was practiced]], especially of the liver, and as part of the [[cult of Apollo]].  Generally, the Greeks put more faith in [[Ornithomancy|observing the behaviour of birds]].<ref>Struck, P.T. (2014). \"Animals and Divination\", In Campbell, G.L. (Ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life'', 2014, Oxford University Press.

More formal ones might be made onto altars at temples, and other fluids such as [[olive oil]] and honey might be used.  Although the grand form of sacrifice called the [[hecatomb]] (meaning 100 bulls) might in practice only involve a dozen or so, at large festivals the number of cattle sacrificed could run into the hundreds, and the numbers feasting on them well into the thousands.\n[[File:Greekreligion-animalsacrifice-corinth-6C-BCE.jpg|thumb|Sacrifice of a lamb on [[Pitsa panels|a Pitsa Panel]], [[Corinth]], 540\u2013530 BC]]\n\nThe evidence of the existence of such practices is clear in some ancient Greek literature, especially in [[Homer]]'s epics. Throughout the poems, the use of the ritual is apparent at banquets where meat is served, in times of danger or before some important endeavor to gain the favor of the gods. For example, in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' [[Eumaeus]] sacrifices a pig with prayer for his unrecognizable master Odysseus. However, in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', which partly reflects very early Greek civilization, not every banquet of the princes begins with a sacrifice.<ref>Sarah Hitch, ''King of Sacrifice: Ritual and Royal Authority in the Iliad'', [https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6164.1-defining-homeric-sacrifice online at] Harvard University's Center for Hellenic Studies</ref>\n\nThese sacrificial practices share much with recorded forms of sacrificial rituals known from later. Furthermore, throughout the poem, special banquets are held whenever gods indicated their presence by some sign or success in war. Before setting out for Troy, this type of animal sacrifice is offered. Odysseus offers Zeus a sacrificial ram in vain. The occasions of sacrifice in Homer's epic poems may shed some light onto the view of the gods as members of society, rather than as external entities, indicating social ties. Sacrificial rituals played a major role in forming the relationship between humans and the divine.<ref>Meuli, ''Griechische Opferbr\u00e4uche'', 1946</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the [[Chthonic]] deities, distinguished from Olympic deities by typically being offered the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] mode of sacrifice, where the offering is wholly burnt, may be remnants of the native [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Hellenic]] religion and that many of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] deities may come from the Proto-Greeks who overran the southern part of the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] in the late third millennium BC.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Chadwick|first1=John|title=The Mycenaean World|date=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-29037-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad/page/85 85]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad/page/85}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\nVarious religious festivals were held in ancient Greece. Many were specific only to a particular deity or city-state. For example, the festival of [[Lykaia]] was celebrated in [[Arcadia]] in Greece, which was dedicated to the pastoral god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].  Like the other [[Panhellenic Games]], the [[ancient Olympic Games]] were a religious festival, held at the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].  Other festivals centred on [[Greek theatre]], of which the [[Dionysia]] in Athens was the most important.  More typical festivals featured a procession, large sacrifices and a feast to eat the offerings, and many included entertainments and customs such as visiting friends, wearing fancy dress and unusual behaviour in the streets, sometimes risky for bystanders in various ways.  Altogether the [[Attic calendar|year in Athens]] included some 140 days that were religious festivals of some sort, though varying greatly in importance.\n\n===Rites of passage===\nOne [[rite of passage]] was the [[amphidromia]], celebrated on the fifth or seventh day after the birth of a child. Childbirth was extremely significant to Athenians, especially if the baby was a boy.\n\n==Sanctuaries and temples==\n[[File:Athena Parthenos LeQuire.jpg|thumb|right|Reproduction of the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' cult image at the original size in the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon in Nashville]], Tennessee.]]\n{{main|Ancient Greek temple}}\nThe main [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temple]] building sat within a larger precinct or [[temenos]], usually surrounded by a [[peribolos]] fence or wall; the whole is usually called a \"sanctuary\". The [[Acropolis of Athens]] is the most famous example, though this was apparently walled as a citadel before a temple was ever built there.  The tenemos might include many subsidiary buildings, [[sacred grove]]s or springs, animals dedicated to the deity, and sometimes people who had taken sanctuary from the law, which some temples offered, for example to runaway slaves.<ref>Miles,  219-220</ref>\n\nThe earliest Greek sanctuaries probably lacked temple buildings, though our knowledge of these is limited, and the subject is controversial.  A typical early sanctuary seems to have consisted of a tenemos, often around a sacred grove, cave or spring, and perhaps defined only by marker stones at intervals, with an altar for offerings.  Many rural sanctuaries probably stayed in this style, but the more popular were gradually able to afford a building to house a cult image, especially in cities.  This process was certainly under way by the 9th century, and probably started earlier.<ref>Theories are discussed in chapter 1 of ''Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches'', Eds. Robin Hagg and Nanno Marinatos, 2002, Routledge, {{ISBN|113480167X}}, 9781134801671, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WvSHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT11#v=onepage&q&f=false google books]</ref>\n\nThe temple interiors did not serve as meeting places, since the [[ritual sacrifice|sacrifice]]s and rituals dedicated to the respective deity took place outside them, at altars within the wider precinct of the sanctuary, which might be large.  As the centuries past both the inside of popular temples and the area surrounding them accumulated statues and small shrines or other buildings as gifts, and military trophies, paintings and items in precious metals, effectively turning them into a type of museum.\n\nSome sanctuaries offered [[oracle]]s, people who were believed to receive divine inspiration in answering questions put by pilgrims.  The most famous of these by far was the female priestess called the [[Pythia]] at the Temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]], and that of Zeus at [[Dodona]], but there were many others.  Some dealt only with medical, agricultural or other specialized matters, and not all represented gods, like that of the hero [[Trophonius]] at [[Livadeia]].\n\n===Cult images===\n[[File:Delphi chryselephantine.jpg|thumb|left|Gold and fire-blackened ivory fragments of a burnt Archaic [[chryselephantine statue]] - [[Delphi Archaeological Museum]]]]\nThe temple was the house of the deity it was dedicated to, who in some sense resided in the [[cult image]] in the ''[[cella]]'' or main room inside, normally facing the only door. The cult image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size. In early days these were in wood, marble or [[terracotta]], or in the specially prestigious form of a [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine statue]] using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework.  The most famous Greek cult images were of this type, including the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]], and [[Phidias]]'s [[Athena Parthenos]] in the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, both colossal statues, now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine statues from [[Delphi]] have been excavated. Bronze cult images were less frequent, at least until Hellenistic times.<ref>Miles, 213</ref> Early images seem often to have been dressed in real clothes, and at all periods images might wear real jewellery donated by devotees.\n\nThe [[acrolith]] was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body.  A [[xoanon]] was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu [[lingam]]; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity, even when a new statue was the main cult image.  Xoana had the advantage that they were easy to carry in processions at festivals.  The [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Trojan Palladium]], famous from the myths of the [[Epic Cycle]] and supposedly ending up in Rome, was one of these.\n\nMany of the Greek statues well known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the [[Apollo Barberini]], can be credibly identified.  A very few actual originals survive, for example, the bronze [[Piraeus Athena]] ({{convert|2.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, including a helmet).  The image stood on a base, from the 5th century often carved with reliefs.\n\nIt used to be thought that access to the ''cella'' of a Greek temple was limited to the priests, and it was entered only rarely by other visitors, except perhaps during important festivals or other special occasions. In recent decades this picture has changed, and scholars now stress the variety of local access rules. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was a gentlemanly traveller of the 2nd-century AD who declares that the special intention of his travels around Greece was to see cult images, and usually managed to do so.<ref>Miles, 212-213, 220</ref>\n\nIt was typically necessary to make a sacrifice or gift, and some temples restricted access either to certain days of the year, or by class, race, gender (with either men or women forbidden), or even more tightly. Garlic-eaters were forbidden in one temple, in another women unless they were virgins; restrictions typically arose from local ideas of ritual purity or a perceived whim of the deity. In some places visitors were asked to show they spoke Greek; elsewhere [[Dorians]] were not allowed entry. Some temples could only be viewed from the threshold. Some temples are said never to be opened at all. But generally Greeks, including slaves, had a reasonable expectation of being allowed into the ''cella''. Once inside the ''cella'' it was possible to pray to or before the cult image, and sometimes to touch it; Cicero saw a bronze image of Heracles with its foot largely worn away by the touch of devotees.<ref>Stevenson, 48-50; Miles, 212-213, 220</ref> Famous cult images such as the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]] functioned as significant visitor attractions.<ref>Stevenson, 68-69</ref>\n\n== Role of women ==\n[[File:Woman altar MAR Palermo NI2129.jpg|thumb|left|Woman pouring a [[libation]] on an altar]]\nThe role of women in sacrifices in discussed above. In addition, the only public roles that [[Greek women]] could perform were [[priest]]esses:<ref>{{cite document |last1=Simon |first1=Stephen J. |title=The Functions of Priestesses in Greek Society |id={{ProQuest|1296355183}} }}</ref> either ''[[hiereiai]]'', meaning \"sacred women\" or ''amphipolis'', a term for lesser attendants.  As a priestess, they gained social recognition and access to more luxuries than other Greek women that worked or typically stayed in the home.  Women who voluntarily chose to become priestesses received an increase in social and legal status to the public, and after death, they received a public burial site.  Greek priestesses had to be healthy and of a sound mind, the reasoning being that the ones serving the gods had to be as high-quality as their offerings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dillon |first1=Matthew |title=Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290875541 |website=Researchgate}}</ref> This was also true for male Greek priests.\n\nIt is contested whether there were gendered divisions when it came to serving a particular god or goddess, who was devoted to what god, gods and/or goddesses could have both priests and priestesses to serve them. Gender specifics did come into play when it came to who would perform certain acts of sacrifice or worship were determined by the significance of the male or female role to that particular god or goddess, a priest would lead the priestess or the reverse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holderman |first1=Elisabeth |title=A Study of the Greek Priestess |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006946365&view=1up&seq=27 |website=HathiTrust}}</ref> In some Greek cults priestesses served both gods and goddesses, such examples as the [[Pythia]], or female [[Oracle of Apollo]] at [[Delphi]], and that at [[Didyma]] were priestesses, but both were overseen by male priests. The festival of Dionosyus was practiced by both and the god was served by women and female priestesses, they were known as the [[Gerarai]] or the venerable ones.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dillon |first1=Matthew |title=Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290875541|website=Researchgate}}</ref>\n\nThere were segregated religious festivals in Ancient Greece; the [[Thesmophoria]], Plerosia, Kalamaia, and [[Skira]] were festivals that were only for women. The Thesmophoria festival and many others represented agricultural fertility, which was considered to be closely connected to women by the ancient Greeks. It gave women a religious identity and purpose in Greek religion, in which the role of women in worshipping goddesses [[Demeter]] and her daughter [[Persephone]] reinforced traditional lifestyles. The festivals relating to agricultural fertility were valued by the [[polis]] because this is what they traditionally worked for, women-centered festivals that involved private matters were less important. In [[Athens]] the festivals honouring Demeter were included in the calendar and promoted by Athens, they constructed temples and shrines like the Thesmophorion, where women could perform their rites and worship.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dillon |first1=Matthew |title=Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290875541|website=Researchgate}}</ref>\n\n==Mystery religions==\nThose who were not satisfied by the public cult of the gods could turn to various [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]] which operated as [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]s into which members had to be initiated in order to learn their secrets.\n\nHere, they could find religious consolations that traditional religion could not provide: a chance at mystical awakening, a systematic religious doctrine, a map to the [[afterlife]], a communal worship, and a band of spiritual fellowship.\n\nSome of these mysteries, like the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|mysteries of Eleusis]] and [[Samothrace]], were ancient and local. Others were spread from place to place, like the mysteries of [[Dionysus]]. During the [[Hellenistic]] period and the [[Roman Empire]], exotic mystery religions became widespread, not only in Greece, but all across the empire. Some of these were new creations, such as [[Mithras]], while others had been practiced for hundreds of years before, like the Egyptian mysteries of [[Osiris]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Piraeus Apollo]], c. 525 BC]]\n\n===Origins===\nMainstream Greek religion appears to have developed out of [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and although very little is known about the earliest periods there are suggestive hints that some local elements go back even further than the [[Bronze Age]] or [[Helladic chronology|Helladic period]] to the farmers of [[Neolithic Greece]].  There was also clearly [[cultural evolution]] from the Late Helladic [[Mycenaean religion]] of the [[Mycenaean civilization]]. Both the literary settings of some important myths and many important sanctuaries relate to locations that were important Helladic centres that had become otherwise unimportant by Greek times.<ref>Burkert (1985): 1:1, 1:2</ref>\n\nThe Mycenaeans perhaps treated Poseidon, to them a god of earthquakes as well as the sea, as their chief deity, and forms of his name along with several other Olympians are recognisable in records in [[Linear B]], although Apollo and Aphrodite are absent.  Only about half of the Mycenaean pantheon seem to survive the [[Greek Dark Ages]] though.  The archaeological evidence for continuity in religion is far clearer for Crete and [[Cyprus]] than the Greek mainland.<ref name=\"Burkert 1985: 1:3:6\">Burkert (1985): 1:3:6</ref>\n\nGreek religious concepts may also have absorbed the beliefs and practices of earlier, nearby cultures, such as [[Minoan religion]],<ref>Burkert (1985): 1:3:1</ref> and other influences came from the Near East, especially via Cyprus.<ref name=\"Burkert 1985: 1:3:6\"/>  [[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, traced many Greek religious practices to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].\n\nThe [[Great Goddess hypothesis]], that a Stone Age religion dominated by a female Great Goddess was displaced by a male-dominated Indo-European hierarchy, has been proposed for Greece as for Minoan [[Crete]] and other regions, but has not been in favour with specialists for some decades, though the question remains too poorly-evidenced for a clear conclusion; at the least the evidence from [[Minoan art]] shows more goddesses than gods.<ref>Burkert (1985): 1:3:5</ref>  The [[Twelve Olympians]], with Zeus as [[sky father]], certainly have a strong Indo-European flavour;<ref>Burkert (1985): 1:2</ref> by the epic works of Homer all are well-established, except for [[Dionysus]].  However, several of the [[Homeric hymns]], probably composed slightly later, are dedicated to him.\n\n===Archaic and classical periods===\n[[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece]] saw the development of [[List of ancient Greek cities|flourishing cities]] and of stone-built temples to the gods, which were rather consistent in design across the Greek world.  Religion was closely tied to civic life, and priests were mostly drawn from the local elite.  Religious works led the development of [[Greek sculpture]], though apparently not the now-vanished Greek painting.  While much religious practice was, as well as personal, aimed at developing solidarity within the ''[[polis]]'', a number of important sanctuaries developed a \"Panhellenic\" status, drawing visitors from all over the Greek world. These served as an essential component in the growth and self-consciousness of Greek nationalism.<ref name=Burckhardt>{{harvnb|Burckhardt|1999|loc=p. 168: \"The establishment of these Panhellenic sites, which yet remained exclusively Hellenic, was a very important element in the growth and self-consciousness of Hellenic nationalism; it was uniquely decisive in breaking down enmity between tribes, and remained the most powerful obstacle to fragmentation into mutually hostile ''poleis''.\"}}</ref> \n \nThe mainstream religion of the Greeks did not go unchallenged within Greece. As [[Greek philosophy]] developed its ideas about [[ethics]], the Olympians were bound to be found wanting.  Several notable philosophers criticised a belief in the gods. The earliest of these was [[Xenophanes]], who chastised the human vices of the gods as well as their anthropomorphic depiction. [[Plato]] wrote that there was one supreme god, whom he called the \"[[Form of the Good]]\", and which he believed was the emanation of perfection in the universe. Plato's disciple, [[Aristotle]], also disagreed that polytheistic deities existed, because he could not find enough empirical evidence for it. He believed in a [[Primum movens|Prime Mover]], which had set creation going, but was not connected to or interested in the universe.\n\n===Hellenistic period===\n[[File:Egyptian - Pendant with Image of Sarapis - Walters 571524 - Front View B (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pendant with [[Serapis]], Egypt, 2nd century BC]]  \n{{main|Hellenistic religion}}\nIn the [[Hellenistic period]] between the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC and the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] (146 BC) Greek religion developed in various ways, including expanding over at least some of Alexander's conquests.  The new dynasties of [[diadochi]], kings and tyrants often spent lavishly on temples, often following Alexander in trying to insinuate themselves into religious cult; this was much easier for the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt, where the traditional [[ancient Egyptian religion]] had long had deified monarchs.  The enormous raised [[Pergamon Altar]] (now in Berlin) and the [[Altar of Hieron]] in [[Sicily]] are examples of unprecedentedly large constructions of the period.\n\nNew cults of imported deities such as [[Isis#In the Greco-Roman world|Isis from Egypt]], [[Atargatis]] from Syria, and [[Cybele]] from Anatolia became increasingly important, as well as [[Hellenistic philosophy|several philosophical movements]] such as [[Platonism]], [[stoicism]], and [[Epicureanism]]; both tended to detract from the traditional religion, although many Greeks were able to hold beliefs from more than one of these groups.  [[Serapis]] was essentially a Hellenistic creation, if not devised then spread in Egypt for political reasons by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] as a hybrid of Greek and local styles of deity.  Various philosophical movements, including the [[Orphics]] and [[Pythagoreans]], began to question the ethics of animal sacrifice, and whether the gods really appreciated it; from the surviving texts [[Empedocles]] and [[Theophrastus]] (both vegetarians) were notable critics.<ref>Burkert (1972), 6-8</ref> [[Hellenistic astrology]] developed late in the period, as another distraction from the traditional practices.  Although the traditional myths, festivals and beliefs all continued, these trends probably reduced the grip on the imagination of the traditional pantheon, especially among the educated, but probably more widely in the general population.\n\n===Roman Empire===\nWhen the [[Roman Republic]] conquered Greece in 146 BC, it took much of Greek religion (along with many other aspects of [[Greek culture]] such as literary and architectural styles) and incorporated it into its own. The Greek gods were equated with the ancient Roman deities; Zeus with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Hera with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], Poseidon with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], Aphrodite with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], Ares with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], Artemis with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], Athena with [[Minerva]], Hermes with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], Hephaestus with [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], Hestia with [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], Demeter with [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], Hades with [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], Tyche with [[Fortuna]], and Pan with [[Faunus]]. Some of the gods, such as Apollo and [[Bacchus]], had earlier been adopted by the Romans. There were also many deities that existed in the Roman religion before its interaction with Greece that were not associated with a Greek deity, including [[Janus]] and [[Quirinus]].\n\nThe Romans generally did not spend much on new temples in Greece, other that those for [[Imperial cult of ancient Rome|their Imperial cult]], which were placed in all important cities.  Exceptions include [[Antoninus Pius]] (r. 138-161 AD), whose commissions include the [[Baalbec]] [[Temple of Bacchus]], arguably the most impressive survival from the imperial period (though the Temple of Jupiter-[[Baal]] next to it was larger).  It could be said the Greek world was by this time well furnished with sanctuaries. Roman governors and emperors often pilfered famous statues from sanctuaries, sometimes leaving contemporary reproductions in their place. [[Verres]], governor of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]] from 73 to 70 BC, was an early example who, unusually, was prosecuted after his departure.\n\nAfter the huge Roman conquests beyond Greece, new cults from Egypt and Asia became popular in Greece as well as the western empire.\n\n===Decline and suppression===\n{{Main|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism}}\nThe initial [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] was due in part to its syncretic nature, assimilating beliefs and practices from a variety of foreign religious traditions as the Roman Empire expanded. Graeco-Roman philosophical schools incorporated elements of [[Judaism]] and [[Early Christianity]], and mystery religions like Christianity and [[Mithraism]] also became increasingly popular. [[Constantine I]] became the first Roman Emperor to convert to Christianity, and the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD enacted official tolerance for Christianity within the Empire. Still, in Greece and elsewhere, there is evidence that pagan and Christian communities remained essentially segregated from each other, with little cultural influence flowing between the two. Urban pagans continued to utilize the civic centers and temple complexes, while Christians set up their own, new places of worship in suburban areas of cities. Contrary to some older scholarship, newly converted Christians did not simply continue worshiping in converted temples; rather, new Christian communities were formed as older pagan communities declined and were eventually suppressed and disbanded.<ref name=survival_greece>Gregory, T.

During the period of time (14th - 17th centuries) when the literature and philosophy of the ancient Greeks gained widespread appreciation in Europe, this new popularity did not extend to ancient Greek religion, especially the original theist forms, and most new examinations of Greek philosophy were written within a solidly Christian context.<ref name=\"openuni\">Open University, ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/religion.htm Looking at the Renaissance: Religious Context in the Renaissance]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)</ref>\n\n[[Hellenism (religion)#Early revivals|Early revivalists]], with varying degrees of commitment, were the Englishmen [[John Fransham]] (1730 \u2013 1810), interested in [[Neoplatonism]], and [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1758 \u2013 1835), who produced the first English translations of many Neoplatonic philosophical and religious texts.\n\nMore recently, a revival has begun with the contemporary [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], as it is often called (a term first used by the last pagan Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]). In Greece, the term used is Hellene ethnic religion (Greek:  \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0398\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1). Modern Hellenism reflects [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] speculation (which is represented in [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Libanius]], [[Proclus]], and [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]), as well as classical cult practice. However, there are many fewer followers than [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]].

These groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or \"cults\" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities.\n\nMost ancient Greeks recognized the [[Twelve Olympians|twelve major Olympian gods and goddesses]]\u2014[[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]], [[Athena]], [[Ares]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]], and either [[Hestia]] or [[Dionysus]]\u2014although philosophies such as [[Stoicism]] and some forms of [[Platonism]] used language that seems to assume a single [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent deity]].  The worship of these deities, and several others, was found across the Greek world, though they often have different [[epithet]]s that distinguished aspects of the deity, and often reflect the absorption of other local deities into the pan-Hellenic scheme.\n\nThe religious practices of the Greeks extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of [[Ionia]] in [[Asia Minor]], to [[Magna Graecia]] (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as [[Marseille|Massalia]] (Marseille).  Early Italian religions such as the [[Etruscan religion]] were influenced by Greek religion and subsequently influenced much of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]].\n\n==Beliefs==\n[[File:7323 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - Artemis - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The (first) [[Piraeus Artemis]], probably the [[cult image]] from a temple, 4th century BC]]\nWhile there were few concepts universal to all the Greek peoples, some common beliefs were shared by many.\n\n===Theology===\n{{Further|List of Greek mythological figures}}\nAncient Greek [[theology]] was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], based on the assumption that there were many gods and goddesses, as well as a range of lesser supernatural beings of various types. There was a hierarchy of deities, with [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, having a level of control over all the others, although he was not almighty. Some deities had dominion over certain aspects of [[nature]]. For instance, Zeus was the sky-god, sending thunder and lightning, [[Poseidon]] ruled over the [[sea]] and [[earthquakes]], [[Hades]] projected his remarkable power throughout the realms of death and the [[Greek Underworld|Underworld]], and [[Helios]] controlled the [[sun]]. Other deities ruled over abstract concepts; for instance [[Aphrodite]] controlled [[love]].  All significant deities were visualized as \"human\" in form, although often able to transform themselves into animals or natural phenomena.<ref>Burkert (1985), 2:1:4</ref>\n\nWhile being immortal, the gods were certainly not [[Omnibenevolence|all-good]] or even [[omnipotence|all-powerful]]. They had to obey [[destiny|fate]], known to Greek mythology as the [[Moirai]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Greek Religion|last=Burkert|first=Walter|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=129|quote=|via=}}</ref> which overrode any of their divine powers or wills. For instance, in mythology, it was [[Odysseus]]' fate to return home to [[Ithaca]] after the [[Trojan War]], and the gods could only lengthen his journey and make it harder for him, but they could not stop him.\n[[File:Aphrodite swan BM D2.jpg|thumb|Aphrodite riding a swan: Attic white-ground red-figured ''[[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'', c. 460, found at Kameiros (Rhodes)]]\n\nThe gods acted like humans and had human [[vice]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Homeric Gods: The Spiritual Significance of Greek Religion|last=Otto|first=W.F.|publisher=Pantheon|year=1954|isbn=|location=New York|pages=131|quote=|via=|title-link=The Homeric Gods}}</ref> They would interact with humans, sometimes even spawning children with them. At times certain gods would be opposed to others, and they would try to outdo each other. In the ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Aphrodite]], [[Ares]] and [[Apollo]] support the Trojan side in the Trojan War, while [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and Poseidon support the Greeks (see [[theomachy]]).\n\nSome gods were specifically associated with a certain city. Athena was associated with the city of [[Athens]], Apollo with [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], Zeus with [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and Aphrodite with [[Corinth]]. But other gods were also worshipped in these cities. Other deities were associated with nations outside of Greece; Poseidon was associated with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Troy]], and Ares with [[Thrace]].\n\nIdentity of names was not a guarantee of a similar [[cult]]us; the Greeks themselves were well aware that the Artemis worshipped at [[Sparta]], the virgin huntress, was a very different deity from the Artemis who was a many-breasted [[fertility rite|fertility goddess]] at [[Ephesus]]. Though the worship of the major deities spread from one locality to another, and though most larger cities boasted temples to several major gods, the identification of different gods with different places remained strong to the end.\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e du Louvre Darafsh (201).jpg|thumb|[[Asclepios]], god of medicine. Marble Roman copy (2nd century AD) of a Greek original of the early 4th century BC. Asclepios was not one of the Twelve Olympians, but popular with doctors like [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and their patients.]]\n\nOur ancient sources for Greek religion tell us a good deal about cult but very little about creed, in no small measure because the Greeks in general considered what one believed to be much less importance than what one did.<ref>Rosivach, Vincent J. (1994).''The System of Public Sacrifice in Fourth Century (B.C.E.) Athens'' Atlanta, Georgia: Scholars Press.\n p. 1.</ref>\n\n===Afterlife===\n{{further|Greek Underworld}}\nThe Greeks believed in an [[underworld]] where the spirits of the dead went after death. One of the most widespread areas of this underworld was ruled over by Hades, a brother of Zeus, and was known as [[Hades]] (originally called 'the place of Hades'). Other well known realms are [[Tartarus]], a place of torment for the damned, and [[Elysium]], a place of pleasures for the virtuous. In the early Mycenean religion all the dead went to Hades, but the rise of mystery cults in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic age]] led to the development of places such as Tartarus and Elysium.\n\nA few Greeks, like [[Achilles]], [[Alcmene]], [[Amphiaraus]] [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Melicertes]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great number of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, were considered to have been physically immortalized and brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean, or beneath the ground. Such beliefs are found in the most ancient of Greek sources, such as [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. This belief remained strong even into the Christian era. For most people at the moment of death there was, however, no hope of anything but continued existence as a disembodied soul.<ref>[[Erwin Rohde]] ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks''. New York: Harper & Row 1925 [1921]</ref>\n\nSome Greeks, such as the philosophers [[Pythagoras]] and [[Plato]], also embraced the idea of [[reincarnation]], though this was only accepted by a few. [[Epicurus]] taught that the soul was simply atoms which were dissolved at death, so one ceased to exist on dying.\n\n===Mythology===\n{{further|Greek mythology}}\n\n[[File:Rubens - Judgement of Paris.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[The Judgement of Paris (Rubens)|''The Judgment of Paris'' by Peter Paul Rubens]] (c. 1636), depicting the goddesses [[Hera]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Athena]], in a competition that causes the [[Trojan War]]. This Baroque painting shows the continuing fascination with Greek mythology]]\n\nGreek religion had an extensive [[mythology]]. It consisted largely of stories of the gods and how they interacted with humans. Myths often revolved around heroes and their actions, such as [[Heracles]] and his [[Twelve Labors|twelve labors]], [[Odysseus]] and his voyage home, [[Jason]] and the quest for the [[Golden Fleece]] and [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]].\n\nMany species existed in Greek mythology. Chief among these were the gods and humans, though the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] (who predated the Olympian gods) also frequently appeared in Greek myths. Lesser species included the half-man-half-horse [[centaur]]s, the nature based [[nymph]]s (tree nymphs were [[dryad]]s, sea nymphs were [[Nereid]]s) and the half man, half goat [[satyr]]s. Some creatures in Greek mythology were monstrous, such as the one-eyed giant [[Cyclopes]], the sea beast [[Scylla]], whirlpool [[Charybdis]], Gorgons, and the half-man, half-bull [[Minotaur]].\n\nThere was not a set Greek [[cosmogony]], or creation myth. Different religious groups believed that the world had been created in different ways. One Greek creation myth was told in Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]''. It stated that at first there was only a primordial deity called [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], who gave birth to various other primordial gods, such as Gaia, Tartarus and Eros, who then gave birth to more gods, the Titans, who then gave birth to the first Olympians.\n\nThe mythology largely survived and was added to in order to form the later [[Roman mythology]]. The Greeks and Romans had been literate societies, and much mythology, although initially shared orally, was written down in the forms of [[epic poetry]] (such as the ''Iliad'', the ''Odyssey'' and the ''[[Argonautica]]'') and plays (such as [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Frogs]]''). The mythology became popular in Christian post-[[Renaissance]] Europe, where it was often used as a basis for the works of artists like [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Rubens]].\n[[File:Atuell en forma d'Afrodita en una petxina, \u00c0tica, necr\u00f2polis de Fanagoria, pin\u00ednsula de Taman. Primer quart del segle IV aC, cer\u00e0mica.JPG|thumb|Pottery vessel in the shape of [[Aphrodite]] inside a shell; from [[Attica]], [[Classical Greece]], discovered in the [[Phanagoria]] cemetery, [[Taman Peninsula]] ([[Bosporan Kingdom]], [[southern Russia]]), 1st quarter of the 4th century BC, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]].]]\n\n===Morality===\nOne of the most important moral concepts to the Greeks was the fear of committing [[hubris]]. Hubris constituted many things, from rape to desecration of a corpse,<ref>Omitowoju {which book?}, p. 36; Cartledge, Millet & Todd, ''Nomos: Essays in Athenian Law, Politics and Society'', 1990, Cambridge UP, p 126</ref> and was a crime in the city-state of Athens. Although pride and vanity were not considered sins themselves, the Greeks emphasized moderation. Pride only became hubris when it went to extremes, like any other vice. The same was thought of eating and drinking. Anything done to excess was not considered proper. Ancient Greeks placed, for example, importance on athletics and intellect equally. In fact many of their competitions included both. Pride was not evil until it became all-consuming or hurtful to others.\n\n===Sacred texts===\nThe Greeks had no [[religious text]]s they regarded as \"revealed\" scriptures of sacred origin, but very old texts including [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', and the [[Homeric hymns]] (regarded as later productions today), Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' and ''[[Works and Days]]'', and [[Pindar]]'s [[Ode]]s were regarded as having authority<ref>Burkert (1985), Introduction:2; [https://books.google.com/books?id=uvtebmqZZDYC&pg=PA634 Religions of the ancient world: a guide]</ref> and perhaps being inspired; they   usually begin with an invocation to the [[Muse]]s for inspiration.  [[Plato]] even wanted to exclude the myths from his ideal state described in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' because of their low moral tone.\n\nWhile some traditions, such as Mystery cults, did uphold certain texts as canonic within their own cult praxis, such texts were respected but not necessarily accepted as canonic outside their circle. In this field, of particular importance are certain texts referring to [[Orphic cults]]: multiple copies, ranging from 450 [[Before Christ|BC]] to 250 [[AD]], have been found in various locations of the Greek world. Even the words of the oracles never turned into a sacred text. Other texts were specially composed for religious events, and some have survived within the lyric tradition; although they had a cult function, they were bound to performance and never developed into a common, standard prayer form comparable to the Christian [[Pater Noster]]. An exception to this rule were the already named Orphic and Mystery rituals, which, in this, set themselves aside from the rest of the Greek religious system. Finally, some texts called ''hieroi logoi'' ({{lang-el|\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03af \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9}}) (sacred texts) by the ancient sources, originated from outside the Greek world, or were supposedly adopted in remote times, representing yet more different traditions within the Greek belief system.\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Tempio di Atena o tempio di Cerere.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Athena (Paestum)|Temple of Athena, Paestum]]]]\n\n===Ceremonies===\nThe lack of a unified priestly class meant that a unified, [[Canon of Scripture|canonic]] form of the religious texts or practices never existed; just as there was no unified, common sacred text for the Greek belief system, there was no standardization of practices. Instead, religious practices were organized on local levels, with priests normally being [[magistrates]] for the city or village, or gaining authority from one of the many sanctuaries. Some priestly functions, like the care for a particular local festival, could be given by tradition to a certain family.  To a large extent, in the absence of \"scriptural\" sacred texts, religious practices derived their authority from tradition, and \"every omission or deviation arouses deep anxiety and calls forth sanctions\".<ref name=\"Burkert 1985, Introduction:3\">Burkert (1985), Introduction:3</ref>\n\n[[Ceremonies of ancient Greece|Greek ceremonies]] and rituals were mainly performed at [[altar]]s. These were typically devoted to one or a few gods, and supported a statue of the particular deity. [[Votive deposit]]s would be left at the altar, such as food, drinks, as well as precious objects. Sometimes [[animal sacrifice]]s would be performed here, with most of the flesh taken for eating, and the [[offal]] burnt as an offering to the gods. [[Libations]], often of wine, would be offered to the gods as well, not only at shrines, but also in everyday life, such as during a [[symposium]].\n\nOne ceremony was [[pharmakos]], a ritual involving expelling a symbolic [[scapegoat]] such as a slave or an animal, from a city or village in a time of hardship. It was hoped that by casting out the ritual scapegoat, the hardship would go with it.\n\n===Sacrifice===\n[[File:Sacrifice to Athena, Amphora from Vulci, 550-540 BC, Berlin F 1686, 141662.jpg|thumb|left|A bull is led to the altar of [[Athena]], whose image is at right.  Vase, c. 545 BC.]]\nWorship in Greece typically consisted of [[animal sacrifice|sacrificing domestic animals]] at the altar with hymn and prayer. The altar was outside any temple building, and might not be associated with a temple at all. The animal, which should be perfect of its kind, was decorated with [[garland]]s and the like, and led in procession to the altar; a girl with a basket on her head containing the concealed knife led the way. After various rituals, the animal was slaughtered over the altar. As it fell, all of the women present \"[cried] out in high, shrill tones\". Its blood was collected and poured over the altar. It was butchered on the spot and various internal organs, bones and other inedible parts burnt as the deity's portion of the offering, while the meat was removed to be prepared for the participants to eat; the leading figures tasted it on the spot. The temple usually kept the skin to sell to tanners. That the humans got more use from the sacrifice than the deity had not escaped the Greeks, and was often the subject of humour in [[Greek comedy]].<ref>Walter Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' (1985), 2:1:1, 2:1:2.  For more exotic local forms of sacrifice, see the [[Laphria (festival)]], [[Xanthika]], and [[Lykaia]].  The advantageous division of the animal was supposed to go back to [[Prometheus]]'s trick on [[Zeus]]</ref>\n\nThe animals used were, in order of preference, bulls or oxen, cows, sheep (the most common sacrifice), goats, pigs (with piglets being the cheapest mammal), and poultry (but rarely other birds or fish).<ref>Walter Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' (1985): 2:1:1; to some extent different animals were thought appropriate for different deities, from bulls for Zeus and Poseidon to doves for Aphrodite, Burkert (1985): 2:1:4</ref>  Horses and asses are seen on some [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Geometric style|vases in the Geometric style]] (900\u2013750 BC), but are very rarely mentioned in literature; they were relatively late introductions to Greece, and it has been suggested that Greek preferences in this matter were established earlier.  The Greeks liked to believe that the animal was glad to be sacrificed, and interpreted various behaviours as showing this.  [[Divination]] by [[haruspex|examining parts of the sacrificed animal]] was much less important than in [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman]] or [[Etruscan religion]], or [[Near Eastern religions]], but [[Greek divination|was practiced]], especially of the liver, and as part of the [[cult of Apollo]].  Generally, the Greeks put more faith in [[Ornithomancy|observing the behaviour of birds]].<ref>Struck, P.T. (2014). \"Animals and Divination\", In Campbell, G.L. (Ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life'', 2014, Oxford University Press.

More formal ones might be made onto altars at temples, and other fluids such as [[olive oil]] and honey might be used.  Although the grand form of sacrifice called the [[hecatomb]] (meaning 100 bulls) might in practice only involve a dozen or so, at large festivals the number of cattle sacrificed could run into the hundreds, and the numbers feasting on them well into the thousands.\n[[File:Greekreligion-animalsacrifice-corinth-6C-BCE.jpg|thumb|Sacrifice of a lamb on [[Pitsa panels|a Pitsa Panel]], [[Corinth]], 540\u2013530 BC]]\n\nThe evidence of the existence of such practices is clear in some ancient Greek literature, especially in [[Homer]]'s epics. Throughout the poems, the use of the ritual is apparent at banquets where meat is served, in times of danger or before some important endeavor to gain the favor of the gods. For example, in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' [[Eumaeus]] sacrifices a pig with prayer for his unrecognizable master Odysseus. However, in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', which partly reflects very early Greek civilization, not every banquet of the princes begins with a sacrifice.<ref>Sarah Hitch, ''King of Sacrifice: Ritual and Royal Authority in the Iliad'', [https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6164.1-defining-homeric-sacrifice online at] Harvard University's Center for Hellenic Studies</ref>\n\nThese sacrificial practices share much with recorded forms of sacrificial rituals known from later. Furthermore, throughout the poem, special banquets are held whenever gods indicated their presence by some sign or success in war. Before setting out for Troy, this type of animal sacrifice is offered. Odysseus offers Zeus a sacrificial ram in vain. The occasions of sacrifice in Homer's epic poems may shed some light onto the view of the gods as members of society, rather than as external entities, indicating social ties. Sacrificial rituals played a major role in forming the relationship between humans and the divine.<ref>Meuli, ''Griechische Opferbr\u00e4uche'', 1946</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the [[Chthonic]] deities, distinguished from Olympic deities by typically being offered the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] mode of sacrifice, where the offering is wholly burnt, may be remnants of the native [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Hellenic]] religion and that many of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] deities may come from the Proto-Greeks who overran the southern part of the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] in the late third millennium BC.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Chadwick|first1=John|title=The Mycenaean World|date=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-29037-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad/page/85 85]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad/page/85}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\nVarious religious festivals were held in ancient Greece. Many were specific only to a particular deity or city-state. For example, the festival of [[Lykaia]] was celebrated in [[Arcadia]] in Greece, which was dedicated to the pastoral god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].  Like the other [[Panhellenic Games]], the [[ancient Olympic Games]] were a religious festival, held at the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].  Other festivals centred on [[Greek theatre]], of which the [[Dionysia]] in Athens was the most important.  More typical festivals featured a procession, large sacrifices and a feast to eat the offerings, and many included entertainments and customs such as visiting friends, wearing fancy dress and unusual behaviour in the streets, sometimes risky for bystanders in various ways.  Altogether the [[Attic calendar|year in Athens]] included some 140 days that were religious festivals of some sort, though varying greatly in importance.\n\n===Rites of passage===\nOne [[rite of passage]] was the [[amphidromia]], celebrated on the fifth or seventh day after the birth of a child. Childbirth was extremely significant to Athenians, especially if the baby was a boy.\n\n==Sanctuaries and temples==\n[[File:Athena Parthenos LeQuire.jpg|thumb|right|Reproduction of the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' cult image at the original size in the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon in Nashville]], Tennessee.]]\n{{main|Ancient Greek temple}}\nThe main [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temple]] building sat within a larger precinct or [[temenos]], usually surrounded by a [[peribolos]] fence or wall; the whole is usually called a \"sanctuary\". The [[Acropolis of Athens]] is the most famous example, though this was apparently walled as a citadel before a temple was ever built there.  The tenemos might include many subsidiary buildings, [[sacred grove]]s or springs, animals dedicated to the deity, and sometimes people who had taken sanctuary from the law, which some temples offered, for example to runaway slaves.<ref>Miles,  219-220</ref>\n\nThe earliest Greek sanctuaries probably lacked temple buildings, though our knowledge of these is limited, and the subject is controversial.  A typical early sanctuary seems to have consisted of a tenemos, often around a sacred grove, cave or spring, and perhaps defined only by marker stones at intervals, with an altar for offerings.  Many rural sanctuaries probably stayed in this style, but the more popular were gradually able to afford a building to house a cult image, especially in cities.  This process was certainly under way by the 9th century, and probably started earlier.<ref>Theories are discussed in chapter 1 of ''Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches'', Eds. Robin Hagg and Nanno Marinatos, 2002, Routledge, {{ISBN|113480167X}}, 9781134801671, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WvSHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT11#v=onepage&q&f=false google books]</ref>\n\nThe temple interiors did not serve as meeting places, since the [[ritual sacrifice|sacrifice]]s and rituals dedicated to the respective deity took place outside them, at altars within the wider precinct of the sanctuary, which might be large.  As the centuries past both the inside of popular temples and the area surrounding them accumulated statues and small shrines or other buildings as gifts, and military trophies, paintings and items in precious metals, effectively turning them into a type of museum.\n\nSome sanctuaries offered [[oracle]]s, people who were believed to receive divine inspiration in answering questions put by pilgrims.  The most famous of these by far was the female priestess called the [[Pythia]] at the Temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]], and that of Zeus at [[Dodona]], but there were many others.  Some dealt only with medical, agricultural or other specialized matters, and not all represented gods, like that of the hero [[Trophonius]] at [[Livadeia]].\n\n===Cult images===\n[[File:Delphi chryselephantine.jpg|thumb|left|Gold and fire-blackened ivory fragments of a burnt Archaic [[chryselephantine statue]] - [[Delphi Archaeological Museum]]]]\nThe temple was the house of the deity it was dedicated to, who in some sense resided in the [[cult image]] in the ''[[cella]]'' or main room inside, normally facing the only door. The cult image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size. In early days these were in wood, marble or [[terracotta]], or in the specially prestigious form of a [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine statue]] using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework.  The most famous Greek cult images were of this type, including the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]], and [[Phidias]]'s [[Athena Parthenos]] in the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, both colossal statues, now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine statues from [[Delphi]] have been excavated. Bronze cult images were less frequent, at least until Hellenistic times.<ref>Miles, 213</ref> Early images seem often to have been dressed in real clothes, and at all periods images might wear real jewellery donated by devotees.\n\nThe [[acrolith]] was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body.  A [[xoanon]] was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu [[lingam]]; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity, even when a new statue was the main cult image.  Xoana had the advantage that they were easy to carry in processions at festivals.  The [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Trojan Palladium]], famous from the myths of the [[Epic Cycle]] and supposedly ending up in Rome, was one of these.\n\nMany of the Greek statues well known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the [[Apollo Barberini]], can be credibly identified.  A very few actual originals survive, for example, the bronze [[Piraeus Athena]] ({{convert|2.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, including a helmet).  The image stood on a base, from the 5th century often carved with reliefs.\n\nIt used to be thought that access to the ''cella'' of a Greek temple was limited to the priests, and it was entered only rarely by other visitors, except perhaps during important festivals or other special occasions. In recent decades this picture has changed, and scholars now stress the variety of local access rules. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was a gentlemanly traveller of the 2nd-century AD who declares that the special intention of his travels around Greece was to see cult images, and usually managed to do so.<ref>Miles, 212-213, 220</ref>\n\nIt was typically necessary to make a sacrifice or gift, and some temples restricted access either to certain days of the year, or by class, race, gender (with either men or women forbidden), or even more tightly. Garlic-eaters were forbidden in one temple, in another women unless they were virgins; restrictions typically arose from local ideas of ritual purity or a perceived whim of the deity. In some places visitors were asked to show they spoke Greek; elsewhere [[Dorians]] were not allowed entry. Some temples could only be viewed from the threshold. Some temples are said never to be opened at all. But generally Greeks, including slaves, had a reasonable expectation of being allowed into the ''cella''. Once inside the ''cella'' it was possible to pray to or before the cult image, and sometimes to touch it; Cicero saw a bronze image of Heracles with its foot largely worn away by the touch of devotees.<ref>Stevenson, 48-50; Miles, 212-213, 220</ref> Famous cult images such as the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]] functioned as significant visitor attractions.<ref>Stevenson, 68-69</ref>\n\n== Role of women ==\n[[File:Woman altar MAR Palermo NI2129.jpg|thumb|left|Woman pouring a [[libation]] on an altar]]\nThe role of women in sacrifices in discussed above. In addition, the only public roles that [[Greek women]] could perform were [[priest]]esses:<ref>{{cite document |last1=Simon |first1=Stephen J. |title=The Functions of Priestesses in Greek Society |id={{ProQuest|1296355183}} }}</ref> either ''[[hiereiai]]'', meaning \"sacred women\" or ''amphipolis'', a term for lesser attendants.  As a priestess, they gained social recognition and access to more luxuries than other Greek women that worked or typically stayed in the home.  Women who voluntarily chose to become priestesses received an increase in social and legal status to the public, and after death, they received a public burial site.  Greek priestesses had to be healthy and of a sound mind, the reasoning being that the ones serving the gods had to be as high-quality as their offerings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dillon |first1=Matthew |title=Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290875541 |website=Researchgate}}</ref> This was also true for male Greek priests.\n\nIt is contested whether there were gendered divisions when it came to serving a particular god or goddess, who was devoted to what god, gods and/or goddesses could have both priests and priestesses to serve them. Gender specifics did come into play when it came to who would perform certain acts of sacrifice or worship were determined by the significance of the male or female role to that particular god or goddess, a priest would lead the priestess or the reverse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holderman |first1=Elisabeth |title=A Study of the Greek Priestess |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006946365&view=1up&seq=27 |website=HathiTrust}}</ref> In some Greek cults priestesses served both gods and goddesses, such examples as the [[Pythia]], or female [[Oracle of Apollo]] at [[Delphi]], and that at [[Didyma]] were priestesses, but both were overseen by male priests. The festival of Dionosyus was practiced by both and the god was served by women and female priestesses, they were known as the [[Gerarai]] or the venerable ones.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dillon |first1=Matthew |title=Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290875541|website=Researchgate}}</ref>\n\nThere were segregated religious festivals in Ancient Greece; the [[Thesmophoria]], Plerosia, [[Kalamaia]], and [[Skira]] were festivals that were only for women. The Thesmophoria festival and many others represented agricultural fertility, which was considered to be closely connected to women by the ancient Greeks. It gave women a religious identity and purpose in Greek religion, in which the role of women in worshipping goddesses [[Demeter]] and her daughter [[Persephone]] reinforced traditional lifestyles. The festivals relating to agricultural fertility were valued by the [[polis]] because this is what they traditionally worked for, women-centered festivals that involved private matters were less important. In [[Athens]] the festivals honouring Demeter were included in the calendar and promoted by Athens, they constructed temples and shrines like the Thesmophorion, where women could perform their rites and worship.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dillon |first1=Matthew |title=Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290875541|website=Researchgate}}</ref>\n\n==Mystery religions==\nThose who were not satisfied by the public cult of the gods could turn to various [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]] which operated as [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]s into which members had to be initiated in order to learn their secrets.\n\nHere, they could find religious consolations that traditional religion could not provide: a chance at mystical awakening, a systematic religious doctrine, a map to the [[afterlife]], a communal worship, and a band of spiritual fellowship.\n\nSome of these mysteries, like the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|mysteries of Eleusis]] and [[Samothrace]], were ancient and local. Others were spread from place to place, like the mysteries of [[Dionysus]]. During the [[Hellenistic]] period and the [[Roman Empire]], exotic mystery religions became widespread, not only in Greece, but all across the empire. Some of these were new creations, such as [[Mithras]], while others had been practiced for hundreds of years before, like the Egyptian mysteries of [[Osiris]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Piraeus Apollo]], c. 525 BC]]\n\n===Origins===\nMainstream Greek religion appears to have developed out of [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and although very little is known about the earliest periods there are suggestive hints that some local elements go back even further than the [[Bronze Age]] or [[Helladic chronology|Helladic period]] to the farmers of [[Neolithic Greece]].  There was also clearly [[cultural evolution]] from the Late Helladic [[Mycenaean religion]] of the [[Mycenaean civilization]]. Both the literary settings of some important myths and many important sanctuaries relate to locations that were important Helladic centres that had become otherwise unimportant by Greek times.<ref>Burkert (1985): 1:1, 1:2</ref>\n\nThe Mycenaeans perhaps treated Poseidon, to them a god of earthquakes as well as the sea, as their chief deity, and forms of his name along with several other Olympians are recognisable in records in [[Linear B]], although Apollo and Aphrodite are absent.  Only about half of the Mycenaean pantheon seem to survive the [[Greek Dark Ages]] though.  The archaeological evidence for continuity in religion is far clearer for Crete and [[Cyprus]] than the Greek mainland.<ref name=\"Burkert 1985: 1:3:6\">Burkert (1985): 1:3:6</ref>\n\nGreek religious concepts may also have absorbed the beliefs and practices of earlier, nearby cultures, such as [[Minoan religion]],<ref>Burkert (1985): 1:3:1</ref> and other influences came from the Near East, especially via Cyprus.<ref name=\"Burkert 1985: 1:3:6\"/>  [[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, traced many Greek religious practices to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].\n\nThe [[Great Goddess hypothesis]], that a Stone Age religion dominated by a female Great Goddess was displaced by a male-dominated Indo-European hierarchy, has been proposed for Greece as for Minoan [[Crete]] and other regions, but has not been in favour with specialists for some decades, though the question remains too poorly-evidenced for a clear conclusion; at the least the evidence from [[Minoan art]] shows more goddesses than gods.<ref>Burkert (1985): 1:3:5</ref>  The [[Twelve Olympians]], with Zeus as [[sky father]], certainly have a strong Indo-European flavour;<ref>Burkert (1985): 1:2</ref> by the epic works of Homer all are well-established, except for [[Dionysus]].  However, several of the [[Homeric hymns]], probably composed slightly later, are dedicated to him.\n\n===Archaic and classical periods===\n[[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece]] saw the development of [[List of ancient Greek cities|flourishing cities]] and of stone-built temples to the gods, which were rather consistent in design across the Greek world.  Religion was closely tied to civic life, and priests were mostly drawn from the local elite.  Religious works led the development of [[Greek sculpture]], though apparently not the now-vanished Greek painting.  While much religious practice was, as well as personal, aimed at developing solidarity within the ''[[polis]]'', a number of important sanctuaries developed a \"Panhellenic\" status, drawing visitors from all over the Greek world. These served as an essential component in the growth and self-consciousness of Greek nationalism.<ref name=Burckhardt>{{harvnb|Burckhardt|1999|loc=p. 168: \"The establishment of these Panhellenic sites, which yet remained exclusively Hellenic, was a very important element in the growth and self-consciousness of Hellenic nationalism; it was uniquely decisive in breaking down enmity between tribes, and remained the most powerful obstacle to fragmentation into mutually hostile ''poleis''.\"}}</ref> \n \nThe mainstream religion of the Greeks did not go unchallenged within Greece. As [[Greek philosophy]] developed its ideas about [[ethics]], the Olympians were bound to be found wanting.  Several notable philosophers criticised a belief in the gods. The earliest of these was [[Xenophanes]], who chastised the human vices of the gods as well as their anthropomorphic depiction. [[Plato]] wrote that there was one supreme god, whom he called the \"[[Form of the Good]]\", and which he believed was the emanation of perfection in the universe. Plato's disciple, [[Aristotle]], also disagreed that polytheistic deities existed, because he could not find enough empirical evidence for it. He believed in a [[Primum movens|Prime Mover]], which had set creation going, but was not connected to or interested in the universe.\n\n===Hellenistic period===\n[[File:Egyptian - Pendant with Image of Sarapis - Walters 571524 - Front View B (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pendant with [[Serapis]], Egypt, 2nd century BC]]  \n{{main|Hellenistic religion}}\nIn the [[Hellenistic period]] between the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC and the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] (146 BC) Greek religion developed in various ways, including expanding over at least some of Alexander's conquests.  The new dynasties of [[diadochi]], kings and tyrants often spent lavishly on temples, often following Alexander in trying to insinuate themselves into religious cult; this was much easier for the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt, where the traditional [[ancient Egyptian religion]] had long had deified monarchs.  The enormous raised [[Pergamon Altar]] (now in Berlin) and the [[Altar of Hieron]] in [[Sicily]] are examples of unprecedentedly large constructions of the period.\n\nNew cults of imported deities such as [[Isis#In the Greco-Roman world|Isis from Egypt]], [[Atargatis]] from Syria, and [[Cybele]] from Anatolia became increasingly important, as well as [[Hellenistic philosophy|several philosophical movements]] such as [[Platonism]], [[stoicism]], and [[Epicureanism]]; both tended to detract from the traditional religion, although many Greeks were able to hold beliefs from more than one of these groups.  [[Serapis]] was essentially a Hellenistic creation, if not devised then spread in Egypt for political reasons by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] as a hybrid of Greek and local styles of deity.  Various philosophical movements, including the [[Orphics]] and [[Pythagoreans]], began to question the ethics of animal sacrifice, and whether the gods really appreciated it; from the surviving texts [[Empedocles]] and [[Theophrastus]] (both vegetarians) were notable critics.<ref>Burkert (1972), 6-8</ref> [[Hellenistic astrology]] developed late in the period, as another distraction from the traditional practices.  Although the traditional myths, festivals and beliefs all continued, these trends probably reduced the grip on the imagination of the traditional pantheon, especially among the educated, but probably more widely in the general population.\n\n===Roman Empire===\nWhen the [[Roman Republic]] conquered Greece in 146 BC, it took much of Greek religion (along with many other aspects of [[Greek culture]] such as literary and architectural styles) and incorporated it into its own. The Greek gods were equated with the ancient Roman deities; Zeus with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Hera with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], Poseidon with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], Aphrodite with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], Ares with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], Artemis with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], Athena with [[Minerva]], Hermes with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], Hephaestus with [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], Hestia with [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], Demeter with [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], Hades with [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], Tyche with [[Fortuna]], and Pan with [[Faunus]]. Some of the gods, such as Apollo and [[Bacchus]], had earlier been adopted by the Romans. There were also many deities that existed in the Roman religion before its interaction with Greece that were not associated with a Greek deity, including [[Janus]] and [[Quirinus]].\n\nThe Romans generally did not spend much on new temples in Greece, other that those for [[Imperial cult of ancient Rome|their Imperial cult]], which were placed in all important cities.  Exceptions include [[Antoninus Pius]] (r. 138-161 AD), whose commissions include the [[Baalbec]] [[Temple of Bacchus]], arguably the most impressive survival from the imperial period (though the Temple of Jupiter-[[Baal]] next to it was larger).  It could be said the Greek world was by this time well furnished with sanctuaries. Roman governors and emperors often pilfered famous statues from sanctuaries, sometimes leaving contemporary reproductions in their place. [[Verres]], governor of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]] from 73 to 70 BC, was an early example who, unusually, was prosecuted after his departure.\n\nAfter the huge Roman conquests beyond Greece, new cults from Egypt and Asia became popular in Greece as well as the western empire.\n\n===Decline and suppression===\n{{Main|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism}}\nThe initial [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] was due in part to its syncretic nature, assimilating beliefs and practices from a variety of foreign religious traditions as the Roman Empire expanded. Graeco-Roman philosophical schools incorporated elements of [[Judaism]] and [[Early Christianity]], and mystery religions like Christianity and [[Mithraism]] also became increasingly popular. [[Constantine I]] became the first Roman Emperor to convert to Christianity, and the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD enacted official tolerance for Christianity within the Empire. Still, in Greece and elsewhere, there is evidence that pagan and Christian communities remained essentially segregated from each other, with little cultural influence flowing between the two. Urban pagans continued to utilize the civic centers and temple complexes, while Christians set up their own, new places of worship in suburban areas of cities. Contrary to some older scholarship, newly converted Christians did not simply continue worshiping in converted temples; rather, new Christian communities were formed as older pagan communities declined and were eventually suppressed and disbanded.<ref name=survival_greece>Gregory, T.

Julian's Christian training influenced his decision to create a single organized version of the various old pagan traditions, with a centralized priesthood and a coherent body of doctrine, ritual, and liturgy based on [[Neoplatonism]].<ref name=\"hughes\">\"A History of the Church\", Philip Hughes, Sheed & Ward, rev ed 1949, vol I chapter 6.[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/HUGHHIST.TXT]</ref><ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ''Res Gestae'' 22.12</ref> Julian's successor [[Constantinus]] reversed some of his reforms, but [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]],<ref>Themistius Oration 5; Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of [[Philostorgius]], 8.5</ref> [[Valentinian I]], and [[Valens]] continued Julian's policy of [[religious toleration]] towards both pagans and Christians in the Empire, and pagan writers applauded both for their policies.<ref>Ammianus Res Gestae 20.9; Themistius Oration 12.</ref>\n\nOfficial persecution of paganism in the Eastern Empire began [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I|under Theodosius I]] in 381 AD.<ref name=\"Grindle1892pp29-30\">Grindle, Gilbert (1892) ''The Destruction of Paganism in the Roman Empire'', pp.29-30.</ref> Theodosius strictly enforced anti-pagan laws, had priesthoods disbanded and temples destroyed, and actively participated in Christian actions against pagan holy sites.<ref name=\"Ramsay1984p90\">Ramsay McMullan (1984) ''Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D. 100\u2013400'', Yale University Press, p.90.</ref> He enacted laws that prohibited worship of pagan gods not only in public, but also within private homes.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> The last Olympic Games were held in 393 AD, and Theodosius likely suppressed any further attempts to hold the games.<ref name=\"Burkert 1985, Introduction:3\"/>\n\nWestern Empire Emperor [[Gratian]], under the influence of his adviser [[Ambrose]], ended the widespread, unofficial tolerance that had existed in the Western Roman Empire since the reign of Julian. In 382 AD, Gratian appropriated the income and property of the remaining orders of pagan priests, removed altars, and confiscated temples.<ref>Theodosian Code 16.10.20; Symmachus Relationes 1-3; Ambrose Epistles 17-18.</ref> Pagan senators argued that Gratian was ignoring his duty as [[Pontifex Maximus]] to ensure that rites to the Graeco-Roman gods continued to be performed, and Gratian responded by abdicating that title.\n\nDespite official suppression of the ancient Graeco-Roman religion by the Roman government, its practice may have persisted in rural and remote regions into the [[early Middle Ages]]. A claimed temple to Apollo, with a community of worshipers and associated sacred grove, survived at [[Monte Cassino]] until 529 AD, when it was forcefully converted to a Christian chapel by Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]], who destroyed the altar and cut down the grove.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Life of Saint Benedict|author=Pope Gregory I|translator=Terrence Kardong, OSB|section=7:10-11|page=49|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=2009|location=Collegeville, MN}}</ref> Other pagan communities, namely the [[Maniots]], persisted in the [[Mani Peninsula]] of Greece until at least the 9th century.<ref name=survival_greece/>\n\n===Modern revivals===\n[[File:Hellen priest (1).png|thumb|right|Priest performing ritual.]]\n{{Main|Hellenism (religion)|Renaissance Neoplatonism}}\nGreek religion and [[Hellenistic philosophy|philosophy]] have experienced a number of revivals, firstly in the arts, humanities and spirituality of [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]], which was certainly believed by many to have effects in the real world.  During the period of time (14th - 17th centuries) when the literature and philosophy of the ancient Greeks gained widespread appreciation in Europe, this new popularity did not extend to ancient Greek religion, especially the original theist forms, and most new examinations of Greek philosophy were written within a solidly Christian context.<ref name=\"openuni\">Open University, ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/religion.htm Looking at the Renaissance: Religious Context in the Renaissance]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)</ref>\n\n[[Hellenism (religion)#Early revivals|Early revivalists]], with varying degrees of commitment, were the Englishmen [[John Fransham]] (1730 \u2013 1810), interested in [[Neoplatonism]], and [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1758 \u2013 1835), who produced the first English translations of many Neoplatonic philosophical and religious texts.\n\nMore recently, a revival has begun with the contemporary [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], as it is often called (a term first used by the last pagan Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]). In Greece, the term used is Hellene ethnic religion (Greek:  \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0398\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1). Modern Hellenism reflects [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] speculation (which is represented in [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Libanius]], [[Proclus]], and [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]), as well as classical cult practice.

He was the head coach at [[Syracuse University]] from 1974 to 1980, succeeding [[College Football Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Ben Schwartzwalder]].  Prior to coaching at Syracuse, Maloney was an assistant coach at the [[University of Michigan]] under [[Bump Elliott]] (1968) and [[Bo Schembechler]] (1969\u20131973). After departing Syracuse he joined the management team for the [[Chicago Cubs]] of [[Major League Baseball]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nMaloney's tenure at Syracuse was marked by inconsistency. The fan base turned on him as the Orange failed to achieve the national status they had enjoyed under Schwartzwalder, perhaps, failing to remember that Schwartzwalder's last few seasons were mediocre ones (only one winning season in his last five), and his 1970 team had been stricken by racial unrest.  Maloney's program was also limited by archaic facilities.  [[Archbold Stadium]], Syracuse's home field since 1907, was in need of replacement. Nonetheless, Maloney did recruit a number of future [[National Football League|NFL]] stars such as [[Joe Morris (American football)|Joe Morris]] and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] member [[Art Monk]].\n\nMaloney was the subject of criticism, not only from the fans and alumni, but also from the 1959 national championship team, members of which started a campaign calling for his ousting.  Ironically enough, this call from program alumni came during the 1979 season, Maloney's best at Syracuse, when the Orangemen qualified for the [[1979 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]], beating [[McNeese State Cowboys football|McNeese State]]. Also, Maloney and the 1979 Orangemen bore the burden of playing an entire season on the road, as [[Archbold Stadium]] was demolished following the 1978 season, and the [[Carrier Dome]] would not be ready until 1980. The 1979 team played \"home\" games at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium|Rich Stadium]] in [[Orchard Park, New York|Orchard Park]], [[Schoellkopf Field]] at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], and [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. \n\nAfter coaching the Orangemen for seven seasons and presiding over the opening of the Carrier Dome in 1980, Maloney was fired and replaced by [[Dick MacPherson]].\n\n==Chicago Cubs==\nIn 29 seasons in the [[Chicago Cubs]] ticket office, including the last 27 as its director, Maloney oversaw nine single-season attendance records, including [[Wrigley Field]]'s first two-million fan season in 1984 and its first three-million fan season in 2004. Maloney stepped down from his post having helped the Cubs to seven consecutive seasons with three million fans at Wrigley Field starting 2004.  Maloney retired at the end of the 2010 calendar year. He remained with the club as a consultant in 2011. He died of brain cancer in Chicago in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.syracuse.com/orangefootball/2020/03/former-syracuse-football-coach-frank-maloney-dies-at-79.html|title=Former Syracuse

Prior to coaching at Syracuse, Maloney was an assistant coach at the [[University of Michigan]] under [[Bump Elliott]] (1968) and [[Bo Schembechler]] (1969\u20131973). After departing Syracuse he joined the management team for the [[Chicago Cubs]] of [[Major League Baseball]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nMaloney's tenure at Syracuse was marked by inconsistency. The fan base turned on him as the Orange failed to achieve the national status they had enjoyed under Schwartzwalder, perhaps, failing to remember that Schwartzwalder's last few seasons were mediocre ones (only one winning season in his last five), and his 1970 team had been stricken by racial unrest.  Maloney's program was also limited by archaic facilities.  [[Archbold Stadium]], Syracuse's home field since 1907, was in need of replacement. Nonetheless, Maloney did recruit a number of future [[National Football League|NFL]] stars such as [[Joe Morris (American football)|Joe Morris]] and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] member [[Art Monk]].\n\nMaloney was the subject of criticism, not only from the fans and alumni, but also from the 1959 national championship team, members of which started a campaign calling for his ousting.  Ironically enough, this call from program alumni came during the 1979 season, Maloney's best at Syracuse, when the Orangemen qualified for the [[1979 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]], beating [[McNeese State Cowboys football|McNeese State]]. Also, Maloney and the 1979 Orangemen bore the burden of playing an entire season on the road, as [[Archbold Stadium]] was demolished following the 1978 season, and the [[Carrier Dome]] would not be ready until 1980. The 1979 team played \"home\" games at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium|Rich Stadium]] in [[Orchard Park, New York|Orchard Park]], [[Schoellkopf Field]] at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], and [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. \n\nAfter coaching the Orangemen for seven seasons and presiding over the opening of the Carrier Dome in 1980, Maloney was fired and replaced by [[Dick MacPherson]].\n\n==Chicago Cubs==\nIn 29 seasons in the [[Chicago Cubs]] ticket office, including the last 27 as its director, Maloney oversaw nine single-season attendance records, including [[Wrigley Field]]'s first two-million fan season in 1984 and its first three-million fan season in 2004. Maloney stepped down from his post having helped the Cubs to seven consecutive seasons with three million fans at Wrigley Field starting 2004.  Maloney retired at the end of the 2010 calendar year. He remained with the club as a consultant in 2011. He died of brain cancer in Chicago in 2020.<ref>[https://www.syracuse.com/orangefootball/2020/03/former-syracuse-football-coach-frank-maloney-dies-at-79.html]</ref>\n\n==Coaching tree==\nAssistant coaches under Maloney who became NFL or colllege head coaches:\n\n* [[Tom Coughlin]]: [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] (1991\u20131993), [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] (1995\u20132002), [[New York Giants]] (2004\u20132015)\n* [[Nick Saban]]: [[Toledo Rockets football|Toledo]] (1990), [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (1995\u20131999), [[Louisiana State Tigers football|LSU]] (2000\u20132004), [[Miami Dolphins]] (2005\u20132006), [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Kevin Callahan]]: [[Monmouth Hawks football|Monmouth]] (1992\u2013present)\n\n==Head coaching record==\n{{CFB Yearly Record Start | type = coach | team = | conf = | bowl = | poll = no }}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subhead\n | name      = [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse Orangemen]] \n | conf      = [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|NCAA Division I/I-A independent]]\n | startyear = 1974\n | endyear   = 1980\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1974 NCAA Division I football season|1974]]\n | name         = [[1974 Syracuse Orangemen football team|Syracuse]]\n | overall      = 2\u20139\n | conference   = \n | confstanding = \n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1975 NCAA Division I football season|1975]]\n | name         = [[1975 Syracuse Orangemen football team|Syracuse]]\n | overall      = 6\u20135\n | conference   = \n | confstanding = \n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1976 NCAA Division I football season|1976]]\n | name         = [[1976 Syracuse Orangemen football team|Syracuse]]\n | overall      = 3\u20138\n | conference   = \n | confstanding = \n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1977 NCAA Division I football season|1977]]\n | name         = [[1977 Syracuse Orangemen football team|Syracuse]]\n | overall      = 6\u20135\n | conference   = \n | confstanding = \n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1978 NCAA Division I-A football season|1978]]\n | name         = [[1978 Syracuse Orangemen football team|Syracuse]]\n | overall      = 3\u20138\n | conference   = \n | confstanding = \n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1979 NCAA Division I-A football season|1979]]\n | name         = [[1979 Syracuse Orangemen football team|Syracuse]]\n | overall      = 7\u20135\n | conference   = \n | confstanding = \n | bowlname     = [[1979 Independence Bowl|Independence]]\n | bowloutcome  = W\n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1980 NCAA Division I-A football season|1980]]\n | name         = [[1980 Syracuse Orangemen football team|Syracuse]]\n | overall      = 5\u20136\n | conference   = \n | confstanding = \n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subtotal\n | name       = Syracuse\n | overall    = 32\u201346\n | confrecord = \n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record End\n | overall  = 32\u201346\n | bowls    = no\n | poll     = no\n | polltype = \n | legend   = no\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Syracuse Orange football coach navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maloney, Frank}}\n[[Category:1940 births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs executives]]\n[[Category:Michigan Wolverines football coaches]]\n[[Category:Michigan Wolverines football players]]\n[[Category:Syracuse Orange football coaches]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Chicago]]\n", "name_user": "GreaterPonce665", "label": "safe", "comment": "citation edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Maloney_(American_football)"}
