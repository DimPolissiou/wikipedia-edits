It stands at the northeastern edge of Coahuila on the [[U.S.-Mexico border]], across the [[Rio Grande]] from [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] in the U.S. state of [[Texas]]. In the 2015 census the city had a population of 163,595 inhabitants,<ref name=\"inegi.org.mx\"/> while the metropolitan area had a population of 245,155 inhabitants.<ref name=\"inegi.org.mx\"/> The Piedras Negras and the Eagle Pass areas are connected by the [[Eagle Pass-Piedras Negras International Bridge]], [[Camino Real International Bridge]], and the [[Eagle Pass Union Pacific International Railroad Bridge]].\n\nIn Spanish ''Piedras Negras'' translates to \"black stones\" \u2013 a reference to coal deposits in the area. Across the river, coal was formerly mined on the US side at Dolchburg, near Eagle Pass. This mine closed around 1905, after a fire. Mexico currently operates two large coal-fired power plants named \"[[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]]\" and \"Carb\u00f3n 2\" located {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of Piedras Negras. These two coal-fired power plants are currently operated by MICARE, which engages with the mining and distribution of coal.\n\n==History==\nOn June 15, 1850, a group of 34 men (commanded by Andr\u00e9s Zapata, Gaspar Salazar and Antonio Ram\u00edrez) met with Colonel Juan Manuel Maldonado to give the news that they had created a pass point at Piedras Negras, to the right of the [[Rio Grande]], south of [[Fort Duncan]]. They named it Nueva Villa de Herrera, but it later became Villa de Piedras Negras. In Otto Schober's \"Breve historia de Piedras Negras,\" the local historian points out that the 34 men were repatriates (Mexican Americans) who arrived on June 15, 1850, in what was then called \"Colonia Militar de Guerrero en Piedras Negras.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piedrasnegras.gob.mx/contenido05/conoce-pn/historia/|title=Historia|publisher=Piedras Negras|date=|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1855, the town was looted by a small force of 130 Texans that had been organized by [[History of slavery in Texas|Texas slaveholders]] for a punitive expedition against a nearby border settlement the Texans claimed were fugitive [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. The force was led by a captain of the Texas Rangers.  As it happened, the incursion was opposed and \"repelled by a superior force of Negroes, Indians, and Mexicans who were waiting in ambush\" inside Mexico. But the Ranger-led expedition then looted Piedras Negras while returning to Texas.<ref name=johnson2014>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Nicholas|title=Negroes and The Gun: the black tradition of arms|year=2014|publisher=Prometheus|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=978-1-61614-839-3|page=133}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the discovery of huge deposits of coal in the region, in 1881 a railroad track was begun that was completed in 1883. The regional economy flourished and on December 1, 1888, it was granted city status; this time with the name of Ciudad Porfirio D\u00edaz. After the fall of Diaz in 1911, the city reverted to being Piedras Negras, Coahuila.\n\nOn April 26, 2004 flooding killed 31 people with up to 60 reported missing.\n\nOn April 24, 2007, [[April 20\u201326, 2007 tornado outbreak sequence|an F4 tornado struck the city]], killing three people there and seven in Eagle Pass, Texas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Welch|first=William M.|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/storms/tornadoes/2007-04-25-texas-storms_N.htm|title=Border storms' death toll rises to 10 - USATODAY.com|publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com|date=26 April 2007|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn June 14\u201315, 2013 over 10,000 homes were flooded, but remarkably only caused one death.\n\nOn the night of June 8, 2018, former Piedras Negras mayor [[Fernando Pur\u00f3n]] was shot in the back of the head by an unknown man while Pur\u00f3n was taking a selfie with an admirer. Pur\u00f3n died on the spot, becoming the 112th candidate or politician to be killed since Mexico's electoral campaign began in September 2017. Pur\u00f3n was supposed to run in the [[2018 Mexican general election|2018 Mexican election]] on July 1 as a congressional candidate of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). [[Sonia Villareal]], current mayor of Piedras Negras and fellow member of PRI, suspended her mayoral reelection campaign in response to Pur\u00f3n's murder to concentrate on her current duties, stating that \"We don't (want) his name to be just one more added to the list of candidates who have been victims of these deplorable acts.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Charner|first1=Flora|title=This Mexican candidate had just vowed to tackle crime.

According to the [[National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing|National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI)]], in 2005 the population of the ''municipio'' of Piedras Negras was 143,915 inhabitants, equal to 5.77% of the population of Coahuila. 17% of the population of Piedras Negras came from other states, 3% were foreigners, and the rest were born in Coahuila. Piedras Negras has a high population growth due partly to its status as a border city fueled by U.S.-bound exports from several factories and also by persons who hope to cross the border into the United States. It is estimated that in a couple of years it will become the third most populated city of the state of [[Coahuila]], surpassing [[Monclova]]. Nowadays Piedras Negras has more than 200,000 inhabitants.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of the region is [[Steppe|semi-arid]] and hot. During summer the temperatures often surpass {{convert|45|C|F}}. The hottest months are May through September with a daily average (mean) temperature between {{convert|26|C|F}} and {{convert|31|C|F}}.\n\nThe high temperatures recorded in Piedras Negras have earned it recognition as one of the hottest cities in the country.<ref>{{cite news|title=Piedras Negras, una de las ciudades m\u00e1s calientes del pa\u00eds|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/piedras-negras-una-de-las-ciudades-mas-calientes-del-pais/|accessdate=12 April 2011|newspaper=Z\u00d3CALO SALTILLO|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nHighest precipitation months are May, June and September with an average monthly downfall in excess of {{convert|80|mm|in|1}} but that is highly sporadic lending to frequent drought conditions. The period of lowest precipitation is between December through March, with a monthly average of {{convert|30|mm|in|1}}.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Piedras Negras, Coahuila (1951\u20132010)\n|single

In the 2015 census the city had a population of 163,595 inhabitants,<ref name=\"inegi.org.mx\"/> while the metropolitan area had a population of 245,155 inhabitants.<ref name=\"inegi.org.mx\"/> The Piedras Negras and the Eagle Pass areas are connected by the [[Eagle Pass-Piedras Negras International Bridge]], [[Camino Real International Bridge]], and the [[Eagle Pass Union Pacific International Railroad Bridge]].\n\nIn Spanish ''Piedras Negras'' translates to \"black stones\" \u2013 a reference to coal deposits in the area. Across the river, coal was formerly mined on the US side at Dolchburg, near Eagle Pass. This mine closed around 1905, after a fire. Mexico currently operates two large coal-fired power plants named \"[[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]]\" and \"Carb\u00f3n 2\" located {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of Piedras Negras. These two coal-fired power plants are currently operated by MICARE, which engages with the mining and distribution of coal.\n\n==History==\nOn June 15, 1850, a group of 34 men (commanded by Andr\u00e9s Zapata, Gaspar Salazar and Antonio Ram\u00edrez) met with Colonel Juan Manuel Maldonado to give the news that they had created a pass point at Piedras Negras, to the right of the [[Rio Grande]], south of [[Fort Duncan]]. They named it Nueva Villa de Herrera, but it later became Villa de Piedras Negras. In Otto Schober's \"Breve historia de Piedras Negras,\" the local historian points out that the 34 men were repatriates (Mexican Americans) who arrived on June 15, 1850, in what was then called \"Colonia Militar de Guerrero en Piedras Negras.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piedrasnegras.gob.mx/contenido05/conoce-pn/historia/|title=Historia|publisher=Piedras Negras|date=|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1855, the town was looted by a small force of 130 Texans that had been organized by [[History of slavery in Texas|Texas slaveholders]] for a punitive expedition against a nearby border settlement the Texans claimed were fugitive [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. The force was led by a captain of the Texas Rangers.  As it happened, the incursion was opposed and \"repelled by a superior force of Negroes, Indians, and Mexicans who were waiting in ambush\" inside Mexico. But the Ranger-led expedition then looted Piedras Negras while returning to Texas.<ref name=johnson2014>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Nicholas|title=Negroes and The Gun: the black tradition of arms|year=2014|publisher=Prometheus|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=978-1-61614-839-3|page=133}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the discovery of huge deposits of coal in the region, in 1881 a railroad track was begun that was completed in 1883. The regional economy flourished and on December 1, 1888, it was granted city status; this time with the name of Ciudad Porfirio D\u00edaz. After the fall of Diaz in 1911, the city reverted to being Piedras Negras, Coahuila.\n\nOn April 26, 2004 flooding killed 31 people with up to 60 reported missing.\n\nOn April 24, 2007, [[April 20\u201326, 2007 tornado outbreak sequence|an F4 tornado struck the city]], killing three people there and seven in Eagle Pass, Texas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Welch|first=William M.|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/storms/tornadoes/2007-04-25-texas-storms_N.htm|title=Border storms' death toll rises to 10 - USATODAY.com|publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com|date=26 April 2007|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn June 14\u201315, 2013 over 10,000 homes were flooded, but remarkably only caused one death.\n\nOn the night of June 8, 2018, former Piedras Negras mayor [[Fernando Pur\u00f3n]] was shot in the back of the head by an unknown man while Pur\u00f3n was taking a selfie with an admirer. Pur\u00f3n died on the spot, becoming the 112th candidate or politician to be killed since Mexico's electoral campaign began in September 2017. Pur\u00f3n was supposed to run in the [[2018 Mexican general election|2018 Mexican election]] on July 1 as a congressional candidate of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). [[Sonia Villareal]], current mayor of Piedras Negras and fellow member of PRI, suspended her mayoral reelection campaign in response to Pur\u00f3n's murder to concentrate on her current duties, stating that \"We don't (want) his name to be just one more added to the list of candidates who have been victims of these deplorable acts.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Charner|first1=Flora|title=This Mexican candidate had just vowed to tackle crime.

According to the [[National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing|National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI)]], in 2005 the population of the ''municipio'' of Piedras Negras was 143,915 inhabitants, equal to 5.77% of the population of Coahuila. 17% of the population of Piedras Negras came from other states, 3% were foreigners, and the rest were born in Coahuila. Piedras Negras has a high population growth due partly to its status as a border city fueled by U.S.-bound exports from several factories and also by persons who hope to cross the border into the United States. It is estimated that in a couple of years it will become the third most populated city of the state of [[Coahuila]], surpassing [[Monclova]]. Nowadays Piedras Negras has more than 200,000 inhabitants.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of the region is [[Steppe|semi-arid]] and hot. During summer the temperatures often surpass {{convert|45|C|F}}. The hottest months are May through September with a daily average (mean) temperature between {{convert|26|C|F}} and {{convert|31|C|F}}.\n\nThe high temperatures recorded in Piedras Negras have earned it recognition as one of the hottest cities in the country.<ref>{{cite news|title=Piedras Negras, una de las ciudades m\u00e1s calientes del pa\u00eds|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/piedras-negras-una-de-las-ciudades-mas-calientes-del-pais/|accessdate=12 April 2011|newspaper=Z\u00d3CALO SALTILLO|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nHighest precipitation months are May, June and September with an average monthly downfall in excess of {{convert|80|mm|in|1}} but that is highly sporadic lending to frequent drought conditions.

It is the sequel to 2014's ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' and its [[Destiny post-release content|subsequent expansions]]. Set in a \"[[science fantasy|mythic science fiction]]\" world, the game features a multiplayer \"shared-world\" environment with elements of [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] games. Like the original, activities in ''Destiny 2'' are divided among [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \"[[Dungeon crawl|strikes]]\" and six-player [[Raid (gaming)|raids]]. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events as well as new activities not featured in the original. These new activities have an emphasis on exploration of the planets and interactions with [[non-player characters]] (NPCs); the original ''Destiny'' only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional [[deathmatch]] game modes.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the Last City from different alien races. One of these races, the Cabal, led by the warlord Dominus Ghaul, assault the Last City and strip all Guardians of their Light. The player sets out on a journey to regain their Light and find a way to defeat Ghaul and his Red Legion army and take back the Last City. Like the original ''Destiny'', the game features [[expansion packs]] which further the story and adds new content and missions. Year One of ''Destiny 2'' featured two small expansions, ''[[Destiny 2: Curse of Osiris|Curse of Osiris]]'' in December 2017 and ''[[Destiny 2: Warmind|Warmind]]'' in May 2018. A third, large expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Forsaken|Forsaken]]'', was released in September 2018, beginning Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into ''Destiny 2: Forsaken Legendary Collection''. An [[Destiny 2 post-release content#Annual Pass|annual pass]] was also available alongside this release, containing three premium content drops for Year Two. Year Three began with the large expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Shadowkeep|Shadowkeep]]'' in October 2019. It is a standalone release, not requiring the previous expansions to play. Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of ''Destiny 2'' called \"New Light\", a [[free-to-play]] re-release of ''Destiny 2'' and the first two expansions.\n\nUpon release, ''Destiny 2'' received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game received praise for its many improvements over its predecessor. The original ''Destiny'' received much criticism for its story, but ''Destiny 2'' was praised as having a \"more robust story\" and an actual fleshed out villain.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/><ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> As with the original, gameplay for the most part was also highly praised. Reviews were split on the recategorization of the weapons and the newer activities like the Adventures and Lost Sectors, but praise was unanimous on the exploration of the game world. Changes to PvP were welcomed by some reviewers, though others were critical for the mode lacking player choice. ''Destiny 2'' was nominated for and won various awards, such as at [[The Game Awards 2017]] and [[Game Critics Awards]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Destiny 2 gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|''Destiny 2'' allows players, known in the game as guardians, to utilize weaponry and special powers alongside other guardians. Here a guardian defends against enemies while another guardian uses their powers to cast a shield made of void energy.]]\n{{see also|Destiny (video game)#Gameplay}}\nSimilar to its predecessor, ''Destiny 2'' is a [[first-person shooter]] game that incorporates [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] and [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMO) elements.<ref name=\"Kotaku Destiny Reveal\">{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Bungie Reveals its Destiny in This Documentary|url=http://kotaku.com/5984863/bungie-reveals-its-destiny-in-this-documentary|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}</ref> The original ''Destiny'' includes on-the-fly [[Matchmaking (video games)|matchmaking]] that allowed players to communicate only with other players with whom they were \"matched\" by the game. To communicate with other players in the game world, players had to use their respective console's messaging system.<ref name=\"Kotaku Destiny Reveal\"/> ''Destiny 2'' features a more optimal way of matchmaking called \"Guided Games\", which allows players to search for [[Video gaming clan|clans]] who may need additional players for activities, such as [[Dungeon crawl|strikes]] or [[raid (gaming)|raids]]. Like the original, activities in ''Destiny 2'' are divided among [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) game types.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6449086/|title=Destiny 2: Everything We Know So Far|date=May 17, 2017|last1=Espineli|first1=Matt|last2=Plagge|first2=Kallie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Character progression and classes ===\n{{see|Destiny (video game)#Character progression and classes}}\nAs in the original game, players are able to improve their characters, referred to as Guardians, by gaining [[experience point]]s (EXP) \u2014 when a set number of experience points are accumulated, the player's character will \"level up\" and gain improved [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] which further enhance performance in battle. [[Quest (video gaming)|Milestones]], including the \"main scenario\" milestones, are specific tasks given to the player by [[non-player characters]] (NPCs) which reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario milestones progresses the overarching plot of the game.\n\n''Destiny 2'' features the same three character classes as the original ''Destiny''. Each class has their own specific upgrades, perks, special abilities, and three sub-classes that allow players to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style. The three classes are Warlock, Hunter, and Titan. After choosing a class, players select one of three species for their character: Human, Awoken (bluish-gray-skinned descendants of Humans), or Exo (humanoid machines). They can then customize their character, such as changing its gender or skin color. A character's species is cosmetic and does not affect gameplay. Players can create two more characters to have a character of each class.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\"/><ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-26-destiny-2-classes-subclasses-titan-hunter-warlock-4747|title=Destiny 2 classes and subclasses - all new Titan, Hunter, and Warlock skills and supers explained|date=May 26, 2017|last=Tapsell|first=Chris|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n*Hunters continue to have access to the Solar-based \"Gunslinger\" sub-class from the original game and the Void-based \"Nightstalker\" sub-class from the original's ''[[Destiny: The Taken King|The Taken King]]'' expansion, both with gameplay changes. The Hunter's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Arc-based \"Arcstrider\", replacing the \"Bladedancer\" sub-class of the original. Arcstrider's super, \"Arc Staff\", focuses on an electrified staff and a large amount of rapid mobility.<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' adds three new supers for each of the Hunter sub-classes: \"Blade Barrage\" for Gunslingers, focusing on throwing a volley of flaming knives; \"Spectral Blades\" for Nightstalkers, allowing players to see through walls and attack with Void daggers; and \"Whirling Guard\" for Arcstriders, which allows players to block projectiles by spinning their Arc Staff.\n*Warlocks continue to have access to the Void-based \"Voidwalker\" sub-class from the original game and the Arc-based \"Stormcaller\" sub-class from the original's ''The Taken King'' expansion, both with several changes. The Warlock's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Solar-based \"Dawnblade\" with a super called \"Daybreak\", replacing the \"Sunsinger\" sub-class of the original. The Daybreak super allows the player to make Solar Light blades to strike enemies from mid-air.<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' gives Warlocks three new supers: \"Nova Warp\" for Voidwalkers, allowing players to warp around the battlefield and unleash a Void explosion; \"Chaos Reach\" for Stormcallers, which unleashes a beam of Arc energy which can be turned off at any time to conserve Super energy; and \"Well of Radiance\" for Dawnblades, allowing players to create a healing and empowering aura for players to stand in.\n*Titans continue to have access to the Arc-based \"Striker\" sub-class from the original game and the Solar-based \"Sunbreaker\" from the original's ''The Taken King'' expansion, both with significant gameplay changes. The Titan's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Void-based \"Sentinel\", replacing the \"Defender\" sub-class of the original, although the Sentinel sub-class can create the Defender's Ward of Dawn shielding bubble if this option is selected. Sentinel's super, \"Sentinel Shield\", allows the player to summon a shield that can block enemy fire and be used offensively (similar to [[Captain America's shield]]).<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' added three new supers for Titans: \"Thundercrash\" for Strikers, allowing players to launch into the air and slam onto the ground; \"Burning Maul\" for Sunbreakers, which players wield a large hammer than can unleash flaming tornadoes; and \"Banner Shield\" for Sentinels, which unleashes a protective barrier that allows other players to shoot through.\n\nUpon reaching the character EXP level cap (level 20 at launch, expanded to 50), character progression shifts to improving their \"Power\" level (formerly \"Light\" level) by acquiring new and better equipment. This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources, including \"[[Dungeon crawl|strikes]]\", [[raid (gaming)|raids]], and in-game events. The three weapon classes and five pieces of armor each have a Power level; a character's Power level is the average of that gear. A higher character level allows for better equipment with higher Power levels to be equipped. A higher Power level improves damage output and defense. The highest obtainable Power level at launch was 305 and is expanded to 600. Weapons and armor were reorganized in ''Destiny 2''. In the original game, weapons were divided as Primary, Special, and Heavy weapons. At launch, the weapons were categorized as Kinetic, Energy, and Power weapons. Primary weapons and some Special weapons in the original \u2013 such as hand cannons and sidearms \u2013 are classified as Kinetic and Energy weapons. Those without an elemental damage type go in the Kinetic weapons slot while those with an elemental damage type (Arc, Solar, or Void) go in the Energy weapons slot. Power weapons include the Heavy weapons and the more powerful Special weapons from the first game, such as shotguns and sniper rifles, as well as new weapon types, such as the grenade launcher. As of ''Forsaken'', the weapons system was overhauled, with many Power weapons, such as most shotguns, single-shot grenade launchers, and most sniper rifles, being reorganized into Kinetic and Energy weapons slots. With armor, the name of the stats have been changed. Instead of Strength, Intellect, and Discipline, there are stats for Resilience, Recovery, and Mobility. Also for armor, the helmet, gauntlets, chest, legs, and class item slots have remained unchanged, but the artifacts slot has been replaced with one for a player's clan banners.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-09-destiny-2-gameplay-beta-features-4747|title=Destiny 2 gameplay changes, beta, release date and everything else we know so far|date=June 9, 2017|last=Reynolds|first=Matthew|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Player versus environment (PvE) ===\nLike the original game, player versus environment game types make up the majority of the game. Areas to explore include [[Earth]]'s European Dead Zone (which was only represented by PvP maps in the original), [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur planet]] [[7066 Nessus|Nessus]]. The ''Curse of Osiris'' expansion adds [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as an explorable area, while the ''Warmind'' expansion adds [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]]. ''Forsaken'' adds two new explorable areas in the Reef: the Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City, the latter being the mysterious sanctuary of the Awoken race and an end-game area that is accessible after completing the campaign of ''Forsaken''. The newest expansion, Shadowkeep, adds the Moon as a playable area. There is also a new social space in the European Dead Zone called \"The Farm\", as the main portion of the Tower of the original was destroyed at the start of ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s campaign. However, a lower, undamaged portion of the Tower becomes the main social space post-campaign. Like the original, there are Patrol missions and public events, but emphasis has been placed more on exploration of the worlds, including towns that players can visit and friendly NPCs who can be found in-game and will give side-quests. New missions were added called \"Adventures\", which allow players to explore the area and go on a treasure hunt-like journey to dungeon-like areas. Some Adventures culminate in what is called a Lost Sector, which are somewhat hidden areas in worlds that lead players to a boss that yields rewards upon its defeat. Lost Sectors can be found and accessed without doing an Adventure. Starting with the ''Curse of Osiris'' expansion, Heroic Adventures were added, which are harder versions of Adventures and they rotate each week. A map has also been added to the game, which shows the locations of the NPCs, Adventures, Heroic Adventures, Region Chests, and Lost Sectors. The maps of these new areas are much larger than those in the original ''Destiny'', with one being described as twice as large as any area of the original. Players no longer have to leave a planet and go to orbit to travel to another location; they can now do so immediately from their current in-game location.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\"/><ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> Another new activity has been added called Flashpoints, which is a weekly milestone that takes place on one of the eight locations and rotates each week. Players complete public events, loot Lost Sectors and complete Heroic Adventures to earn high level rewards.<ref name=\"D2Flashpoint\">{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-flashpoints-weekly/|title=Destiny 2 Has A New Weekly Activity Called 'Flashpoints'|date=June 2017|last=Albert|first=Weston|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 8, 2017}}</ref> Similar to the original game, players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions \u2014 Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy. In ''Destiny 2'', however, the factions now compete against each other in the Faction Rally, which is a periodic event that lasts for one week. Faction points are earned by doing various activities. The faction with the most points at the end of the week earns a high level reward for 1,000 Glimmer (in-game currency). The losing factions can also gain the reward, but must pay 50,000 Glimmer for their faction's item.<ref name=\"FactionRally\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/22/destiny-2-bungie-explains-new-faction-rally-event|title=Destiny 2: Bungie Explains New Faction Rally Event|date=September 22, 2017|last=Gilyadov|first=Alex|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOnce a player has completed the main story and has reached the level cap (currently 50), they unlock access to different types of end-game content. These activities include Nightfall strikes (a weekly featured strike with modifiers and high level rewards; as of the ''Forsaken'' expansion, players can choose one of three featured strikes), a strike playlist with modifiers, a Daily Heroic Story playlist, the \"Leviathan\" and \"Last Wish\" raids, the \"Eater of Worlds\" and \"Spire of Stars\" raid lairs, and the \"Escalation Protocol\" and \"Blind Well\" horde activities on Mars and the Dreaming City, respectively, among other PvP activities. A harder difficulty mode called \"Prestige\" is available for the Leviathan raid its raid lairs, with modifiers; there are no plans for a Prestige mode for Last Wish. These end-game activities reward players with powerful gear upon successful completion to increase their Power level.<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/8/16274074/destiny-2-dlc-curse-of-osiris-expansion-leak-mercury</ref>\nIn Destiny 2 Forsaken, they added new special abilities like Daybreak and other abilities.\n\n=== Player versus player (PvP) ===\nLike the original, player versus player combat exists in what is called the Crucible with Lord Shaxx returning as its NPC. The original ''Destiny''{{'}}s Crucible featured six-versus-six and three-versus-three game modes, as well as a limited time two-versus-two mode. At launch, all game modes were four-versus-four as Bungie shifted their focus to smaller teams for competitive multiplayer and better map design, but Quickplay modes eventually became six-versus-six. Like the original, player statistics such as weapon power and defense are balanced between players in Crucible game modes. The in-game [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] was updated so that players can see if an enemy has their super charged or has power ammo. Currently, players have the option to choose between four rotating playlists, rumble (a six player 1v1v1v1v1v1 gamemode) survival and freelance survival (A version of survival where players cannot choose the teammates on their team), classic mix, and private matches.\n\nTrials of Osiris from the original game was replaced by Trials of the Nine. Like Trials of Osiris, Trials of the Nine begins on Fridays and ends with the weekly reset on Tuesdays. The game mode for this new Trials, however, has changed; instead of using the Elimination mode of the original, Trials of the Nine rotates each week between ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s two new game modes, Countdown and Survival. Only one map is featured for Trials' four-day duration, but the map also rotates weekly. Player's gear is locked during Trials, meaning they cannot change it for the duration of a match. Unlike Trials of Osiris, players can gain access to the Trials of the Nine's social space called The Spire, located in unknown space, for completing a match of Trials and earning Trials tokens. There, players will meet an NPC called the Emissary of the Nine, who will exchange tokens for gear. Gaining three, five, and seven wins on the score card, respectively, gains access to the upper tiers of the social space with greater rewards at each tier. Going flawless with seven wins allows admittance into an exclusive area with even greater rewards. Three losses resets the score card. To access Trials of the Nine, players must have completed the campaign, completed Lord Shaxx's \"Call to Arms\" milestone, and have a Power level of at least 260.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-trials-of-the-nine-mode-date/|title=Destiny 2 Details Trials of the Nine Debut [UPDATED]|date=September 8, 2017|last=Albert|first=Weston|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-what-is-trials-of-the-nine-how-to-get-st/1100-6453377/|title=Destiny 2: What Is Trials Of The Nine? How To Get Started|date=September 15, 2017|last=Pereira|first=Chris|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref> Trials of the nine has been put on permanent hiatus, but a new trials game mode has been speculated heavily. Recently on 2/26/20 Bungie released the reveal trailer for the next season (season of the worthy) as well as revealing that trials of osiris will be returning as a part of this dlc. It has been confirmed that Trials of Osiris will be released on 3/13/20. However, instead of the usual 9 wins without losing to go flawless, the new gamemode will only require 7 wins.\n\nThe periodic competitive Iron Banner PvP mode of the original game, which disabled balancing of player's gear, also returned for the sequel. ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s Iron Banner, however, does not disable balancing, with Bungie stating that \"Your fighting abilities, not your power levels, will decide the outcome\". This was changed following the release of ''Forsaken'', with balancing becoming disabled like the original game. Like the original, Iron Banner lasts for one week and features milestones to complete daily. Players must have completed the campaign and be level 20 to access Iron Banner, which features the returning Lord Saladin from the original game as its NPC.<ref name=\"D2IronBanner\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-iron-banner-gear-rewards-when-it-starts-/1100-6453830/|title=Destiny 2: Iron Banner Gear Rewards, When It Starts, What's New, And How To Access It|date=October 7, 2017|last1=Pereira|first1=Chris|last2=Makuch|first2=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA new PvP mode that was added in the ''Forsaken'' expansion is called Gambit, a best-of-three rounds mode that combines both PvE and PvP, featuring the Drifter as its NPC. A 24-hour free trial of the mode was made available to all players on September 1, 2018, three days prior to the launch of ''Forsaken''. Two teams of four players compete against each other by defeating PvE enemies. Enemies, when defeated, drop motes which players can pick up and deposit in a bank in the center of the arena. Depositing 5, 10 or 15 motes send small, medium or large enemy blockers, respectively, to the opposing team's arena and locks their bank; the opposing team must defeat the blockers in order to reactivate their bank. Every 25 motes deposited opens a portal where one team member can invade the other team's arena. Defeating members of the opposing team drops any motes that they are carrying. After depositing a certain amount of motes, a boss will spawn in the middle of the arena; if a team member is defeated by an invading member of the opposing team, the boss regains health. The first team that defeats their boss wins the round.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{see|Destiny (video game)#Setting}}\nOne year after the [[Destiny: Rise of Iron#Plot|SIVA Crisis]], Cabal forces of the Red Legion launch an aerial assault on the Last City, destroying the main portion of the Tower, the headquarters of the Guardians. The player's Guardian and their Ghost respond by assisting the Vanguard in assaulting the Red Legion command ship. As they confront the Red Legion's commander, Dominus Ghaul, his forces attach a device to the Traveler and begin draining it of the Light, the power used by the Guardians. The Guardian loses their powers and is nearly killed by Ghaul. Waking two days after the attack, the Guardian locates their Ghost. They find a haven known as \"the Farm\" in the European Dead Zone (EDZ) with the assistance of Suraya Hawthorne, a non-Guardian human from the outskirts of the Last City.\n\nThe Guardian follows a vision to encounter a shard of the Traveler hidden in a forest within the EDZ. Ghost interfaces with the shard and both its and the Guardian's Light are restored. After restoring long range communications, Hawthorne intercepts a distress call from Commander Zavala, urging surviving Guardians to travel to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and assist in mounting a counter-offensive. Against Hawthorne's objections, the Guardian travels to Titan, which has been overrun by the Hive. With assistance from Deputy Commander Sloane, they learn that the Red Legion was dispatched to the [[Milky Way]] in response to a distress call sent during the [[Destiny: The Taken King#Plot|Taken War]] two years prior, and that Ghaul possesses a superweapon known as the Almighty, a space station capable of destroying stars. Resistance to Cabal rule has resulted in entire star systems being destroyed. The intelligence also reveals that the Almighty is positioned near the Sun, breaking up the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as fuel. Zavala tasks the Guardian to find Ikora Rey and Cayde-6 to assist in a counterattack to retake the Last City. During this time, it is shown that Ghaul, aided by his mentor, the Consul, overthrew Emperor Calus and took control of the Cabal, and has been studying the Traveler in order to learn how to use the Light and legitimize himself as Emperor.\n\nThe Guardian locates Cayde-6 on the centaur planet [[7066 Nessus|Nessus]], which has almost been completely transformed by the Vex. With the aid of Failsafe, an AI from the crashed starship ''Exodus Black'', the Guardian frees Cayde from a Vex portal loop, and claims a teleporter for use in taking back the City. Cayde directs the Guardian to find Ikora on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] moon of [[Io (moon)|Io]], where she had gone to find answers about the Traveler. Ikora and Io researcher Asher Mir directs the Guardian to locate a Warmind, an ancient defensive AI for intelligence on the Almighty. Afterwards, the Vanguard reunites at the Farm and conclude that the only way to retake the Last City and save the Traveler is to shut down the Almighty first, eliminating the possibility of it destroying the Sun. The Guardian boards the Almighty and destroys the weapon, signaling Zavala to begin the counterattack. As the Vanguard begins the assault, the Consul admonishes Ghaul for his obsession with the Traveler, and urges him to take the Light; Ghaul is reluctant until the Consul kills the Speaker, whom Ghaul had captured and tortured to try and learn more about the Traveler. Ghaul then proclaims that he will take the Light, and strangles the Consul in a fit of rage.\n\nThe Guardian returns to Earth to assist in the counterattack and infiltrates Ghaul's command ship alone to save the Traveler. Ghaul forcibly takes the Light, corrupting it, and uses its power against the Guardian, but the Guardian is successful in defeating Ghaul. Ghaul reemerges as a massive ethereal figure who then speaks to the Traveler directly. In doing so, the Traveler wakes from its long sleep, destroying the device that was harvesting its power and killing Ghaul. It sends a massive shockwave, restoring the Light and decimating the Red Legion's forces. The game ends with a posthumous voiceover from the Speaker, reminding all that the Light can never be stopped. The Guardian and Ghost convene with Zavala, Ikora, Cayde, and Hawthorne at an undamaged portion of the Tower, with the Vanguard returning to their old duties and Hawthorne assuming a new post there. In a post-credits scene, the shockwave sent by the Traveler is shown reaching the entire system. The wave of Light extends beyond the Solar System and spreads beyond the Milky Way, before panning across a fleet of dark, unknown ships sitting some distance away in extragalactic space.\n\nFollowing Ghaul's defeat, a massive Cabal ship called the Leviathan appears in orbit of Nessus, under the control of the exiled Emperor Calus. Calus invites Guardians to complete a series of challenges before reaching his throne (\"Leviathan\" raid). A fireteam of Guardians complete his challenges before facing Calus himself; however, after overcoming his strange powers and defeating him, they discover that they were fighting a mechanical doppelganger. The real Calus speaks through the machine, claiming that what they know is a lie and that there is a truth beyond what the Speaker had told them.\n\n== Development ==\nA sequel to ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' was first mentioned in November 2014, two months after the original released, by [[Activision]] [[chief executive officer]] Eric Hirshberg, where he said \"Work has also begun on future expansion packs as well as on our next full game release\".<ref>{{cite web| last = Thier| first = Dave | title = 'Destiny' Sequel Already In The Works| work = [[Forbes]]| date = November 4, 2014| url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2014/11/04/destiny-sequel-already-in-the-works/| accessdate = January 25, 2015}}</ref> Based on documents of the original release schedule for ''Destiny'', Bungie and Activision intended to release new, disc-based sequels every other year until 2019, with large downloadable expansions in between.<ref name=\"originalreleaseschedule\"/> Originally planned for a September 2016 release (based on the original documents),<ref name=\"originalreleaseschedule\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-not-launching-september-2016-report-says/1100-6434074/|title=Destiny 2 Not Launching September 2016, Report Says|date=January 22, 2016|last=Hussain|first=Tamoor|magazine=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}</ref> Bungie confirmed on February 11, 2016 that a full sequel would release in 2017.<ref name=\"glimpse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bungie.net/en/News/News?aid=44353|title=This Week At Bungie \u2013 02/11/2016|date=February 11, 2016|author=DeeJ|publisher=[[Bungie]]|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"IGNY2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/11/destiny-2-in-2017-large-new-expansion-coming-2016|title=Destiny 2 in 2017, 'Large New Expansion' Coming to Destiny 2016|date=February 11, 2016|last=Dyer|first=Mitch|website=IGN|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref> That same month, video game writer Christopher Schlerf, who was the lead writer for ''[[Halo 4]]'' and worked on ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', joined Bungie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/destinys-new-writer-proves-bungie-finally-taking-its-story-seriously/ |title=Destiny's new writer proves Bungie is finally taking its story seriously|date=February 16, 2016|last=Skrebels|first=Joe|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> In December 2016, Bungie announced that [[Vicarious Visions]] would be joining the development team along with Activision.<ref>{{cite web| last = McWertor| first =Michael| title = Destiny development team expands with Vicarious Visions| work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]| publisher = [[Vox Media]]| date = December 8, 2016| url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/8/13888632/destiny-development-team-vicarious-visions | accessdate = December 11, 2016}}</ref> Unlike the original, it was rumored that ''Destiny 2'' would also release on [[Microsoft Windows]],<ref name=\"Destiny22017\"/> which was confirmed on March 30, 2017.<ref name=\"release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/30/15125010/destiny-2-trailer-release-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc|title=Destiny 2 launching Sept. 8, watch the reveal trailer|date=March 30, 2017|last=Sarkar|first=Samit|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Activision's earnings report for 2016, Hirshberg said that ''Destiny''{{'}}s sequel was still \"on track for release this fall [2017].\" Activision said the sequel would \"broaden the franchise's global reach.\" Hirshberg elaborated that players who had spent hours in the original would \"love\" the sequel, and for those who had not played ''Destiny'', or had not played in a while, {{quote|... we think we've made a sequel that's going to have a lot for them to love, too.

To detail the lore of the universe in ''Destiny 2'', there are many artifacts around the maps that can be scanned by Ghost, who will give details and backstory. Exotic gear and some legendary gear also have a lore tab.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> At the [[E3 2017|2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), a new cinematic trailer was shown, narrated by the main antagonist, Dominus Ghaul.

Bungie's aim was to have the game able to be played by anyone with their friends, regardless of platform, so they implemented cross-saving, allowing players to transfer their characters from one platform to another. Alongside this, they partnered with [[Google]] to offer ''Destiny 2'' on [[Google Stadia|Stadia]], a new game streaming service.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/6/18655373/destiny-2-google-stadia-cross-save-transfer-xbox-one-pc | title=  Destiny 2 coming to Google Stadia with character transfers from other platforms  | first=  Michael | last= McWhertor | date = June 6, 2019 | accessdate = June 6, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Additionally, alongside the release of ''Shadowkeep'', Bungie made ''Destiny 2'' [[free to play]] in its \"New Light\" version, making the base game, the Leviathan raid, and many of the player-versus-player modes free, including the first two expansions, ''Curse of Osiris'' and ''Warmind''.

One of the team's remedies for this were the Adventures and Lost Sectors activities that were added to the free roam Patrol mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-post-launch-plans/|title=Destiny 2 Devs Talk Post-Release Content Plans|date=June 2017|last=Henry|first=Jasmine|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Bungie also announced the ''Destiny 2'' Expansion Pass prior to launch, which grants access to the first two expansions of the game.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> The in-game clan features became available a few days after the game's launch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-clan-features-wont-work-in-game-for-sev/1100-6453128/|title=Destiny 2's Clan Features Won't Work In-Game For \"Several Days\" After Launch|date=September 7, 2017|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}</ref> The Guided Games feature became available on September 12 for the Nightfall activity, the game's first raid, \"Leviathan\", unlocked on September 13 (with the Guided Games in beta), and Trials of the Nine became available on September 15, along with the character X\u00fbr from the original game, the exotic items vendor who only appears on the weekends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-release-date-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-raid-an/1100-6453052/|title=Destiny 2 Release Date On PS4 And Xbox One, Raid And Nightfall Debuts Confirmed|date=September 6, 2017|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}</ref> The three factions and their respective NPCs from the original game returned on September 26 for a new periodic event, Faction Rally.<ref name=\"FactionRally\"/> The competitive Iron Banner PvP mode from the original returned on October 10.<ref name=\"D2IronBanner\"/> The prestige mode for the Leviathan raid was originally scheduled to unlock on October 10, but was delayed to October 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-prestige-raid-for-leviathan-unlocks-nex/1100-6453827/|title=Destiny 2's Prestige Raid For Leviathan Unlocks Next Week|date=October 7, 2017|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe game's first expansion released on December 5, 2017.

The expansion takes players to the planet Mercury with its own patrol mode. Additionally, the EXP level cap was raised to 25 and the Power level cap was raised to 330. There was also a timed-exclusive Crucible map for PS4 players called Wormhaven. Instead of an entirely new raid, a feature called raid lair was added, featuring new areas to the existing Leviathan raid and a different final boss.<ref name=\"ExpansionI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-curse-of-osiris-dlc-increases-the-level-/1100-6454529/|title=Destiny 2 Curse Of Osiris DLC Increases The Level Cap|date=October 31, 2017|last=Pereira|first=Chris|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref> The second expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Warmind|Warmind]]'', was released on May 8, 2018 and focuses on the Warmind Rasputin from the original game. This expansion takes players to the planet Mars in a new area called [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas Basin]]. The expansion also features a new mode called \"Escalation Protocol\", a horde mode which can be started by any player in the patrol mode on Mars. As well, the EXP level cap was raised to 30 and the Power level cap was raised to 380. In addition to Rasputin, a new character named Ana Bray (also from the lore of the original ''Destiny'') was added, who serves as the primary NPC on Mars. Like the previous expansion, ''Warmind'' also includes a second raid lair on the Leviathan. The expansion also added progressive ranking systems for PvP, titled Valor and Glory. Players earn Valor in quickplay matches while Glory is earned in competitive matches, with each new rank earning greater rewards. Valor points are earned regardless of win or loss, while Glory points are earned by wins but reduced by losses.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> Both expansions featured timed-exclusive content for the PlayStation 4 platform, which became available for other platforms in late 2019.\n\nThe game saw many seasonal events during its first year of service, which were free to all players regardless of which version of the game they owned. \"The Dawning\" holiday event from the original ''Destiny'' returned on December 19, 2017 and ended on January 9, 2018. Both social spaces were redecorated for the event along with snow weather. Players could create snowballs in the social spaces and during strikes and throw these at other players or enemies (which damaged enemies). The Crucible game mode \"Mayhem\" (all abilities restore rapidly) was also brought back from the original ''Destiny''. New Milestones with event-themed rewards were also added.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-holiday-event-is-now-playable-on-ps4-xb/1100-6455748/|title=Destiny 2's Holiday Event Is Now Playable On PS4, Xbox One, And PC|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=December 19, 2017|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> \"Crimson Days\", the [[Valentine's Day]]-themed event from Year 2 (2016) of the original ''Destiny'', returned for ''Destiny 2'' on February 13, 2018, and like the original, it ran for only one week. Just as in the original event, Crimson Days featured a 2-versus-2 Crucible mode\u2013the only in ''Destiny 2''\u2013however, the mode was modified from the original. Staying close to a teammate caused all abilities to recharge quicker, while being apart gave away both players' locations to the opposing team. Players could earn Crimson Engrams, granting new rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-crimson-days-launches-with-new-update-on/1100-6456750/|title=Destiny 2 Crimson Days Launches With New Update On PC, PS4, And Xbox One|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=February 13, 2018|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=February 13, 2018}}</ref> Crimson Days was later rebranded into a separate but permanent mode called \"Doubles\" as a rotating mode in the Crucible. A brand new summer event called \"Solstice of Heroes\" began on July 31, 2018 and ended on August 28, 2018, to commemorate the first year of the game. The Power level cap was raised to 400 for the event. A new NPC called the Statue of Heroes was added and provided bounties that, when turned in, awarded Moments of Triumph points for players which could be used to earn exclusive rewards. Players received \"Scorched\" armor pieces at Power level 240 at the start of the event, which could then be upgraded to \"Rekindled\" armor at Power level 340, then to \"Resplendent\" armor at Power level 400, all by completing specific requirements for each armor piece, including playing through 5 revamped (Redux) missions from the original ''Destiny 2'' campaign. Players could also earn Solstice Engrams, which also granted new rewards.\n\nThe third expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Forsaken|Forsaken]]'', was released on September 4, 2018, beginning Year 2 of ''Destiny 2''. Similar to the original [[Destiny: The Taken King|''Destiny''{{'}}s ''The Taken King'']] expansion, ''Forsaken'' had a large overhaul on gameplay, though not to the extent that ''The Taken King'' had with the original ''Destiny''. A large expansion, the story has a \"western revenge\" theme, according to Bungie. A large portion of the expansion takes place in the Reef's Tangled Shore, including a new raid called \"Last Wish\", which takes place in the end-game area, the Dreaming City, also located in the Reef. The developers claimed that it has more bosses than any previous raid (including from the original game) with a massive roam area, puzzles, and the raid changes over time based on players' actions in the raid itself. There is also a new mode called Gambit that combines PvE and PvP, and features its own ranking system called Infamy, which works similar to the Crucible's Valor ranking system. Two teams of four players compete against each other while facing PvE enemies. A new weapon type, a bow and arrow, was also added. The EXP level cap was raised to 50 and the Power level cap was raised to 600.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-forsaken-dlc-release-date-new-mode-trail/1100-6459402/|title=Destiny 2 Forsaken DLC Release Date, New Mode, Trailer, And More Details|date=June 6, 2018|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> A trailer displayed during Sony's E3 2018 press conference showed the death of Cayde-6 by the hands of the returning Prince Uldren Sov.

Although he said the variety of weapons were fun, the Kinetic weapons \"didn't seem to pack as much of a punch as their Energy [weapon] counterparts.\"<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Cody Perez of ''[[Game Revolution]]'', however, welcomed the recategorized weapons, saying they were less restrictive and said that \"Bungie are masters of gun-play\".<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Kallie Plagge of [[GameSpot]] said that the game features mostly the same structure as the original, including its \"mechanically excellent shooting and satisfying loot grind\".<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/> Carter praised the Lost Sectors and public events, as well as the additional story quests and Adventures post-campaign.<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Miller said that the Lost Sectors were fun, but they became less interesting with the more that were done.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Perez, however, was not a fan of the Adventures and Lost Sectors activities, saying they were a \"disconnect [from] the main campaign\". He said that they were filler content, and that they were \"monotonous and a bore to accomplish, lacking the heart that fills the campaign.\" He did praise the public events as they are only periodic.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/>\n\nThe Leviathan raid received praise and criticism. Miller of ''Game Informer'' stated that the Leviathan raid was \"one of Bungie's most intricate and fascinating environments to date\", praising its maze-like structure with hidden chests and secret passages. He was critical of the award system, however, stating that it \"separates the excitement of new gear from the moment of victory\", as it does not offer most loot until a full completion.<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Slead of ''EGM'' said that \"the bread and butter of ''Destiny'' is still these post-campaign quests\", also referring to Strikes and the weekly Nightfall activity.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'', who did not play any of the original game's raids, was a big fan of the Leviathan raid, stating that it exceeded its hype.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/348153-destiny-2-leviathan-raid-review-exceeds-hype|title=Destiny 2's Leviathan Raid Exceeds the Hype|date=September 13, 2017|last=Perez|first=Cody|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> Plagge of GameSpot said that \"solving [the raid's] often obscure puzzles can be both rewarding and frustrating\", but \"each failure teaches you something new\".<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/>\n\nThe original ''Destiny'' was largely criticized for its story. ''Destiny 2'', however, was praised for its improvements to the story and easier access to the universe's lore. Slead of ''EGM'' said that it has a \"more robust story\" and Bungie fixed the \"meandering storytelling from the first\".<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Carter of ''Destructoid'' said that although its story was similar to others in the same genre, \"it's easy to follow and even easier to get invested in, with the game's cast coming front and center.\"<ref name=\"DestructoidReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'' said that the story \"[gripped] me in a way that only Bungie's former series ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' was able to.\" He said that there were many moments that were of shock and awe, and that the game had a meaningful narrative with an actual fleshed out villain.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Plagge of GameSpot said that the story serves its main purpose and that its strength \"lie in atmosphere and side details\", while also praising its \"mournful soundtrack\" as fantastic.<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/>\n\nMiller of ''Game Informer'' praised the Crucible mode for feeling more competitive than the original ''Destiny''{{'}}s, with teamwork being \"highly valued\". However, Miller was \"perplexed by the decision to force players into one of two playlists\", instead of letting them choose. He was also indifferent to the change of making all modes four-versus-four, but said that \"the compact group size demands everyone pull their weight, which is great.\"<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'' was disappointed that Crucible did not receive \"the same love that the singleplayer had been given.\" He said that although the smaller map sizes were not a bad thing, it causes multiplayer to be non-stop action, not allowing players to take a moment to strategize.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> David Houghton of ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' said that the changes to the Crucible mode \"shine in a tight, focused, clear, and tactically co-operative format.\"<ref name=\"GRadarReview\"/>\n\nFor the 2017 [[Game Critics Awards]], it was awarded Best PC Game for E3 2017.<ref

It was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on September 6, 2017, followed by a [[Microsoft Windows]] version the following month.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.glixel.com/news/bungie-embraces-pc-with-destiny-2-w483017|title=Bungie Embraces PC With 'Destiny 2'|last=Weber|first=Rachel|date=May 18, 2017|work=Glixel|access-date=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Schreier|first1=Jason|title=Destiny 2 Officially Revealed, Confirmed For PC|date=March 30, 2017|url=http://kotaku.com/destiny-2-officially-revealed-confirmed-for-pc-1793838721|website=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> The game was published by [[Activision]] until December 31 2018 <ref>https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/718877/000071887719000015/atvi-6302019x10xq.htm</ref>, when Bungie acquired the publishing rights to the franchise. It is the sequel to 2014's ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' and its [[Destiny post-release content|subsequent expansions]]. Set in a \"[[science fantasy|mythic science fiction]]\" world, the game features a multiplayer \"shared-world\" environment with elements of [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] games. Like the original, activities in ''Destiny 2'' are divided among [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \"[[Dungeon crawl|strikes]]\" and six-player [[Raid (gaming)|raids]]. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events as well as new activities not featured in the original. These new activities have an emphasis on exploration of the planets and interactions with [[non-player characters]] (NPCs); the original ''Destiny'' only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional [[deathmatch]] game modes.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the Last City from different alien races. One of these races, the Cabal, led by the warlord Dominus Ghaul, assault the Last City and strip all Guardians of their Light. The player sets out on a journey to regain their Light and find a way to defeat Ghaul and his Red Legion army and take back the Last City. Like the original ''Destiny'', the game features [[expansion packs]] which further the story and adds new content and missions. Year One of ''Destiny 2'' featured two small expansions, ''[[Destiny 2: Curse of Osiris|Curse of Osiris]]'' in December 2017 and ''[[Destiny 2: Warmind|Warmind]]'' in May 2018. A third, large expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Forsaken|Forsaken]]'', was released in September 2018, beginning Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into ''Destiny 2: Forsaken Legendary Collection''. An [[Destiny 2 post-release content#Annual Pass|annual pass]] was also available alongside this release, containing three premium content drops for Year Two. Year Three began with the large expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Shadowkeep|Shadowkeep]]'' in October 2019. It is a standalone release, not requiring the previous expansions to play. Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of ''Destiny 2'' called \"New Light\", a [[free-to-play]] re-release of ''Destiny 2'' and the first two expansions.\n\nUpon release, ''Destiny 2'' received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game received praise for its many improvements over its predecessor. The original ''Destiny'' received much criticism for its story, but ''Destiny 2'' was praised as having a \"more robust story\" and an actual fleshed out villain.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/><ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> As with the original, gameplay for the most part was also highly praised. Reviews were split on the recategorization of the weapons and the newer activities like the Adventures and Lost Sectors, but praise was unanimous on the exploration of the game world. Changes to PvP were welcomed by some reviewers, though others were critical for the mode lacking player choice. ''Destiny 2'' was nominated for and won various awards, such as at [[The Game Awards 2017]] and [[Game Critics Awards]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Destiny 2 gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|''Destiny 2'' allows players, known in the game as guardians, to utilize weaponry and special powers alongside other guardians. Here a guardian defends against enemies while another guardian uses their powers to cast a shield made of void energy.]]\n{{see also|Destiny (video game)#Gameplay}}\nSimilar to its predecessor, ''Destiny 2'' is a [[first-person shooter]] game that incorporates [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] and [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMO) elements.<ref name=\"Kotaku Destiny Reveal\">{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Bungie Reveals its Destiny in This Documentary|url=http://kotaku.com/5984863/bungie-reveals-its-destiny-in-this-documentary|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}</ref> The original ''Destiny'' includes on-the-fly [[Matchmaking (video games)|matchmaking]] that allowed players to communicate only with other players with whom they were \"matched\" by the game. To communicate with other players in the game world, players had to use their respective console's messaging system.<ref name=\"Kotaku Destiny Reveal\"/> ''Destiny 2'' features a more optimal way of matchmaking called \"Guided Games\", which allows players to search for [[Video gaming clan|clans]] who may need additional players for activities, such as [[Dungeon crawl|strikes]] or [[raid (gaming)|raids]]. Like the original, activities in ''Destiny 2'' are divided among [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) game types.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6449086/|title=Destiny 2: Everything We Know So Far|date=May 17, 2017|last1=Espineli|first1=Matt|last2=Plagge|first2=Kallie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Character progression and classes ===\n{{see|Destiny (video game)#Character progression and classes}}\nAs in the original game, players are able to improve their characters, referred to as Guardians, by gaining [[experience point]]s (EXP) \u2014 when a set number of experience points are accumulated, the player's character will \"level up\" and gain improved [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] which further enhance performance in battle. [[Quest (video gaming)|Milestones]], including the \"main scenario\" milestones, are specific tasks given to the player by [[non-player characters]] (NPCs) which reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario milestones progresses the overarching plot of the game.\n\n''Destiny 2'' features the same three character classes as the original ''Destiny''. Each class has their own specific upgrades, perks, special abilities, and three sub-classes that allow players to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style. The three classes are Warlock, Hunter, and Titan. After choosing a class, players select one of three species for their character: Human, Awoken (bluish-gray-skinned descendants of Humans), or Exo (humanoid machines). They can then customize their character, such as changing its gender or skin color. A character's species is cosmetic and does not affect gameplay. Players can create two more characters to have a character of each class.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\"/><ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-26-destiny-2-classes-subclasses-titan-hunter-warlock-4747|title=Destiny 2 classes and subclasses - all new Titan, Hunter, and Warlock skills and supers explained|date=May 26, 2017|last=Tapsell|first=Chris|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n*Hunters continue to have access to the Solar-based \"Gunslinger\" sub-class from the original game and the Void-based \"Nightstalker\" sub-class from the original's ''[[Destiny: The Taken King|The Taken King]]'' expansion, both with gameplay changes. The Hunter's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Arc-based \"Arcstrider\", replacing the \"Bladedancer\" sub-class of the original. Arcstrider's super, \"Arc Staff\", focuses on an electrified staff and a large amount of rapid mobility.<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' adds three new supers for each of the Hunter sub-classes: \"Blade Barrage\" for Gunslingers, focusing on throwing a volley of flaming knives; \"Spectral Blades\" for Nightstalkers, allowing players to see through walls and attack with Void daggers; and \"Whirling Guard\" for Arcstriders, which allows players to block projectiles by spinning their Arc Staff.\n*Warlocks continue to have access to the Void-based \"Voidwalker\" sub-class from the original game and the Arc-based \"Stormcaller\" sub-class from the original's ''The Taken King'' expansion, both with several changes. The Warlock's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Solar-based \"Dawnblade\" with a super called \"Daybreak\", replacing the \"Sunsinger\" sub-class of the original. The Daybreak super allows the player to make Solar Light blades to strike enemies from mid-air.<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' gives Warlocks three new supers: \"Nova Warp\" for Voidwalkers, allowing players to warp around the battlefield and unleash a Void explosion; \"Chaos Reach\" for Stormcallers, which unleashes a beam of Arc energy which can be turned off at any time to conserve Super energy; and \"Well of Radiance\" for Dawnblades, allowing players to create a healing and empowering aura for players to stand in.\n*Titans continue to have access to the Arc-based \"Striker\" sub-class from the original game and the Solar-based \"Sunbreaker\" from the original's ''The Taken King'' expansion, both with significant gameplay changes. The Titan's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Void-based \"Sentinel\", replacing the \"Defender\" sub-class of the original, although the Sentinel sub-class can create the Defender's Ward of Dawn shielding bubble if this option is selected. Sentinel's super, \"Sentinel Shield\", allows the player to summon a shield that can block enemy fire and be used offensively (similar to [[Captain America's shield]]).<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' added three new supers for Titans: \"Thundercrash\" for Strikers, allowing players to launch into the air and slam onto the ground; \"Burning Maul\" for Sunbreakers, which players wield a large hammer than can unleash flaming tornadoes; and \"Banner Shield\" for Sentinels, which unleashes a protective barrier that allows other players to shoot through.\n\nUpon reaching the character EXP level cap (level 20 at launch, expanded to 50), character progression shifts to improving their \"Power\" level (formerly \"Light\" level) by acquiring new and better equipment. This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources, including \"[[Dungeon crawl|strikes]]\", [[raid (gaming)|raids]], and in-game events. The three weapon classes and five pieces of armor each have a Power level; a character's Power level is the average of that gear. A higher character level allows for better equipment with higher Power levels to be equipped. A higher Power level improves damage output and defense. The highest obtainable Power level at launch was 305 and is expanded to 600. Weapons and armor were reorganized in ''Destiny 2''. In the original game, weapons were divided as Primary, Special, and Heavy weapons. At launch, the weapons were categorized as Kinetic, Energy, and Power weapons. Primary weapons and some Special weapons in the original \u2013 such as hand cannons and sidearms \u2013 are classified as Kinetic and Energy weapons. Those without an elemental damage type go in the Kinetic weapons slot while those with an elemental damage type (Arc, Solar, or Void) go in the Energy weapons slot. Power weapons include the Heavy weapons and the more powerful Special weapons from the first game, such as shotguns and sniper rifles, as well as new weapon types, such as the grenade launcher. As of ''Forsaken'', the weapons system was overhauled, with many Power weapons, such as most shotguns, single-shot grenade launchers, and most sniper rifles, being reorganized into Kinetic and Energy weapons slots. With armor, the name of the stats have been changed. Instead of Strength, Intellect, and Discipline, there are stats for Resilience, Recovery, and Mobility. Also for armor, the helmet, gauntlets, chest, legs, and class item slots have remained unchanged, but the artifacts slot has been replaced with one for a player's clan banners.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-09-destiny-2-gameplay-beta-features-4747|title=Destiny 2 gameplay changes, beta, release date and everything else we know so far|date=June 9, 2017|last=Reynolds|first=Matthew|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Player versus environment (PvE) ===\nLike the original game, player versus environment game types make up the majority of the game. Areas to explore include [[Earth]]'s European Dead Zone (which was only represented by PvP maps in the original), [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur planet]] [[7066 Nessus|Nessus]]. The ''Curse of Osiris'' expansion adds [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as an explorable area, while the ''Warmind'' expansion adds [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]]. ''Forsaken'' adds two new explorable areas in the Reef: the Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City, the latter being the mysterious sanctuary of the Awoken race and an end-game area that is accessible after completing the campaign of ''Forsaken''. The newest expansion, Shadowkeep, adds the Moon as a playable area. There is also a new social space in the European Dead Zone called \"The Farm\", as the main portion of the Tower of the original was destroyed at the start of ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s campaign. However, a lower, undamaged portion of the Tower becomes the main social space post-campaign. Like the original, there are Patrol missions and public events, but emphasis has been placed more on exploration of the worlds, including towns that players can visit and friendly NPCs who can be found in-game and will give side-quests. New missions were added called \"Adventures\", which allow players to explore the area and go on a treasure hunt-like journey to dungeon-like areas. Some Adventures culminate in what is called a Lost Sector, which are somewhat hidden areas in worlds that lead players to a boss that yields rewards upon its defeat. Lost Sectors can be found and accessed without doing an Adventure. Starting with the ''Curse of Osiris'' expansion, Heroic Adventures were added, which are harder versions of Adventures and they rotate each week. A map has also been added to the game, which shows the locations of the NPCs, Adventures, Heroic Adventures, Region Chests, and Lost Sectors. The maps of these new areas are much larger than those in the original ''Destiny'', with one being described as twice as large as any area of the original. Players no longer have to leave a planet and go to orbit to travel to another location; they can now do so immediately from their current in-game location.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\"/><ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> Another new activity has been added called Flashpoints, which is a weekly milestone that takes place on one of the eight locations and rotates each week. Players complete public events, loot Lost Sectors and complete Heroic Adventures to earn high level rewards.<ref name=\"D2Flashpoint\">{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-flashpoints-weekly/|title=Destiny 2 Has A New Weekly Activity Called 'Flashpoints'|date=June 2017|last=Albert|first=Weston|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 8, 2017}}</ref> Similar to the original game, players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions \u2014 Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy. In ''Destiny 2'', however, the factions now compete against each other in the Faction Rally, which is a periodic event that lasts for one week. Faction points are earned by doing various activities. The faction with the most points at the end of the week earns a high level reward for 1,000 Glimmer (in-game currency). The losing factions can also gain the reward, but must pay 50,000 Glimmer for their faction's item.<ref name=\"FactionRally\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/22/destiny-2-bungie-explains-new-faction-rally-event|title=Destiny 2: Bungie Explains New Faction Rally Event|date=September 22, 2017|last=Gilyadov|first=Alex|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOnce a player has completed the main story and has reached the level cap (currently 50), they unlock access to different types of end-game content. These activities include Nightfall strikes (a weekly featured strike with modifiers and high level rewards; as of the ''Forsaken'' expansion, players can choose one of three featured strikes), a strike playlist with modifiers, a Daily Heroic Story playlist, the \"Leviathan\" and \"Last Wish\" raids, the \"Eater of Worlds\" and \"Spire of Stars\" raid lairs, and the \"Escalation Protocol\" and \"Blind Well\" horde activities on Mars and the Dreaming City, respectively, among other PvP activities. A harder difficulty mode called \"Prestige\" is available for the Leviathan raid its raid lairs, with modifiers; there are no plans for a Prestige mode for Last Wish. These end-game activities reward players with powerful gear upon successful completion to increase their Power level.<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/8/16274074/destiny-2-dlc-curse-of-osiris-expansion-leak-mercury</ref>\nIn Destiny 2 Forsaken, they added new special abilities like Daybreak and other abilities.\n\n=== Player versus player (PvP) ===\nLike the original, player versus player combat exists in what is called the Crucible with Lord Shaxx returning as its NPC. The original ''Destiny''{{'}}s Crucible featured six-versus-six and three-versus-three game modes, as well as a limited time two-versus-two mode. At launch, all game modes were four-versus-four as Bungie shifted their focus to smaller teams for competitive multiplayer and better map design, but Quickplay modes eventually became six-versus-six. Like the original, player statistics such as weapon power and defense are balanced between players in Crucible game modes. The in-game [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] was updated so that players can see if an enemy has their super charged or has power ammo. Currently, players have the option to choose between four rotating playlists, rumble (a six player 1v1v1v1v1v1 gamemode) survival and freelance survival (A version of survival where players cannot choose the teammates on their team), classic mix, and private matches.\n\nTrials of Osiris from the original game was replaced by Trials of the Nine. Like Trials of Osiris, Trials of the Nine begins on Fridays and ends with the weekly reset on Tuesdays. The game mode for this new Trials, however, has changed; instead of using the Elimination mode of the original, Trials of the Nine rotates each week between ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s two new game modes, Countdown and Survival. Only one map is featured for Trials' four-day duration, but the map also rotates weekly. Player's gear is locked during Trials, meaning they cannot change it for the duration of a match. Unlike Trials of Osiris, players can gain access to the Trials of the Nine's social space called The Spire, located in unknown space, for completing a match of Trials and earning Trials tokens. There, players will meet an NPC called the Emissary of the Nine, who will exchange tokens for gear. Gaining three, five, and seven wins on the score card, respectively, gains access to the upper tiers of the social space with greater rewards at each tier. Going flawless with seven wins allows admittance into an exclusive area with even greater rewards. Three losses resets the score card. To access Trials of the Nine, players must have completed the campaign, completed Lord Shaxx's \"Call to Arms\" milestone, and have a Power level of at least 260.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-trials-of-the-nine-mode-date/|title=Destiny 2 Details Trials of the Nine Debut [UPDATED]|date=September 8, 2017|last=Albert|first=Weston|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-what-is-trials-of-the-nine-how-to-get-st/1100-6453377/|title=Destiny 2: What Is Trials Of The Nine? How To Get Started|date=September 15, 2017|last=Pereira|first=Chris|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref> Trials of the nine has been put on permanent hiatus, but a new trials game mode has been speculated heavily. Recently on 2/26/20 Bungie released the reveal trailer for the next season (season of the worthy) as well as revealing that trials of osiris will be returning as a part of this dlc. It has been confirmed that Trials of Osiris will be released on 3/13/20. However, instead of the usual 9 wins without losing to go flawless, the new gamemode will only require 7 wins.\n\nThe periodic competitive Iron Banner PvP mode of the original game, which disabled balancing of player's gear, also returned for the sequel. ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s Iron Banner, however, does not disable balancing, with Bungie stating that \"Your fighting abilities, not your power levels, will decide the outcome\". This was changed following the release of ''Forsaken'', with balancing becoming disabled like the original game. Like the original, Iron Banner lasts for one week and features milestones to complete daily. Players must have completed the campaign and be level 20 to access Iron Banner, which features the returning Lord Saladin from the original game as its NPC.<ref name=\"D2IronBanner\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-iron-banner-gear-rewards-when-it-starts-/1100-6453830/|title=Destiny 2: Iron Banner Gear Rewards, When It Starts, What's New, And How To Access It|date=October 7, 2017|last1=Pereira|first1=Chris|last2=Makuch|first2=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA new PvP mode that was added in the ''Forsaken'' expansion is called Gambit, a best-of-three rounds mode that combines both PvE and PvP, featuring the Drifter as its NPC. A 24-hour free trial of the mode was made available to all players on September 1, 2018, three days prior to the launch of ''Forsaken''. Two teams of four players compete against each other by defeating PvE enemies. Enemies, when defeated, drop motes which players can pick up and deposit in a bank in the center of the arena. Depositing 5, 10 or 15 motes send small, medium or large enemy blockers, respectively, to the opposing team's arena and locks their bank; the opposing team must defeat the blockers in order to reactivate their bank. Every 25 motes deposited opens a portal where one team member can invade the other team's arena. Defeating members of the opposing team drops any motes that they are carrying. After depositing a certain amount of motes, a boss will spawn in the middle of the arena; if a team member is defeated by an invading member of the opposing team, the boss regains health. The first team that defeats their boss wins the round.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{see|Destiny (video game)#Setting}}\nOne year after the [[Destiny: Rise of Iron#Plot|SIVA Crisis]], Cabal forces of the Red Legion launch an aerial assault on the Last City, destroying the main portion of the Tower, the headquarters of the Guardians. The player's Guardian and their Ghost respond by assisting the Vanguard in assaulting the Red Legion command ship. As they confront the Red Legion's commander, Dominus Ghaul, his forces attach a device to the Traveler and begin draining it of the Light, the power used by the Guardians. The Guardian loses their powers and is nearly killed by Ghaul. Waking two days after the attack, the Guardian locates their Ghost. They find a haven known as \"the Farm\" in the European Dead Zone (EDZ) with the assistance of Suraya Hawthorne, a non-Guardian human from the outskirts of the Last City.\n\nThe Guardian follows a vision to encounter a shard of the Traveler hidden in a forest within the EDZ. Ghost interfaces with the shard and both its and the Guardian's Light are restored. After restoring long range communications, Hawthorne intercepts a distress call from Commander Zavala, urging surviving Guardians to travel to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and assist in mounting a counter-offensive. Against Hawthorne's objections, the Guardian travels to Titan, which has been overrun by the Hive. With assistance from Deputy Commander Sloane, they learn that the Red Legion was dispatched to the [[Milky Way]] in response to a distress call sent during the [[Destiny: The Taken King#Plot|Taken War]] two years prior, and that Ghaul possesses a superweapon known as the Almighty, a space station capable of destroying stars. Resistance to Cabal rule has resulted in entire star systems being destroyed. The intelligence also reveals that the Almighty is positioned near the Sun, breaking up the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as fuel. Zavala tasks the Guardian to find Ikora Rey and Cayde-6 to assist in a counterattack to retake the Last City. During this time, it is shown that Ghaul, aided by his mentor, the Consul, overthrew Emperor Calus and took control of the Cabal, and has been studying the Traveler in order to learn how to use the Light and legitimize himself as Emperor.\n\nThe Guardian locates Cayde-6 on the centaur planet [[7066 Nessus|Nessus]], which has almost been completely transformed by the Vex. With the aid of Failsafe, an AI from the crashed starship ''Exodus Black'', the Guardian frees Cayde from a Vex portal loop, and claims a teleporter for use in taking back the City. Cayde directs the Guardian to find Ikora on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] moon of [[Io (moon)|Io]], where she had gone to find answers about the Traveler. Ikora and Io researcher Asher Mir directs the Guardian to locate a Warmind, an ancient defensive AI for intelligence on the Almighty. Afterwards, the Vanguard reunites at the Farm and conclude that the only way to retake the Last City and save the Traveler is to shut down the Almighty first, eliminating the possibility of it destroying the Sun. The Guardian boards the Almighty and destroys the weapon, signaling Zavala to begin the counterattack. As the Vanguard begins the assault, the Consul admonishes Ghaul for his obsession with the Traveler, and urges him to take the Light; Ghaul is reluctant until the Consul kills the Speaker, whom Ghaul had captured and tortured to try and learn more about the Traveler. Ghaul then proclaims that he will take the Light, and strangles the Consul in a fit of rage.\n\nThe Guardian returns to Earth to assist in the counterattack and infiltrates Ghaul's command ship alone to save the Traveler. Ghaul forcibly takes the Light, corrupting it, and uses its power against the Guardian, but the Guardian is successful in defeating Ghaul. Ghaul reemerges as a massive ethereal figure who then speaks to the Traveler directly. In doing so, the Traveler wakes from its long sleep, destroying the device that was harvesting its power and killing Ghaul. It sends a massive shockwave, restoring the Light and decimating the Red Legion's forces. The game ends with a posthumous voiceover from the Speaker, reminding all that the Light can never be stopped. The Guardian and Ghost convene with Zavala, Ikora, Cayde, and Hawthorne at an undamaged portion of the Tower, with the Vanguard returning to their old duties and Hawthorne assuming a new post there. In a post-credits scene, the shockwave sent by the Traveler is shown reaching the entire system. The wave of Light extends beyond the Solar System and spreads beyond the Milky Way, before panning across a fleet of dark, unknown ships sitting some distance away in extragalactic space.\n\nFollowing Ghaul's defeat, a massive Cabal ship called the Leviathan appears in orbit of Nessus, under the control of the exiled Emperor Calus.

There was also a timed-exclusive Crucible map for PS4 players called Wormhaven. Instead of an entirely new raid, a feature called raid lair was added, featuring new areas to the existing Leviathan raid and a different final boss.<ref name=\"ExpansionI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-curse-of-osiris-dlc-increases-the-level-/1100-6454529/|title=Destiny 2 Curse Of Osiris DLC Increases The Level Cap|date=October 31, 2017|last=Pereira|first=Chris|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref> The second expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Warmind|Warmind]]'', was released on May 8, 2018 and focuses on the Warmind Rasputin from the original game. This expansion takes players to the planet Mars in a new area called [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas Basin]]. The expansion also features a new mode called \"Escalation Protocol\", a horde mode which can be started by any player in the patrol mode on Mars. As well, the EXP level cap was raised to 30 and the Power level cap was raised to 380. In addition to Rasputin, a new character named Ana Bray (also from the lore of the original ''Destiny'') was added, who serves as the primary NPC on Mars. Like the previous expansion, ''Warmind'' also includes a second raid lair on the Leviathan. The expansion also added progressive ranking systems for PvP, titled Valor and Glory. Players earn Valor in quickplay matches while Glory is earned in competitive matches, with each new rank earning greater rewards. Valor points are earned regardless of win or loss, while Glory points are earned by wins but reduced by losses.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> Both expansions featured timed-exclusive content for the PlayStation 4 platform, which became available for other platforms in late 2019.\n\nThe game saw many seasonal events during its first year of service, which were free to all players regardless of which version of the game they owned. \"The Dawning\" holiday event from the original ''Destiny'' returned on December 19, 2017 and ended on January 9, 2018. Both social spaces were redecorated for the event along with snow weather. Players could create snowballs in the social spaces and during strikes and throw these at other players or enemies (which damaged enemies). The Crucible game mode \"Mayhem\" (all abilities restore rapidly) was also brought back from the original ''Destiny''. New Milestones with event-themed rewards were also added.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-holiday-event-is-now-playable-on-ps4-xb/1100-6455748/|title=Destiny 2's Holiday Event Is Now Playable On PS4, Xbox One, And PC|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=December 19, 2017|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> \"Crimson Days\", the [[Valentine's Day]]-themed event from Year 2 (2016) of the original ''Destiny'', returned for ''Destiny 2'' on February 13, 2018, and like the original, it ran for only one week. Just as in the original event, Crimson Days featured a 2-versus-2 Crucible mode\u2013the only in ''Destiny 2''\u2013however, the mode was modified from the original. Staying close to a teammate caused all abilities to recharge quicker, while being apart gave away both players' locations to the opposing team. Players could earn Crimson Engrams, granting new rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-crimson-days-launches-with-new-update-on/1100-6456750/|title=Destiny 2 Crimson Days Launches With New Update On PC, PS4, And Xbox One|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=February 13, 2018|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=February 13, 2018}}</ref> Crimson Days was later rebranded into a separate but permanent mode called \"Doubles\" as a rotating mode in the Crucible. A brand new summer event called \"Solstice of Heroes\" began on July 31, 2018 and ended on August 28, 2018, to commemorate the first year of the game. The Power level cap was raised to 400 for the event. A new NPC called the Statue of Heroes was added and provided bounties that, when turned in, awarded Moments of Triumph points for players which could be used to earn exclusive rewards. Players received \"Scorched\" armor pieces at Power level 240 at the start of the event, which could then be upgraded to \"Rekindled\" armor at Power level 340, then to \"Resplendent\" armor at Power level 400, all by completing specific requirements for each armor piece, including playing through 5 revamped (Redux) missions from the original ''Destiny 2'' campaign. Players could also earn Solstice Engrams, which also granted new rewards.\n\nThe third expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Forsaken|Forsaken]]'', was released on September 4, 2018, beginning Year 2 of ''Destiny 2''. Similar to the original [[Destiny: The Taken King|''Destiny''{{'}}s ''The Taken King'']] expansion, ''Forsaken'' had a large overhaul on gameplay, though not to the extent that ''The Taken King'' had with the original ''Destiny''. A large expansion, the story has a \"western revenge\" theme, according to Bungie. A large portion of the expansion takes place in the Reef's Tangled Shore, including a new raid called \"Last Wish\", which takes place in the end-game area, the Dreaming City, also located in the Reef. The developers claimed that it has more bosses than any previous raid (including from the original game) with a massive roam area, puzzles, and the raid changes over time based on players' actions in the raid itself. There is also a new mode called Gambit that combines PvE and PvP, and features its own ranking system called Infamy, which works similar to the Crucible's Valor ranking system. Two teams of four players compete against each other while facing PvE enemies. A new weapon type, a bow and arrow, was also added. The EXP level cap was raised to 50 and the Power level cap was raised to 600.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-forsaken-dlc-release-date-new-mode-trail/1100-6459402/|title=Destiny 2 Forsaken DLC Release Date, New Mode, Trailer, And More Details|date=June 6, 2018|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> A trailer displayed during Sony's E3 2018 press conference showed the death of Cayde-6 by the hands of the returning Prince Uldren Sov.

The expansion sees players return to the [[Moon]], an area that was featured in the first ''Destiny'' game. The location was reprised and expanded upon with Bungie claiming it to be twice the size of the original location from ''Destiny''.<ref name=\"Gilliam\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/17/18679445/destiny-2-shadowkeep-moon-black-garden-artifact-gate-lord-armor-2-0-pvp-crota-exotic-finishing-move|title=Everything we know is coming to Destiny 2: Shadowkeep|last=Gilliam|first=Ryan|date=2019-06-17|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref> The story of ''Shadowkeep'' sees the return of Eris Morn, a character from the first game who has been absent since the events of ''Destiny 2''. Eris seeks the help of the player character in defeating \"Nightmares\" that she released into the solar system, which are manifestations of the Guardians' past. Guardians face off against their previous adversaries, which are being resurrected by the Darkness. Throughout the story, Eris and the Guardians work together to figure out the cause of this unleashed madness and do what they can to put a stop to it.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bungie|title=Bungie ViDoc - Out of the Shadows|date=2019-06-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVk4PkTG99o|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref> The expansion includes a return to the Black Garden on Mars for a new 6 player raid, ''Garden Of Salvation''.<ref name=\"Gilliam\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 83/100<ref name=\"MCPC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/destiny-2 |title=Destiny 2 for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}</ref><br/>(PS4) 85/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/destiny-2 |title=Destiny 2 for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref><br/>(XONE) 87/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/destiny-2 |title=Destiny 2 for Xbox One Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref>\n| Destruct = 7.5/10<ref name=\"DestructoidReview\">{{cite web |last=Carter |first=Chris |date=September 11, 2017 |url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-destiny-2-459702.phtml |title=Review: Destiny 2 |website=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n| EGM = 8/10<ref name=\"EGMReview\">{{cite magazine |last=Slead |first=Evan |date=September 14, 2017 |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/destiny-2-review |title=Destiny 2 review |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |accessdate=September 14, 2017}}</ref>\n| GI = 9/10<ref name=\"GIReview\">{{cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Matt |date=September 15, 2017 |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/destiny_2/b/playstation4/archive/2017/09/15/game-informer-review-destiny-2.aspx |title=A Streamlined Future - Destiny 2 - PlayStation 4 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameRev = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRevReview\">{{cite web |last=Perez |first=Cody |date=September 13, 2017 |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/347609-destiny-2-final-review-what-destiny-shouldve-been |title=Destiny 2 Final Review \u2013 What Destiny Should've Been |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=\"GSpotReview\">{{cite web |last=Plagge |first=Kallie |date=September 15, 2017 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/ |title=Destiny 2 Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n| GRadar = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"GRadarReview\">{{cite web |last=Houghton |first=David |date=September 15, 2017 |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/destiny-2-review/ |title=Destiny 2 review: 'This isn't Destiny.

Although he said the variety of weapons were fun, the Kinetic weapons \"didn't seem to pack as much of a punch as their Energy [weapon] counterparts.\"<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Cody Perez of ''[[Game Revolution]]'', however, welcomed the recategorized weapons, saying they were less restrictive and said that \"Bungie are masters of gun-play\".<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Kallie Plagge of [[GameSpot]] said that the game features mostly the same structure as the original, including its \"mechanically excellent shooting and satisfying loot grind\".<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/> Carter praised the Lost Sectors and public events, as well as the additional story quests and Adventures post-campaign.<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Miller said that the Lost Sectors were fun, but they became less interesting with the more that were done.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Perez, however, was not a fan of the Adventures and Lost Sectors activities, saying they were a \"disconnect [from] the main campaign\". He said that they were filler content, and that they were \"monotonous and a bore to accomplish, lacking the heart that fills the campaign.\" He did praise the public events as they are only periodic.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/>\n\nThe Leviathan raid received praise and criticism. Miller of ''Game Informer'' stated that the Leviathan raid was \"one of Bungie's most intricate and fascinating environments to date\", praising its maze-like structure with hidden chests and secret passages. He was critical of the award system, however, stating that it \"separates the excitement of new gear from the moment of victory\", as it does not offer most loot until a full completion.<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Slead of ''EGM'' said that \"the bread and butter of ''Destiny'' is still these post-campaign quests\", also referring to Strikes and the weekly Nightfall activity.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'', who did not play any of the original game's raids, was a big fan of the Leviathan raid, stating that it exceeded its hype.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/348153-destiny-2-leviathan-raid-review-exceeds-hype|title=Destiny 2's Leviathan Raid Exceeds the Hype|date=September 13, 2017|last=Perez|first=Cody|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> Plagge of GameSpot said that \"solving [the raid's] often obscure puzzles can be both rewarding and frustrating\", but \"each failure teaches you something new\".<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/>\n\nThe original ''Destiny'' was largely criticized for its story. ''Destiny 2'', however, was praised for its improvements to the story and easier access to the universe's lore. Slead of ''EGM'' said that it has a \"more robust story\" and Bungie fixed the \"meandering storytelling from the first\".<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Carter of ''Destructoid'' said that although its story was similar to others in the same genre, \"it's easy to follow and even easier to get invested in, with the game's cast coming front and center.\"<ref name=\"DestructoidReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'' said that the story \"[gripped] me in a way that only Bungie's former series ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' was able to.\" He said that there were many moments that were of shock and awe, and that the game had a meaningful narrative with an actual fleshed out villain.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Plagge of GameSpot said that the story serves its main purpose and that its strength \"lie in atmosphere and side details\", while also praising its \"mournful soundtrack\" as fantastic.<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/>\n\nMiller of ''Game Informer'' praised the Crucible mode for feeling more competitive than the original ''Destiny''{{'}}s, with teamwork being \"highly valued\". However, Miller was \"perplexed by the decision to force players into one of two playlists\", instead of letting them choose. He was also indifferent to the change of making all modes four-versus-four, but said that \"the compact group size demands everyone pull their weight, which is great.\"<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'' was disappointed that Crucible did not receive \"the same love that the singleplayer had been given.\" He said that although the smaller map sizes were not a bad thing, it causes multiplayer to be non-stop action, not allowing players to take a moment to strategize.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> David Houghton of ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' said that the changes to the Crucible

After some years of teaching, he became, in 1871, custodian of botanical collections of the ''Botanische Institute der [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian University M\u00fcnchen]]'' (Botanical Institute of Munich), remaining there until 1878, when he accepted a professorship at the [[University of Kiel]], where he stayed until 1884, teaching systematic botany. Also in 1878, Engler was elected into [[German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina|Leopoldina]], German Academy of Natural History. He went back to Breslau in 1884, as director of the Botanical Garden, succeeding [[Johann Heinrich Robert Goeppert|Goeppert]], and appointed professor of botany at the University of Breslau. From 1889 to 1921, Engler was a professor at [[University of Berlin]], and director of the [[Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum Berlin-Dahlem|Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden]], transforming it into one of the greatest botanical gardens of the world.\n\nHe visited several regions of the world, enlarging the knowledge of floristic distribution, especially of Africa.\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Alangium salviifolium Engler.png|upright|thumb|<center>''[[Alangium salviifolium]]''<br /> plate from ''Das Pflanzenreich''  </center>]]\n\n=== Plant taxonomy ===\nBesides his important work in general plant taxonomy, he was also an expert in some taxa, such as ''[[Saxifraga]]'', [[Araceae]], [[Burseraceae]], and others.\n\nAdolf Engler collaborated with several other great botanists, including [[Alphonse de Candolle]] on the ''Monographiae Phanerogamarum'' (''Monographs of Flowering Plants''), and [[Karl Friedrich Philipp von Martius|C.F.P. von Martius]] on the monumental work ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]'' (''Flora of [[Brazil]]'').\n\nHe founded the journal ''Botanische Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie'' (''Botanical Yearbook for Systematics, Plant Phylogeny and Phytogeography'', ISSN 0006-8152), published in [[Leipzig]], Germany, which has continued in publication from 1881 to the present.

After some years of teaching, he became, in 1871, custodian of botanical collections of the ''Botanische Institute der [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian University M\u00fcnchen]]'' (Botanical Institute of Munich), remaining there until 1878, when he accepted a professorship at the [[University of Kiel]], where he stayed until 1884, teaching systematic botany. Also in 1878, Engler was elected into [[German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina|Leopoldina]], German Academy of Natural History. He went back to Breslau in 1884, as director of the Botanical Garden, succeeding [[Johann Heinrich Robert Goeppert|Goeppert]], and appointed professor of botany at the University of Breslau. From 1889 to 1921, Engler was a professor at [[University of Berlin]], and director of the [[Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum Berlin-Dahlem|Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden]], transforming it into one of the greatest botanical gardens of the world.\n\nHe visited several regions of the world, enlarging the knowledge of floristic distribution, especially of Africa.\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Alangium salviifolium Engler.png|upright|thumb|<center>''[[Alangium salviifolium]]''<br /> plate from ''Das Pflanzenreich''  </center>]]\n\n=== Plant taxonomy ===\nBesides his important work in general plant taxonomy, he was also an expert in some taxa, such as ''[[Saxifraga]]'', [[Araceae]], [[Burseraceae]], and others.\n\nAdolf Engler collaborated with several other great botanists, including [[Alphonse de Candolle]] on the ''Monographiae Phanerogamarum'' (''Monographs of Flowering Plants''), and [[Karl Friedrich Philipp von Martius|C.F.P. von Martius]] on the monumental work ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]'' (''Flora of [[Brazil]]'').\n\nHe founded the journal ''Botanische Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie'' (''Botanical Yearbook for Systematics, Plant Phylogeny and Phytogeography'', ISSN 0006-8152), published in [[Leipzig]], Germany, which has continued in publication from 1881 to the present. In 2010, this publication changed its name to ''Plant Diversity and Evolution: Phylogeny, Biogeography, Structure and Function'', ISSN 1869-6155.\n* ''[[Die Nat\u00fcrlichen Pflanzenfamilien]]'' (''The Natural Plant Families''), edited with [[Karl A.

It is also known as '''''The Sandglass''''' in English-speaking countries. The story follows a young [[Jewish]] man who visits his father in a mystical sanatorium where time does not behave normally. The film is an adaptation of [[Bruno Schulz]]'s story collection ''[[Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass]]''. It won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nJoseph ([[Jan Nowicki]]) travels through a dream-like world, taking a dilapidated train to visit his dying father, Jacob, in a [[sanatorium]]. When he arrives at the hospital, he finds the entire facility is going to ruin and no one seems to be in charge or even caring for the patients. Time appears to behave in unpredictable ways, reanimating the past in an elaborate artificial caprice.\n\nThough Joseph is always shown as an adult, his behavior and the people around often depict him as a child. He befriends Rudolf, a young boy who owns a postage stamp album. The names of the stamps trigger a wealth of association and adventure in Joseph. Among the many occurrences in this visually potent [[phantasmagoria]] include Joseph re-entering childhood episodes with his wildly eccentric father (who lives with birds in an attic), being arrested by a mysterious unit of soldiers for having a dream that was severely criticized in high places, reflecting on a girl he fantasized about in his boyhood and commandeering a group of historic wax mannequins. Throughout his strange journey, an ominous blind train conductor reappears like a death figure.\n\nHas also adds a series of reflections on the [[Holocaust]] that were not present in the original texts, reading Schulz's prose through the prism of the author's death during [[World War II]] and the demise of the world he described.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jan Nowicki]] as J\u00f3zef\n* [[Tadeusz Kondrat]] as Jakub, J\u00f3zef's father\n* Irena Orska as J\u00f3zef's mother\n* Halina Kowalska as Adela\n* [[Gustaw Holoubek]] as Dr. Gotard\n* Mieczys\u0142aw Voit as train conductor\n* Bo\u017cena Adamek as Bianka\n* Ludwik Benoit as Szloma\n* Henryk Bouko\u0142owski as firefighter\n* Seweryn Dalecki as Teodor the clerk\n* [[Jerzy Przybylski]] as Mr. de V.\n* Julian Jabczy\u0144ski as dignitary\n* Wiktor Sadecki as dignitary\n* Janina Soko\u0142owska as nurse\n* Wojciech Stande\u0142\u0142o as a Jew\n* Tadeusz Schmidt as officer\n* Szymon Szurmiej as Jew reciting verses from [[Ecclesiastes]] false\n* Pawe\u0142 Unrug as ornithologist\n* Filip Zylber as Rudolf\n* Jerzy Trela as jester\n\n==Production==\n''The Hourglass Sanatorium'' is not solely an adaptation of ''[[Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass]]'', but also includes sequences from other works by [[Bruno Schulz]]. Regarding the possibility of a film adaptation of a book written by Schulz, director [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] said: \"Schulz's poetic prose was the reading of my early youth. It influenced my films. That is why the realization of ''The Hourglass Sanatorium'' was a must for me. My aim was not to make a literal adaption of the work, but rather to do justice to what we call the work's poetics: its unique, isolated world, its atmospherics, colours and shapes.\"<ref name=krakowpost>{{Cite web|last=Hodge|first=Nick|date=2010-08-07|url=http://www.krakowpost.com/article/2265|title=Wojciech Has and the Interpretation of Dreams|work=[[Krakow Post]]|publisher=Lifeboat Ltd|accessdate=2010-12-27<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61BAJcLi8 -->}}</ref> The time period of the film is a mixture of elements from the turn-of-the-century [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] where Schulz grew up, and Has' own pre-World War II memories of the same region.<ref name=krakowpost /> The film was produced by Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Filmowy Silesia.

Not only was the crumbled sanatorium interpreted as a parallel to the poor condition of many institutions and manor houses in contemporary Poland; Has had also chosen to emphasize the Jewish aspects of the source material, and this soon after an antisemitic campaign the government had launched in 1968, which had prompted around 30,000 Polish Jews to leave the country. The authorities forbid Has to submit ''The Hourglass Sanatorium'' for the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]], but the director managed to smuggle a print abroad so the film could be screened at the festival.<ref name=krakowpost /> The Cannes jury, led by actress [[Ingrid Bergman]], honoured the film with the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Jury Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/1973/juryLongFilm.html|title=Juries 1973 |work=festival-cannes.com|accessdate=2010-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2302/year/1973.html|title=Sanatorium pod klepsydra|work=festival-cannes.com|accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> The Polish premiere took place on 11 December 1973.<ref name=filmpolski /> The film is among 21 digitally restored classic Polish films chosen for ''Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema.'' <ref>[http://www.mspresents.com/ Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema]</ref><ref>[http://culture.pl/en/article/martin-scorsese-presents-21-masterpieces Martin Scorsese Presents 21 Masterpieces]</ref> and has been released on blu-ray in a related box set by Milestone Cinema.\n\n==Reception==\nWhen the film was released in Poland it met with mixed reviews from the critics and it was mostly criticized by [[literary criticism|literary scholar]]s.

It is also known as '''''The Sandglass''''' in English-speaking countries. The story follows a young [[Jewish]] man who visits his father in a mystical sanatorium where time does not behave normally. The film is an adaptation of [[Bruno Schulz]]'s story collection ''[[Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass]]''. It won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nJoseph ([[Jan Nowicki]]) travels through a dream-like world, taking a dilapidated train to visit his dying father, Jacob, in a [[sanatorium]]. When he arrives at the hospital, he finds the entire facility is going to ruin and no one seems to be in charge or even caring for the patients. Time appears to behave in unpredictable ways, reanimating the past in an elaborate artificial caprice.\n\nThough Joseph is always shown as an adult, his behavior and the people around often depict him as a child. He befriends Rudolf, a young boy who owns a postage stamp album. The names of the stamps trigger a wealth of association and adventure in Joseph. Among the many occurrences in this visually potent [[phantasmagoria]] include Joseph re-entering childhood episodes with his wildly eccentric father (who lives with birds in an attic), being arrested by a mysterious unit of soldiers for having a dream that was severely criticized in high places, reflecting on a girl he fantasized about in his boyhood and commandeering a group of historic wax mannequins. Throughout his strange journey, an ominous blind train conductor reappears like a death figure.\n\nHas also adds a series of reflections on the [[Holocaust]] that were not present in the original texts, reading Schulz's prose through the prism of the author's death during [[World War II]] and the demise of the world he described.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jan Nowicki]] as J\u00f3zef\n* [[Tadeusz Kondrat]] as Jakub, J\u00f3zef's father\n* Irena Orska as J\u00f3zef's mother\n* Halina Kowalska as Adela\n* [[Gustaw Holoubek]] as Dr. Gotard\n* Mieczys\u0142aw Voit as train conductor\n* Bo\u017cena Adamek as Bianka\n* Ludwik Benoit as Szloma\n* Henryk Bouko\u0142owski as firefighter\n* Seweryn Dalecki as Teodor the clerk\n* [[Jerzy Przybylski]] as Mr. de V.\n* Julian Jabczy\u0144ski as dignitary\n* Wiktor Sadecki as dignitary\n* Janina Soko\u0142owska as nurse\n* Wojciech Stande\u0142\u0142o as a Jew\n* Tadeusz Schmidt as officer\n* Szymon Szurmiej as Jew reciting verses from [[Ecclesiastes]] false\n* Pawe\u0142 Unrug as ornithologist\n* Filip Zylber as Rudolf\n* Jerzy Trela as jester\n\n==Production==\n''The Hourglass Sanatorium'' is not solely an adaptation of ''[[Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass]]'', but also includes sequences from other works by [[Bruno Schulz]]. Regarding the possibility of a film adaptation of a book written by Schulz, director [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] said: \"Schulz's poetic prose was the reading of my early youth. It influenced my films. That is why the realization of ''The Hourglass Sanatorium'' was a must for me. My aim was not to make a literal adaption of the work, but rather to do justice to what we call the work's poetics: its unique, isolated world, its atmospherics, colours and shapes.\"<ref name=krakowpost>{{Cite web|last=Hodge|first=Nick|date=2010-08-07|url=http://www.krakowpost.com/article/2265|title=Wojciech Has and the Interpretation of Dreams|work=[[Krakow Post]]|publisher=Lifeboat Ltd|accessdate=2010-12-27<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61BAJcLi8 -->}}</ref> The time period of the film is a mixture of elements from the turn-of-the-century [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] where Schulz grew up, and Has' own pre-World War II memories of the same region.<ref name=krakowpost /> The film was produced by Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Filmowy Silesia.

Not only was the crumbled sanatorium interpreted as a parallel to the poor condition of many institutions and manor houses in contemporary Poland; Has had also chosen to emphasize the Jewish aspects of the source material, and this soon after an antisemitic campaign the government had launched in 1968, which had prompted around 30,000 Polish Jews to leave the country. The authorities forbid Has to submit ''The Hourglass Sanatorium'' for the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]], but the director managed to smuggle a print abroad so the film could be screened at the festival.<ref name=krakowpost /> The Cannes jury, led by actress [[Ingrid Bergman]], honoured the film with the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Jury Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/1973/juryLongFilm.html|title=Juries 1973 |work=festival-cannes.com|accessdate=2010-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2302/year/1973.html|title=Sanatorium pod klepsydra|work=festival-cannes.com|accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> The Polish premiere took place on 11 December 1973.<ref name=filmpolski /> The film is among 21 digitally restored classic Polish films chosen for ''Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema.'' <ref>[http://www.mspresents.com/ Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema] </ref> <ref>[http://culture.pl/en/article/martin-scorsese-presents-21-masterpieces Martin Scorsese Presents 21 Masterpieces]</ref> and has been released on blu-ray in a related box set by Milestone Cinema.\n\n==Reception==\nWhen the film was released in Poland it met with mixed reviews from the critics and it was mostly criticized by [[literary criticism|literary scholar]]s.

Trucks engaged for [[kar seva]] (religious service) and bringing in supplies for the daily langar were smuggling in guns and ammunition. The police never attempted to check these vehicles entering the Golden Temple, reportedly on instructions from superiors. During a random check one such truck was stopped and many [[sten]] guns and ammunition were found. After Operation Blue Star it was found that the militants had set up a grenade manufacturing facility, and a workshop for the fabrication of sten-guns inside the Temple Complex.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/>\n\nThe Harmandir Sahib compound and some of the surrounding houses were fortified under the guidance of Major General [[Shabeg Singh]], who had joined Bhindranwale's group after dismissal from the army. During their occupation of Akal Takht, Bhindranwale's group had begun fortifying the building, which had allegedly disfigured the Akal Takht.

All of these positions were protected by sandbags and newly made brick walls. The windows and arches of Akal Takht were blocked with bricks and sandbags. Sandbags were placed on the turrets. The entire Akal Takht had been converted into a large reinforced pillbox with weapons pointing in all directions.

This was to avoid the 'desecration' of the temple by their presence. The security forces were prevented by the politicians from taking action in enforcing the law. Even self-defence from the militants was made difficult. On 14 February 1984, a police post near the entrance of the Temple was attacked by a group of militants. Six fully armed policemen were captured and taken inside. After twenty four hours the police responded and sent in a senior police officer for negotiation. He asked Bhindranwale in the Akal Takht to release his men and return their weapons. Bhindranwale agreed only to return the corpse of one of the policemen who had been killed.

The option of laying down a long siege was ruled out by the army due to the risk of emotionally aroused villagers marching to the temple and clashing with the army.

Ten Guards, 1 Para Commandos and [[Special Frontier Force]] (SFF) would attack from the main entrance of the complex, and 26 Madras and 9 Kumaon battalions from the hostel complex side entrance from the south. The objective of the 10 Guards was to secure the northern wing of the Temple complex and draw attention away from SFF who were to secure the western wing of the complex and 1 Para Commandos who were to gain a foothold in Akal Takht and in Harmandir Sahab, with the help of divers. Twenty-six Madras was tasked with securing the southern and the eastern complexes, and the 9 Kumaon regiment with SGPC building and Guru Ramdas Serai.

Eventually, other teams managed to reach Darshani Deori, a building north of the Nishan Sahib, and started to fire at the Akal Takth and a red building towards its left, so that the SFF troops could get closer to the Darshani Deori and fire gas canisters at Akal Takth. The canisters bounced off the building and affected the troops instead.\n\nMeanwhile, 26 Madras and 9 Garhwal Rifles (reserve troops) had come under heavy fire from the Langar rooftop, Guru Ramdas Serai and the buildings in the vicinity. Moreover, they took a lot of time in forcing open the heavy Southern Gate, which had to be shot open with tank fire. This delay caused a lot of casualties among the Indian troops fighting inside the complex. Three tanks and an APC had entered the complex.\n\nCrawling was impossible as Shabeg Singh had placed light machine guns nine or ten inches above the ground. The attempt caused many casualties among the Indian troops. A third attempt to gain the Pool was made by a squad of 200 commandos. On the southern side, the Madras and Garhwal battalions were not able to make it to the pavement around the pool because they were engaged by positions on the southern side.\n\nDespite the mounting casualties, General Sunderji ordered a fourth assault by the commandos. This time, the Madras battalion was reinforced with two more companies of the 7th Garhwal Rifles under the command of General Kuldip Singh Brar. However, the Madras and Garhwal troops under Brigadier A. K. Dewan once again failed to move towards the parikarma (the pavement around the pool).\n\nBrigadier Dewan reported heavy casualties and requested more reinforcements. General Brar sent two companies of 15 Kumaon Regiment. This resulted in yet more heavy casualties, forcing Brigadier Dewan to request tank support. As one APC inched closer to the Akal Takth it was hit with an anti-tank [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], which immediately immobilized it. Brar also requested tank support.

There, 1,461 soldiers\u20141,050 of them raw recruits, stormed the armoury, killing one officer and injuring two before they set out for Amritsar. The leaders of the mutiny divided the troops into two groups just outside of [[Banaras]] to avoid a rumoured roadblock. One half was engaged by army artillery at Shakteshgarh railway station; those who managed to escape were rounded up by [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment|21st Mechanised Infantry Regiment]]. The other half engaged with the artillery and troops of [[20th Indian Infantry Brigade|20th Infantry Brigade]], during which 35 soldiers (both sides) were killed.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/0095327X9201900106| issn = 0095-327X| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 123\u2013137| last = Barua| first = Pradeep P.| title = Ethnic Conflict in the Military of Developing Nations: A Comparative Analysis of India and Nigeria| journal = Armed Forces & Society| date = October 1992}}</ref><ref name=\"Kundu\"/><ref>{{cite book|first1=Mark|last1=Tully|first2=Satish|last2=Jacob|title=Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle|url=https://archive.org/details/amritsarmrsgandh00tull|url-access=registration|date=1985|page=[https://archive.org/details/amritsarmrsgandh00tull/page/195 195]}}</ref> There were five more smaller mutinies in different parts of India.

Bhindranwale was about to launch a fierce movement planned to murder Hindus in all the villages across Punjab. Plans included killings of All congress (I) MPs and MLAs on 5 June.

An arsenal had been created within the Akal Takht over a period of several months. Trucks engaged for [[kar seva]] (religious service) and bringing in supplies for the daily langar were smuggling in guns and ammunition. The police never attempted to check these vehicles entering the Golden Temple, reportedly on instructions from superiors. During a random check one such truck was stopped and many [[sten]] guns and ammunition were found. After Operation Blue Star it was found that the militants had set up a grenade manufacturing facility, and a workshop for the fabrication of sten-guns inside the Temple Complex.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/>\n\nThe Harmandir Sahib compound and some of the surrounding houses were fortified under the guidance of Major General [[Shabeg Singh]], who had joined Bhindranwale's group after dismissal from the army. During their occupation of Akal Takht, Bhindranwale's group had begun fortifying the building, which had allegedly disfigured the Akal Takht. ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' reported that [[light machine gun]]s and [[semi-automatic rifle]]s were known to have been brought into the compound,<ref>Kuldip Nayar and Khushwant Singh, ''Tragedy of Punjab'', Vision Books, New Delhi, 1984, p. 79.</ref> and strategically placed to defend against an armed assault on the complex. The modern weapons later found inside the temple complex indicated that foreign elements were involved. The heavier weapons were found to have Pakistani or Chinese markings on them.<ref name=\"weapons\">{{cite news |title=Operation Bluestar |publisher=India Today |date=1999}}</ref>\n\nHoles were smashed through the marble walls of Akal takht to create gun positions. Walls were broken to allow entry points from the basements in the Takht and from the rooms around the Parikrama, to the tiled courtyards. Secure machine gun nests were created. All of these positions were protected by sandbags and newly made brick walls. The windows and arches of Akal Takht were blocked with bricks and sandbags. Sandbags were placed on the turrets. The entire Akal Takht had been converted into a large reinforced pillbox with weapons pointing in all directions. Every strategically significant building of the temple complex, apart from the Harmandir Sahib located at its very centre, had been fortified in a similar manner and allegedly defaced. The fortifications also included seventeen private houses in the residential area near the Temple.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/> All the high rise buildings and towers near the temple complex were occupied. The militants manning these vantage points were in wireless contact with Shabeg Singh in Akal Takht.<ref name=\"Guha_IndiaGandhi\"/> Under the military leadership of the cashiered Major General Singh, ex-army veterans and deserters had provided weapons training to Bhindranwale's men in the Temple Complex.<ref name=\"satp prophet\"/> Young Sikhs were occupying firing positions in the shrine and the buildings on all sides of Akal Takht.<ref name=ms_AT_fort>{{cite book | last = Mark Tully | first = Satish Jacob | title = Amritsar; Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle | publisher = J.

The defences in the complex were created with the purpose of holding out long enough to provoke an uprising among Sikhs in the villages and encourage them to march en masse towards the Golden Temple in support of the militants.

This was to avoid the 'desecration' of the temple by their presence. The security forces were prevented by the politicians from taking action in enforcing the law. Even self-defence from the militants was made difficult. On 14 February 1984, a police post near the entrance of the Temple was attacked by a group of militants. Six fully armed policemen were captured and taken inside. After twenty four hours the police responded and sent in a senior police officer for negotiation. He asked Bhindranwale in the Akal Takht to release his men and return their weapons. Bhindranwale agreed only to return the corpse of one of the policemen who had been killed.

The buildings were close together and had labyrinthine passages all under the control of the militants. Militants in the temple premises had access to langars, food supplies, and water from the Sarovar (temple pond). Militants were well stocked with weapons and ammunitions. Any siege under these circumstances would have been long and difficult. The option of laying down a long siege was ruled out by the army due to the risk of emotionally aroused villagers marching to the temple and clashing with the army.

Ten Guards, 1 Para Commandos and [[Special Frontier Force]] (SFF) would attack from the main entrance of the complex, and 26 Madras and 9 Kumaon battalions from the hostel complex side entrance from the south. The objective of the 10 Guards was to secure the northern wing of the Temple complex and draw attention away from SFF who were to secure the western wing of the complex and 1 Para Commandos who were to gain a foothold in Akal Takht and in Harmandir Sahab, with the help of divers. Twenty-six Madras was tasked with securing the southern and the eastern complexes, and the 9 Kumaon regiment with SGPC building and Guru Ramdas Serai. Twelve Bihar was charged with providing a cordon and fire support to the other regiments by neutralising enemy positions under their observance.<ref>Brar, K.S. (1992).

Eventually, other teams managed to reach Darshani Deori, a building north of the Nishan Sahib, and started to fire at the Akal Takth and a red building towards its left, so that the SFF troops could get closer to the Darshani Deori and fire gas canisters at Akal Takth. The canisters bounced off the building and affected the troops instead.\n\nMeanwhile, 26 Madras and 9 Garhwal Rifles (reserve troops) had come under heavy fire from the Langar rooftop, Guru Ramdas Serai and the buildings in the vicinity. Moreover, they took a lot of time in forcing open the heavy Southern Gate, which had to be shot open with tank fire. This delay caused a lot of casualties among the Indian troops fighting inside the complex. Three tanks and an APC had entered the complex.\n\nCrawling was impossible as Shabeg Singh had placed light machine guns nine or ten inches above the ground. The attempt caused many casualties among the Indian troops. A third attempt to gain the Pool was made by a squad of 200 commandos. On the southern side, the Madras and Garhwal battalions were not able to make it to the pavement around the pool because they were engaged by positions on the southern side.\n\nDespite the mounting casualties, General Sunderji ordered a fourth assault by the commandos. This time, the Madras battalion was reinforced with two more companies of the 7th Garhwal Rifles under the command of General Kuldip Singh Brar. However, the Madras and Garhwal troops under Brigadier A. K. Dewan once again failed to move towards the parikarma (the pavement around the pool).\n\nBrigadier Dewan reported heavy casualties and requested more reinforcements. General Brar sent two companies of 15 Kumaon Regiment. This resulted in yet more heavy casualties, forcing Brigadier Dewan to request tank support. As one APC inched closer to the Akal Takth it was hit with an anti-tank [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], which immediately immobilized it. Brar also requested tank support. The tanks received the clearance to fire their main guns (105&nbsp;mm [[high-explosive squash head]] shells) only at around 7:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brar|first=K.S.|date=1992|title=Operation Blue Star: True Story|publisher=UBS Publishers Distributors (P) Limited|pages=81\u2013110|isbn=978-81-7476-068-5}}</ref>\n\n=== 6 June ===\n[[File:AB133 - Vijayanta MBT.JPG|thumb|The army used seven [[Vijayanta|Vijayanta Tanks]] during the operation<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Singh\n | first = Sangat\n | title = The Sikhs in History\n | publisher = Uncommon Books\n | year = 1992\n | page = 378\n | isbn = 978-81-900650-0-9 }}</ref>]]\nVijayanta tanks shelled the Akal Takht.

He lived nearby in the Seaton Place Apartments with his wife, [[Lee Hawkins Garby]]. A long discussion about journeys into outer space ensued, and it was suggested that Smith should write down his ideas and speculations as a story about interstellar travel. Although he was interested, Smith believed after some thought that some [[romantic fiction|romantic]] elements would be required and he was uncomfortable with that.\n\nMrs. Garby offered to take care of the love interest and the romantic dialogue, and Smith decided to give it a try. The sources of inspirations for the main characters in the novel were themselves; the \"Seatons\" and \"Cranes\" were based on the Smiths and Garbys, respectively.<ref>Sanders pp. 8\u20139, Moskowitz p. 14.</ref> About one third of ''[[The Skylark of Space]]'' was completed by the end of 1916, when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it.\n\nSmith earned his master's degree in chemistry from the [[George Washington University]] in 1917, studying under Dr. [[Charles Edward Munroe|Charles E.

Bob Davis, editor of ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', sent an encouraging rejection letter in 1922, saying that he liked the novel personally, but that it was too far out for his readers.<ref>Sanders, p. 9; Moskowitz, p. 15.</ref> (According to [http://fanac.org/fanzines/Spaceways/Spaceways01-07.html Warner], but no other source, Smith began work on the sequel, ''Skylark III'', before the first book was accepted.)

The book does, however, have significant scientific implausibilities, for example the breathable atmosphere on Saturn and some of Jupiter and its satellites.</ref> Even in 1938, after he had written ''Galactic Patrol'', Smith considered it his finest work;<ref name = \"warner\"/> he later said of it, \"This was really scientific fiction; not, like the Skylarks, pseudo-science\";<ref>Sheridan p. 3</ref> and even at the end of his career, he considered it his only work of true science fiction.<ref>Rogers p. 26.</ref> It was published in the July through September 1931 issues of ''Amazing,'' with [[T.

So when [[Harry Bates (author)|Harry Bates]], editor of ''[[Astounding Stories]]'', offered Smith 2\u00a2/word\u2014payable on publication\u2014for his next story, he agreed; this meant that it could not be a sequel to ''Spacehounds.''<ref name=\"mosk16\"/>\n\nThis book would be ''[[Triplanetary (novel)|Triplanetary]]'', \"in which scientific detail would not be bothered about, and in which his imagination would run riot.\"<ref name=\"warner\">Warner.</ref> Indeed, characters within the story point out its psychological<ref>Lyman Cleveland's comment on the easy availability of \"solid asteroids of iron\", ''Amazing'' March 1934, p. 16, first edition p.196, as proving the pointlessness of the Nevians' attack.</ref> and scientific<ref>Cleveland's expectation, correct according to [[special relativity]], that inertialess travel would not be faster than light in the home [[Frame of reference|reference frame]], p. 223.</ref> implausibilities, and sometimes even seem to suggest self-parody.<ref>Nerado's comment, \"Destruction, always destruction ... they are a useless race\", February p. 81, p. 160.</ref> At other times, they are conspicuously silent about obvious implausibilities.<ref>Costigan & Bradley's lack of comment when they discover that the ship they are on has passed the speed of light, February p. 84, p. 168.

Shortly after it was accepted, [[F. Orlin Tremaine]], the new editor of the revived ''Astounding'', offered one cent a word for ''Triplanetary''; when he learned that he was too late, he suggested a third ''Skylark'' novel instead.<ref>Moskowitz p. 17</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 1933\u201334, Smith worked on ''The Skylark of Valeron'', but he felt that the story was getting out of control; he sent his first draft to Tremaine, with a distraught note asking for suggestions. Tremaine accepted the rough draft for $850, and announced it in the June 1934 issue, with a full-page editorial and a three-quarter-page advertisement. The novel was published in the August 1934 through February 1935 issues.<ref name=isfdb/> [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Astounding'']]'s circulation rose by 10,000 for the first issue, and its two main competitors, ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'' and ''[[Wonder Stories]]'', fell into financial difficulties, both skipping issues within a year.<ref>Moskowitz p. 17\u20138, Rogers pp. 24\u201330. Rogers agrees with Moskowitz that ''Astounding'' became the leading science-fiction magazine during this period, but does not attribute this solely to Smith.</ref>\n\n===The ''Lensman'' series===\n\nIn January 1936, a time period where he was already an established science-fiction writer, he took a job for salary plus profit-sharing, as a food technologist (a cereal chemist) at the Dawn Doughnut Company of [[Jackson, Michigan]].<ref>Moskowitz p. 19, Warner.</ref> This initially entailed almost a year's worth of 18-hour days and seven-day workweeks.

(Private correspondence, July 4, 2006.) Searches at Google patent (www.google.com/patent) on various combinations of Smith's name have not uncovered any patents which relate to his professional biography and supposed accomplishments in the pastry field.</ref> Smith was reportedly dislocated from his job at Dawn Doughnuts by prewar rationing in early 1940.<ref name=\"dict\">The Dictionary of Literary Biography,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} quoted at http://www.bookrags.com/Edward_Elgar accessed May 8, 2007.</ref>\n\nSmith had been contemplating writing a \"space-police novel\" since early 1927;<ref>\"The Epic of Space\" p. 83.</ref> once he had \"the Lensmen's universe fairly well set up\", he reviewed his science-fiction collection for \"cops-and-robbers\" stories.

Note that Smith's account in \"The Epic of Space\" does not mention Tremaine's commitment. Moskowitz says that the outline was 80 pages; Smith only mentions that the section on ''[[Galactic Patrol]]'' was \"only a few pages long.\"</ref> Segmenting the story into four novels required considerable effort to avoid dangling loose ends; Smith cites [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] as a negative example.<ref name=\"epic85\">\"The Epic of Space\" p. 85.</ref> After the outline was complete, he wrote a more detailed outline of ''[[Galactic Patrol]]'', plus a detailed graph of its structure, with \"peaks of emotional intensity and the valleys of characterization and background material.\" He notes, however, that he was never able to follow any of his outlines at all closely, as the \"characters get away from me and do exactly as they damn please.\"<ref>\"The Epic of Space\" p. 86.</ref> After completing the rough draft of ''Galactic Patrol'', he wrote the concluding chapter of the last book in the series, ''[[Children of the Lens]].''<ref name = \"mosk19\"/> ''Galactic Patrol'' was published in the September 1937 through February 1938 issues of ''Astounding''; unlike the revised book edition, it was not set in the same universe as ''Triplanetary''.<ref>The Commandant's account of the Patrol's early history at the beginning of the magazine version of ''Galactic Patrol'' does not describe what happened in the magazine version of ''Triplanetary''; the reference to Virgil Samms and the Triplanetary Patrol is a later interpolation. (''Astounding'' September 1937 pp. 12\u201313; cp. [[Fantasy Press]] edition pp. 8\u20139.) The reference to \"the days of the semi-inert drive\" and the Third Galactic Survey on page 34 of the same issue is not consistent with the history of partial inertialessness in either version of ''Triplanetary'', and is omitted from page 42 of the [[Fantasy Press]] edition. (''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'' March 1934 pp. 28 & 33; cp. Fantasy Press edition pp. 223 & 231.) See also Gharlane's Lens FAQ Question 1.

[[John W. Campbell|Campbell]]'s editorial in the December issue suggested that the October issue was the best issue of ''Astounding'' ever, and ''Gray Lensman'' was first place in the Analytical Laboratory statistics \"by a lightyear\", with three runners-up in a distant tie for second place.<ref>''Astounding'' December 1939 pp. 6, 91.</ref> The cover was also praised by readers in ''Brass Tacks'', and Campbell noted, \"We got a letter from E.

An extended segment in the novel version of ''Triplanetary'', set during World War II, suggests intimate familiarity with explosives and munitions manufacturing. Some biographers cite as fact that, just as Smith's protagonist in this segment lost his job over failure to approve substandard munitions, Smith did, as well. Smith began work for the J. W. Allen Company (a manufacturer of doughnut and frosting mixes) in 1946 and worked for them until his professional retirement in 1957.<ref name=\"dict\" />\n\n===Retirement and late writing===\n\nAfter Smith retired, his wife and he lived in [[Clearwater, Florida]],<ref name=\"wt640406\"/> in the fall and winter, driving the smaller of their two trailers to [[Seaside, Oregon]], each April, often stopping at [[science fiction convention]]s on the way. (Smith did not like to fly.<ref>Pohl in Lucchetti p. 15, Al Trestrail in Lucchetti p. 19. Al Trestrail (p. 20) and Pohl (p. 14) also mention church attendance (Pohl in a fictional context), which none of the other sources seem to.</ref>) In 1963, he was presented the inaugural [[First Fandom Hall of Fame award]] at the [[21st World Science Fiction Convention]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"wt640406\"/> Some of his biography is captured in an essay by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], which was reprinted in the collection ''Expanded Universe'' in 1980. A more detailed, although allegedly<ref>[[Gharlane of Eddore (Pen-name)|Gharlane of Eddore]], [http://www.chronology.org/noframes/lens/ Lensman FAQ], under \"References.\"</ref> error-ridden biography is in Sam Moskowitz's ''Seekers of Tomorrow.''\n\nRobert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein dedicated his 1958 novel ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' \"To Edward E. Smith, PhD\".<ref>{{cite book | author=Heinlein, Robert A | title=Methuselah's Children | publisher=Baen Publishing Enterprises | year=1986 | isbn=0-671-65597-3}}</ref>) Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his \"unrealistic\" heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of ''[[Spacehounds of IPC]]''. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of \"superman\" when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by [[bone conduction]]\u2014a process apparently improvised on the spot.\n\nIn his nonseries novels written after his professional retirement, ''Galaxy Primes'', ''Subspace Explorers'', and ''Subspace Encounter'', E. E. Smith explores themes of telepathy and other mental abilities collectively called \"psionics\", and of the conflict between [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and socialistic/communistic influences in the colonization of other planets. ''Galaxy Primes'' was written after critics such as [[Groff Conklin]] and [[P. Schuyler Miller]] in the early '50s accused his fiction of being pass\u00e9, and he made an attempt to do something more in line with the concepts about which ''Astounding'' editor John W. Campbell encouraged his writers to make stories. Despite this, it was rejected by Campbell, and it was eventually published by ''Amazing Stories'' in 1959. His late story \"The Imperial Stars\" (1964), featuring a troupe of circus performers involved in sabotage in a galactic empire, recaptured some of the atmosphere from his earlier works and was intended as the first in a new series, with outlines of later parts rumored to still exist.<ref>[http://port70.net/cgi/httpgate.rss.cgi?9text/books/By%20Author/smith%2C%20edward%20elmer/Smith%2C%20E.%20E.%20Doc%20-%20Best%20of%20EE%20Doc%20Smith.pdf The Best of E.E. \"Doc\" Smith. Classic Adventures in Space By One of SF's Great Originals]</ref>. In fact, the Imperial Stars characters and concepts were continued by author [[Stephen Goldin]] as the \"[[Family D'Alembert]] series\". While the book covers indicate the series was written by Smith and Goldin together, Goldin only ever had Smith's original novella to expand upon.\n\nThe fourth ''Skylark'' novel, ''[[Skylark DuQuesne]]'', ran in the June to October 1965 issues of ''If'', beginning once again as the cover story. Editor [[Frederik Pohl]] introduced it with a one-page summary of the previous stories, which were all at least 30 years old.<ref name=isfdb/>\n\n===Lord Tedric===\n\nSmith published two novelettes entitled \"Tedric\" in ''Other Worlds Science Fiction Stories'' (1953) and \"Lord Tedric\" in ''Universe Science Fiction'' (1954). These were almost completely forgotten until after Smith's death. In 1975, a compendium of Smith's works was published, entitled ''The Best of E. E. \"Doc\" Smith'', containing these two short stories, excerpts from several of his major works, and another short story first published in ''Worlds of If'' in 1964 entitled \"The Imperial Stars\".\n\nIn Smith's original short stories, Tedric was a smith (both blacksmith and whitesmith) residing in a small town near a castle in a situation roughly equivalent to [[History of England#England under the Plantagenets|England of the 1200s]]. He received instruction in advanced metallurgy from a [[time-travel]]er who wanted to change the situation in his own time by modifying certain events of the past. From this instruction, he was able to build better suits of armor and help defeat the villains of the piece. Unlike Eklund's later novels based on these short stories, the original Tedric never left his own time or planet, and fought purely local enemies of his own time period.\n\nA few years later and 13 years after Smith's death, Verna Smith arranged with [[Gordon Eklund]] to publish another novel of the same name about the same fictional character, introducing it as \"a new series conceived by E. E. 'Doc' Smith\". Eklund later went on to publish the other novels in the series, one or two under the pseudonym \"E. E. 'Doc' Smith\" or \"E. E. Smith\". The protagonist possesses heroic qualities similar to those of the heroes in Smith's original novels and can communicate with an extra-dimensional race of beings known as the Scientists, whose archenemy is Fra Villion, a mysterious character described as a dark knight, skilled in whip-sword combat, and evil genius behind the creation of a planetoid-sized \"iron sphere\" armed with a weapon capable of destroying planets. As a result, Smith is believed by many to be the unacknowledged progenitor of themes that would appear in ''[[Star Wars]]''. In fact, however, these appear in the sequels written by others after Smith's death.\n\n==Critical opinion==\n\nSmith's novels are generally considered to be classic [[space opera]]s,<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Sir Arthur C.]]|title=[[Astounding Days]]|pages= 102\u20133 ff}}</ref> and he is sometimes called the first of the three \"[[nova]]s\" of 20th-century science fiction (with [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]] as the second and third novas).<ref>Clarke, ''op. cit.'' p. 120, citing and agreeing with Isaac Asimov in his introduction to ''The Best of Stanley G. Weinbaum'', who was the second nova.</ref>\n\nHeinlein credited him for being his main influence: \n\n<blockquote>I have learned from many writers\u2014from [[Jules Verne|Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells|Wells]] and [[John W. Campbell|Campbell]] and [[Sinclair Lewis]], et al.\u2014but I have learned more from you than from any of the others and perhaps more than for all the others put together{{nbsp}}...<ref>William H. Patterson. ''Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century''. New York: Tor Books, 2014, p. 200</ref></blockquote>\n\nSmith expressed a preference for inventing fictional technologies that were not strictly impossible (so far as the science of the day was aware) but highly unlikely: \"the more highly improbable a concept is\u2014short of being contrary to mathematics whose fundamental operations involve no neglect of infinitesimals\u2014the better I like it\" was his phrase.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, E.E.|title=[[Of Worlds Beyond]]|page= 84|edition= Advent }}</ref>\n\n<!-- 2013-03-26 these two new paragraphs don't fit section heading \"Critical opinion\" but neither does the old content -->''Lensman'' was one of five finalists when the 1966 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] judged [[Foundation series|Isaac Asimov's ''Foundation'']] the Best All-Time Series.<ref name=SFAwards>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit125.html#4842|author=Smith, Edward E.|title=The Locus Index of SF Awards: Index of Literary Nominees|website=[[Locus Publications]]|accessdate=March 26, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016201144/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit125.html#4842|archivedate=October 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] inducted Smith in 2004.<ref name=sfhof-old>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.midamericon.org/halloffame/ \n |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame \n |website=Mid American Science Fiction and Fantasy Conventions, Inc. \n |accessdate=March 26, 2013 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521070009/http://www.midamericon.org/halloffame/ \n |archivedate=May 21, 2013 \n |df=mdy \n}} This was the official website of the hall of fame to 2004.</ref>\n\n==Extending the ''Lensman'' universe==\n\n''Vortex Blasters'' (also known as ''Masters of the Vortex'') is set in the same universe as the ''Lensman'' novels. It is an extension to the main storyline which takes place between ''Galactic Patrol'' and ''Children of the Lens'', and introduces a different type of psionics from that used by the Lensmen. ''Spacehounds of IPC'' is not a part of the series, despite occasional erroneous statements to the contrary. (It is listed as a novel in the series in some paperback editions of the 1970s.)\n\nRobert A. Heinlein reported that Smith had planned a seventh ''Lensman'' novel, set after the events described in ''Children of the Lens'', which was unpublishable at that time (the early 1960s).<ref>Robert A. Heinlein, \"Larger Than Life\", reprinted in ''[[Expanded Universe]]'', Ace Books, 1980.</ref> Smith told Heinlein that the new novel proceeded inexorably from matters left unresolved in ''Children'', a statement easily supported by a careful reading of ''Children''. Careful searches by people who knew Smith well (including Frederik Pohl, Smith's editor, and Verna Smith Trestrail, Smith's daughter) have failed to locate any material related to such a story.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Smith apparently never wrote any of it down.\n\nOn July 14, 1965, barely a month before his death, Smith gave written permission to [[William B. Ellern]] to continue the ''Lensman'' series, which led to the publishing of \"Moon Prospector\" in 1965 and ''New Lensman'' in 1976. Smith's long-time friend, [[Dave Kyle]], wrote three authorized added novels in the ''Lensman'' series that provided background about the major nonhuman Lensmen: ''Dragon Lensman'', ''Lensman from Rigel'', and ''Z-Lensman''.\n\n==Influence on science and the military==\n\nSmith was widely read by scientists and engineers from the 1930s into the 1970s. Literary precursors of ideas which arguably entered the military-scientific complex include [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]] (''Triplanetary''), [[Stealth technology|stealth]] (''Gray Lensman''), the [[OODA loop]], [[Command and control|C3]]-based warfare, and the [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] (''Gray Lensman'').\n\nAn inarguable influence was described in a June 11, 1947, letter<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell to E. E. Smith, pages 1\u20132, Dated June 11, 1947.</ref> to Smith from John W. Campbell (the editor of ''Astounding'', where much of the ''Lensman'' series was originally published). In it, Campbell relayed Captain [[Cal Laning]]'s<ref>Presumably, this is later Rear Admiral Caleb Lanning, shipmate, friend, and occasional co-author of Heinlein.</ref> acknowledgment that he had used Smith's ideas for displaying the battlespace situation (called the \"tank\" in the stories) in the design of the [[United States Navy]]'s ships' [[Combat information center|Combat Information Centers]]. \"The entire set-up was taken specifically, directly, and consciously from the ''Directrix''. In your story, you reached the situation the Navy was in\u2014more communication channels than integration techniques to handle it. You proposed such an integrating technique and proved how advantageous it could be. You, sir, were 100% right. As the Japanese Navy\u2014not the hypothetical Boskonian fleet\u2014learned at an appalling cost.\"\n\nOne underlying theme of the later ''Lensman'' novels was the difficulty in maintaining military secrecy\u2014as advanced capabilities are revealed, the opposing side can often duplicate them. This point was also discussed extensively by John Campbell in his letter to Smith.<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell to E. E. Smith, page 2-3, Dated June 11, 1947.</ref> Also in the later ''Lensman'' novels, and particular after the \"Battle of Klovia\" broke the Boskonian's power base at the end of ''Second Stage Lensmen'', the Boskonian forces and particularly Kandron of Onlo reverted to terroristic tactics to attempt to demoralize Civilization, thus providing an early literary glimpse into this modern problem of both law enforcement and military response. The use of \"Vee-two\" gas by the pirates attacking the ''Hyperion'' in ''Triplanetary'' (in both magazine and book appearances) also suggests anticipation of the terrorist uses of poison gases. (But note that Smith lived through WW I, when the use of poison gas on troops was well known to the populace; extending the assumption that pirates might use it if they could obtain it was no great extension of the present-day knowledge.)\n\nThe beginning of the story ''Skylark of Space'' describes in relative detail the protagonist's research into separation of platinum group residues, subsequent experiments involving electrolysis, and the discovery of a process evocative of [[cold fusion]] (over 50 years before [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]]). He describes a nuclear process yielding large amounts of energy and producing only negligible radioactive waste\u2014which then goes on to form the basis of the adventures in the Skylark books. Smith's general description of the process of discovery is highly evocative of R\u00f6ntgen's descriptions of his discovery of the [[X-ray]].\n\nAnother theme of the ''Skylark'' novels involves precursors of modern information technology. The humanoid aliens encountered in the first novel have developed a primitive technology called the \"mechanical educator\", which allows direct conversion of brain waves into intelligible thought for transmission to others or for electrical storage. By the third novel in the series, ''Skylark of Valeron'', this technology has grown into an \"Electronic Brain\" which is capable of computation on all \"bands\" of energy\u2014electromagnetism, gravity, and \"tachyonic\" energy and radiation bands included. This is itself derived from a discussion of reductionist atomic theory in the second novel, ''Skylark Three'', which brings to mind modern quark and sub-quark theories of elementary particle physics.\n\n==Literary influences==\n\nIn his 1947 essay \"The Epic of Space\", Smith listed (by last name only) authors he enjoyed reading: John W. Campbell, [[L. Sprague de Camp]], Robert A. Heinlein, [[Murray Leinster]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[A. Merritt]] (specifically ''[[The Ship of Ishtar]]'', ''[[The Moon Pool]]'', ''[[The Snake Mother]]'', and ''[[Dwellers in the Mirage]]'', as well as the character John Kenton), [[C. L. Moore]] (specifically \"[[Jirel of Joiry]]\"), [[Roman Frederick Starzl]], [[Eric Temple Bell|John Taine]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] (specifically [[Tweel (A Martian Odyssey)|\"Tweerl\"]]<ref>\"The Epic of Space\" p. 80. The conventional spelling is \"Tweel\", though the most accurate spelling is \"Trrrweerrlll.\" (\"[[A Martian Odyssey]]\", ''The Best of Stanley G. Weinbaum'' p. 5.)</ref>), and [[Jack Williamson]]. In a passage on his preparation for writing the ''Lensman'' novels, he notes that Clinton Constantinescu's \"War of the Universe\" was not a masterpiece,<ref>Both Constantinescu's name and title are misspelled in the essay: Canstantinescu's \"War of the Universes\", p. 84.</ref><ref>Clinton Constantinescu (1912\u20131999), later Clinton Constant, was a [[Romanian Canadian]] chemical engineer and a member of the American Astronomical Society and several other scientific associations [http://d7beta.aas.org/obituaries/clinton-constant-1912-1999] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223085228/http://d7beta.aas.org/obituaries/clinton-constant-1912-1999 |date=February 23, 2013 }}. \"War of the Universe\", one of his forays into science fiction, depicted a grand multisided space melee using a great variety of superscience weapons, and involving various human races which developed independently of each other on many planets, as well as insectoid, bird-like, and termite-like creatures. A summary is provided on p. 83 of Everett Franklin Bleiler and Richard Bleiler's ''\"Science-fiction: The Gernsback Years\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PbMdeizaCNcC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=%22Clinton+Constant%22&source=bl&ots=ODzjoiJKPC&sig=tmzDxFeXNJN0WNUKp7Z5XYFERWc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=05wPUdjbEJHHsgbwmoGIDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=%22Clinton%20Constant%22&f=false]</ref> but says that Starzl and Williamson were masters; this suggests that Starzl's Interplanetary Flying Patrol may have been an influence on Smith's Triplanetary Patrol, later the ''Galactic Patrol''. The feeding of the Overlords of Delgon upon the [[Energy (esotericism)|life-force]] of their victims at the end of chapter five of ''Galactic Patrol'' seems a clear allusion to chapter 29 of ''The Moon Pool'', Merritt's account of the Taithu and the power of love in chapters 29 and 34 also bear some resemblance to the end of ''Children of the Lens.''<ref>''The Moon Pool,''  A. Merritt, chapters 29 and 34</ref> Smith also mentions [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], complaining about loose ends at the end of one of his novels.\n\nSmith acknowledges the help of the Galactic Roamers writers' workshop, plus [[E. Everett Evans]], Ed Counts, an unnamed aeronautical engineer, Dr. James Enright, and Dr. Richard W. Dodson. Smith's daughter, Verna, lists the following authors as visitors to the Smith household in her youth: [[Lloyd Arthur Eshbach]], Heinlein, [[Dave Kyle]], [[Wilson Tucker|Bob Tucker]], Williamson, Pohl, Merritt, and the Galactic Roamers. Smith cites Bigelow's ''Theoretical Chemistry\u2013Fundamentals'' as a justification for the possibility of the [[inertialess drive]]. Also, an extended reference is made to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s \"[http://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_bohdathone_notes.htm Ballad of Boh Da Thone]\" in ''Gray Lensman'' (chapter 22, \"Regeneration\", in a conversation between Kinnison and MacDougall). Again in ''Gray Lensman'', Smith quotes from Merritt\u2019s ''Dwellers in the Mirage'', even name-checking the author:\n\n{{quote|He could not even pray, with immortal Merritt's Dwayanu, \"Luka - turn your wheel so that I need not slay this woman!\"}}\n\n[[Sam Moskowitz]]'s biographical essay on Smith in ''Seekers of Tomorrow'' states that he regularly read ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' magazine, and everything by [[H. G. Wells]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Moskowitz also notes that Smith's \"reading enthusiasms included poetry, philosophy, ancient and medieval history, and all of English literature\".<ref>Moskowitz p. 14.</ref> (Smith's grandson notes that he spoke, and sang, German.<ref>Al Trestrail, in Lucchetti, p. 20.</ref>) The influence of these is not readily apparent, except in the Roman section of ''Triplanetary'', and in the impeccable but convoluted grammar of Smith's narration. Some influence of 19th-century [[philosophy of language]] may be detectable in the account in ''Galactic Patrol'' of the Lens of [[Arisia]] as a [[universal translator]], which is reminiscent of [[Frege]]'s strong [[Philosophical realism|realism]] about ''Sinn'', that is, thought or sense.\n\nBoth Moskowitz and Smith's daughter Verna Smith Trestrail report that Smith had a troubled relationship with John Campbell, the editor of ''Astounding''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Smith's most successful works were published under Campbell, but the degree of influence is uncertain. The original outline for the ''Lensman'' series had been accepted by [[F. Orlin Tremaine]],<ref name=\"mosk19\">Moskowitz p. 19</ref> and Smith angered Campbell by showing loyalty to Tremaine at his new magazine, ''Comet'', when he sold him \"The Vortex Blaster\" in 1941.<ref>Moskowitz p. 21</ref> Campbell's announcement of ''Children of the Lens'', in 1947, was less than enthusiastic.<ref>Moskowitz p. 23.</ref> Campbell later said that he published it only reluctantly,<ref>Sanders p. 15.</ref> though he praised it privately,<ref>Letter to [[Clifford Simak]] June 18, 1953, ''The John W. Campbell Letters'' Volume 1, p. 177.</ref> and bought little from Smith thereafter.\n\n==Derivative works and influence on popular culture==\n\n* [[Randall Garrett]] wrote a parody entitled ''[[Backstage Lensman]]'' which Smith reportedly enjoyed. [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] also parodied Smith's work in the novel, ''[[Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers]]''.\n* Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s space battle in ''[[Earthlight]]'' was based on the attack on the Mardonalian fortress in chapter seven of ''[[Skylark Three]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Arthur C. | authorlink = Arthur C.

Efforts to print translations of the associated [[manga]] in the United States in the early 1990s without payment of royalties to the Smith family were successfully blocked in court by Verna Smith Trestrail with the help of several California science-fiction authors and fans.\n* In his biography, [[George Lucas]] reveals that the ''Lensman'' novels were a major influence on his youth. [[J.

This was somewhat of a tribute to Smith. May had written an early SF work called Dune Roller in 1950, and had attended several Science Fiction Conventions in the early '50's, where she met and came to know Smith personally.\n\n==Fictional appearances==\n\nSmith himself appears as a character in the 2006 novel ''[[The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril]]'' by [[Paul Malmont]]. The novel describes friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s. He also appears as \"Lensman Ted Smith\" in the 1980 novel ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' and as \"Commander Ted Smith\" in the 1985 novel ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'', both by Robert A. Heinlein. It is also suggested that he was one of the inspirations for Heinlein's character [[Lazarus Long]]. Christopher Nuttall incorporates a fictional quote from \u201cEdward E.

He lived nearby in the Seaton Place Apartments with his wife, [[Lee Hawkins Garby]]. A long discussion about journeys into outer space ensued, and it was suggested that Smith should write down his ideas and speculations as a story about interstellar travel. Although he was interested, Smith believed after some thought that some [[romantic fiction|romantic]] elements would be required and he was uncomfortable with that.\n\nMrs. Garby offered to take care of the love interest and the romantic dialogue, and Smith decided to give it a try. The sources of inspirations for the main characters in the novel were themselves; the \"Seatons\" and \"Cranes\" were based on the Smiths and Garbys, respectively.<ref>Sanders pp. 8\u20139, Moskowitz p. 14.</ref> About one third of ''[[The Skylark of Space]]'' was completed by the end of 1916, when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it.\n\nSmith earned his master's degree in chemistry from the [[George Washington University]] in 1917, studying under Dr. [[Charles Edward Munroe|Charles E.

Five years passed before acceptance by the first science-fiction magazine on the American market, and two more years elapsed before it was published.\"  This is not consistent with other sources.</ref> He submitted it to many book publishers and magazines, spending more in postage than he would eventually receive for its publication. Bob Davis, editor of ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', sent an encouraging rejection letter in 1922, saying that he liked the novel personally, but that it was too far out for his readers.<ref>Sanders, p. 9; Moskowitz, p. 15.</ref> (According to [http://fanac.org/fanzines/Spaceways/Spaceways01-07.html Warner], but no other source, Smith began work on the sequel, ''Skylark III'', before the first book was accepted.) Finally, upon seeing the April 1927 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', he submitted it to that magazine; it was accepted, initially for $75, later raised to $125.<ref>Sanders, pp. 1, 9; Moskowitz, p. 15. Both sources say that [[T.

The book does, however, have significant scientific implausibilities, for example the breathable atmosphere on Saturn and some of Jupiter and its satellites.</ref> Even in 1938, after he had written ''Galactic Patrol'', Smith considered it his finest work;<ref name = \"warner\"/> he later said of it, \"This was really scientific fiction; not, like the Skylarks, pseudo-science\";<ref>Sheridan p. 3</ref> and even at the end of his career, he considered it his only work of true science fiction.<ref>Rogers p. 26.</ref> It was published in the July through September 1931 issues of ''Amazing,'' with [[T.

So when [[Harry Bates (author)|Harry Bates]], editor of ''[[Astounding Stories]]'', offered Smith 2\u00a2/word\u2014payable on publication\u2014for his next story, he agreed; this meant that it could not be a sequel to ''Spacehounds.''<ref name=\"mosk16\"/>\n\nThis book would be ''[[Triplanetary (novel)|Triplanetary]]'', \"in which scientific detail would not be bothered about, and in which his imagination would run riot.\"<ref name=\"warner\">Warner.</ref> Indeed, characters within the story point out its psychological<ref>Lyman Cleveland's comment on the easy availability of \"solid asteroids of iron\", ''Amazing'' March 1934, p. 16, first edition p.196, as proving the pointlessness of the Nevians' attack.</ref> and scientific<ref>Cleveland's expectation, correct according to [[special relativity]], that inertialess travel would not be faster than light in the home [[Frame of reference|reference frame]], p. 223.</ref> implausibilities, and sometimes even seem to suggest self-parody.<ref>Nerado's comment, \"Destruction, always destruction ... they are a useless race\", February p. 81, p. 160.</ref> At other times, they are conspicuously silent about obvious implausibilities.<ref>Costigan & Bradley's lack of comment when they discover that the ship they are on has passed the speed of light, February p. 84, p. 168.

Shortly after it was accepted, [[F. Orlin Tremaine]], the new editor of the revived ''Astounding'', offered one cent a word for ''Triplanetary''; when he learned that he was too late, he suggested a third ''Skylark'' novel instead.<ref>Moskowitz p. 17</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 1933\u201334, Smith worked on ''The Skylark of Valeron'', but he felt that the story was getting out of control; he sent his first draft to Tremaine, with a distraught note asking for suggestions. Tremaine accepted the rough draft for $850, and announced it in the June 1934 issue, with a full-page editorial and a three-quarter-page advertisement. The novel was published in the August 1934 through February 1935 issues.<ref name=isfdb/> [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Astounding'']]'s circulation rose by 10,000 for the first issue, and its two main competitors, ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'' and ''[[Wonder Stories]]'', fell into financial difficulties, both skipping issues within a year.<ref>Moskowitz p. 17\u20138, Rogers pp. 24\u201330. Rogers agrees with Moskowitz that ''Astounding'' became the leading science-fiction magazine during this period, but does not attribute this solely to Smith.</ref>\n\n===The ''Lensman'' series===\n\nIn January 1936, a time period where he was already an established science-fiction writer, he took a job for salary plus profit-sharing, as a food technologist (a cereal chemist) at the Dawn Doughnut Company of [[Jackson, Michigan]].<ref>Moskowitz p. 19, Warner.</ref> This initially entailed almost a year's worth of 18-hour days and seven-day workweeks. Individuals who knew Smith confirmed that he had a role in developing mixes for doughnuts and other pastries, but the contention that he developed the first process for making powdered sugar adhere to doughnuts cannot be substantiated.<ref>The earliest web source for this claim seems to be [http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/emergingtech/0,39020357,2099814,00.htm Computer games: 40 years of fun, ZDNet UK, November 23, 2001] by Graeme Wearden; the article does not provide a source, and the claim may have been added by a colleague. (Private correspondence, July 4, 2006.) Searches at Google patent (www.google.com/patent) on various combinations of Smith's name have not uncovered any patents which relate to his professional biography and supposed accomplishments in the pastry field.</ref> Smith was reportedly dislocated from his job at Dawn Doughnuts by prewar rationing in early 1940.<ref name=\"dict\">The Dictionary of Literary Biography,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} quoted at http://www.bookrags.com/Edward_Elgar accessed May 8, 2007.</ref>\n\nSmith had been contemplating writing a \"space-police novel\" since early 1927;<ref>\"The Epic of Space\" p. 83.</ref> once he had \"the Lensmen's universe fairly well set up\", he reviewed his science-fiction collection for \"cops-and-robbers\" stories.

Note that Smith's account in \"The Epic of Space\" does not mention Tremaine's commitment. Moskowitz says that the outline was 80 pages; Smith only mentions that the section on ''[[Galactic Patrol]]'' was \"only a few pages long.\"</ref> Segmenting the story into four novels required considerable effort to avoid dangling loose ends; Smith cites [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] as a negative example.<ref name=\"epic85\">\"The Epic of Space\" p. 85.</ref> After the outline was complete, he wrote a more detailed outline of ''[[Galactic Patrol]]'', plus a detailed graph of its structure, with \"peaks of emotional intensity and the valleys of characterization and background material.\" He notes, however, that he was never able to follow any of his outlines at all closely, as the \"characters get away from me and do exactly as they damn please.\"<ref>\"The Epic of Space\" p. 86.</ref> After completing the rough draft of ''Galactic Patrol'', he wrote the concluding chapter of the last book in the series, ''[[Children of the Lens]].''<ref name = \"mosk19\"/> ''Galactic Patrol'' was published in the September 1937 through February 1938 issues of ''Astounding''; unlike the revised book edition, it was not set in the same universe as ''Triplanetary''.<ref>The Commandant's account of the Patrol's early history at the beginning of the magazine version of ''Galactic Patrol'' does not describe what happened in the magazine version of ''Triplanetary''; the reference to Virgil Samms and the Triplanetary Patrol is a later interpolation. (''Astounding'' September 1937 pp. 12\u201313; cp. [[Fantasy Press]] edition pp. 8\u20139.) The reference to \"the days of the semi-inert drive\" and the Third Galactic Survey on page 34 of the same issue is not consistent with the history of partial inertialessness in either version of ''Triplanetary'', and is omitted from page 42 of the [[Fantasy Press]] edition. (''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'' March 1934 pp. 28 & 33; cp. Fantasy Press edition pp. 223 & 231.) See also Gharlane's Lens FAQ Question 1. The Arisians' near-omniscience about the future is also interpolated, e.g., ''Astounding'' January 1938 p. 127 vs. first edition p. 205.</ref>\n\n''[[Gray Lensman]]'', the fourth book in the series, appeared in ''Astounding''{{'}}s October 1939 through January 1940 issues. (Note that the frequent British spelling \"grey\" is simply a recurrent mistake, starting with the cover of the first installment; Moskowitz's usage, ''\"The Grey Lensman\",'' is even harder to justify.<ref>Gharlane Lens FAQ Question 1 and footnote to rec.arts.sf.written [https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written/msg/59129aa183783b05 posting]; Moskowitz p. 20.</ref>) ''Gray Lensman'' (and its [http://www.ethanfleischer.com/lensman/gallery_gl.htm cover illustration]) was extremely well received. [[John W. Campbell|Campbell]]'s editorial in the December issue suggested that the October issue was the best issue of ''Astounding'' ever, and ''Gray Lensman'' was first place in the Analytical Laboratory statistics \"by a lightyear\", with three runners-up in a distant tie for second place.<ref>''Astounding'' December 1939 pp. 6, 91.</ref> The cover was also praised by readers in ''Brass Tacks'', and Campbell noted, \"We got a letter from E.

An extended segment in the novel version of ''Triplanetary'', set during World War II, suggests intimate familiarity with explosives and munitions manufacturing. Some biographers cite as fact that, just as Smith's protagonist in this segment lost his job over failure to approve substandard munitions, Smith did, as well. Smith began work for the J. W. Allen Company (a manufacturer of doughnut and frosting mixes) in 1946 and worked for them until his professional retirement in 1957.<ref name=\"dict\" />\n\n===Retirement and late writing===\n\nAfter Smith retired, his wife and he lived in [[Clearwater, Florida]],<ref name=\"wt640406\"/> in the fall and winter, driving the smaller of their two trailers to [[Seaside, Oregon]], each April, often stopping at [[science fiction convention]]s on the way. (Smith did not like to fly.<ref>Pohl in Lucchetti p. 15, Al Trestrail in Lucchetti p. 19. Al Trestrail (p. 20) and Pohl (p. 14) also mention church attendance (Pohl in a fictional context), which none of the other sources seem to.</ref>) In 1963, he was presented the inaugural [[First Fandom Hall of Fame award]] at the [[21st World Science Fiction Convention]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"wt640406\"/> Some of his biography is captured in an essay by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], which was reprinted in the collection ''Expanded Universe'' in 1980. A more detailed, although allegedly<ref>[[Gharlane of Eddore (Pen-name)|Gharlane of Eddore]], [http://www.chronology.org/noframes/lens/ Lensman FAQ], under \"References.\"</ref> error-ridden biography is in Sam Moskowitz's ''Seekers of Tomorrow.''\n\nRobert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein dedicated his 1958 novel ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' \"To Edward E. Smith, PhD\".<ref>{{cite book | author=Heinlein, Robert A | title=Methuselah's Children | publisher=Baen Publishing Enterprises | year=1986 | isbn=0-671-65597-3}}</ref>) Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his \"unrealistic\" heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of ''[[Spacehounds of IPC]]''. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of \"superman\" when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by [[bone conduction]]\u2014a process apparently improvised on the spot.\n\nIn his nonseries novels written after his professional retirement, ''Galaxy Primes'', ''Subspace Explorers'', and ''Subspace Encounter'', E. E. Smith explores themes of telepathy and other mental abilities collectively called \"psionics\", and of the conflict between [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and socialistic/communistic influences in the colonization of other planets. ''Galaxy Primes'' was written after critics such as [[Groff Conklin]] and [[P. Schuyler Miller]] in the early '50s accused his fiction of being pass\u00e9, and he made an attempt to do something more in line with the concepts about which ''Astounding'' editor John W. Campbell encouraged his writers to make stories. Despite this, it was rejected by Campbell, and it was eventually published by ''Amazing Stories'' in 1959. His late story \"The Imperial Stars\" (1964), featuring a troupe of circus performers involved in sabotage in a galactic empire, recaptured some of the atmosphere from his earlier works and was intended as the first in a new series, with outlines of later parts rumored to still exist.<ref>[http://port70.net/cgi/httpgate.rss.cgi?9text/books/By%20Author/smith%2C%20edward%20elmer/Smith%2C%20E.%20E.%20Doc%20-%20Best%20of%20EE%20Doc%20Smith.pdf The Best of E.E. \"Doc\" Smith. Classic Adventures in Space By One of SF's Great Originals]</ref>. In fact, the Imperial Stars characters and concepts were continued by author [[Stephen Goldin]] as the \"[[Family D'Alembert]] series\". While the book covers indicate the series was written by Smith and Goldin together, Goldin only ever had Smith's original novella to expand upon.\n\nThe fourth ''Skylark'' novel, ''[[Skylark DuQuesne]]'', ran in the June to October 1965 issues of ''If'', beginning once again as the cover story. Editor [[Frederik Pohl]] introduced it with a one-page summary of the previous stories, which were all at least 30 years old.<ref name=isfdb/>\n\n===Lord Tedric===\n\nSmith published two novelettes entitled \"Tedric\" in ''Other Worlds Science Fiction Stories'' (1953) and \"Lord Tedric\" in ''Universe Science Fiction'' (1954). These were almost completely forgotten until after Smith's death. In 1975, a compendium of Smith's works was published, entitled ''The Best of E. E. \"Doc\" Smith'', containing these two short stories, excerpts from several of his major works, and another short story first published in ''Worlds of If'' in 1964 entitled \"The Imperial Stars\".\n\nIn Smith's original short stories, Tedric was a smith (both blacksmith and whitesmith) residing in a small town near a castle in a situation roughly equivalent to [[History of England#England under the Plantagenets|England of the 1200s]]. He received instruction in advanced metallurgy from a [[time-travel]]er who wanted to change the situation in his own time by modifying certain events of the past. From this instruction, he was able to build better suits of armor and help defeat the villains of the piece. Unlike Eklund's later novels based on these short stories, the original Tedric never left his own time or planet, and fought purely local enemies of his own time period.\n\nA few years later and 13 years after Smith's death, Verna Smith arranged with [[Gordon Eklund]] to publish another novel of the same name about the same fictional character, introducing it as \"a new series conceived by E. E. 'Doc' Smith\". Eklund later went on to publish the other novels in the series, one or two under the pseudonym \"E. E. 'Doc' Smith\" or \"E. E. Smith\". The protagonist possesses heroic qualities similar to those of the heroes in Smith's original novels and can communicate with an extra-dimensional race of beings known as the Scientists, whose archenemy is Fra Villion, a mysterious character described as a dark knight, skilled in whip-sword combat, and evil genius behind the creation of a planetoid-sized \"iron sphere\" armed with a weapon capable of destroying planets. As a result, Smith is believed by many to be the unacknowledged progenitor of themes that would appear in ''[[Star Wars]]''. In fact, however, these appear in the sequels written by others after Smith's death.\n\n==Critical opinion==\n\nSmith's novels are generally considered to be classic [[space opera]]s,<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Sir Arthur C.]]|title=[[Astounding Days]]|pages= 102\u20133 ff}}</ref> and he is sometimes called the first of the three \"[[nova]]s\" of 20th-century science fiction (with [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]] as the second and third novas).<ref>Clarke, ''op. cit.'' p. 120, citing and agreeing with Isaac Asimov in his introduction to ''The Best of Stanley G. Weinbaum'', who was the second nova.</ref>\n\nHeinlein credited him for being his main influence: \n\n<blockquote>I have learned from many writers\u2014from [[Jules Verne|Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells|Wells]] and [[John W. Campbell|Campbell]] and [[Sinclair Lewis]], et al.\u2014but I have learned more from you than from any of the others and perhaps more than for all the others put together{{nbsp}}...<ref>William H. Patterson. ''Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century''. New York: Tor Books, 2014, p. 200</ref></blockquote>\n\nSmith expressed a preference for inventing fictional technologies that were not strictly impossible (so far as the science of the day was aware) but highly unlikely: \"the more highly improbable a concept is\u2014short of being contrary to mathematics whose fundamental operations involve no neglect of infinitesimals\u2014the better I like it\" was his phrase.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, E.E.|title=[[Of Worlds Beyond]]|page= 84|edition= Advent }}</ref>\n\n<!-- 2013-03-26 these two new paragraphs don't fit section heading \"Critical opinion\" but neither does the old content -->''Lensman'' was one of five finalists when the 1966 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] judged the [[Foundation series|Isaac Asimov's ''Foundation'']] the Best All-Time Series.<ref name=SFAwards>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit125.html#4842|author=Smith, Edward E.|title=The Locus Index of SF Awards: Index of Literary Nominees|website=[[Locus Publications]]|accessdate=March 26, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016201144/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit125.html#4842|archivedate=October 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] inducted Smith in 2004.<ref name=sfhof-old>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.midamericon.org/halloffame/ \n |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame \n |website=Mid American Science Fiction and Fantasy Conventions, Inc. \n |accessdate=March 26, 2013 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521070009/http://www.midamericon.org/halloffame/ \n |archivedate=May 21, 2013 \n |df=mdy \n}} This was the official website of the hall of fame to 2004.</ref>\n\n==Extending the ''Lensman'' universe==\n\n''Vortex Blasters'' (also known as ''Masters of the Vortex'') is set in the same universe as the ''Lensman'' novels. It is an extension to the main storyline which takes place between ''Galactic Patrol'' and ''Children of the Lens'', and introduces a different type of psionics from that used by the Lensmen. ''Spacehounds of IPC'' is not a part of the series, despite occasional erroneous statements to the contrary. (It is listed as a novel in the series in some paperback editions of the 1970s.)\n\nRobert A. Heinlein reported that Smith had planned a seventh ''Lensman'' novel, set after the events described in ''Children of the Lens'', which was unpublishable at that time (the early 1960s).<ref>Robert A. Heinlein, \"Larger Than Life\", reprinted in ''[[Expanded Universe]]'', Ace Books, 1980.</ref> Smith told Heinlein that the new novel proceeded inexorably from matters left unresolved in ''Children'', a statement easily supported by a careful reading of ''Children''. Careful searches by people who knew Smith well (including Frederik Pohl, Smith's editor, and Verna Smith Trestrail, Smith's daughter) have failed to locate any material related to such a story.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Smith apparently never wrote any of it down.\n\nOn July 14, 1965, barely a month before his death, Smith gave written permission to [[William B. Ellern]] to continue the ''Lensman'' series, which led to the publishing of \"Moon Prospector\" in 1965 and ''New Lensman'' in 1976. Smith's long-time friend, [[Dave Kyle]], wrote three authorized added novels in the ''Lensman'' series that provided background about the major nonhuman Lensmen: ''Dragon Lensman'', ''Lensman from Rigel'', and ''Z-Lensman''.\n\n==Influence on science and the military==\n\nSmith was widely read by scientists and engineers from the 1930s into the 1970s. Literary precursors of ideas which arguably entered the military-scientific complex include [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]] (''Triplanetary''), [[Stealth technology|stealth]] (''Gray Lensman''), the [[OODA loop]], [[Command and control|C3]]-based warfare, and the [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] (''Gray Lensman'').\n\nAn inarguable influence was described in a June 11, 1947, letter<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell to E. E. Smith, pages 1\u20132, Dated June 11, 1947.</ref> to Smith from John W. Campbell (the editor of ''Astounding'', where much of the ''Lensman'' series was originally published). In it, Campbell relayed Captain [[Cal Laning]]'s<ref>Presumably, this is later Rear Admiral Caleb Lanning, shipmate, friend, and occasional co-author of Heinlein.</ref> acknowledgment that he had used Smith's ideas for displaying the battlespace situation (called the \"tank\" in the stories) in the design of the [[United States Navy]]'s ships' [[Combat information center|Combat Information Centers]]. \"The entire set-up was taken specifically, directly, and consciously from the ''Directrix''. In your story, you reached the situation the Navy was in\u2014more communication channels than integration techniques to handle it. You proposed such an integrating technique and proved how advantageous it could be. You, sir, were 100% right. As the Japanese Navy\u2014not the hypothetical Boskonian fleet\u2014learned at an appalling cost.\"\n\nOne underlying theme of the later ''Lensman'' novels was the difficulty in maintaining military secrecy\u2014as advanced capabilities are revealed, the opposing side can often duplicate them. This point was also discussed extensively by John Campbell in his letter to Smith.<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell to E. E. Smith, page 2-3, Dated June 11, 1947.</ref> Also in the later ''Lensman'' novels, and particular after the \"Battle of Klovia\" broke the Boskonian's power base at the end of ''Second Stage Lensmen'', the Boskonian forces and particularly Kandron of Onlo reverted to terroristic tactics to attempt to demoralize Civilization, thus providing an early literary glimpse into this modern problem of both law enforcement and military response. The use of \"Vee-two\" gas by the pirates attacking the ''Hyperion'' in ''Triplanetary'' (in both magazine and book appearances) also suggests anticipation of the terrorist uses of poison gases. (But note that Smith lived through WW I, when the use of poison gas on troops was well known to the populace; extending the assumption that pirates might use it if they could obtain it was no great extension of the present-day knowledge.)\n\nThe beginning of the story ''Skylark of Space'' describes in relative detail the protagonist's research into separation of platinum group residues, subsequent experiments involving electrolysis, and the discovery of a process evocative of [[cold fusion]] (over 50 years before [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]]). He describes a nuclear process yielding large amounts of energy and producing only negligible radioactive waste\u2014which then goes on to form the basis of the adventures in the Skylark books. Smith's general description of the process of discovery is highly evocative of R\u00f6ntgen's descriptions of his discovery of the [[X-ray]].\n\nAnother theme of the ''Skylark'' novels involves precursors of modern information technology. The humanoid aliens encountered in the first novel have developed a primitive technology called the \"mechanical educator\", which allows direct conversion of brain waves into intelligible thought for transmission to others or for electrical storage. By the third novel in the series, ''Skylark of Valeron'', this technology has grown into an \"Electronic Brain\" which is capable of computation on all \"bands\" of energy\u2014electromagnetism, gravity, and \"tachyonic\" energy and radiation bands included. This is itself derived from a discussion of reductionist atomic theory in the second novel, ''Skylark Three'', which brings to mind modern quark and sub-quark theories of elementary particle physics.\n\n==Literary influences==\n\nIn his 1947 essay \"The Epic of Space\", Smith listed (by last name only) authors he enjoyed reading: John W. Campbell, [[L. Sprague de Camp]], Robert A. Heinlein, [[Murray Leinster]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[A. Merritt]] (specifically ''[[The Ship of Ishtar]]'', ''[[The Moon Pool]]'', ''[[The Snake Mother]]'', and ''[[Dwellers in the Mirage]]'', as well as the character John Kenton), [[C. L. Moore]] (specifically \"[[Jirel of Joiry]]\"), [[Roman Frederick Starzl]], [[Eric Temple Bell|John Taine]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] (specifically [[Tweel (A Martian Odyssey)|\"Tweerl\"]]<ref>\"The Epic of Space\" p. 80. The conventional spelling is \"Tweel\", though the most accurate spelling is \"Trrrweerrlll.\" (\"[[A Martian Odyssey]]\", ''The Best of Stanley G. Weinbaum'' p. 5.)</ref>), and [[Jack Williamson]]. In a passage on his preparation for writing the ''Lensman'' novels, he notes that Clinton Constantinescu's \"War of the Universe\" was not a masterpiece,<ref>Both Constantinescu's name and title are misspelled in the essay: Canstantinescu's \"War of the Universes\", p. 84.</ref><ref>Clinton Constantinescu (1912\u20131999), later Clinton Constant, was a [[Romanian Canadian]] chemical engineer and a member of the American Astronomical Society and several other scientific associations [http://d7beta.aas.org/obituaries/clinton-constant-1912-1999] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223085228/http://d7beta.aas.org/obituaries/clinton-constant-1912-1999 |date=February 23, 2013 }}. \"War of the Universe\", one of his forays into science fiction, depicted a grand multisided space melee using a great variety of superscience weapons, and involving various human races which developed independently of each other on many planets, as well as insectoid, bird-like, and termite-like creatures. A summary is provided on p. 83 of Everett Franklin Bleiler and Richard Bleiler's ''\"Science-fiction: The Gernsback Years\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PbMdeizaCNcC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=%22Clinton+Constant%22&source=bl&ots=ODzjoiJKPC&sig=tmzDxFeXNJN0WNUKp7Z5XYFERWc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=05wPUdjbEJHHsgbwmoGIDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=%22Clinton%20Constant%22&f=false]</ref> but says that Starzl and Williamson were masters; this suggests that Starzl's Interplanetary Flying Patrol may have been an influence on Smith's Triplanetary Patrol, later the ''Galactic Patrol''. The feeding of the Overlords of Delgon upon the [[Energy (esotericism)|life-force]] of their victims at the end of chapter five of ''Galactic Patrol'' seems a clear allusion to chapter 29 of ''The Moon Pool'', Merritt's account of the Taithu and the power of love in chapters 29 and 34 also bear some resemblance to the end of ''Children of the Lens.''<ref>''The Moon Pool,''  A. Merritt, chapters 29 and 34</ref> Smith also mentions [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], complaining about loose ends at the end of one of his novels.\n\nSmith acknowledges the help of the Galactic Roamers writers' workshop, plus [[E. Everett Evans]], Ed Counts, an unnamed aeronautical engineer, Dr. James Enright, and Dr. Richard W. Dodson. Smith's daughter, Verna, lists the following authors as visitors to the Smith household in her youth: [[Lloyd Arthur Eshbach]], Heinlein, [[Dave Kyle]], [[Wilson Tucker|Bob Tucker]], Williamson, Pohl, Merritt, and the Galactic Roamers. Smith cites Bigelow's ''Theoretical Chemistry\u2013Fundamentals'' as a justification for the possibility of the [[inertialess drive]]. Also, an extended reference is made to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s \"[http://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_bohdathone_notes.htm Ballad of Boh Da Thone]\" in ''Gray Lensman'' (chapter 22, \"Regeneration\", in a conversation between Kinnison and MacDougall). Again in ''Gray Lensman'', Smith quotes from Merritt\u2019s ''Dwellers in the Mirage'', even name-checking the author:\n\n{{quote|He could not even pray, with immortal Merritt's Dwayanu, \"Luka - turn your wheel so that I need not slay this woman!\"}}\n\n[[Sam Moskowitz]]'s biographical essay on Smith in ''Seekers of Tomorrow'' states that he regularly read ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' magazine, and everything by [[H. G. Wells]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Moskowitz also notes that Smith's \"reading enthusiasms included poetry, philosophy, ancient and medieval history, and all of English literature\".<ref>Moskowitz p. 14.</ref> (Smith's grandson notes that he spoke, and sang, German.<ref>Al Trestrail, in Lucchetti, p. 20.</ref>) The influence of these is not readily apparent, except in the Roman section of ''Triplanetary'', and in the impeccable but convoluted grammar of Smith's narration. Some influence of 19th-century [[philosophy of language]] may be detectable in the account in ''Galactic Patrol'' of the Lens of [[Arisia]] as a [[universal translator]], which is reminiscent of [[Frege]]'s strong [[Philosophical realism|realism]] about ''Sinn'', that is, thought or sense.\n\nBoth Moskowitz and Smith's daughter Verna Smith Trestrail report that Smith had a troubled relationship with John Campbell, the editor of ''Astounding''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Smith's most successful works were published under Campbell, but the degree of influence is uncertain. The original outline for the ''Lensman'' series had been accepted by [[F. Orlin Tremaine]],<ref name=\"mosk19\">Moskowitz p. 19</ref> and Smith angered Campbell by showing loyalty to Tremaine at his new magazine, ''Comet'', when he sold him \"The Vortex Blaster\" in 1941.<ref>Moskowitz p. 21</ref> Campbell's announcement of ''Children of the Lens'', in 1947, was less than enthusiastic.<ref>Moskowitz p. 23.</ref> Campbell later said that he published it only reluctantly,<ref>Sanders p. 15.</ref> though he praised it privately,<ref>Letter to [[Clifford Simak]] June 18, 1953, ''The John W. Campbell Letters'' Volume 1, p. 177.</ref> and bought little from Smith thereafter.\n\n==Derivative works and influence on popular culture==\n\n* [[Randall Garrett]] wrote a parody entitled ''[[Backstage Lensman]]'' which Smith reportedly enjoyed. [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] also parodied Smith's work in the novel, ''[[Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers]]''.\n* Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s space battle in ''[[Earthlight]]'' was based on the attack on the Mardonalian fortress in chapter seven of ''[[Skylark Three]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Arthur C. | authorlink = Arthur C.

Efforts to print translations of the associated [[manga]] in the United States in the early 1990s without payment of royalties to the Smith family were successfully blocked in court by Verna Smith Trestrail with the help of several California science-fiction authors and fans.\n* In his biography, [[George Lucas]] reveals that the ''Lensman'' novels were a major influence on his youth. [[J.

This was somewhat of a tribute to Smith. May had written an early SF work called Dune Roller in 1950, and had attended several Science Fiction Conventions in the early '50's, where she met and came to know Smith personally.\n\n==Fictional appearances==\n\nSmith himself appears as a character in the 2006 novel ''[[The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril]]'' by [[Paul Malmont]]. The novel describes friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s. He also appears as \"Lensman Ted Smith\" in the 1980 novel ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' and as \"Commander Ted Smith\" in the 1985 novel ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'', both by Robert A. Heinlein. It is also suggested that he was one of the inspirations for Heinlein's character [[Lazarus Long]]. Christopher Nuttall incorporates a fictional quote from \u201cEdward E.

With an estimated 600-900 species, the genus represents about half of its family. The plants are [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s or [[liana]]s, growing {{convert|4|-|20|m}} tall, with woody stems, the absence of articulated pedicels and armaments, and palmately compound leaves. \n\nSeveral species are grown in pots as [[houseplant]]s, most commonly ''[[Schefflera actinophylla]]'' (umbrella tree) and ''[[Schefflera arboricola]]'' (dwarf umbrella tree). Numerous [[cultivar]]s have been selected for various characters, most popularly for [[variegation|variegated]] or purple foliage. ''Schefflera'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]]n species including ''[[Batrachedra]] arenosella'' (recorded on ''S. stellata'').

For 2021, ''U.S. News & World Report'' ranked the University of Tulsa College of Law at #111 among all law schools in the United States. It is the only law school in the [[Tulsa Metropolitan Area]] and [[Northeastern Oklahoma|northeastern Oklahoma]].\n\n== History ==\nThe University of Tulsa College of Law was founded by local attorneys in 1923, during one of Tulsa's oil booms.  The law school was originally known simply as the Tulsa Law School and was independent of the [[University of Tulsa]]. Initially, classes took place in the Central High School building in downtown Tulsa, while the law library was in the Tulsa County courthouse, a few blocks away. The faculty initially consisted of practicing Tulsa attorneys who taught classes at night.<ref name=\"UTCL\">The University of Tulsa College of Law: History of the College of Law.\" Accessed April 25, 2012 [http://www.utulsa.edu/academics/colleges/college-of-law/About%20the%20College%20of%20Law/History%20of%20the%20College%20of%20Law.aspx]</ref>\n\nTulsa Law was formally absorbed by the [[University of Tulsa]] in 1943. A pioneering Tulsa attorney named John Rogers is credited with making this association.<ref name=\"TU-History\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU.aspx |title=.TU website \"History of TU.\" Accessed February 24, 2011 |access-date=March 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317033428/http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU.aspx |archive-date=March 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1949, the school moved into a downtown office building. In 1953, the school was accredited by the [[American Bar Association]]. During the 1950s and 60s, the library, classrooms and administrative offices were consolidated at a single location and full-time tenured and tenure-track research faculty were hired. The school became a member of the Association of American Law Schools in 1966. The name of the school was formally changed to the University of Tulsa College of Law.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Tulsa Law became increasingly prominent in the field of energy law and policy; during this period, the ''Energy Law Journal'' and the National Energy and Law Policy Institute were established at the law school (NELPI).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tulsa County Bar Association |title=Building Tulsa: Lawyers at Work |date=2003 |publisher=Hawk Publishing |location=Tulsa |page=112 }}</ref> The National Energy Law and Policy Institute was initially led by [[Kent Frizzell]], who had served as Assistant Attorney General of the United States from 1972\u20131973 and Undersecretary of the Department of the Interior from 1975\u20131977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/enrd/kent-frizzell |title=Kent Frizzell (1972\u20131973)| website=United States Department of Justice |accessdate=30 July 2018|date=2015-04-14}}</ref> During this time, Frizzell also taught at Tulsa Law.\n\nIn the 1990s, Tulsa Law developed a reputation for strength in legal history, hiring legal historian Bernard Schwartz (formerly of [[New York University Law School]]) and, later, [[Paul Finkelman]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Bernard Schwartz Dies at 74; Legal Scholar and Historian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/us/bernard-schwartz-dies-at-74-legal-scholar-and-historian.html|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=New York Times|date=26 December 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Law School Building==\nTulsa Law moved from downtown Tulsa to its present location on the University of Tulsa's main campus in 1973, where it was housed in what was then named John Rogers Hall. <ref name=\"UTCL\"/> The building was formally dedicated with a speech by U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William Rehnquist]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rhenquist|first1=William|title=LEGAL EDUCATION: A CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW|journal=Tulsa Law Journal|date=1974|volume=10|page=9|url=https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&context=tlr|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2016, the university decided to remove the name of John Rogers from the law school's building, in response to increased controversy about Rogers' role in the founding of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Tulsa in the 1920s.<ref>Laura Bult, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tulsa-law-school-remove-founder-due-kkk-associations-article-1.2626106 \"University of Tulsa law school to remove founder's name after discovering his affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan\"], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', May 5, 2016.</ref>\n\n== Academic Programs and Offerings ==\nTU College of Law offers [[Juris Doctor]] programs for full-time and part-time students.  TU Law also grants the degree of [[Master of Laws]], or [[LLM]], in the areas of Native American Law, Natural Resources and Energy Law, and International Law for foreign students.  Additionally, the College of Law offers two online Master of Jurisprudence (MJ) degrees in Indian law and energy law. Students  have the ability to obtain joint JD/MA degrees in a variety of fields including, history, English, psychology, as well as a joint [[JD/MBA]], joint JD/[[Master of Science|Masters in]] Taxation]], and joint JD/[[Master of Science|MS]] in geosciences, biological sciences, and finance.  TU Law offers certificate programs in sustainable energy and resources law, Native American law, and health law.\n\nThe College also hosts a number of endowed lecture series which bring renowned scholars and jurists to campus:\n* ''The John W. Hager Distinguished Lecture'' in Law has brought [[Lawrence Lessig]], [[William Eskridge]], [[Michelle Alexander]] and [[Harold Koh]] to speak at the College of Law in recent years.  \n* ''The Buck Colbert Franklin Memorial Civil Rights Lecture'' honors the pioneering attorney and early leader of Tulsa's black community (who was also the father of famed historian [[John Hope Franklin]]. This lecture series has brought [[Deborah Rhode]], [[Jerry Kang]] and [[Alfred Brophy]] to speak at TU Law.\n* ''The Stephanie K. Seymour Distinguished Lecture in Law'' is the only lecture series in the country established by former clerks to honor the judge for whom they served. This lecture calls attention to the scholarship of an untenured law professor whose dedication and passion mirror that of Judge Seymour.\n\nThe College of Law also has study abroad arrangements allowing students to study in [[Dublin]] or [[London]].\n\nThe University of Tulsa College of Law is a national leader in teaching scholarship and research in energy, environmental, and natural resources law and policy and Native American law.\n\n===Student-Edited Publications===\n*''Tulsa Law Review'', previously the ''Tulsa Law Journal'' from 1964\u20132001\n*''Energy Law Journal''\n\n== Clinical Offerings ==\n\n\nThe on-campus Boesche Legal Clinic offers students real-world experience under the supervision of clinical professors while providing pro bono legal services to disadvantaged populations.

For 2021, ''U.S. News & World Report'' ranked the University of Tulsa College of Law at #111 among all law schools in the United States. It is the only law school in the [[Tulsa Metropolitan Area]] and [[Northeastern Oklahoma|northeastern Oklahoma]].\n\n== History ==\nThe University of Tulsa College of Law was founded by local attorneys in 1923, during one of Tulsa's oil booms.  The law school was originally known simply as the Tulsa Law School and was independent of the [[University of Tulsa]]. Initially, classes took place in the Central High School building in downtown Tulsa, while the law library was in the Tulsa County courthouse, a few blocks away. The faculty initially consisted of practicing Tulsa attorneys who taught classes at night.<ref name=\"UTCL\">The University of Tulsa College of Law: History of the College of Law.\" Accessed April 25, 2012 [http://www.utulsa.edu/academics/colleges/college-of-law/About%20the%20College%20of%20Law/History%20of%20the%20College%20of%20Law.aspx]</ref>\n\nTulsa Law was formally absorbed by the [[University of Tulsa]] in 1943. A pioneering Tulsa attorney named John Rogers is credited with making this association.<ref name=\"TU-History\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU.aspx |title=.TU website \"History of TU.\" Accessed February 24, 2011 |access-date=March 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317033428/http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU.aspx |archive-date=March 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1949, the school moved into a downtown office building. In 1953, the school was accredited by the [[American Bar Association]]. During the 1950s and 60s, the library, classrooms and administrative offices were consolidated at a single location and full-time tenured and tenure-track research faculty were hired. The school became a member of the Association of American Law Schools in 1966. The name of the school was formally changed to the University of Tulsa College of Law.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Tulsa Law became increasingly prominent in the field of energy law and policy; during this period, the ''Energy Law Journal'' and the National Energy and Law Policy Institute were established at the law school (NELPI).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tulsa County Bar Association |title=Building Tulsa: Lawyers at Work |date=2003 |publisher=Hawk Publishing |location=Tulsa |page=112 }}</ref> The National Energy Law and Policy Institute was initially led by [[Kent Frizzell]], who had served as Assistant Attorney General of the United States from 1972\u20131973 and Undersecretary of the Department of the Interior from 1975\u20131977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/enrd/kent-frizzell |title=Kent Frizzell (1972\u20131973)| website=United States Department of Justice |accessdate=30 July 2018|date=2015-04-14}}</ref> During this time, Frizzell also taught at Tulsa Law.\n\nIn the 1990s, Tulsa Law developed a reputation for strength in legal history, hiring legal historian Bernard Schwartz (formerly of [[New York University Law School]]) and, later, [[Paul Finkelman]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Bernard Schwartz Dies at 74; Legal Scholar and Historian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/us/bernard-schwartz-dies-at-74-legal-scholar-and-historian.html|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=New York Times|date=26 December 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Law School Building==\nTulsa Law moved from downtown Tulsa to its present location on the University of Tulsa's main campus in 1973, where it was housed in what was then named John Rogers Hall. <ref name=\"UTCL\"/> The building was formally dedicated with a speech by U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William Rehnquist]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rhenquist|first1=William|title=LEGAL EDUCATION: A CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW|journal=Tulsa Law Journal|date=1974|volume=10|page=9|url=https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&context=tlr|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2016, the university decided to remove the name of John Rogers from the law school's building, in response to increased controversy about Rogers' role in the founding of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Tulsa in the 1920s.<ref>Laura Bult, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tulsa-law-school-remove-founder-due-kkk-associations-article-1.2626106 \"University of Tulsa law school to remove founder's name after discovering his affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan\"], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', May 5, 2016.</ref>\n\n== Academic Programs and Offerings ==\nTU College of Law offers [[Juris Doctor]] programs for full-time and part-time students.  TU Law also grants the degree of [[Master of Laws]], or [[LLM]], in the areas of Native American Law, Natural Resources and Energy Law, and International Law for foreign students.  Additionally, the College of Law offers two online Master of Jurisprudence (MJ) degrees in Indian law and energy law. Students  have the ability to obtain joint JD/MA degrees in a variety of fields including, history, English, psychology, as well as a joint [[JD/MBA]], joint JD/[[Master of Science|Masters in]] Taxation]], and joint JD/[[Master of Science|MS]] in geosciences, biological sciences, and finance.  TU Law offers certificate programs in sustainable energy and resources law, Native American law, and health law.\n\nThe College also hosts a number of endowed lecture series which bring renowned scholars and jurists to campus:\n* ''The John W. Hager Distinguished Lecture'' in Law has brought [[Lawrence Lessig]], [[William Eskridge]], [[Michelle Alexander]] and [[Harold Koh]] to speak at the College of Law in recent years.  \n* ''The Buck Colbert Franklin Memorial Civil Rights Lecture'' honors the pioneering attorney and early leader of Tulsa's black community (who was also the father of famed historian [[John Hope Franklin]]. This lecture series has brought [[Deborah Rhode]], [[Jerry Kang]] and [[Alfred Brophy]] to speak at TU Law.\n* ''The Stephanie K. Seymour Distinguished Lecture in Law'' is the only lecture series in the country established by former clerks to honor the judge for whom they served. This lecture calls attention to the scholarship of an untenured law professor whose dedication and passion mirror that of Judge Seymour.\n\nThe College of Law also has study abroad arrangements allowing students to study in [[Dublin]] or [[London]].\n\nThe University of Tulsa College of Law is a national leader in teaching scholarship and research in energy, environmental, and natural resources law and policy and Native American law.\n\n===Student-Edited Publications===\n*''Tulsa Law Review'', previously the ''Tulsa Law Journal'' from 1964\u20132001\n*''Energy Law Journal''\n\n== Clinical Offerings ==\n\n\nThe on-campus Boesche Legal Clinic offers students real-world experience under the supervision of clinical professors while providing pro bono legal services to disadvantaged populations.
