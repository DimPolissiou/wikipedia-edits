The incumbent governor of the province is [[Saud bin Nayef Al Saud|Prince Saud bin Nayef Al Saud]]. Other populous cities in the province include [[Hofuf]], Mubarraz, [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]], [[Jubail]] and [[Khobar]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/saudi-arabia-population/cities/|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising of, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province. The region borders, from north to south, the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain|Bahrain,]] [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]].\n\n==History==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun empire-slide.gif|thumb|335x335px|The [[Rashidun Caliphate]] expanded the Muslim world into three continents within 20 years of the death of [[Muhammad]]]]\n\n=== Lakhmid and Sasanian rule (300-623 AD) ===\nThe northern part of the Eastern Province was first inhabited by the [[Lakhmids]] around 300 AD, with the coastal regions claimed by the [[Sasanians]] but governed by the Lakhmids. Much of the Eastern Province was under [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule at the time of [[Muhammad|Muhammad.]] The entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] fell into Muslim hands during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], after [[Muhammad]]'s death. \n[[File:IbnSaud.jpg|thumb|[[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Ibn Saud]] is largely accepted to be the founder of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]], also known as the Third Saudi State]]\n\n=== Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates (623-661, 661-750 & 750-899 AD) ===\nThe region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates.\n\n=== Qarmatian rule (899-1076 AD) ===\nDuring the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the region was taken over by the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] group of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]. \n\n=== Uyunids, Usfurids and Jabrids (1076-1253, 1253-1320 & 1520-1521 AD) ===\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids.\n\nThe Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. \n\nThe region was mostly overlooked until 1520 AD, when the [[Jabrids]] built a more stable [[polity]], only for it to fall just a year later, in 1521.\n\n=== Ottoman invasions (1551-1671 AD) ===\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671.\n\nThe region has stayed in Muslims hands since. In the late 1800s, during the period of the [[Second Saudi State]], the area came into Saudi control for the first time from Ottoman hands, before briefly being taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and then retaken by the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] after the in 1913, which was later consolidated into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] under [[Ibn Saud]] on September 23, 1932.\n\nDue to the significance of the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], the region around the oasis, which comprises much of modern-day [[Hofuf]] and its surrounding areas, was simply known as ''al-Ahsa''' and the region around present-day [[Bahrain]] and the [[Greater Dammam]] area was simply known as ''al-Bahran'' from pre-Islamic times.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}According to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals.

As such, the Eastern Province, being the province with most of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves enjoys a high economic position. [[Saudi Aramco]], the [[government-owned corporation|state-owned]] oil company of Saudi Arabia and an organization of major significance in the [[petroleum industry]], is based in [[Dhahran]] in [[Greater Dammam]]. It became the fifth company in the world to reach a [[market capitalization]] of $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) on December 11, 2019. After going public the same day in what is considered the largest [[IPO|public offering]] ever as of December 2019, the next day, on December 12, 2019, the company reached a market cap of $2 trillion, becoming the first and only company in the world to break the record. The kingdom's main oil and gas fields are located in the Eastern Province with sites such as the [[Ghawar Field]], the largest onshore [[Petroleum reservoir|oil field]] in the world and the [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], the largest offshore oil field in the world. Petroleum from the fields is shipped to dozens of countries from the port cities of [[Ras Tanura|Ra's Tanura]] and [[Jeddah]].\n\nSaudi Arabia's largest agricultural product, dates, also forms a large part of the province's economy. Every year thousands of tonnes of dates are harvested from the date palms in the giant oasis of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa]].\n\nThe same as other cities in the Kingdom the area has faced reasonable growth over the past two years; however, it has always maintained a more consistent real estate progress due to the smaller number of major projects that can affect its real estate landscape and due the long term outlook of many firms located within it. A D Williams indicated in the Saudi Real Estate Companion that despite being home to some of the largest conglomerates in the region, namely [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]] and [[SABIC|Sabic]], the Eastern Province did fall behind the rest of the country when it came to non-oil related services.\n\n==Transportation==\nDammam's [[King Fahd International Airport]], the largest airport in the world in terms of land area, is the only airport in the entire Eastern Province with scheduled international flights. Located 30&nbsp;km northwest of the city, the airport is the primary air hub of the Eastern Province. Dammam is well connected by air with other cities in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Other airports in the province include [[Al-Ahsa International Airport|Ahsa International Airport]] and [[Al Qaisumah/Hafr Al Batin Airport|Qaisumah-Hafr Al Batin Airport]].\n\nThe [[King Abdul Aziz Port|King Abdulaziz Sea Port]], located on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], is the second largest and second busiest port in [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is also the largest port in the Persian Gulf and was built in the 1940s. The port is equipped with 56 multi-purpose hoists, 8 container cranes, and 524 tanker containers.\n\nHighway 95 (Route 5M) connects [[Khafji]] on the [[Kuwait|Kuwaiti]] border in the north to the Ramlah border station on the [[Oman|Omani]] border in the south via [[Jubail]], [[Ras Tanura|Ra's Tanura]], the [[Dammam metropolitan area]], the Salwa border station on the [[Qatar|Qatari]] border and the Batha' border station with the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Highway 40 (Route 80M) connects [[Bahrain]] and [[Dammam]] via the 25 km (15 mi) [[King Fahd Causeway]] over the [[Persian Gulf]] and onward to [[Jeddah]] on the [[Red Sea]] via [[Riyadh]], [[Ta'if]] and [[Makkah]].\n\nIntercity bus services are operated in the province by the Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company (SAPTCO). [[Umrah]] and [[Hajj]] shuttle services are also provided to residents of the kingdom by private contractors. Shuttle services also connect the [[Dammam metropolitan area]] to the [[Bahrain International Airport]], northeast of [[Manama]] in Bahrain.\n\nA plan to build a [[Dammam Metro|metro]] in Dammam is also in the works.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{see also|Regions of Saudi Arabia|List of governorates of Saudi Arabia}}\nThe Eastern Province is one of the 13 [[regions of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arab.net/saudi/sa_admindivisions.htm |title=Saudi Arabia: Administrative divisions |publisher=arab.net }}</ref> ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}}; ''manatiq id\u0101riyya'', sing. \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629; ''[[mintaqah]] idariyya'').

The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising of, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province. The region borders, from north to south, the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain|Bahrain,]] [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]].\n\n==History==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun empire-slide.gif|thumb|335x335px|The [[Rashidun Caliphate]] expanded the Muslim world into three continents within 20 years of the death of [[Muhammad]]]]\n\n=== Lakhmid and Sasanian rule (300-623 AD) ===\nThe northern part of the Eastern Province was first inhabited by the [[Lakhmids]] around 300 AD, with the coastal regions claimed by the [[Sasanians]] but governed by the Lakhmids. Much of the Eastern Province was under [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule at the time of [[Muhammad|Muhammad.]] The entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] fell into Muslim hands during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], after [[Muhammad]]'s death. \n[[File:IbnSaud.jpg|thumb|[[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Ibn Saud]] is largely accepted to be the founder of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]], also known as the Third Saudi State]]\n\n=== Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates (623-661, 661-750 & 750-899 AD) ===\nThe region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates.\n\n=== Qarmatian rule (899-1076 AD) ===\nDuring the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the region was taken over by the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] group of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]. \n\n=== Uyunids, Usfurids and Jabrids (1076-1253, 1253-1320 & 1520-1521 AD) ===\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids.\n\nThe Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. \n\nThe region was mostly overlooked until 1520 AD, when the [[Jabrids]] built a more stable [[polity]], only for it to fall just a year later, in 1521.\n\n=== Ottoman invasions (1551-1671 AD) ===\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671.\n\nThe region has stayed in Muslims hands since. In the late 1800s, during the period of the [[Second Saudi State]], the area came into Saudi control for the first time from Ottoman hands, before briefly being taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and then retaken by the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] after the in 1913, which was later consolidated into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] under [[Ibn Saud]] on September 23, 1932.\n\nDue to the significance of the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], the region around the oasis, which comprises much of modern-day [[Hofuf]] and its surrounding areas, was simply known as ''al-Ahsa''' and the region around present-day [[Bahrain]] and the [[Greater Dammam]] area was simply known as ''al-Bahran'' from pre-Islamic times.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}{{historical populations|11=1992|12=2,575,820|13=2004|14=3,360,031|15=2010|16=4,130,033|17=2018|18=5,028,753|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/saudiarabia/cities/ Saudi Arabia: Regions and Cities]</ref>|align=right}}According to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals.

As such, the Eastern Province, being the province with most of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves enjoys a high economic position. [[Saudi Aramco]], the [[government-owned corporation|state-owned]] oil company of Saudi Arabia and an organization of major significance in the [[petroleum industry]], is based in [[Dhahran]] in [[Greater Dammam]]. It became the fifth company in the world to reach a [[market capitalization]] of $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) on December 11, 2019. After going public the same day in what is considered the largest [[IPO|public offering]] ever as of December 2019, the next day, on December 12, 2019, the company reached a market cap of $2 trillion, becoming the first and only company in the world to break the record. The kingdom's main oil and gas fields are located in the Eastern Province with sites such as the [[Ghawar Field]], the largest onshore [[Petroleum reservoir|oil field]] in the world and the [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], the largest offshore oil field in the world. Petroleum from the fields is shipped to dozens of countries from the port cities of [[Ras Tanura|Ra's Tanura]] and [[Jeddah]].\n\nSaudi Arabia's largest agricultural product, dates, also forms a large part of the province's economy. Every year thousands of tonnes of dates are harvested from the date palms in the giant oasis of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa]].\n\nThe same as other cities in the Kingdom the area has faced reasonable growth over the past two years; however, it has always maintained a more consistent real estate progress due to the smaller number of major projects that can affect its real estate landscape and due the long term outlook of many firms located within it. A D Williams indicated in the Saudi Real Estate Companion that despite being home to some of the largest conglomerates in the region, namely [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]] and [[SABIC|Sabic]], the Eastern Province did fall behind the rest of the country when it came to non-oil related services.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Air===\nDammam's [[King Fahd International Airport]], the largest airport in the world in terms of land area. The passenger terminal is about 20&nbsp;km to the northwest of the city and is connected by a 6-lane highway. The airport is the primary air hub of the Eastern Province. Dammam is well connected by air with other cities in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe.\n\nOther international airports in the province are [[Al-Ahsa International Airport]] and [[Al Qaisumah/Hafr Al Batin Airport]].\n\n===Sea===\nThe [[King Abdul Aziz Port|King Abdul Aziz Sea Port]], located on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], is the second largest and second busiest port in [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is also the largest port in the Persian Gulf. It was founded in the late 1940s. It has large equipment that allows it to receive various types of vessels. The most important equipments are 56 multi-purpose hoist, 8 container cranes, and 524 tanker containers. There are a number of berths for ships and fishing, as well as ship repair yard.\n\n===Road===\nThe major cities of the Eastern Province cities such as [[Abqaiq]], [[Dammam]], [[Dhahran]], [[Hofuf]], [[Jubail]], [[Khafji]], [[Khobar]], [[Ras Tanura]], Sihat and [[Qatif]] ([[Gulf Road|Gulf Road (Saudi Arabia)]]) are well connected by highways. Dammam is connected to the Saudi capital, [[Riyadh]] and [[Jeddah]] on the west coast by [[Highway 40 (Saudi Arabia)|Highway 40]]. The Eastern Province is also linked to [[Bahrain]] by the 28&nbsp;km long [[King Fahd Causeway]], and to other Middle-Eastern countries such as [[Kuwait]] ([[Abu Hadriyah Highway]]), [[Oman]], [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].\n\nInter-city bus services are operated in the province by the [[Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company]] (SAPTCO). Bus services also connect Dammam and other cities in Saudi Arabia, and across the Middle East.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{see also|Regions of Saudi Arabia|List of governorates of Saudi Arabia}}\nThe Eastern Province is one of the 13 [[regions of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arab.net/saudi/sa_admindivisions.htm |title=Saudi Arabia: Administrative divisions |publisher=arab.net }}</ref> ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}}; ''manatiq id\u0101riyya'', sing. \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629; ''[[mintaqah]] idariyya'').

In addition, Al-Hasa has a mayor who has a power of a governor, although not \"officially\" considered as a governor because the province's governor still can control the operation of Al-Hasa Governorate and its mayor's office. Nonetheless, the Eastern Province's governor is still considered the head of the province government in any local occasion that occurs in Al-Hasa.\n* [[Qatif]]: Large oasis on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]]\n* [[Jubail]]: Largest industrial city in the [[Middle East]].\n* [[Abqaiq]]: Home for major and largest oil and gas processing plants\n* [[Ras Tanura]]: Major petroleum refining center, home for the largest oil refinery in the world, and many [[Oil platform|offshore oil platforms]].

Modern Chittagong is Bangladesh's second most significant urban center after [[Dhaka]].\n\nChittagong plays a vital role in the [[Economy of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi economy]]. The [[Port of Chittagong]] is the principal maritime gateway to the country. The port is the busiest international seaport on the Bay of Bengal and the third busiest in [[South Asia]].<ref name=\"thedailystar.net\">{{cite news |title=Pangaon container terminal to get a boost |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/business/pangaon-container-terminal-get-boost-196714 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=3 January 2016}}</ref> The [[Chittagong Stock Exchange]] is one of the country's two stock markets. Several Chittagong-based [[List of companies in Bangladesh|companies]] are among the largest industrial conglomerates and enterprises in Bangladesh. The port city is the largest base of the [[Bangladesh Navy]] and [[Bangladesh Coast Guard]]; while the [[Bangladesh Army]] and [[Bangladesh Air Force]] also maintains bases and contributes to the city's economy. Chittagong is the headquarters of the Eastern Zone of the [[Bangladesh Railway]], having historically been the headquarters of [[British India]]'s [[Assam Bengal Railway]] and [[East Pakistan]]'s [[Pakistan Eastern Railway]]. A controversial [[Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard|ship breaking industry]] on the outskirts of the city, which supplies local steel but causes pollution, has come under international scrutiny.\n\nChittagong is an ancient seaport due to its [[natural harbor]]. It was noted as one of the largest [[Eastern world|Eastern]] ports by the Roman geographer [[Ptolemy]] in the 1st century. The harbor has been a gateway through southeastern [[Bengal]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] for centuries. [[Arab people|Arab]] sailors and traders, who once explored the Bay of Bengal, set up a mercantile station in the harbor during the 9th century.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Arabs,_The |title = Arabs, the - Banglapedia}}</ref> During the 14th century, the port became a \"[[Mint (facility)|mint]] town\" of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], with the status of an administrative center.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese historian [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] described Chittagong as \"the most famous and wealthy city of the Kingdom of Bengal\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Chittagong |title = Chittagong &#124; Bangladesh}}</ref> [[Portuguese Chittagong]] was the first European colonial settlement in Bengal. A naval battle in 1666 between the [[Mughal Empire]] and [[Arakan]] resulted in the expulsion of Portuguese pirates. [[British Empire|British colonization]] began in 1760 when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] ceded Chittagong to the [[East India Company]]. During [[World War II]], Chittagong was a base for [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] engaged in the [[Burma Campaign]].

Rev.'', pp. 687\u2013688.</ref>\n\n==Research and legal work==\n===Sexual harassment===\nAccording to an article in 2006 by Deborah Dinner in ''[[Legal Affairs]]'', MacKinnon first focused on what became known as sexual harassment after learning about an administrative assistant at [[Cornell University]] who had resigned after being hospitalized because of it. The woman had refused a transfer when she complained about her supervisor's behavior, then was denied unemployment benefits because she quit for what were termed \"personal\" reasons.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn 1977, MacKinnon graduated from [[Yale Law School]] having written a paper on sexual harassment for Professor [[Thomas I. Emerson]] arguing that it was a form of sex-based discrimination. Two years later, Yale University Press published MacKinnon's book, ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination'' (1979), creating the legal claim for sexual harassment as a form of [[sex discrimination]] under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and any other sex-discrimination prohibition. While working on the paper and book, she shared draft copies with legal authorities who embraced her approach. She also conceived the legal claim for sexual harassment as sex discrimination in education under Title IX, which was established through litigation brought by Yale undergraduates in ''[[Alexander v. Yale]].'' While the plaintiff who went to trial on the facts, Pamela Price, lost, the case established the law: the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] recognized that, under the civil rights statute [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], schools must have procedures to address sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.<ref>Alexander v. Yale Univ., 631 F.2d 178, 181 n.1 (2d Cir. 1980).</ref>\n\nIn her book, MacKinnon argued that sexual harassment is sex discrimination because the act is a product of, and produces, the social inequality of women to men (see, for example, pp.&nbsp;116\u201318, 174). She distinguishes between two types of sexual harassment (see pp.&nbsp;32\u201342): 1) \"quid pro quo\", meaning sexual harassment \"in which sexual compliance is exchanged, or proposed to be exchanged, for an employment opportunity (p. 32)\" and 2) the type of harassment that \"arises when sexual harassment is a persistent condition of work (p. 32)\". In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] followed MacKinnon's framework in adopting guidelines prohibiting sexual harassment by prohibiting both quid pro quo harassment and hostile work environment harassment (see 29 [[Code of Federal Regulations|C.F.R.]] \u00a7 1604.11 (a)). Courts also used the concepts.\n\nIn 1986, the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'' that sexual harassment may violate laws against sex discrimination. MacKinnon was co-counsel for Mechelle Vinson, the plaintiff, and wrote the brief in the Supreme Court. In ''Meritor'', the Court recognized the distinction between quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile workplace harassment. In a 2002 article, MacKinnon wrote, quoting the Court:\n\n<blockquote>\"Without question,\" then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court, \"when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor \"discriminate&#91;s&#93;\" on the basis of sex.\" The D.C. Circuit, and women, had won. A new common-law rule was established.<ref name=\"logic\">Catharine A. MacKinnon, \"The Logic of Experience: Reflections on the Development of Sexual Harassment Law\", 90 ''Geo. L.J.'' 813, 824 (2002).</ref></blockquote>\n\nMacKinnon's book, ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination'', is the eighth most-cited American legal book published since 1978, according to a study published by [[Fred R.

They defined pornography as:\n\n{{quote|the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words that also includes women dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; enjoying pain or humiliation or rape; being tied up, cut up, mutilated, bruised, or physically hurt; in postures of sexual submission or servility or display; reduced to body parts, penetrated by objects or animals, or presented in scenarios of degradation, injury, torture; shown as filthy or inferior; bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catherine|title=Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law|url=https://archive.org/details/feminismunmodifi00mack|url-access=registration|date=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=[https://archive.org/details/feminismunmodifi00mack/page/176 176]|ref=harv}}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'', MacKinnon writes, \"Pornography, in the feminist view, is a form of forced sex, a practice of sexual politics, and institution of gender inequality\".

Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, together with MacKinnon, members of [[Women Against Pornography]], and feminist writer [[Andrea Dworkin]] offering statements in support. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Boreman, and [[Gloria Steinem]] began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of ''Deep Throat''. This was not possible for Boreman because the [[statute of limitations]] for a possible suit had passed.<ref>* {{cite book | last = Brownmiller | first = Susan | author-link = Susan Brownmiller | title = In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution|publisher=Dial Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=9780385314862|page=337 |url=https://archive.org/details/inourtimememoiro00brow_0}}</ref>\n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin continued to discuss civil rights litigation, specifically sex discrimination, as a possible approach to combating pornography. MacKinnon opposed traditional arguments and laws against pornography based on the idea of morality or filth or sexual innocence, including the use of traditional criminal obscenity law to suppress pornography. Instead of condemning pornography for violating \"community standards\" of sexual decency or modesty, they characterized pornography as a form of sex discrimination and sought to give women the right to seek damages under civil rights law when they could prove they had been harmed. Their anti-pornography ordinances make actionable only sexually explicit material that can be proven to subordinate on the basis of sex.\n\nIn 1983, the [[Minneapolis]] city government hired MacKinnon and Dworkin to draft an anti-pornography civil rights ordinance as an amendment to the Minneapolis city human rights ordinance. The amendment defined pornography as a [[civil rights]] violation against women and allowed women who claimed harm from trafficking in pornography to [[lawsuit|sue]] the producers and distributors for damages in [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]]. It also allowed those who had been coerced into pornography, had had pornography forced upon them, or were assaulted in a way caused by specific pornography to sue for harm they could prove. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council but was vetoed by the mayor. Another version of the ordinance passed in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] in 1984, but was ruled [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], a decision summarily affirmed (without opinion) by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMacKinnon wrote in the ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' in 1985:\n\n<blockquote>And as you think about the assumption of consent that follows women into pornography, look closely some time for the skinned knees, the bruises, the welts from the whippings, the scratches, the gashes. Many of them are not simulated. One relatively soft core pornography model said, \"I knew the pose was right when it hurt\". It certainly seems important to the audiences that the events in the pornography be real. For this reason, pornography becomes a motive for murder, as in \"[[Snuff film|snuff]]\" films in which someone is tortured to death to make a sex film. They exist.<ref>Catharine A. MacKinnon, \"Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech\", 20 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 1 (1985). As support for the existence of snuff films, MacKinnon wrote in footnote 61, \"In the movies known as snuff films, victims sometimes are actually murdered.\"' 130 Cong. Rec. S13192 (daily ed. October 3, 1984; statement of Senator [[Arlen Specter]] introducing the [[Pornography Victims Compensation Act|Pornography Victims Protection Act]]). See ''People v.

Smith, The Chicken Hawks (1975)(unpublished manuscript; on file with ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'').</ref></blockquote>\n\nMacKinnon represented Boreman from 1980 until Boreman's death in 2002. Civil libertarians frequently find MacKinnon's theories objectionable (see \"[[#Criticisms|Criticisms]]\" section), arguing there is no evidence that sexually explicit media encourages or promotes violence against women.<ref>Dworkin, Ronald. \"Women and Pornography\", ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' 40, no. 17 (October 21, 1993): 299. \"no reputable study has concluded that pornography is a significant cause of sexual crime: many of them conclude, on the contrary, that the causes of violent personality lie mainly in childhood\"</ref> Max Waltman states that the empirical evidence for this view is emphatic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waltman|first=Max|date=March 2010|title=Rethinking Democracy: Legal Challenges to Pornography and Sex Inequality in Canada and the United States|url=|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=63|pages=218\u2013237|doi=10.1177/1065912909349627}}</ref>\n\n===International work===\nIn February 1992, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] largely accepted MacKinnon's theories of equality, hate propaganda, and pornography, citing extensively from a brief she co-authored in [[R. v. Butler|a ruling against]] [[Manitoba]] pornography distributor Donald Butler. The ''Butler'' decision was controversial to some; it is sometimes implied that shipments of Dworkin's book ''[[Pornography: Men Possessing Women]]'' were seized by Canadian customs agents under this ruling, as well as books by [[Marguerite Duras]] and [[David Leavitt]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Margulis|first=Zachary |url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/wired-3.03.html|title=Canada's Thought Police|date=1995|work=Wired|publisher=Electronic Frontier Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OrdinanceCanada.html|title=Canadian Customs and Legal Approaches to Pornography|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref> In fact, MacKinnon's brief argued that seizure of materials for which no harm was shown was unconstitutional.\n\nSuccessful ''Butler'' prosecutions have been undertaken against the [[lesbian]] [[sadomasochistic]] magazine ''Bad Attitude'', as well as the owners of a gay and lesbian bookstore for selling it. Canadian authorities raided an art gallery and confiscated controversial paintings depicting [[child abuse]]. Many Free Speech and Gay Rights activists have alleged that the law is selectively enforced, targeting the [[LGBT community]].\n\nMacKinnon represented Bosnian and Croatian women against Serbs accused of genocide since 1992, creating the legal claim for rape as an act of genocide in that conflict. She was co-counsel, representing named plaintiff S. Kadic, in ''Kadic v. [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107|Karadzic]]'' and won a jury verdict of $745 million in New York City on August 10, 2000. The lawsuit (under the United States' [[Alien Tort Statute]]) established forced prostitution and forced impregnation when based on ethnicity or religion in a genocidal context as legally actionable acts of genocide.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Cristyn |last2=Knox|first2=Sara L.|title=Cultural Studies of Law|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-69727-5|pages=118, 126\u2013128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4pG9CgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA128&pg=PA126 |language=en}}</ref> In 2001, MacKinnon was named co-director of the Lawyers Alliance for Women (LAW) Project, an initiative of Equality Now, an international [[non-governmental organization]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Steven Harmon|title=The U.S. Justice System: Law and constitution in early America|date=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-304-0|pages=605\u2013606 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Snia9Kt7rokC&lpg=PA606&pg=PA605|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin proposed the law against prostitution in Sweden in 1990, which Sweden passed in 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waltman|first1=Max|title=Prohibiting Sex Purchasing and Ending Trafficking: The Swedish Prostitution Law|journal=Michigan Journal of International Law|date=1 October 2011|volume=33|issue=1|pages=137\u2013138|url=https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&context=mjil|issn=1052-2867}}</ref> What became termed the [[Nordic model approach to prostitution|Swedish Model]], also known as the Nordic Model, the \"Equality Model,\" or the \"Restrictive Model\", penalises buyers of sexual services as well as sellers, where sellers are characterised as pimps or sex traffickers, while putatively decriminalizing all those who are \"bought and sold in prostitution.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} The fundamental concept is that the requirement to exchange sexual services for survival is a product of sex inequality and a form of violence against women.

She writes about the interrelations between theory and practice, recognizing that women's experiences have, for the most part, been ignored in both arenas. Furthermore, she uses [[Marxism]] to critique certain points in [[liberal feminism]] in [[feminist theory]] and uses [[radical feminism]] to criticize Marxist theory.{{sfn|MacKinnon|1987|pp=15\u201316, 60, 118\u2013120, 136\u2013137}} MacKinnon notes Marx's criticism of theory that treated class division as a spontaneous event that occurred naturally.

Sex-positive feminists note that anti-pornography ordinances contrived by MacKinnon and Dworkin called for the removal, censorship, or control over sexually explicit material.<ref>Carole Vance. \"More Pleasure, More Danger: A Decade after the Barnard Sexuality Conference\", ''Pleasure and Danger: Towards a Politics of Sexuality'' (Carole Vance, ed., 1984).<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nIn ''States of Injury'' (1995), [[Wendy Brown (political theorist)|Wendy Brown]] contends that MacKinnon's attempt to ban prostitution and pornography does not primarily protect but reinscribes the category of \"woman\" as an essentialized identity premised on injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5715.html|title=States of Injury book description|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref> In ''[[The Nation]]'', Brown also characterized MacKinnon's ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' (1989) as a \"profoundly static world view and undemocratic, perhaps even anti-democratic, political sensibility\" as well as \"flatly dated\" and \"developed at 'the dawn of feminism's second wave... framed by a political-intellectual context that no longer exists \u2014 a male Marxist monopoly on radical social discourse'\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acc.english.ucsb.edu/ACGCC%2014-15/Brown_The%20Impossibility%20of%20Women%27s%20Studies.pdf|title=The Impossibility of Women's Studies|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMacKinnon formerly had a relationship with author and animal-rights activist [[Jeffrey Masson]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Dinitia|title=Love is Strange|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61MAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA36|work=New York Magazine|date=March 22, 1993|pages=36\u201343}}</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin|26em}}\n* (1979). {{cite book|title=Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination|url=https://archive.org/details/sexualharassment00cath|url-access=registration|location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-02299-9|oclc=3912752|year=1979 }}\n* (1987). {{cite book|title=Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law|location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-29874-8|oclc=157005506|title-link=Feminism Unmodified |year=1987 }}\n* (1988) with [[Andrea Dworkin]]. {{cite book|title=Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality|location=Minneapolis, MN|publisher=Organizing Against Pornography|year=1988|isbn=0-9621849-0-X |oclc=}}\n* (1989). {{cite book|title=Toward a Feminist Theory of the State|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-89646-7|oclc=26545325|title-link=Toward a Feminist Theory of the State |year=1989}}\n* (1993). {{cite book|title=Only Words|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-63933-2|oclc=28067216|title-link=Only Words (book)|year=1993}}\n* (1997) with Andrea Dworkin (eds.). {{cite book|title=In Harm's Way: The Pornography Civil Rights Hearings|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-44579-1 |oclc=37418262|year=1997}}\n* (2001).

Rev.'', pp. 687\u2013688.</ref>\n\n==Research and legal work==\n===Sexual harassment===\nAccording to an article in 2006 by Deborah Dinner in ''[[Legal Affairs]]'', MacKinnon first focused on what became known as sexual harassment after learning about an administrative assistant at [[Cornell University]] who had resigned after being hospitalized because of it. The woman had refused a transfer when she complained about her supervisor's behavior, then was denied unemployment benefits because she quit for what were termed \"personal\" reasons.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn 1977, MacKinnon graduated from [[Yale Law School]] having written a paper on sexual harassment for Professor [[Thomas I. Emerson]] arguing that it was a form of sex-based discrimination. Two years later, Yale University Press published MacKinnon's book, ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination'' (1979), creating the legal claim for sexual harassment as a form of [[sex discrimination]] under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and any other sex-discrimination prohibition. While working on the paper and book, she shared draft copies with legal authorities who embraced her approach. She also conceived the legal claim for sexual harassment as sex discrimination in education under Title IX, which was established through litigation brought by Yale undergraduates in ''[[Alexander v. Yale]].'' While the plaintiff who went to trial on the facts, Pamela Price, lost, the case established the law: the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] recognized that, under the civil rights statute [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], schools must have procedures to address sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.<ref>Alexander v. Yale Univ., 631 F.2d 178, 181 n.1 (2d Cir. 1980).</ref>\n\nIn her book, MacKinnon argued that sexual harassment is sex discrimination because the act is a product of, and produces, the social inequality of women to men (see, for example, pp.&nbsp;116\u201318, 174). She distinguishes between two types of sexual harassment (see pp.&nbsp;32\u201342): 1) \"quid pro quo\", meaning sexual harassment \"in which sexual compliance is exchanged, or proposed to be exchanged, for an employment opportunity (p. 32)\" and 2) the type of harassment that \"arises when sexual harassment is a persistent condition of work (p. 32)\". In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] followed MacKinnon's framework in adopting guidelines prohibiting sexual harassment by prohibiting both quid pro quo harassment and hostile work environment harassment (see 29 [[Code of Federal Regulations|C.F.R.]] \u00a7 1604.11 (a)). Courts also used the concepts.\n\nIn 1986, the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'' that sexual harassment may violate laws against sex discrimination. MacKinnon was co-counsel for Mechelle Vinson, the plaintiff, and wrote the brief in the Supreme Court. In ''Meritor'', the Court recognized the distinction between quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile workplace harassment. In a 2002 article, MacKinnon wrote, quoting the Court:\n\n<blockquote>\"Without question,\" then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court, \"when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor \"discriminate&#91;s&#93;\" on the basis of sex.\" The D.C. Circuit, and women, had won. A new common-law rule was established.<ref name=\"logic\">Catharine A.

L.J.'' 813, 824 (2002).</ref></blockquote>\n\nMacKinnon's book, ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination'', is the eighth most-cited American legal book published since 1978, according to a study published by [[Fred R.

They defined pornography as:\n\n{{quote|the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words that also includes women dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; enjoying pain or humiliation or rape; being tied up, cut up, mutilated, bruised, or physically hurt; in postures of sexual submission or servility or display; reduced to body parts, penetrated by objects or animals, or presented in scenarios of degradation, injury, torture; shown as filthy or inferior; bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catherine|title=Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law|url=https://archive.org/details/feminismunmodifi00mack|url-access=registration|date=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=[https://archive.org/details/feminismunmodifi00mack/page/176 176]|ref=harv}}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'', MacKinnon writes, \"Pornography, in the feminist view, is a form of forced sex, a practice of sexual politics, and institution of gender inequality\". As documented by extensive empirical studies, she writes, \"Pornography contributes causally to attitudes and behaviors of violence and discrimination which define the treatment and status of half the population\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=Toward A Feminist Theory of The State|url=https://archive.org/details/towardfeministth00mack|url-access=registration|last=Mackinnon|first=Catharine |publisher=Harvard|year=1989|isbn=0674896467|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=|pages=}}</ref>{{Rp|196}}\n\n====Anti-pornography ordinances====\n{{Main|Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance}}\nIn 1980, [[Linda Boreman]] (who had appeared, under the name Linda Lovelace in the pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') said her ex-husband [[Chuck Traynor]] had violently coerced her into making ''Deep Throat'' and other pornographic films. Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, together with MacKinnon, members of [[Women Against Pornography]], and feminist writer [[Andrea Dworkin]] offering statements in support. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Boreman, and [[Gloria Steinem]] began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of ''Deep Throat''. This was not possible for Boreman because the [[statute of limitations]] for a possible suit had passed.<ref>* {{cite book | last = Brownmiller | first = Susan | author-link = Susan Brownmiller | title = In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution|publisher=Dial Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=9780385314862|page=337 |url=https://archive.org/details/inourtimememoiro00brow_0}}</ref>\n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin continued to discuss civil rights litigation, specifically sex discrimination, as a possible approach to combating pornography. MacKinnon opposed traditional arguments and laws against pornography based on the idea of morality or filth or sexual innocence, including the use of traditional criminal obscenity law to suppress pornography. Instead of condemning pornography for violating \"community standards\" of sexual decency or modesty, they characterized pornography as a form of sex discrimination and sought to give women the right to seek damages under civil rights law when they could prove they had been harmed. Their anti-pornography ordinances make actionable only sexually explicit material that can be proven to subordinate on the basis of sex.\n\nIn 1983, the [[Minneapolis]] city government hired MacKinnon and Dworkin to draft an anti-pornography civil rights ordinance as an amendment to the Minneapolis city human rights ordinance. The amendment defined pornography as a [[civil rights]] violation against women and allowed women who claimed harm from trafficking in pornography to [[lawsuit|sue]] the producers and distributors for damages in [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]]. It also allowed those who had been coerced into pornography, had had pornography forced upon them, or were assaulted in a way caused by specific pornography to sue for harm they could prove. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council but was vetoed by the mayor. Another version of the ordinance passed in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] in 1984, but was ruled [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], a decision summarily affirmed (without opinion) by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMacKinnon wrote in the ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' in 1985:\n\n<blockquote>And as you think about the assumption of consent that follows women into pornography, look closely some time for the skinned knees, the bruises, the welts from the whippings, the scratches, the gashes. Many of them are not simulated. One relatively soft core pornography model said, \"I knew the pose was right when it hurt\". It certainly seems important to the audiences that the events in the pornography be real. For this reason, pornography becomes a motive for murder, as in \"[[Snuff film|snuff]]\" films in which someone is tortured to death to make a sex film. They exist.<ref>Catharine A. MacKinnon, \"Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech\", 20 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 1 (1985). As support for the existence of snuff films, MacKinnon wrote in footnote 61, \"In the movies known as snuff films, victims sometimes are actually murdered.\"' 130 Cong. Rec. S13192 (daily ed. October 3, 1984; statement of Senator [[Arlen Specter]] introducing the [[Pornography Victims Compensation Act|Pornography Victims Protection Act]]). See ''People v.

Civil libertarians frequently find MacKinnon's theories objectionable (see \"[[#Criticisms|Criticisms]]\" section), arguing there is no evidence that sexually explicit media encourages or promotes violence against women.<ref>Dworkin, Ronald. \"Women and Pornography\", ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' 40, no. 17 (October 21, 1993): 299. \"no reputable study has concluded that pornography is a significant cause of sexual crime: many of them conclude, on the contrary, that the causes of violent personality lie mainly in childhood\"</ref> Max Waltman states that the empirical evidence for this view is emphatic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waltman|first=Max|date=March 2010|title=Rethinking Democracy: Legal Challenges to Pornography and Sex Inequality in Canada and the United States|url=|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=63|pages=218\u2013237|doi=10.1177/1065912909349627}}</ref>\n\n===International work===\nIn February 1992, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] largely accepted MacKinnon's theories of equality, hate propaganda, and pornography, citing extensively from a brief she co-authored in [[R. v. Butler|a ruling against]] [[Manitoba]] pornography distributor Donald Butler. The ''Butler'' decision was controversial to some; it is sometimes implied that shipments of Dworkin's book ''[[Pornography: Men Possessing Women]]'' were seized by Canadian customs agents under this ruling, as well as books by [[Marguerite Duras]] and [[David Leavitt]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Margulis|first=Zachary |url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/wired-3.03.html|title=Canada's Thought Police|date=1995|work=Wired|publisher=Electronic Frontier Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OrdinanceCanada.html|title=Canadian Customs and Legal Approaches to Pornography|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref> In fact, MacKinnon's brief argued that seizure of materials for which no harm was shown was unconstitutional.\n\nSuccessful ''Butler'' prosecutions have been undertaken against the [[lesbian]] [[sadomasochistic]] magazine ''Bad Attitude'', as well as the owners of a gay and lesbian bookstore for selling it. Canadian authorities raided an art gallery and confiscated controversial paintings depicting [[child abuse]]. Many Free Speech and Gay Rights activists have alleged that the law is selectively enforced, targeting the [[LGBT community]].\n\nMacKinnon represented Bosnian and Croatian women against Serbs accused of genocide since 1992, creating the legal claim for rape as an act of genocide in that conflict. She was co-counsel, representing named plaintiff S. Kadic, in ''Kadic v. [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107|Karadzic]]'' and won a jury verdict of $745 million in New York City on August 10, 2000.

She writes about the interrelations between theory and practice, recognizing that women's experiences have, for the most part, been ignored in both arenas. Furthermore, she uses [[Marxism]] to critique certain points in [[liberal feminism]] in [[feminist theory]] and uses [[radical feminism]] to criticize Marxist theory.{{sfn|MacKinnon|1987|pp=15\u201316, 60, 118\u2013120, 136\u2013137}} MacKinnon notes Marx's criticism of theory that treated class division as a spontaneous event that occurred naturally.

Sex-positive feminists note that anti-pornography ordinances contrived by MacKinnon and Dworkin called for the removal, censorship, or control over sexually explicit material.<ref>Carole Vance. \"More Pleasure, More Danger: A Decade after the Barnard Sexuality Conference\", ''Pleasure and Danger: Towards a Politics of Sexuality'' (Carole Vance, ed., 1984).<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nIn ''States of Injury'' (1995), [[Wendy Brown (political theorist)|Wendy Brown]] contends that MacKinnon's attempt to ban prostitution and pornography does not primarily protect but reinscribes the category of \"woman\" as an essentialized identity premised on injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5715.html|title=States of Injury book description|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref> In ''[[The Nation]]'', Brown also characterized MacKinnon's ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' (1989) as a \"profoundly static world view and undemocratic, perhaps even anti-democratic, political sensibility\" as well as \"flatly dated\" and \"developed at 'the dawn of feminism's second wave... framed by a political-intellectual context that no longer exists \u2014 a male Marxist monopoly on radical social discourse'\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acc.english.ucsb.edu/ACGCC%2014-15/Brown_The%20Impossibility%20of%20Women%27s%20Studies.pdf|title=The Impossibility of Women's Studies|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMacKinnon formerly had a relationship with author and animal-rights activist [[Jeffrey Masson]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Dinitia|title=Love is Strange|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61MAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA36|work=New York Magazine|date=March 22, 1993|pages=36\u201343}}</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin|26em}}\n* (1979). {{cite book|title=Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination|url=https://archive.org/details/sexualharassment00cath|url-access=registration|location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-02299-9|oclc=3912752|year=1979 }}\n* (1987). {{cite book|title=Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law|location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-29874-8|oclc=157005506|title-link=Feminism Unmodified |year=1987 }}\n* (1988) with [[Andrea Dworkin]]. {{cite book|title=Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality|location=Minneapolis, MN|publisher=Organizing Against Pornography|year=1988|isbn=0-9621849-0-X |oclc=}}\n* (1989). {{cite book|title=Toward a Feminist Theory of the State|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-89646-7|oclc=26545325|title-link=Toward a Feminist Theory of the State |year=1989}}\n* (1993). {{cite book|title=Only Words|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-63933-2|oclc=28067216|title-link=Only Words (book)|year=1993}}\n* (1997) with Andrea Dworkin (eds.). {{cite book|title=In Harm's Way: The Pornography Civil Rights Hearings|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-44579-1 |oclc=37418262|year=1997}}\n* (2001).
