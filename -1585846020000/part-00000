{"title_page": "La Hija del Mariachi", "text_new": "\n\n'''''La hija del mariachi''''' ''(The Daughter of the Mariachi)'' is a [[Colombia]]n [[telenovela]] produced by [[RCN TV|RCN Television]] and written by M\u00f3nica Aguledo.\n\nOne night, ranchera singer Rosario Guerrero sees Emiliano at the doors of Plaza Garibaldi, a mariachi bar. He has an air of vulnerability and signs of having been robbed, so she decides to help him. What she does not know is that he is a wealthy young Mexican who has reached [[Bogot\u00e1]] fleeing from justice for a crime he did not commit.\n \nThe friendship they develop completely transforms their lives. He is astounded by Rosario\u2019s selfless support, a rare commodity in the world of wealth he comes from. Thanks to her, he manages to survive as a mariachi singer in the bar while eluding the zealous pursuit of [[Interpol]] and the police in [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]. In this world, he discovers the widespread influence of mariachi music in Colombia. Above all, in Rosario he finds the great love of his life.\n \nShe also finds love thanks to Emiliano. With him, she begins to fit together the scattered pieces of her life. The happiest and yet most painful parts of Rosario\u2019s life are related to the memory of her father. He was a mariachi singer, bohemian and passionate, and an affectionate man. Yet he filled his family\u2019s life with sadness because he spent his nights with work, liquor, and women. In a desperate attempt to erase the memory of a turbulent childhood, Rosario is struggling to earn a degree in Business Management.\n \nDespite the sadness, the image of her father is linked to joy and passion, so preserved as a relic of mariachi attire. A dress without a master, a pain that only fades when Rosario unwittingly falls in love with Emiliano and lends him the suit for him to sing in the bar Plaza Garibaldi.\n \nEmiliano S\u00e1nchez-Gallardo, a member of one of the most powerful families in Mexico, never imagined he would end up as a singer in a Mexican music bar, middle class, in the Colombian capital. He believed that his legal status in Mexico would be cleared in a few weeks, so he never told Rosario the truth. But the trouble is serious: they are blaming him for a massive money laundering operation actually operated by his partners.\n \n<br />\nThe uncertainty of trying to be someone else and the distress that it causes, causes the collapse of his family and his life, need to add the little control he has over his own feelings, to withstand the fierce opposition of their opponents, and the pitfalls put in his path by other women who desire Emiliano and want to separate him from Rosario.\n\n== Criticisms of the two versions ==\nThe telenovela garnered a big audience in Colombia and Latin America. Given these facts, Colombia decided to record more chapters. Criticism of U.S. and Chilean versions have not been too positive, because the story is resolved in a fast manner, leaving some unfinished business. On the other hand, the Colombian version explained in more detail the resolution of the plot and keeps the spirit that took the soap during its course.\n \n==Cast==\n \n*'''[[Mark Tacher]]'''\u2026.

As a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer he led two expeditions under authority of President [[Thomas Jefferson]] through the new [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory, first in 1805\u20131806 to reconnoiter the upper northern reaches of the [[Mississippi River]], and then in 1806\u20131807 to explore the Southwest to the fringes of the northern Spanish-colonial settlements of [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]]. Pike's expeditions coincided with other Jeffersonian expeditions, including the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804\u20131806) and the [[Red River Expedition (1806)|Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis expedition]] up the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] (1806).<ref name=\"Berry\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Trey |editor1-last=Berry |editor2-first=Pam |editor2-last=Beasley |editor3-first=Jeanne |editor3-last=Clements |year=2006 |title=The Forgotten Expedition, 1804\u20131805: The Louisiana Purchase Journals of Dunbar and Hunter |page=xi |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |isbn=978-0-8071-3165-7}}</ref>\n\nPike's second expedition crossed the [[Rocky Mountains]] into what is now southern [[Colorado]], which led to his capture by the Spanish colonial authorities near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], who sent Pike and his men to [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] (present-day [[Mexico]]), for interrogation. Later in 1807, Pike and some of his men were escorted by the Spanish through Texas and released near American territory in [[Louisiana]].\n\nIn 1810, Pike published an account of his expeditions, a book so popular that it was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] languages, for publication in [[Europe]]. He later achieved the rank of brigadier general in the American Army and served during the [[War of 1812]], until he was killed during the [[Battle of York]], in April 1813, outside the then [[Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonial capital of [[Upper Canada]] (later Toronto, [[Ontario]]).\n\n==Early and family life==\n\n===Early life and education===\nPike was born during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], on January 5, 1779, near Lamberton,<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Washington |last=Irving |title=Biographical Memoir of the Late Brigadier General Zebulon Montgomery Pike |magazine=[[Analectic Magazine]] |volume=4 |date=November 1814 |page=380}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Wilson |title=The Biography of the Principal American Military and Naval Heroes; Comprehending Details of Their Achievements During the Revolutionary and Late Wars |volume=II |edition=Second |location=New York |publisher=John Low |year=1822 |page=9}}</ref> now called [[Lamington, New Jersey|Lamington]] in [[Bedminster, New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Backes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUMVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=General Zebulon M.

General [[James Wilkinson]], appointed Governor of the Upper [[Louisiana Territory]] and headquartered there, became his mentor.\n\nIn 1796 Pike shadowed the expedition of General [[Georges Henri Victor Collot]], a French officer who had been tasked to tour the Mississippi frontier, and draw maps that France might use if it were to try and seize this lightly settled territory from the nascent USA.<ref name=Herald-Leader2017-03-19/>\n\n===First Pike Expedition===\nIn the summer of 1805, Wilkinson ordered Pike to locate the source of the [[Mississippi River]], explore the northern portion of the newly created [[Louisiana Territory]], and expel Canadian fur traders illegally trading in the borders of the United States. Pike left St. Louis on August 9, 1805, proceeding upstream by [[pirogue]]. They reached the [[Pike Island|confluence]] of the Mississippi and [[Minnesota River]]s on September 21, where he negotiated a [[Pike's Purchase|treaty]] with the [[Dakota people|Dakota]], purchasing the future site of [[Fort Snelling]]. The expedition proceeded further upriver, stopping to construct a winter camp at the mouth of the Swan River, south of present-day [[Little Falls, Minnesota|Little Falls]], on October 16. On December 10, they continued upstream along the now-frozen river on foot, visiting a number of British [[North West Company]] fur posts along the way.\n\nThey reached the fur post at [[Leech Lake]] on February 1, and stayed nearly three weeks. Pike informed the traders they were within the boundaries of the United States, and henceforth required to abide by its laws and regulations. Pike met with many prominent [[Ojibwe]] chiefs, prevailing on them to surrender the medals and flags given to them as tokens of allegiance by the British, and offering American replacement [[Indian Peace Medal|medals]]. He also relayed the United States' desire that the Ojibwe and Dakota cease their mutual hostility, and invited the chiefs to attend a peace conference in St. Louis (all declined the invitation to travel through several thousand miles of hostile territory). On February 10, they ceremonially shot the [[British ensign|British red ensign]] from the fur company's flag pole, replacing it with an [[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|American flag]]. On a short side trip (February 12 to 14), Pike traveled to the North West Company fur post on [[Cass Lake (Minnesota)|Upper Red Cedar Lake]] (now commonly known as Cass Lake), erroneously designating the lake as the ultimate source of the Mississippi, and taking celestial observations to determine its [[latitude]].\n\nPike and his men left [[Leech Lake]] on February 18, carrying diplomatic tokens from the Ojibwe chiefs to present to the Dakota chiefs as a gesture of reconciliation, arriving at their winter encampment on March 5. They re-embarked in their pirogues for the downriver journey on April 7, reaching St. Louis on April 20. Pike's was the second expedition dispatched by the government into its new territory, and the first to return.\n\n===Second Pike Expedition===\n{{main|Pike expedition}}\n[[File:Pikes Peak by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pikes Peak]], central Colorado]]\nAfter Pike returned from this first expedition, General Wilkinson almost immediately ordered him to mount a second expedition, this time to explore, map, and find the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and Red rivers. Additional objectives of this exploratory expedition into the southwestern part of the Louisiana Territory were to evaluate natural resources and establish friendly relations with Native Americans.\n\nBeginning July 15, 1806, Pike led what became known as the \"Pike Expedition\". General Wilkinson's son James served as one of his lieutenants, although it now seems that Wilkinson planned that the Spanish who controlled Mexico would capture him and his men.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn early November 1806, Pike and his team sighted and tried to climb to the summit of the peak later named after him ([[Pikes Peak]]). They made it as far as Mt. Rosa, located southeast of Pikes Peak, before giving up the ascent in waist-deep snow. They had already gone almost two days without food.\n\nThey then continued south, searching for the Red River's headwaters, and built a fort for shelter during the winter. However, they had crossed the border, whether through confusion or deliberation. [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities captured Pike and some of his party in what was then northern New Mexico (now part of southern [[Colorado]]) on February 26, 1807.\n\nPike and his men were taken to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] then to the capital of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] province, and presented to Commandant General Salcedo, who was governor of the state.<ref>{{cite web |last=Buescher |first=John |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 |title=Trailing Lewis and Clark |publisher=TeachingHistory.org |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Pike was treated well and invited to formal social dinners, but still not quite given the treatment of a visiting dignitary, and his men were kept prisoner. Salcedo housed Pike with Juan Pedro Walker, a cartographer who also acted as an  interpreter. Walker transcribed and translated Pike's confiscated documents, including his journal. Spanish authorities feared the spread of both democracy and Protestant Christian sects that might undermine their rule.\n\nDuring this time, Pike had access to various maps of the southwest and learned about Mexico's discontent with Spanish rule. Spain filed official protests with the United States about Pike's expedition, but since the nations were not at war (and Spain was rebelling against Napoleon's brother, who was fighting England in the [[Peninsular War]]), Commandant Salcedo released the military men. The Spanish escorted Pike and most of his men north, releasing them at the Louisiana border on July 1, 1807. However, some of Pike's soldiers were held for years in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===War of 1812===\nPike was promoted to captain during the southwestern expedition. In 1811, Lt. Col. Zebulon M. Pike with the 4th Infantry Regiment fought at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. He was promoted to colonel of the 15th Infantry Regiment in July 1812. Pike's military career also included service as deputy [[quartermaster]]-general in [[New Orleans]] and [[inspector-general]] during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nPike was promoted to brigadier general in March 1813.<ref name=\"collier\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Valkenburg |first=Samuel Van |editor=William D.

On this expedition, Pike commanded combat troops in the [[Battle of York|successful attack]] on [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]), on April 27, 1813. Pike was killed, along with numerous other American troops, by flying rocks and other debris when the withdrawing British garrison blew up its ammunition magazine as Pike's troops approached Fort York.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 31B: Fort York|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto}}</ref>  His body was brought by ship back to Sackets Harbor, where his remains were buried at the military cemetery.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=2nN0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=zebulon+pike+sackets+harbor+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYzoS_35bfAhWEJjQIHfZoDgQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=zebulon%20pike%20sackets%20harbor%20cemetery&f=false ''Graves of Upstate New York'']</ref>\n\n==Journals==\nThe Spanish authorities confiscated Pike's journals, which were not recovered by the United States from Mexico until the 1900s. Pike wrote an account from memory of his expeditions, which was published in 1810 as ''The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to Headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the Years 1805-6-7''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XrMlAAAAMAAJ |title=The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the years 1805-6-7 |first=Zebulon Montgomery |last=Pike |editor=Elliott Coues |publisher=Ross & Haines |year=1965 |publication-date=1895}}</ref> It was popular; was later translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] editions; and became required reading for all American explorers who followed him in the 19th century.\n\nPike's capture by the Spanish and travel through the Southwest gave Pike insight into the region. For example, he described the politics in Chihuahua, which led to the [[Mexican independence]] movement, and described trade conditions in the Spanish territories of New Mexico and Chihuahua, which contributed to development of the [[Santa Fe Trail]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn some eastern regions of North America a tradition or legend pervades often referred to as ''The Lost City of Palanor'' or ''Zebulon's Amulet'' which have been attributed to Pike's journals. The myth, said to be derived from a missing portion of Pike's confiscated journals, is usually told in two segments. The first sequence involves Pike receiving an amulet from a native chieftain as a reward for the rescue of the chief's daughter. The second is a description of Pike's discovery of the lost city \"Palanor,\" said to be built by pre-Columbian European settlers, and his decision to bury the amulet there.\n\n==Legacy==\nAs Olsen (2006) shows, after Pike's death in battle, his military accomplishments were widely celebrated in terms of biographies, mourning memorials, paintings, poems, and songs, and he became the namesake for dozens of towns, counties, and ships. His memory faded after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] but rebounded in 1906, at the centennial of his Southwest Expedition.

As a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer he led two expeditions under authority of President [[Thomas Jefferson]] through the new [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory, first in 1805\u20131806 to reconnoiter the upper northern reaches of the [[Mississippi River]], and then in 1806\u20131807 to explore the Southwest to the fringes of the northern Spanish-colonial settlements of [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]]. Pike's expeditions coincided with other Jeffersonian expeditions, including the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804\u20131806) and the [[Red River Expedition (1806)|Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis expedition]] up the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] (1806).<ref name=\"Berry\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Trey |editor1-last=Berry |editor2-first=Pam |editor2-last=Beasley |editor3-first=Jeanne |editor3-last=Clements |year=2006 |title=The Forgotten Expedition, 1804\u20131805: The Louisiana Purchase Journals of Dunbar and Hunter |page=xi |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |isbn=978-0-8071-3165-7}}</ref>\n\nPike's second expedition crossed the [[Rocky Mountains]] into what is now southern [[Colorado]], which led to his capture by the Spanish colonial authorities near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], who sent Pike and his men to [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] (present-day [[Mexico]]), for interrogation. Later in 1807, Pike and some of his men were escorted by the Spanish through Texas and released near American territory in [[Louisiana]].\n\nIn 1810, Pike published an account of his expeditions, a book so popular that it was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] languages, for publication in [[Europe]]. He later achieved the rank of brigadier general in the American Army and served during the [[War of 1812]], until he was killed during the [[Battle of York]], in April 1813, outside the then [[Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonial capital of [[Upper Canada]] (later Toronto, [[Ontario]]).\n\n==Early and family life==\n\n===Early life and education===\nPike was born during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], on January 5, 1779, near Lamberton,<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Washington |last=Irving |title=Biographical Memoir of the Late Brigadier General Zebulon Montgomery Pike |magazine=[[Analectic Magazine]] |volume=4 |date=November 1814 |page=380}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Wilson |title=The Biography of the Principal American Military and Naval Heroes; Comprehending Details of Their Achievements During the Revolutionary and Late Wars |volume=II |edition=Second |location=New York |publisher=John Low |year=1822 |page=9}}</ref> now called [[Lamington, New Jersey|Lamington]] in [[Bedminster, New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Backes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUMVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=General Zebulon M.

General [[James Wilkinson]], appointed Governor of the Upper [[Louisiana Territory]] and headquartered there, became his mentor.\n\nIn 1796 Pike shadowed the expedition of General [[Georges Henri Victor Collot]], a French officer who had been tasked to tour the Mississippi frontier, and draw maps that France might use if it were to try and seize this lightly settled territory from the nascent USA.<ref name=Herald-Leader2017-03-19/>\n\n===First Pike Expedition===\nIn the summer of 1805, Wilkinson ordered Pike to locate the source of the [[Mississippi River]], explore the northern portion of the newly created [[Louisiana Territory]], and expel Canadian fur traders illegally trading in the borders of the United States. Pike left St. Louis on August 9, 1805, proceeding upstream by [[pirogue]]. They reached the [[Pike Island|confluence]] of the Mississippi and [[Minnesota River]]s on September 21, where he negotiated a [[Pike's Purchase|treaty]] with the [[Dakota people|Dakota]], purchasing the future site of [[Fort Snelling]]. The expedition proceeded further upriver, stopping to construct a winter camp at the mouth of the Swan River, south of present-day [[Little Falls, Minnesota|Little Falls]], on October 16. On December 10, they continued upstream along the now-frozen river on foot, visiting a number of British [[North West Company]] fur posts along the way.\n\nThey reached the fur post at [[Leech Lake]] on February 1, and stayed nearly three weeks. Pike informed the traders they were within the boundaries of the United States, and henceforth required to abide by its laws and regulations. Pike met with many prominent [[Ojibwe]] chiefs, prevailing on them to surrender the medals and flags given to them as tokens of allegiance by the British, and offering American replacement [[Indian Peace Medal|medals]]. He also relayed the United States' desire that the Ojibwe and Dakota cease their mutual hostility, and invited the chiefs to attend a peace conference in St. Louis (all declined the invitation to travel through several thousand miles of hostile territory). On February 10, they ceremonially shot the [[British ensign|British red ensign]] from the fur company's flag pole, replacing it with an [[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|American flag]]. On a short side trip (February 12 to 14), Pike traveled to the North West Company fur post on [[Cass Lake (Minnesota)|Upper Red Cedar Lake]] (now commonly known as Cass Lake), erroneously designating the lake as the ultimate source of the Mississippi, and taking celestial observations to determine its [[latitude]].\n\nPike and his men left [[Leech Lake]] on February 18, carrying diplomatic tokens from the Ojibwe chiefs to present to the Dakota chiefs as a gesture of reconciliation, arriving at their winter encampment on March 5. They re-embarked in their pirogues for the downriver journey on April 7, reaching St. Louis on April 20. Pike's was the second expedition dispatched by the government into its new territory, and the first to return.\n\n===Second Pike Expedition===\n{{main|Pike expedition}}\n[[File:Pikes Peak by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pikes Peak]], central Colorado]]\nAfter Pike returned from this first expedition, General Wilkinson almost immediately ordered him to mount a second expedition, this time to explore, map, and find the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and Red rivers. Additional objectives of this exploratory expedition into the southwestern part of the Louisiana Territory were to evaluate natural resources and establish friendly relations with Native Americans.\n\nBeginning July 15, 1806, Pike led what became known as the \"Pike Expedition\". General Wilkinson's son James served as one of his lieutenants, although it now seems that Wilkinson planned that the Spanish who controlled Mexico would capture him and his men.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn early November 1806, Pike and his team sighted and tried to climb to the summit of the peak later named after him ([[Pikes Peak]]). They made it as far as Mt. Rosa, located southeast of Pikes Peak, before giving up the ascent in waist-deep snow. They had already gone almost two days without food.\n\nThey then continued south, searching for the Red River's headwaters, and built a fort for shelter during the winter. However, they had crossed the border, whether through confusion or deliberation. [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities captured Pike and some of his party in what was then northern New Mexico (now part of southern [[Colorado]]) on February 26, 1807.\n\nPike and his men were taken to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] then to the capital of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] province, and presented to Commandant General Salcedo, who was governor of the state.<ref>{{cite web |last=Buescher |first=John |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 |title=Trailing Lewis and Clark |publisher=TeachingHistory.org |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Pike was treated well and invited to formal social dinners, but still not quite given the treatment of a visiting dignitary, and his men were kept prisoner. Salcedo housed Pike with Juan Pedro Walker, a cartographer who also acted as an  interpreter. Walker transcribed and translated Pike's confiscated documents, including his journal. Spanish authorities feared the spread of both democracy and Protestant Christian sects that might undermine their rule.\n\nDuring this time, Pike had access to various maps of the southwest and learned about Mexico's discontent with Spanish rule. Spain filed official protests with the United States about Pike's expedition, but since the nations were not at war (and Spain was rebelling against Napoleon's brother, who was fighting England in the [[Peninsular War]]), Commandant Salcedo released the military men. The Spanish escorted Pike and most of his men north, releasing them at the Louisiana border on July 1, 1807. However, some of Pike's soldiers were held for years in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===War of 1812===\nPike was promoted to captain during the southwestern expedition. In 1811, Lt. Col. Zebulon M. Pike with the 4th Infantry Regiment fought at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. He was promoted to colonel of the 15th Infantry Regiment in July 1812. Pike's military career also included service as deputy [[quartermaster]]-general in [[New Orleans]] and [[inspector-general]] during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nPike was promoted to brigadier general in March 1813.<ref name=\"collier\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Valkenburg |first=Samuel Van |editor=William D.

On this expedition, Pike commanded combat troops in the [[Battle of York|successful attack]] on [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]), on April 27, 1813. Pike was killed, along with numerous other American troops, by flying rocks and other debris when the withdrawing British garrison blew up its ammunition magazine as Pike's troops approached Fort York.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 31B: Fort York|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto}}</ref>  His body was brought by ship back to Sackets Harbor, where his remains were buried at the military cemetery.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=2nN0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=zebulon+pike+sackets+harbor+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYzoS_35bfAhWEJjQIHfZoDgQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=zebulon%20pike%20sackets%20harbor%20cemetery&f=false ''Graves of Upstate New York'']</ref>\n\n==Journals==\nThe Spanish authorities confiscated Pike's journals, which were not recovered by the United States from Mexico until the 1900s. Pike wrote an account from memory of his expeditions, which was published in 1810 as ''The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to Headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the Years 1805-6-7''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XrMlAAAAMAAJ |title=The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the years 1805-6-7 |first=Zebulon Montgomery |last=Pike |editor=Elliott Coues |publisher=Ross & Haines |year=1965 |publication-date=1895}}</ref> It was popular; was later translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] editions; and became required reading for all American explorers who followed him in the 19th century.\n\nPike's capture by the Spanish and travel through the Southwest gave Pike insight into the region. For example, he described the politics in Chihuahua, which led to the [[Mexican independence]] movement, and described trade conditions in the Spanish territories of New Mexico and Chihuahua, which contributed to development of the [[Santa Fe Trail]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn some eastern regions of North America a tradition or legend pervades often referred to as \"The Lost City of Palanor\" or \"Zebulon's Amulet\" which have been attributed to Pike's journals. The myth, said to be derived from a missing portion of Pike's confiscated journals, is usually told in two segments. The first sequence involves Pike receiving an amulet from a native chieftain as a reward for the rescue of the chief's daughter. The second is a description of Pike's discovery of the lost city \"Palanor,\" said to be built by pre-Columbian European settlers, and his decision to bury the amulet there.\n\n==Legacy==\nAs Olsen (2006) shows, after Pike's death in battle, his military accomplishments were widely celebrated in terms of biographies, mourning memorials, paintings, poems, and songs, and he became the namesake for dozens of towns, counties, and ships. His memory faded after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] but rebounded in 1906, at the centennial of his Southwest Expedition.

The 4/7 DG first wore their flash in 1939 in Northern France in support of the British Expeditionary Force, one of the first armoured units to fight in the desperate but gallant withdrawal to Dunkirk and it is believed to be the first regiment to wear a Tactical Recognition Flash. The worsted material recognition flash came about following an order to remove badges of recognition from battle-dress to conceal regimental identity. The design was copied from the painted diamond flash in Regimental colours on the steel helmets. The order was later rescinded so back on went the collar-dogs and numerals but the cloth badge remained. The 13/18H later followed suit in 1940 with a blue and white flash.<ref>Chappell, p. 58</ref>\n\nThe 4/7 DG Regimental flash was worn by all ranks from Warrant Officer Class 2 and below on BD/SDs upon the left arm 1\" below the shoulder seam.

It was formed in 1992 by the amalgamation of two other regiments: The [[4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards]] and the [[5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards]].  The regiment currently serves as the Armoured Cavalry Reconnaissance unit of the [[20th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|20th Armoured Infantry Brigade]] and is therefore equipped with the [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)]] [[FV107 Scimitar|Scimitar]] and is based in [[Catterick Garrison]], North Yorkshire.  Today the RDG is an operationally experienced regiment having recently served in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] ([[Operation Telic]] 5 and 11), and [[Afghanistan]] ([[Operation Herrick]] 12 and 17).\n\n==History==\nThe regiment was formed in 1992 by the amalgamation of two other regiments: The [[4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards]] and the [[5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards]]. The Royal Dragoon Guards has served in a variety of roles and theatres since its formation.

The 4/7 DG first wore their flash in 1939 in Northern France in support of the British Expeditionary Force, one of the first armoured units to fight in the desperate but gallant withdrawal to Dunkirk and it is believed to be the first regiment to wear a Tactical Recognition Flash. The worsted material recognition flash came about following an order to remove badges of recognition from battle-dress to conceal regimental identity. The design was copied from the painted diamond flash in Regimental colours on the steel helmets. The order was later rescinded so back on went the collar-dogs and numerals but the cloth badge remained. The 13/18H later followed suit in 1940 with a blue and white flash.<ref>Chappell, p. 58</ref>\n\nThe 4/7 DG Regimental flash was worn by all ranks from Warrant Officer Class 2 and below on BD/SDs upon the left arm 1\" below the shoulder seam.

{"title_page": "Bering Sea Arbitration", "text_new": "The '''Bering Sea Arbitration of 1893''' arose out of a [[fishery]] dispute between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[United States]] in the 1880s. The [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], today known as the [[United States Coast Guard]], captured several Canadian sealer vessels throughout the conflict. Diplomatic representations followed the capture of the first three ships and an order for release was issued by the British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the [[Dominion of Canada]]), but it did nothing to stop the seizures and none were released. This led to the U.S. claiming exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]], and that led to negotiations outside of the courts. The award was given in favor of the British, however, and the Americans were denied exclusive jurisdiction. The British were awarded compensation for the damage that had been inflicted on their vessels, and the American sealing zone remained as it was prior to the conflict (60 miles).\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1867 the United States government purchased from [[Russia]] all her territorial rights in [[Alaska]] and the adjacent islands. The boundary between the two countries was a line drawn from the middle of the [[Bering Strait]] south-west to a point midway between the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Komandorski Islands]] dividing the Bering Sea into two parts, the larger being on the American side. This portion included the [[Pribilof Islands]], the principal breeding-grounds of the seals in those seas.\n\nBy [[Acts of Congress]], passed between 1868 and 1873, the killing of seals was prohibited on the Pribilof Islands and in \"the waters adjacent thereto\" except upon certain specified conditions. This created a large swathe of friction between the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government with the [[presidential veto]] employed by [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on two notable occasions.   No definition of the meaning of the words \"waters adjacent\" was given in the act. In 1870 the exclusive rights of killing seals on these islands was leased by the United States to the [[Alaska Commercial Company]], on conditions limiting the numbers to be taken annually, and otherwise providing for their protection. As early as 1872, the operations of foreign sealers attracted the attention of the United States' government, but any precautions then taken seem to have been directed against the capture of seals on their way through the passages between the Aleutian Islands, and no claim to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit appears to have been made. On March 12, 1881, the acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in answer to a letter asking for an interpretation of the words \"waters adjacent thereto\" in the acts of 1868 and 1873, stated that all the waters east of the boundary line were considered to be within the waters of Alaska territory. In March 1886 this letter was communicated to the [[San Francisco]] [[customs]] by [[Daniel Manning]], U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, for publication.\n\nBeginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing), often killing both male and female.<ref name=nie/> The great drawback of pelagic sealing lies in the fact that nursing seal mothers wander far in search of food, while the males do not take food during the breeding season, but remain on the islands. Consequently, practically all the seals taken by pelagic sealers are nursing females, the death of which ordinarily results in the starvation of the pups.<ref>{{Cite NIE |last=Clark |first=Hubert Lyman |authorlink=Hubert Lyman Clark |wstitle=Seal (mammal)|display=Seal.

Diplomatic representations followed and an order for release was issued but, in 1887, further captures were made which were judicially supported on the same grounds. From that point the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the Bering Sea; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada) repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.\n\n==Negotiations==\nBetween 1887 and 1890, negotiations were carried out among Russia, Great Britain and the United States with a view to a joint convention but the parties were unable to agree on basis for regulating sealing in the open seas, the [[pelagic zone]]. America had seal nurseries on the Pribilof Islands and Russia on the Komandorski group. Neither Britain, nor the Dominion of Canada, had land access to the Bering Sea or seal breeding grounds. Thus, to prohibit pelagic sealing would have been to exclude Britain from the industry.\n\nThe United States insisted that such prohibition was indispensable on the grounds that pelagic sealing involved the destruction of breeding stock, because it was practically impossible to distinguish between the male and female seal when in the water; and that it was unnecessarily wasteful, inasmuch as a large proportion of the seals so killed were lost. Britain contended that in all known cases the extermination of seals had been the result of operations upon land, and had never been caused exclusively by sealing in the pelagic zone.\n\nThe negotiations came to nothing, and the United States fell back upon their claim of right. In June 1890, it was reported that certain American revenue cutters had been ordered to proceed to the Bering Sea. Sir [[Julian Pauncefote]], the British ambassador at [[Washington, DC|Washington]], having failed to obtain an assurance that British vessels would not be interfered with, laid a formal protest before the United States government.\n\n==Arbitration==\nThere followed a diplomatic controversy, in the course of which the United States developed the contentions which were afterwards laid before the tribunal of arbitration. The claim that Bering Sea was ''[[mare clausum]]'' was abandoned, but it was asserted that Russia had formerly exercised therein rights of exclusive jurisdiction which had passed to the United States, and they relied ''[[inter alia]]'' upon the [[ukase]] of 1821, by which foreign vessels had been forbidden to approach within 100 Italian miles of the coasts of Russian America. It was pointed out by Great Britain that this ukase had been the subject of protest both by Great Britain and the United States, and that by treaties similar in their terms, made between Russia and each of the protesting powers, Russia had agreed that their subjects should not be troubled or molested in navigating or fishing in any part of the Pacific Ocean. The American answer was that the [[Pacific Ocean]] did not include the Bering Sea. They also claimed an interest in the fur seals, involving the right to protect them outside the three-mile limit. In August 1890 [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] proposed that the question at issue should be submitted to arbitration. This was ultimately assented to by the secretary of state, [[James Gillespie Blaine]], on the understanding that certain specific\npoints, which he indicated, should be laid before the arbitrators.\n\nOn February 29, 1892, a definitive treaty was signed at Washington, D.C. Each power was to name two arbitrators, and the president of the [[France|French]] Republic, the king of [[Italy]], the king of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were each to name one.\n\n===Terms of reference and arbitrators===\nThe points submitted were\n#What exclusive jurisdiction in the sea now known as Bering Sea, and what exclusive rights in the seal fisheries therein, did Russia assert and exercise prior to and up to the time of the cession of Alaska to the United States? \n#How far were her claims of jurisdiction as to the seal fisheries recognized and conceded by Great Britain? \n#Was the body of water now known as Bering Sea included in the phrase \"Pacific Ocean\", as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, and what rights, if any, in Bering Sea were held exclusively exercised by Russia after the said treaty? \n#Did not all the rights of Russia as to jurisdiction and as to the seal fisheries in Bering Sea east of the water boundary, in the treaty between the United States and Russia of the 30th of  March 1867, pass unimpaired to the United States under that treaty? \n#Had the United States any and what right of protection over, or property in, the fur seals frequenting the islands of Bering Sea when such seals are found outside the three-mile limit?\n\nIn the event of a determination in favour of Great Britain the arbitrators were to determine what concurrent regulations were necessary for the preservation of the seals, and a joint commission was to be appointed by the two powers to assist them in the investigation of the facts of seal life. The question of damages was reserved for further discussion, but either party was to be at liberty to submit any question of fact to the arbitrators, and to ask for a finding thereon. The tribunal was to sit at [[Paris]]. The treaty was approved by the [[United States Senate]] on the March 29, 1892, and ratified by the president on April 22.\n\nThe United States appointed as arbitrator Mr. [[John Marshall Harlan|John M. Harlan]], a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and Mr [[John T. Morgan]], a member of the Senate. The British arbitrators were [[Lord Hannen]] and [[Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]]. The neutral arbitrators were the Baron de Courcel, the [[Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta|Marquis Visconti-Venosta]], and Mr. [[Gregers Winther Wulfsberg Gram]], appointed respectively by the president of the French Republic, the king of Italy, and the king of Norway and Sweden. The sittings of the tribunal began in February 1893 and ended in August.  [[Henry Williams Blodgett]] acted as U.S. counsel before the tribunal.\n\n===Main arguments===\nWhen the evidence was before the tribunal, it was plain that the United States had a very weak case with regard to the claim of exclusive jurisdiction in the Bering Sea (the first claim), and it was not strongly pressed by the counsel of the United States.<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Sealing}}</ref> The real question, therefore, and the one upon which the chief argument was directed, was the second of the two claims put forward on behalf of the United States, the right of property in the seals and the right of protecting them beyond the three-mile limit.\n\nIt was suggested that the seals had some of the characteristics of the domestic animals, and could therefore be the subject of something in the nature of a right of property. They were so far amenable to human control that it was possible to take their increase without destroying the stock. Sealing upon land was legitimate sealing; the United States being the owners of the land, the industry was a trust vested in them for the benefit of mankind. On the other hand, pelagic sealing, being a method of promiscuous slaughter, was illegitimate; it was ''contra bonos mores'' and analogous to piracy. Consequently, the United States claimed a right to restrain such practices, both as proprietors of the seals and as proprietors and trustees of the legitimate industry.\n\nSuch a right to restrain was a novelty hitherto unrecognized by any system of law. [[James C. Carter]], therefore, as counsel for the United States, submitted a theory of international jurisprudence which was equally novel. He argued that the determination of the tribunal must be grounded upon \"the principles of right,\" that \"by the rule or principle of right was meant a moral rule dictated by the general standard of justice upon which civilized nations are agreed, that this international standard of justice is but another name for international law, that the particular recognized rules were but cases of the application of a more general rule, and that where the particular rules were silent the general rule applied.\" The practical result of giving effect to this contention would be that an international tribunal could make new law and apply it retrospectively. Carter's contention was successfully combated by [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]], the leading counsel for Great Britain.\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe award, which was signed and published on 15 August 1893, was in favour of Great Britain on all points. The question of damages, which had been reserved, was ultimately settled by a mixed commission appointed by the two powers in February 1896, the total amount awarded to the British sealers being $473,151.26 - in excess of US$10 million in present-day inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nSince the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited. The regulations were to remain in force until abolished by mutual agreement, but were to be examined every five years with a view to modification.<ref name=nie/>\n\nThese regulations, however, failed of their object, because the mother seals did not feed within the protected area, but far outside of it. The mother seals were therefore taken by the pelagic sealers as before, and their young were left to starve. The largest catch in the history of pelagic sealing, that of 1894, was made in the first season of the operation of these very regulations designed to so limit and restrict pelagic sealing as to protect and preserve the herd.<ref name=ea>{{Americana |last=Clark |first=George Archibald |wstitle=Seals and Sealing|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nA joint commission of scientists from Great Britain and the United States further considered the problem, and came to the conclusion that the pelagic sealing needed to be curtailed.  However further joint tribunals did not enact new legal restrictions, and then Japan also embarked upon pelagic sealing.<ref name=ea/> Finally, the [[North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911]] severely curtailed the sealing industry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cod Wars]]\n*[[1993 Cherbourg incident]]\n*[[Turbot War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{more footnotes|date=July 2014}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Bering Sea Arbitration |volume=3 |pages=776-777 |first=Montague Hughes |last=Crackanthorpe}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''], E.O.S.

[[James C. Carter]], therefore, as counsel for the United States, submitted a theory of international jurisprudence which was equally novel. He argued that the determination of the tribunal must be grounded upon \"the principles of right,\" that \"by the rule or principle of right was meant a moral rule dictated by the general standard of justice upon which civilized nations are agreed, that this international standard of justice is but another name for international law, that the particular recognized rules were but cases of the application of a more general rule, and that where the particular rules were silent the general rule applied.\" The practical result of giving effect to this contention would be that an international tribunal could make new law and apply it retrospectively. Carter's contention was successfully combated by [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]], the leading counsel for Great Britain.\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe award, which was signed and published on 15 August 1893, was in favour of Great Britain on all points. The question of damages, which had been reserved, was ultimately settled by a mixed commission appointed by the two powers in February 1896, the total amount awarded to the British sealers being $473,151.26 - in excess of US$10 million in present-day inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nSince the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited. The regulations were to remain in force until abolished by mutual agreement, but were to be examined every five years with a view to modification.<ref name=nie/>\n\nThese regulations, however, failed of their object, because the mother seals did not feed within the protected area, but far outside of it. The mother seals were therefore taken by the pelagic sealers as before, and their young were left to starve. The largest catch in the history of pelagic sealing, that of 1894, was made in the first season of the operation of these very regulations designed to so limit and restrict pelagic sealing as to protect and preserve the herd.<ref name=ea>{{Americana |last=Clark |first=George Archibald |wstitle=Seals and Sealing|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nA joint commission of scientists from Great Britain and the United States further considered the problem, and came to the conclusion that the pelagic sealing needed to be curtailed.  However further joint tribunals did not enact new legal restrictions, and then Japan also embarked upon pelagic sealing.<ref name=ea/> Finally, the [[North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911]] severely curtailed the sealing industry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cod Wars]]\n*[[1993 Cherbourg incident]]\n*[[Turbot War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{more footnotes|date=July 2014}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Bering Sea Arbitration |volume=3 |pages=776-777 |first=Montague Hughes |last=Crackanthorpe}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''], E.O.S.

Although five members were not sovereign when they joined the UN, all subsequently became fully independent between 1946 and 1991. Because a state can only be admitted to membership in the UN by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly, [[List of states with limited recognition|a number of states that are considered sovereign]] according to the [[Montevideo Convention]] are not members of the UN. This is because the UN does not consider them to possess [[sovereignty]], mainly due to the lack of [[diplomatic recognition|international recognition]] or due to opposition from one of the permanent members.\n\nIn addition to the member states, the UN also invites non-member states to become [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observers at the UN General Assembly]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Secretariat |title=UN GA invitations to non-member states |url=https://undocs.org/en/A/INF/74/3 |website=United Nations |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>, allowing them to participate and speak in General Assembly meetings, but not vote.

The UN was notified on 18 November 1949 of the formation of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China]]; however, the [[Government of the Republic of China]] continued to represent China at the UN, despite the small size of the ROC's jurisdiction of [[List of islands of the Republic of China|Taiwan and a number of smaller islands]] compared to the PRC's jurisdiction of mainland China. As both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of China, proposals to effect a change in the representation of China in the UN were discussed but rejected for the next two decades, as the ROC was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the [[One-China policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/20-taiwan-un-winkler|title=Taiwan's UN Dilemma: To Be or Not To Be|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|first=Sigrid|last=Winkler|date=June 2012|accessdate=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s, a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count.

During the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]], and in response to the election of [[Malaysia]] as a [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council]], in a letter dated 20 January 1965, [[Indonesia]] informed the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] that it had decided \"at this stage and under the present circumstances\" to withdraw from the UN. However, following the overthrow of [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]], in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision \"to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly\".
