A charter for the Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was obtained in 1871, and the company was organized before the end of May. The charter was amended to allow placing piers in the river by 1872 (despite fierce opposition from navigation interests), and the company began raising funds. Through the influence of [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] president [[J. Edgar Thomson]] was persuaded to personally invest in the project.\n\nThis funding led to a surge of activity. The line was to be carried from [[Harrisburg (PA)|Harrisburg]] to the crossing of the Delaware River at [[Portland, PA|Portland]] by the [[South Mountain Railroad]]. The '''South Mountain and Boston Railroad''' was chartered in [[New Jersey]] on March 13, 1873 and also in [[New York (state)|New York]] to continue the line via [[Poughkeepsie (NY)|Poughkeepsie]] and [[Boston Corners, New York|Boston Corners]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line. At the state line, an extension of the planned [[Massachusetts Central Railroad (defunct)|Massachusetts Central Railroad]] would connect, taking traffic to [[Boston (MA)|Boston]]. Grading began on the various lines (known, in the aggregate, as the South Mountain and Boston Railroad), and the cornerstone was laid for a bridge pier at Poughkeepsie. However, the [[Panic of 1873]] and the death of Thomson in May 1874 and loss of his personal support brought the project to a halt.\n\n[[Image:1876 South Mountain & Boston.jpg|thumb|300px|1876 map]]\nAn attempt at revival was made in 1879. By this time the South Mountain Railroad had collapsed; a new railroad, the '''Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and New England Railroad''', was incorporated on May 6, 1879 to follow its route from Harrisburg to the South Mountain and Boston connection at Portland. This company too would be short-lived; the South Mountain and Boston's New Jersey Division was renamed on March 11, 1880 to the '''Pennsylvania and New England Railroad''', and that company's [[Pennsylvania]] Division was incorporated on May 5, 1880. The property of the PP&NE was sold to the P&NE (PA Division) on October 13, 1880. This does not seem to have improved the fortunes of this segment of the line; a third company, the '''Delaware and Slatington Railroad''', was incorporated on September 9, 1881, to run from the P&NE (NJ Division) at Portland to [[Slatington, Pennsylvania|Slatington]] on the [[Lehigh River]]. The P&NE (NJ Division) merged with the Delaware and Slatington on June 22, 1882 to form the '''Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad'''.\n\n===Pennsylvania construction: 1880-1891===\nIn the meantime, the P&NE (PA Division) was successful in laying one and one-sixth mile (2&nbsp;km) of track to the east of [[Wind Gap, PA|Wind Gap]] about 1880. However, it was foreclosed on July 25, 1881, and reorganized as the '''Susquehanna and Delaware River Railroad''' on August 23, 1881; it was foreclosed again and reorganized on July 13, 1886 as the '''Harrisburg and New England Railroad'''. This company was supposedly reorganized as the '''Harrisburg and Eastern Railroad''' on July 31, 1891.\n\n===Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad: 1882-1887===\nThe '''Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad''' was formed June 22, 1882 as a consolidation of the Pennsylvania and New England Railroad (NJ Division) and Delaware and Slatington Railroad, to build from [[Slatington, Pennsylvania]] to [[Pine Island, New York]]. In December of that year, [[John L. Blair]], who controlled the nearby [[Bangor and Portland Railway]], acquired control of the PS&NE, in order to give the B&P direct access to New England and other points. Additionally the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]'s [[Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad]] could no longer access points on the B&P.\n\nConstruction was carried out through 1883, with grading finished in Pennsylvania and about 12 miles west from [[Sussex, New Jersey]]. The bridge over the [[Delaware River]] at [[Portland (PA)|Portland]] was built, and rails were laid for about half of the length in Pennsylvania. In early 1883 a dispute erupted with the [[Wind Gap and Delaware Railroad]] over the tracks between [[Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania|Pen Argyl]] and [[Bangor, Pennsylvania|Bangor]], which the PS&NE wanted to use. Later that year the company went [[bankrupt]] and construction stopped.\n\n===Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and Boston Railroad: 1887-1895===\nThe Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad was sold at [[foreclosure]] to [[William W. Gibbs]], president of the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge Company]], on July 12, 1887, and was reorganized as the '''Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and Boston Railroad''' (also known as the \"Pickles, Pork, and Beans\" Line). Construction was begun, but the company again went [[bankrupt]], and was sold at [[foreclosure]] December 14, 1894.\n\nAround that time, various other companies were chartered to build the line over the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]], and in 1889, the [[Central New England and Western Railroad]] was completed. That part would be combined with the PS&NE in 1892 by the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railway]], but in 1893 the two parts were split. The eastern section later became part of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]], and the western section stayed independent to the end.\n\nThe '''Campbell Hall Connecting Railroad''' was chartered April 3, 1889 to obtain the right to operate the section in [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was originally planned to extend beyond [[Pine Island, New York|Pine Island]] to [[Campbell Hall, New York|Campbell Hall]], the west end of the existing Poughkeepsie Bridge line.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia and Reading Railway]] gained control of the [[Central New England and Western Railroad]] in early 1892, and the PP&B soon after, giving it a route from [[Reading (PA)|Reading]] via the [[Schuylkill and Lehigh Railroad]] to [[Slatington (PA)|Slatington]], and then to New England along its new acquisitions. The Reading's [[bankruptcy]] in 1893 ended this control, and led to the PP&B's bankruptcy.\n\n===Lehigh and New England Railroad: 1895-1961===\n{{Rail freight\n|title=Revenue freight traffic, in millions of net ton-miles\n|float=right\n|1925|348\n|1933|244\n|1944|550\n|1956|338\n|1960|143\n}}\nThe '''Lehigh and New England Railroad''' was organized April 2, 1895 as the successor to the PP&B. The route was completed from Slatington to Pine Island, but between [[Swartswood, New Jersey|Swartswood]] and [[Hainesburg Junction]] it used [[trackage rights]] over the [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway]]. Despite that, a tunnel ({{coord|40|58|44|N|74|46|1|W|type:landmark|name=Tunnel}}) was built under the fill for the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]'s [[New Jersey Cut-Off]] (opened 1911) in case the L&NE ever decided to complete its own line.<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:October 2006 - 2 014.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The never-used tunnel for the Lehigh & New England Railroad is on the right of this photo, as seen from Tunnel Field in Knowlton Township, NJ. The tunnel for NJ Route 94 is on the left. The Lackawanna Cut-Off is atop the embankment.]] -->\nAdditionally, the planned route from [[Pine Island, New York|Pine Island]] to [[Campbell Hall, New York|Campbell Hall]] was cancelled, and [[trackage rights]] were obtained over the [[Erie Railroad]]'s [[Goshen and Deckertown Railroad]] and [[Montgomery and Erie Railroad]].\n\nThe [[Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad]] and its leased [[Wind Gap and Delaware Railroad]] were operated by the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] until February 1, 1905, when the two companies were merged into the L&NE. Around the same time the L&NE acquired the [[Northampton Railroad]]. This gave the L&NE a branch to [[Bethlehem (PA)|Bethlehem]], with a branch off that one to [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania|Martins Creek]]. Part of the main line between [[Benders Junction]] (the crossing of the original L&NE and the L&L) and [[Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania|Pen Argyl]] was abandoned in 1905, with the new route using the L&L and WG&D.\n\nThe [[Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company]] (LC&N) gained control of the L&NE on May 9, 1904.\n\nA yard at [[Maybrook, New York]] opened in 1912, with L&NE trains terminating there via a section of the [[Central New England Railway]].\n\nOn July 24, 1912 a new extension opened, splitting from the main line at [[Danielsville, Pennsylvania]] and running west to [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania|Tamaqua]] to directly serve the LC&N. On December 14, 1913 the L&NE acquired the [[Panther Creek Railroad]], running east from Tamaqua to [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania|Summit Hill]], and with a connection to the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]'s [[Hauto Tunnel]] for access to [[Nesquehoning (PA)|Nesquehoning]] obtained in 1915.\n\nOn June 4, 1926 the [[Reading Company]] leased the L&NE, but other railroads objected, and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] rejected the lease, preferring a lease by the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] (which was never done).\n\n[[File:Lehigh and New England tunnel, Knowlton, NJ.jpg|thumb|370px|The never-used tunnel (at right) for the Lehigh & New England under the now-abandoned Lackawanna Cut-Off. NJ Route 94 uses the tunnel on the left). The tunnel is now an integral part of Knowlton's Tunnel Field, a sports and recreation area that spans the Cut-Off via this tunnel.]]\n\n<!-- [[File:Lehigh and New England tunnel, Knowlton, NJ.jpg|thumb|370px|right|Two piers of the L&NE bridge over the Delaware River near Columbia, NJ are still extant in 2006, as seen from the nearby pedestrian bridge.]]-->\n\nThe LNE Board of Directors decided to end all railroad operations on October 31, 1961. Although the LNE was still profitable, the rapid decline of the anthracite coal business was seen on the horizon and the decision was made to cease operations. By this date the LNE mainline saw only one coal train per week (which usually operated on Thursdays). Trackage was removed by the following year and the bridges over the Lehigh River and Delaware River were dismantled by 1969.\n\nWhile a never particularly profitable system because it paralleled the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway|Lehigh & Hudson River Railway]] and did not serve any large markets, the L&NE did have a profitable cement business from its lines around Bath, Pennsylvania; the trackage which served this commodity was taken over and operated by the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), then by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad|Lehigh Valley]] in 1972 when the CNJ's lease on its Pennsylvania trackage expired and was not renewed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} To railfans, the L&NE is best remembered for its diesel motive power, which consisted entirely of models built by [[American Locomotive Company|Alco]].\n\n===Lehigh and New England Railway: 1961-===\nThe '''Lehigh and New England Railway''' was chartered by the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] to take over some of the lines in Pennsylvania. Included in that sale was the main line east from [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania|Tamaqua]], the old [[Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad]] and [[Northampton Railroad]] from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] to [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania|Martins Creek]], and the branch from Bethlehem west to [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]].

A charter for the Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was obtained in 1871, and the company was organized before the end of May. The charter was amended to allow placing piers in the river by 1872 (despite fierce opposition from navigation interests), and the company began raising funds. Through the influence of [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] president [[J. Edgar Thomson]] was persuaded to personally invest in the project.\n\nThis funding led to a surge of activity. The line was to be carried from [[Harrisburg (PA)|Harrisburg]] to the crossing of the Delaware River at [[Portland, PA|Portland]] by the [[South Mountain Railroad]]. The '''South Mountain and Boston Railroad''' was chartered in [[New Jersey]] on March 13, 1873 and also in [[New York (state)|New York]] to continue the line via [[Poughkeepsie (NY)|Poughkeepsie]] and [[Boston Corners, New York|Boston Corners]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line. At the state line, an extension of the planned [[Massachusetts Central Railroad (defunct)|Massachusetts Central Railroad]] would connect, taking traffic to [[Boston (MA)|Boston]]. Grading began on the various lines (known, in the aggregate, as the South Mountain and Boston Railroad), and the cornerstone was laid for a bridge pier at Poughkeepsie. However, the [[Panic of 1873]] and the death of Thomson in May 1874 and loss of his personal support brought the project to a halt.\n\n[[Image:1876 South Mountain & Boston.jpg|thumb|300px|1876 map]]\nAn attempt at revival was made in 1879. By this time the South Mountain Railroad had collapsed; a new railroad, the '''Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and New England Railroad''', was incorporated on May 6, 1879 to follow its route from Harrisburg to the South Mountain and Boston connection at Portland. This company too would be short-lived; the South Mountain and Boston's New Jersey Division was renamed on March 11, 1880 to the '''Pennsylvania and New England Railroad''', and that company's [[Pennsylvania]] Division was incorporated on May 5, 1880. The property of the PP&NE was sold to the P&NE (PA Division) on October 13, 1880. This does not seem to have improved the fortunes of this segment of the line; a third company, the '''Delaware and Slatington Railroad''', was incorporated on September 9, 1881, to run from the P&NE (NJ Division) at Portland to [[Slatington, Pennsylvania|Slatington]] on the [[Lehigh River]]. The P&NE (NJ Division) merged with the Delaware and Slatington on June 22, 1882 to form the '''Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad'''.\n\n===Pennsylvania construction: 1880-1891===\nIn the meantime, the P&NE (PA Division) was successful in laying one and one-sixth mile (2&nbsp;km) of track to the east of [[Wind Gap, PA|Wind Gap]] about 1880. However, it was foreclosed on July 25, 1881, and reorganized as the '''Susquehanna and Delaware River Railroad''' on August 23, 1881; it was foreclosed again and reorganized on July 13, 1886 as the '''Harrisburg and New England Railroad'''. This company was supposedly reorganized as the '''Harrisburg and Eastern Railroad''' on July 31, 1891.\n\n===Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad: 1882-1887===\nThe '''Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad''' was formed June 22, 1882 as a consolidation of the Pennsylvania and New England Railroad (NJ Division) and Delaware and Slatington Railroad, to build from [[Slatington, Pennsylvania]] to [[Pine Island, New York]]. In December of that year, [[John L. Blair]], who controlled the nearby [[Bangor and Portland Railway]], acquired control of the PS&NE, in order to give the B&P direct access to New England and other points. Additionally the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]'s [[Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad]] could no longer access points on the B&P.\n\nConstruction was carried out through 1883, with grading finished in Pennsylvania and about 12 miles west from [[Sussex, New Jersey]]. The bridge over the [[Delaware River]] at [[Portland (PA)|Portland]] was built, and rails were laid for about half of the length in Pennsylvania. In early 1883 a dispute erupted with the [[Wind Gap and Delaware Railroad]] over the tracks between [[Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania|Pen Argyl]] and [[Bangor, Pennsylvania|Bangor]], which the PS&NE wanted to use. Later that year the company went [[bankrupt]] and construction stopped.\n\n===Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and Boston Railroad: 1887-1895===\nThe Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad was sold at [[foreclosure]] to [[William W. Gibbs]], president of the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge Company]], on July 12, 1887, and was reorganized as the '''Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and Boston Railroad''' (also known as the \"Pickles, Pork, and Beans\" Line). Construction was begun, but the company again went [[bankrupt]], and was sold at [[foreclosure]] December 14, 1894.\n\nAround that time, various other companies were chartered to build the line over the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]], and in 1889, the [[Central New England and Western Railroad]] was completed. That part would be combined with the PS&NE in 1892 by the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railway]], but in 1893 the two parts were split. The eastern section later became part of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]], and the western section stayed independent to the end.\n\nThe '''Campbell Hall Connecting Railroad''' was chartered April 3, 1889 to obtain the right to operate the section in [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was originally planned to extend beyond [[Pine Island, New York|Pine Island]] to [[Campbell Hall, New York|Campbell Hall]], the west end of the existing Poughkeepsie Bridge line.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia and Reading Railway]] gained control of the [[Central New England and Western Railroad]] in early 1892, and the PP&B soon after, giving it a route from [[Reading (PA)|Reading]] via the [[Schuylkill and Lehigh Railroad]] to [[Slatington (PA)|Slatington]], and then to New England along its new acquisitions. The Reading's [[bankruptcy]] in 1893 ended this control, and led to the PP&B's bankruptcy.\n\n===Lehigh and New England Railroad: 1895-1961===\n{{Rail freight\n|title=Revenue freight traffic, in millions of net ton-miles\n|float=right\n|1925|348\n|1933|244\n|1944|550\n|1956|338\n|1960|143\n}}\nThe '''Lehigh and New England Railroad''' was organized April 2, 1895 as the successor to the PP&B. The route was completed from Slatington to Pine Island, but between [[Swartswood, New Jersey|Swartswood]] and [[Hainesburg Junction]] it used [[trackage rights]] over the [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway]]. Despite that, a tunnel ({{coord|40|58|44|N|74|46|1|W|type:landmark|name=Tunnel}}) was built under the fill for the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]'s [[New Jersey Cut-Off]] (opened 1911) in case the L&NE ever decided to complete its own line.<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:October 2006 - 2 014.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The never-used tunnel for the Lehigh & New England Railroad is on the right of this photo, as seen from Tunnel Field in Knowlton Township, NJ. The tunnel for NJ Route 94 is on the left. The Lackawanna Cut-Off is atop the embankment.]] -->\nAdditionally, the planned route from [[Pine Island, New York|Pine Island]] to [[Campbell Hall, New York|Campbell Hall]] was cancelled, and [[trackage rights]] were obtained over the [[Erie Railroad]]'s [[Goshen and Deckertown Railroad]] and [[Montgomery and Erie Railroad]].\n\nThe [[Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad]] and its leased [[Wind Gap and Delaware Railroad]] were operated by the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] until February 1, 1905, when the two companies were merged into the L&NE. Around the same time the L&NE acquired the [[Northampton Railroad]]. This gave the L&NE a branch to [[Bethlehem (PA)|Bethlehem]], with a branch off that one to [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania|Martins Creek]]. Part of the main line between [[Benders Junction]] (the crossing of the original L&NE and the L&L) and [[Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania|Pen Argyl]] was abandoned in 1905, with the new route using the L&L and WG&D.\n\nThe [[Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company]] (LC&N) gained control of the L&NE on May 9, 1904.\n\nA yard at [[Maybrook, New York]] opened in 1912, with L&NE trains terminating there via a section of the [[Central New England Railway]].\n\nOn July 24, 1912 a new extension opened, splitting from the main line at [[Danielsville, Pennsylvania]] and running west to [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania|Tamaqua]] to directly serve the LC&N. On December 14, 1913 the L&NE acquired the [[Panther Creek Railroad]], running east from Tamaqua to [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania|Summit Hill]], and with a connection to the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]'s [[Hauto Tunnel]] for access to [[Nesquehoning (PA)|Nesquehoning]] obtained in 1915.\n\nOn June 4, 1926 the [[Reading Company]] leased the L&NE, but other railroads objected, and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] rejected the lease, preferring a lease by the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] (which was never done).\n\n[[File:Lehigh and New England tunnel, Knowlton, NJ.jpg|thumb|370px|The never-used tunnel (at right) for the Lehigh & New England under the now-abandoned Lackawanna Cut-Off. NJ Route 94 uses the tunnel on the left). The tunnel is now an integral part of Knowlton's Tunnel Field, a sports and recreation area that spans the Cut-Off via this tunnel.]]\n\n<!-- [[File:Lehigh and New England tunnel, Knowlton, NJ.jpg|thumb|370px|right|Two piers of the L&NE bridge over the Delaware River near Columbia, NJ are still extant in 2006, as seen from the nearby pedestrian bridge.]]-->\n\nThe LNE Board of Directors decided to end all railroad operations on October 31, 1961. Although the LNE was still profitable, the rapid decline of the anthracite coal business was seen on the horizon and the decision was made to cease operations. By this date the LNE mainline saw only one coal train per week (which usually operated on Thursdays). Trackage was removed by the following year and the bridges over the Lehigh River and Delaware River were dismantled by 1969.\n\nWhile a never particularly profitable system because it paralleled the Lehigh & Hudson River Railway and did not serve any large markets, the L&NE did have a profitable cement business from its lines around Bath, Pennsylvania; the trackage which served this commodity was taken over and operated by the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), then by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad|Lehigh Valley]] in 1972 when the CNJ's lease on its Pennsylvania trackage expired and was not renewed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} To railfans, the L&NE is best remembered for its diesel motive power, which consisted entirely of models built by [[American Locomotive Company|Alco]].\n\n===Lehigh and New England Railway: 1961-===\nThe '''Lehigh and New England Railway''' was chartered by the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] to take over some of the lines in Pennsylvania. Included in that sale was the main line east from [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania|Tamaqua]], the old [[Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad]] and [[Northampton Railroad]] from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] to [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania|Martins Creek]], and the branch from Bethlehem west to [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]].

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track.

This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.  The recording was directed and produced by [[Donald Lawrence]] and was released as a [[CD]] on April 10, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theclarksisters.com/whatsnew.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213174605/http://www.theclarksisters.com/whatsnew.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> on EMI Gospel, followed by a CD/DVD Special Edition release June 19, 2007.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]]. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their largest mainstream crossover gold-certified hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\".

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]],\" the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!
