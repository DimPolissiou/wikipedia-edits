Jazz music also helped pave the way for more jobs for women. This increase of a very male-dominated career until the 1920s allowed more women to be in a performing arts career. In return of this increase, ''Showboat'', the first jazz Broadway musical, was produced. ''Showboat'' discusses the hardships of family in Mississippi and the reunification of family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnh.com/show/89/Show-Boat|title=Show Boat|website=rnh.com|access-date=26 March 2019}}</ref> Jazz music influenced in helping women gain more jobs, open environment for post-war equality, and open sexuality in the early twentieth century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/tbacig/studproj/is3099/jazzcult/20sjazz/jazzlib.html|title=jazzlib|website=d.umn.edu|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> Many of the women in jazz music at the time helped influence the genre and many jazz women musicians were people of color.

She studied [[counterpoint]] with Benedetto Re, one of the leading teachers at [[Pavia Cathedral]]. She composed a collection of [[motet]]s in the new [[concertato]] style in [[Milan]] in 1609, an imitative eight-voice ''[[Salve Regina]]'' in 1611, and a [[motet]], ''Audite verbum Dominum,'' for four voices in 1618. She composed traditional pieces and more innovative works. Among the latter is ''Duo seraphim.'' Her motet ''O Salutaris hodie,'' included in ''Motetti'' op. 2, was one of the first pieces to include the [[violone]], a bowed stringed instrument.\n\n===Baroque era===\n[[File:Orazio Gentileschi - Il suonatore di liuto (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Lute Player'' by [[Orazio Gentileschi]], presumed to be a portrait of Francesca Caccini]]\n[[Francesca Caccini]] (1587\u20131641) was an Italian composer, singer, [[lute]]nist, poet, and music teacher. Her singing for the wedding of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Maria de Medici]] in 1600 was praised by Henry, who called her the \"best singer in all of France\". She worked in the [[Medici]] court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until 1627. By 1614 she was the court's most highly paid musician, because her musical [[virtuosity]] so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany's de facto Regent, Granduchess [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies. In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets. In 1625 she composed a 75-minute \"comedy-ballet\". In all, she wrote sixteen staged works. She was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony changes, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates emotional affect.\n\n[[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619\u20131677) was an Italian [[Baroque]] composer and singer. As a child, her considerable vocal talents were displayed to a wide audience. She was also compositionally gifted, and her father arranged for her to study with composer [[Francesco Cavalli]]. Strozzi was said to be \"the most prolific composer \u2013 man or woman \u2013 of printed secular vocal music in Venice in the Middle of the century\".{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=135}} Her output is also unique in that it only contains secular vocal music, with the exception of one volume of sacred songs.{{sfn|Heller|2006}} She was renowned for her poetic ability as well as her compositional talent. Her lyrics were often poetic and well-articulated.{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=138}} Nearly three-quarters of her printed works were written for [[soprano]], but she also published works for other voices.{{sfn|Kendrick|2002}} Her compositions are firmly rooted in the ''[[seconda pratica]]'' tradition. Strozzi's music evokes the spirit of [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]], heir of [[Monteverdi]].  However, her style is more lyrical, and more dependent on sheer vocal sound.{{sfn|Rosand|1986|p=170}} Many of the texts for her early pieces were written by her father Giulio. Later texts were written by her father's colleagues, and for many compositions she may have written her own texts.\n\n[[\u00c9lisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665\u20131729) was a French composer, musician and [[harpsichordist]].

Her career was made possible by the Austrian Lombardy, which was progressive and enlightened in [[women's rights]]. Her patron was [[Maria Theresia]], holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Lombardy, and [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis]], a gifted composer and contemporary. Her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic. She composed operas, including heroic drama and serious drama styles.

She showed prodigious musical ability as a child and began to write music. Even though famous visitors to her family home were equally impressed by Fanny and her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], Fanny was limited by prevailing attitudes of the time toward women. Her father was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. Her father wrote to her in 1820, telling her that \"[m]usic will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament [in your life]\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I 82</ref> Felix cautioned her against publishing her works under her own name and seeking a career in music.

From an early age, she had a one-hour lesson in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. In 1830, at the age of eleven, she had become a virtuoso soloist and she left on a concert tour of European cities. In the late 1830s, she performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews. [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] described her playing to [[Franz Liszt]], who came to hear one of her concerts and subsequently \"praised her extravagantly\" in a letter that was published in the Parisian ''Revue et Gazette Musicale''.<ref name=\"Nancya250\">Reich (1986), 250.</ref> She was named a ''K\u00f6nigliche und Kaiserliche Kammervirtuosin'' (\"Royal and Imperial Chamber Virtuoso\"), [[Austria]]'s highest musical honor.<ref name=\"Nancya250\" />\n\nShe was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage to [[Robert Schumann]], she played what was then customary, mainly bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was also customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, works such as her Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and her popular Scherzo (Op. 10). Her works include songs, piano pieces, a piano concerto, a [[piano trio]], choral pieces, and three Romances for violin and piano. <!--Her husband however remarked that she did not have the opportunity to do this often, as a result of being a wife and a mother:\n\n{{quote|'Clara has composed a series of small pieces, which show a musical and tender ingenuity such as she has never attained before.

This band consists of a trio of [[Natalie Maines]] as lead singer, Natalie Maguire on the fiddle and mandolin, and [[Emily Robison]], master of banjo, the Dobro, guitar, and the accordion. The Dixie Chicks sold more CDs than all other country music groups combined. They won five [[Grammys]], in 2000, the Country Music Association's Album of the Year, and the Vocal Group of the Year award in 2002. Another famous female band includes the WildWood Girls. Originally the WildWood Pickers beginning in 1979 from the Chicago area, the all female band began after the band became a family affair and later, they changed their name to WildWood Girls in 1982, resulting in twice as many bookings. They embarked on overseas tours for the USO and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], they worked as a band at [[Dollywood]] for about 5 years, and they played many times at Bill Monroe's Bean Blossom Festival in [[Indiana]] for 10 years. They released six recordings, despite the issues they ran into regarding the fact that they were an all girls band. Yet, another famous band is the Happy Hollow String brand (1974\u20131979). They were an all female bluegrass band with Sandy Crisco on banjo.

[[Courtney Love]] described the other females in [[Hole (band)|Hole]] as using a more \"lunar viewpoint\" in their roles as musicians.<ref>Boder, Christopher. \"The Hole Story\", ''Buzz'', Page 13, Vol VII, Issue 70.

Bands like The Distillers, fronted by Brody Dalle, influenced the rise of street punk. St. Vincent started gaining more traction and eventually appeared on the cover of Guitar World magazine. St. Vincent wore a T-shirt with a bikini decal on the magazine cover, a comment on how when women appear with guitars, they're usually dressed very minimally, as a marketing tool to sell the instruments. Haim, a band composed of three sisters, is extremely outspoken when it comes to the promotion of women in music, calling out major music festivals for the lack of female-fronted bands on bills and the lack of payment for female artists as compared to male artists of the same level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/06/13/haim-festival-inequality/|title=HAIM Says a Male Group Got Paid 10 Times More by a Festival|date=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back|title=Live music acts are mostly male-only.

One of the most famous girl bands is [[Little Mix]] (2011), a British band that originated on ''[[The X Factor]]'' and is composed of [[Jesy Nelson]], [[Leigh-Anne Pinnock]], [[Jade Thirlwall]], and [[Perrie Edwards]]. Little Mix is the first all female group since the [[Pussycat Dolls]] to reach the US top five with their album ''[[DNA (Little Mix album)|DNA]]'' (2012).

Often, during [[World War II]], these all women's groups would entertain the troops while the male musicians served. However, after the war, these girls groups were thrown aside, as male musicians returned and the public favored the \"normalcy\" it brought, and the over sexualization of females in music returned.<ref name=\"auto5\">Arnwine, B.

Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvvnh25.14</ref>\n\nSome of these musicians helped shape jazz music and [[American culture]]. When June Norton was young, she wanted to pursue classical music, in hopes that one day she could join the opera. However, this did not seem possible, so she began to pursue [[popular music]]. Norton became the first black woman in the region of Washington DC to appear singing in TV commercials marketed towards southern states. This led to her accomplishments of many awards including the 1962 Achievement Award from the [[National Association of Colored Women]], the TV Personality of the Year award, the 1962 Emphasis Award from the National Association of Market Development, and the 1962 Singer of the Year Award from the [[YMCA]]. She later stepped away from the spotlight and began a career as a counselor and married Thomas C. Cuff. She spent the rest of her working years helping underprivileged youth and female prisoners.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nAnother female pianist, composer, and vocalist made significant contribution to jazz and the American culture. [[Shirley Horn]] (1934\u20132005) recorded more than 25 albums and worked as a side musician for [[Stuff Smith]], [[Toots Thielemans]], [[Charlie Haden]], and [[Oscar Peterson]]. She practiced at the [[Howard University]] Junior School of Music, and later received offers from [[Juilliard]] University and [[Xavier University]], but opted to remain in Washington DC, marry, and have a child. She continued to tour and play gigs constantly. Her first recording was part of Stuff Smith's 1959 release, [[Cat on a Hot Fiddle]]. Her debut recording, [[Embers and Ashes]] attracted a large amount of attention and helped her to realize she wanted to be a concert pianist after all. A few months after this, [[Miles Davis]] contacted Horn and told [[Village Vanguard]] in New York City that he wanted Horn to open for him, and that he refused to play if this was not a possibility. This is when Horn's fame and reputation began to rise. She continued to work with [[Mercury Records]] and [[Verve Records]]. She received many awards including a [[Grammy Award]] in 1999 for Best Jazz vocal album for I Remember Miles, five Washington Area Music Awards, an honorary music degree from the [[Berklee College of Music]], and a 2004 NEA Jazz Master Fellowship and Award from the National Endowment for the Arts.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===Classical music===\nInstrumentalists in classical music may focus on one specific type of playing, such as solo recitals, solo concertos, [[chamber music]], or performing as a member of an orchestra, or they may do different types. Some musicians who play orchestral instruments may do all of these types of performances. Instrumentalists in classical music may do both live performances for an audience and recordings. In some cases, classical performers may do mostly live performances. There has traditionally been a gendered aspect to playing instruments in classical music.\n\nMany album covers for female classical musicians have photographs that emphasize the physical attractiveness of the performer, \"often using risqu\u00e9 images\".<ref>Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan. ''Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World'', Volume 1. SAGE Publications, 2011. p. 294</ref> According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', Classical women musicians are \"too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent\" and they face pressure \"to look sexy onstage and in photos.\"<ref name=\"music.cbc.ca\"/> Duchen states that while \"[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.\"<ref name=\"music.cbc.ca\"/>\n\n====Orchestra====\n[[File:Music. Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra BAnQ Vieux-Montr\u00e9al P48S1P08057.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra in 1942]]\nHistorically, orchestras tended to be almost exclusively male, with the exception of the harp player, as the harp was considered a \"women's instrument\". A music newspaper editorial in 1917 in England encouraged orchestras to allow women to play the \"lighter instruments\", with the understanding that these women performers would relinquish their positions to men once WW I was over.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1990s, to reduce the likelihood of [[gender bias]], some orchestras began conducting [[audition]]s of potential new members behind a screen, so the audition panel could not see if it was a male or female performer. Historically, there has been a tendency for brass sections to be male, and some women brass players have alleged that there is gender bias against female brass players. A study in the 1980s found that women made up 36% of US orchestras; 30% in the United Kingdom, and 16% in East and West Germany.<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/excuse.htm |title=Gender Bias in International Orchestras |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date=n.d.|accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref> Women tended to be hired by lower paid orchestras and they were less present in major orchestras.<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\"/>\n\nIn the past, the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] argued that \"ethnic and gender uniformity\" gave their orchestra a better sound.<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\"/> Several male VPO musicians stated in a 1996 interview that classical music has \"gender-defined qualities which can be most clearly expressed by male uniformity\" in the orchestra.<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\"/> One male VPO member stated that men \"carry secrets that are involved with music and tones, just like in Australian aboriginal or Indian cultures where men play certain instruments, and not the women.\"<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\"/> One male VPO performer stated that \"pregnancy brings problems.  It brings disorder.  Another important argument against women is that they can bring the solidarity of the men in question.

In many cases, though, soloists are accompanied, either by a pianist, a small [[chamber music]] ensemble, or, in the case of a concerto, by a full symphony orchestra. In the 2014\u20132015 season, the majority of concerto soloists who performed with major Canadian orchestras were male. In the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]], 67% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]], 74% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], 79% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]], 84% of the concerto soloists were male.<ref name=\"music.cbc.ca\"/> When the CBC news story on the gender balance of concerto soloists was released, the conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, [[Bramwell Tovey]], disputed the accuracy of the news story in regards to his orchestra, arguing that the article only took a single season into account.\n\n==Singers==\n\n===Popular music===\n[[File:Madonna Rebel Heart Tour 2015 - Amsterdam 2 (23823323680).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is often referred to as the artist who changed the role of women in popular music.]]\n\nSingers in popular music perform the vocals for bands and other music groups, which may range in size from a [[Musical duo|duo]] or a [[power trio]] to a large jazz [[big band]]. Singers typically do both live performances and studio recordings. Singers who do live performances may sing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or [[nightclub]]s, or they may perform in larger venues ranging from arts centres to stadiums. Some singers also perform in music videos, which are used to promote the songs. In some styles of music, singers may play a [[rhythm section]] instrument, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass or a percussion instrument while they sing. In some styles of pop, singers perform choreographed dance moves during the show. Three well-known examples of pop singers who perform elaborate dance routines in their live shows are [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]] and [[Britney Spears]].\n\nSinger-songwriter and music producer [[Bjork]] has commented on how \"women's labor and expertise\u2014inside and outside of the music industry\u2014go unnoticed.\" She has stated that \"[I]t's invisible, what women do,\" and \"[I]t's not rewarded as much.\"<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/> Bjork states \"that her male collaborators are typically credited for the sound of her records; because on stage she mainly sings, there is a widespread assumption that she neither produces [as a music producer] nor plays an instrument.\"<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/> In 2015, \"while accepting the Woman of the Year honor at this year's Billboard Women in Music event\", [[Lady Gaga]] commented on the \"difficulties of being a female recording artist.\" She said it \"is really hard sometimes for women in music.

An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues.  Classic blues songs performed by female vocalists were accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles, and were the first blues to be recorded. The classic female blues singers were pioneers in the [[record industry]], as they were among the first black singers and blues artists who were recorded. They were also instrumental in popularizing the [[12-bar blues]] throughout the US.\n\n[[Ma Rainey|Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey]] (1886\u20131939), known as the \"[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|Mother of]] the Blues\", is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and comedy around 1902.<ref>Stewart-Baxter, Derrick.

Wiley; Chichester: John Wiley [distributor], 2011, p. 159</ref> [[Marion Harris]] became one of the first white female singers to record the blues.\n\nThe most popular of the classic blues singers was [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bessie Smith]] (no relation to Mamie Smith), who first recorded in 1923 and became known as the \"Empress of the Blues\". She signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and became the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s, recording over 160 songs. Other classic blues singers who recorded extensively until the end of the 1920s were [[Ida Cox]], [[Clara Smith]], and [[Sara Martin]]. These early blues singers were an influence on later singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. These blues women's contributions to the genre included \"increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, [[Broadway musical]]s, [[torch song]]s of the 1930s and 1940s, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rhythm and blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]].\"<ref>Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 8</ref>\n\n===Country music ===\nGender discrimination and sexism occurs frequently in [[country music]]. In more recent times, a popular subgenre has developed: \"Bro-Country\", which has lyrics that sexually objectify women and frame them as assets for men's use. Some popular \"Bro-Country\" artists include [[Luke Bryan]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], and [[Blake Shelton]]. Gender discrimination and sexism has become more prominent in this genre over time, going backwards compared to some categories like [[Rapping|rap]] and pop. Dr. Eric Rasmussen, a professor in the College of Media and Communication and Texas Tech University, argues that compared to the 1990s and 2000s (decade), the country music of the 2010s discriminates more against women. Some of the ways they discriminate include, \"talking more about women's appearance, [showing] women in tight or revealing clothing, comparing women to objects, referring to women in slang [terms] versus their real names, and portraying women as distrustful and cheaters.\"\n\n\"Bro-Country\" may be influenced by historical aspects of Southern culture which have been associated with racism and sexism. Women in country music continue to face these issues, and often find no way to directly deal with them. [[Kacey Musgraves]], a recording artist, describes her experience with sexism in country music by stating that if a label can't get your song off the ground, it's immediately blamed on your personality or the fact that you're female, or that you didn't make a radio station program director feel important. Women like [[Kacey Musgraves]], no matter what they do or change, will almost always fall under some form of scrutiny from her male competitors.\n\nA large number of women singers in the country music genre have been influential to the industry through their success. Despite the popularity of male country artists and the discrimination that is displayed throughout their music, many female artists have worked their way past, leading them to achieve multiple accomplishments.\n\nDolly Parton, a female country singer that has been in the industry for over 55 years, developed a successful career for herself. Parton consistently created new projects to release to her fans and was described as \"unstoppable\" by a pop culture magazine titled ''Rolling Stone''. These projects include over 45 musical albums, multiple film features, a Dollywood theme park, and the creation of a production company.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://login.library.collin.edu/login|title=Collin College Library|website=login.library.collin.edu|access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nCarrie Underwood, the iconic ''American Idol'' winner, also created a lasting impact in the country music genre. With over 251,000 units sold, Underwood's album ''Cry Pretty'' was her fourth album to reach number one on the ''Billboard 200'' list.<ref name=\":3\"/> ''Blown Away, Play On'' and ''Carnival Ride'' were the other three albums that also reached the top of the charts. These achievements led her to become the first women singer to have four country albums as number one in the all-genre ''Billboard 200''.<ref name=\":3\"/> Underwood had multiple other number ones throughout her career, surpassing many other popular artists, as she left a strong impact on the female country music industry.\n\nA women's rights activist and animal lover, Miranda Lambert, is another woman known to have a dominating career within the music industry. Her songs titled \"Over You\" and \"Heart Like Mine\" took over the ''Billboard'' charts and country music radio stations in 2010 and 2011.<ref name=\":3\"/> As a solo female artist, she writes her music through honesty and reality.<ref name=\":3\"/> The messages sent through her music are intended to help other women not to feel alone as they go through difficult life situations. Lambert uses the fame she has earned from the music industry and works with charities like the Humane Society as a way to give back.<ref name=\":3\"/>\n\n===Jazz===\n[[File:Ella Fitzgerald in September 1947.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ella Fitzgerald]] performing with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], [[Milt Jackson]] and [[Timme Rosenkrantz]] in September 1947, New York]]\nWhile woman have been underrepresented in jazz as instrumentalists, composers, songwriters and bandleaders, there have been many notable women singers. [[Bessie Smith]] sang both the blues and jazz. [[Lena Horne]] first appeared in the [[Cotton Club]] as a teenager. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]] were known for their ballads during the swing era. [[Shirley Horn]] sang both jazz and blues. [[Nina Simone]] sang jazz, folk and Rhythm and blues. [[Etta Jones]] sang rhythm and blues and jazz. [[Anita O'Day]] is known for her contributions to Bebop. [[Betty Carter]] sang during the post-bop era. [[Mary Lou Williams]] was a singer and pianist during the swing and hard bop eras. [[Sarah Vaughan]] is known for her singing in the [[Cool jazz]] era. Other notable singers include [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Flora Purim]]. Contemporary jazz singers include [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Melody Gardot]] and singer-bassist [[Esperanza Spalding]]. [[Esperanza Spalding]] has been trying to speak out louder and push towards more conversation about the current discrimination in jazz. In 2017, [[Esperanza Spalding]] spent 77 hours straight creating an entire album titled Exposure to help change herself. It quickly became \"a display of dauntless prowess and grand ambition<sup>[1]</sup>\" and showed, to thousands of people<sup>[1]</sup>, a woman working confidently within the male dominated space of a recording studio.\n\n===Classical music===\n[[File:Cecilia Bartoli 2008c.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Cecilia Bartoli]] onstage in 2008]]\n[[File:Kathleen battle.PNG|thumb|right|180px|[[Kathleen Battle]]]]\nClassical singers typically do both live performances and recordings. Live performances may be in small venues, such as churches, or large venues, such as opera halls or arts centers. Classical singers may specialize in specific types of singing, such as [[art song]], which are songs performed with piano accompaniment, or opera, which is singing accompanied by a [[symphony orchestra]] in a staged, costumed theatrical production.  Classical singers are typically categorized by their voice type, which indicates both their vocal range and in some cases also the \"color\" of their voice. Examples of voice types that indicate the range of a singer's voice include [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (these go from the lowest range to the highest range). Examples of voice types that indicate both the singer's range and the \"color\" of her voice type are [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]]. Whereas popular music singers typically use a [[microphone]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for their vocals, in classical music the voice must be projected into the hall naturally, a skill for which they undertake vocal training.\n\n====Black women====\n[[File:Marian Anderson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marian Anderson]] in 1940]]\n[[Marian Anderson]] (1897\u20131993)<ref>[http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/ande-mar.htm Marian Anderson Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729020030/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/ande-mar.htm# |date=29 July 2013 }}, Lakewood Public Library.

Anderson became an important figure in the struggle for black artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]]. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. She sang before a crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on 7 January 1955.\n\n====Notable singers====\nA short list of notable classical singers includes:\n*[[Elly Ameling]]\n*[[Cecilia Bartoli]]\n*[[Kathleen Battle]]\n*[[Maria Callas]]\n*[[Natalie Dessay]]\n*[[Joyce DiDonato]]\n*[[Frederica von Stade]]\n*[[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]]\n*[[Elina Garanca]]\n*[[Susan Graham]]\n*[[Anna Netrebko]]\n*[[Jessye Norman]]\n\n==== Sexism and discrimination of female musicians ====\nWhether it is hip-hop, country, or [[popular music]], female musicians and performers from all genres experience discrimination and sexist treatment.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=Sarah|year=2014|title=Sexism Across Musical Genres: A Comparison|journal=Paper 2484|volume=Honors Theses}}</ref> The treatment of women in the music industry is best highlighted by the phrase denoted by Megan Jordan, heavily agreed upon in current scholarly discourse: 10X THE TALENT = 1/3 OF THE CREDIT.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Meggan|year=2006|title=10x The Talent = 1/3 Of The Credit: How Female Musicians Are Treated Differently In Music|journal=Stars-University of Central Florida|volume=Electronic Theses and Dissertations. 946.}}</ref> The three prominent forms of subtle discrimination experienced by female singers are being mistaken for non-musicians, lack of artistic control compared to their male counterparts, and having their [[sexuality]], age, and [[femininity]] constantly scrutinized.<ref name=\":5\" /> In many cases, female musicians are dismissed into inferior roles, such as a \"gimmick,\" \"good for a girl,\" and \"invisible accessory.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> Males lead most of the music projects and female musicians' artistic freedom is constrained by male bandleaders or managers.<ref name=\":5\" /> Another prevalent form of discrimination towards female vocalists and musicians in the music industry is [[sexual misconduct]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Coopersmith|first=Tristan. \"Leading A Business Through #MeToo: Female Executives Faced Tough Decisions This Year as an Array of Powerful Music Figures Were Accused of Sexual Misconduct.

In the 1960s and 1970s Argentinian folk singer [[Mercedes Sosa]], South African [[Miriam Makeba]] or Greek [[Maria Farantouri]] were also recognized for their engagement against the oppressive political situation in their home states.

In [[Music of Egypt|Egypt during the medieval era]], male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means \"a player upon an instrument\". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. Male professional musicians were considered disreputable and lowly, and they earned their living playing at parties. Female professional musicians in Egypt were called Awalim (pl) or Al'meh, which means a \"learned female\". These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the [[harem]] of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded.\n\nIn the 9th century, using male instrumentalists was harshly criticized in a treatise, because male musicians were associated with perceived vices such as playing [[chess]] and writing [[love poetry]]. Following the invasion of Egypt, [[Napoleon]] commissioned reports on the state of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture. The report reveals that there were [[guild]]s of male instrumentalists who played to male audiences, and \"learned female\" singer/musicians who sang and played for women audiences.\n\n===Chinese music===\n[[File:Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels 2.jpg|thumb|right|500px|A half-section of the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279) version of the ''Night Revels of Han Xizai'', original by [[Gu Hongzhong]];<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 148\">Patricia Ebrey (1999), ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 148.</ref> the female musicians in the center of the image are playing [[dizi (instrument)|transverse bamboo flutes]] and ''[[Guan (instrument)|guan]]'', and the male musician is playing a wooden clapper called ''paiban''.]]\n[[File:China singing stars 1940s.jpg|thumb|150px|Six of the seven stars.

Women performers were associated with the [[guqin]] since ancient times. The guqin is a plucked seven-string [[Chinese musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family. It has traditionally been favored by scholars and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement. A notable woman guqin player was [[Cai Wenji]], associated with the piece ''Hujia Shiba-pai''.<ref>\u300a\u80e1\u7b33\u5341\u516b\u62cd\u300b</ref>\n\nWomen musicians also play a key role in Chinese folk music. In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music]] is a genre of traditional Chinese folk ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] flute and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with the topic of a love-stricken woman.\n\nThe [[Chinese pop]] (C-pop) music industry in the 1930s and 1940s was dominated by the [[Seven Great Singing Stars]], who were the most renowned singers of China in the 1940s. [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Gong Qiuxia]], [[Yao Lee]] and [[Bai Hong]] emerged in the 1930s, while [[Bai Guang]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Wu Yingyin]] became popular in the 1940s. After 1949, these early generations of C-pop were denounced by the [[Communist Party of China]] as [[Yellow Music]] as it saw pop music as sexually indecent (the color yellow is associated with eroticism and sex in China). Only after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], by the early 1980s, could Yellow Music be performed again.\n\nNowadays, after China's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, Chinese popular music has been increasingly emulating and taking inspiration from the styles of popular music of South Korea ([[K-pop]]) and of Japan ([[J-pop]]), both of which it now closely resembles. As such, during the 2010s, several girl groups have been established based both on the Japanese model, like [[SNH48]] (created in 2012) and its [[SNH48#Sister groups|sister groups]], as well as on the Korean model, like [[Rocket Girls (band)|Rocket Girls]], created in 2018 from the [[Produce 101 (Chinese TV series)|Chinese version]] of a Korean reality television talent competition show.

Subbalakshmi]], [[Gangubai Hangal]], [[Hirabai Barodekar]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Kishori Amonkar]], [[Malini Rajurkar]], [[Mogubai Kurdikar]], [[Prabha Atre]], [[Roshan Ara Begum]] and [[Shruti Sadolikar Katkar]].

Female vocalists can perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. Traditionally, it has been difficult for female singers to appear publicly. Women were only allowed to perform for religious rituals, called [[Tazieh]], and men were generally forbidden to listen to women. Before the Revolution, [[Women's rights in Iran|Iranian women]] could only sing in private, while working, for other women, or during women's celebrations. [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]] (1905\u20131959) is one of the first female masters of Persian music. Notable female musicians include [[Delkash]] (1923\u20132004); [[Simin Ghanem]] (born 1944); [[Maryam Akhondy]] (born 1957), founder of Barbad Ensemble; Persian classical guitarist [[Lily Afshar]]; singer [[Shakila]], winner of Persian Academy Award; the conductor [[Soodabeh Salem]]; [[Afsaneh Rasaei]]; [[Pirayeh Pourafar]], founder of Nava Ensemble and Lian Ensemble; and [[Mahsa Vahdat]].\n\nThe classical singer [[Fatemeh Vaezi]] (commonly known by her stage name \"Parisa\") has given concerts accompanied by a female orchestra. After 1986 [[Maryam Akhondy]] started working with other Iranian musicians in exile. In 2000 Maryam Akhondy created the all-female a cappella group Banu which sung old folk songs that were part of women's activities and celebrations. Singer [[Sima Bina]] has taught many female students. [[Ghashang Kamkar]] teaches both male and female students. Both Ghashang and Vaezi have criticized the patriarchal power structure in Iran for its treatment of female musicians.<ref>Fereshteh Javaheri, 'With These Problems of Life, There Is No Time for Art,' trans.

In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of \"purely musical\" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.\n\nOther notable women scholars include:\n\n*[[Eva Badura-Skoda]]\n*[[Margaret Bent]]\n*[[Suzanne Cusick]]\n*[[Ursula G\u00fcnther]]\n*[[Maud Cuney Hare]]\n*[[Liudmila Kovnatskaya]]\n*[[Kendra Preston Leonard]]\n*[[Rosetta Reitz]]\n*[[Elaine Sisman]]\n*[[Hedi Stadlen]]\n*[[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]] \n*[[Anahit Tsitsikian]]\n\n===Ethnomusicologists===\n[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&nbsp;\u2013 1957) was an American [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]] known for her studies of Native American music and culture.]]\n\n[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.\nEthnomusicology \u2013&nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words \u1f14\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (''ethnos'', \"nation\") and \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (''mousike'', \"music\")&nbsp;\u2013 is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music.

Positions such as conductors, executives, and staff are dominated by white individuals, in particular, white males. In high level executive positions, it remains rare to see women or people of color. However, the gender gap narrowed in the early 1990s, with women musicians making up between 46% and 49% of the total musician pool in the two decades since.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The years 1980 to 2014 saw a four-fold increase in the proportion of diverse musicians on stage, driven largely by an increase in musicians from Asian / Pacific Islander backgrounds.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> Over the years, more attention was brought to gender and racial disparity in the field. This awareness has caused positive impacts in the orchestrating field. Data about conductors from 2006 to 2016 reveals there is a gradual but steady trend towards greater racial and ethnic diversity, with the percentage of African American, Latino / Hispanic, Asian /Pacific Islander, American Indian / Alaskan Native, and other non-white conductorsincreasing from 15.7% in 2006 to 21% in 2016.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> Although there has been reconstruction of the whiteness and gender domination of males in the field, there is still work to be done.\n\nMany women within the orchestrating profession experience forms of discrimination whether it be gender, racial, or both. Women, initially, were not encouraged to play professionally because it was deemed inappropriate by society. Women were further considered neither strong enough nor skilled enough to play instruments other than the piano, or to survive grueling rehearsal schedules.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jagow|first=Shelley M.|year=1998|title=Women Orchestral Conductors in America: The Struggle for Acceptance\u2014An Historical View from the Nineteenth Century to the Present|journal=College Music Symposium|volume=38|pages=126\u2013145|issn=0069-5696|jstor=40374324}}</ref> [[Jeri Lynne Johnson]] was the first African-American woman to win an international conducting prize when she was awarded the Taki Concordia conducting fellowship in 2005.

Alongside prominent woman conductors [[Marin Alsop]] and [[JoAnn Falletta]], Ms. Johnson was heralded on the [[NBC]] [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] as one of the nation's leading female conductors.\n\nAccording to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, \"The music world has been happy to have female performers ...for a long time...[;]But owning authority and power in public is another matter. That's where female conductors have had a hard time. Our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining.\"<ref name=\"theguardian.com\" /> The low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study in music school; indeed, in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of [[Doctor of Musical Arts|conducting doctorates]] were women.<ref name=\"motherjones.com\" />\n\nThe turn for women's rights in music began the feminist movement in America in 1848. The movement fueled \u00a0all women to fight for equal rights in a plethora of fields such as voting, education, employment, and marriage. While the women's rights movement meant the start of including women into the orchestrating field, there would still be barriers that these women needed to overcome. Women of color, in particular, were faced with many stereotypes that challenged the worthiness of their work. In fact, black women's work in the field faced more scrutiny than their white counterparts. A classic example of this is seen in a study conducted for the Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education, by Elliot Charles, in 1996. Elliot Examined:\n\nWhether race and gender influenced judgments of musical performances. Four trumpeters and four flutists were videotaped performing the same music excerpt. For each instrument, one white male, one white female, one black male, and one black female, served as models. To control the audio portion of the study, the researcher used two prerecorded performances, one for the trumpets and one for the flutes. This created the same audio for all trumpets and flute performances. College music majors rated each performance on a Likert-type scale. Results revealed black performers of each genders and instruments were rated significantly lower than white performers. The lowest ratings were given to black male and female trumpet players.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=VanWeelden|first=Kimberly|year=2004|title=Racially Stereotyped Music and Conductor Race: Perceptions of Performance|journal=Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education|issue=160|pages=38\u201348|issn=0010-9894|jstor=40319217}}</ref>\n\nThis example demonstrates that gender discrimination was prevalent during this time, but racial discrimination must be accounted for as well.\n\n===Sexism, Racism, and Gender Discrimination===\nWomen conductors faced sexism, racism, and gender discrimination throughout the 19th century and 20th century. \"To break down this apparent employment barrier, women created their own opportunities by founding and organizing all-female orchestras\"; one example is the Fadette Women's Orchestra in Boston founded in 1888 by conductor Caroline B.

The feminist argument that the personal is political was revisited in the image that Riot grrrl set forth, similarly to the culture of Punk that [[self-actualization]] is not to be found in external forces but rather through an individual's true self. By recognizing and reevaluating the institutional structures that affect individual experiences within social situations, an individual can gain the knowledge to better know herself and therefore know how to present herself to others so that they may know her accurately. Riot grrrl termed this movement to self-actualization, girl love \u2013 \"girls learning to love themselves, and each other, against those forces that would otherwise see them destroyed or destroy themselves\".\n\nThe accompanying slogan \"every girl is a riot grrrl\" reinforced the solidarity that women could find amongst themselves. This created an intimate aesthetic and sentimental politic well expressed in the production of zines (a shortened version of \"fanzines\").<ref name=\"Schilt\" /> [[Zine]]s were handmade, crafted by individuals who wanted to connect directly with their readers, with simple items like scissors, glue, and tape. They called out injustices and challenged the norms that typically directed the expression of sexuality and domestic abuse, providing a space for women to exchange personal stories to which many others could relate. They challenged girls and women alike to stand up for themselves in a political atmosphere that actively sought to silence them.<ref name=\"Kearney\" /> The shared personal stories were, at times, met with attitudes that reduced the communication to \"it's all just girls in their bedrooms, sprawled out writing in their diaries, and then they'll send them to each other\", while the choice to share in that way was an aesthetic one.\n\nIn the midst of this raising of awareness, riot grrrls had to address the generalizations that worked for them but that could not apply to women of color. Not all girls could be riot grrrl after all, for lack of privilege barred them from participating in such acts as writing \"SLUT\" across their stomach in an attempt to reclaim sexual agency.<ref name=\"Nguyen 173\u2013196\"/> While this performance is an earnest one, racism had already labeled women of color as that term. As observed by Kearny, \"the gender deviance displayed by riot grrrls is a privilege to which only middle-class white girls have access.\"<ref name=\"Kearney\" /> Another aspect of this need for inclusive [[discourse]] arose in the movement's preference for concrete knowledge and a disregard for the abstract that would foster theoretical inquiry.\n\n===Festivals===\nWomen's music festivals, which may also be called [[womyn]]'s music festivals, have been held since the 1970s. Some women's music festivals are organized for lesbians. The first women's music festival was held in 1973 at Sacramento State University. In May 1974 the first National Woman's Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, founded by [[University of Illinois]] student Kristin Lems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=DIL19740326.2.55&srpos=6&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-national+women's+music+festival------|title=Daily Illini 26 March 1974 \u2013 Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|website=Idnc.library.illinois.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> It celebrated its 40th year in Middleton, Wisconsin, from 2\u20135 July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org|title=National Womens Music Festival \u2013 July 5\u20138, 2018 Middleton, Wisconsin|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> As of 2015, it is a four-day event that includes concerts, workshops, comedy, theatre, films and writing events that \"promote and affirm the creative talents and technical skills of women\" from diverse, multicultural communities, including women with disabilities.

The festival began in 2005 as a celebration of the contributions of women to composition, performance, teaching, scholarship, and music administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esm.rochester.edu/wmf|title=Women in Music Festival|website=Women in Music Festival|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> From its modest beginnings of Eastman students and faculty members performing music by women composers, the Festival has grown to include additional concerts and events throughout Rochester, NY and to host composers-in-residence, who have included [[Tania Le\u00f3n]] (2007), [[Nancy Van de Vate]] (2008), [[Judith Lang Zaimont]] (2009), [[Emma Lou Diemer]] (2010), and [[Hilary Tann]] (2011). The festival has presented more than 291 different works by 158 composers.\n\nMany other festivals have been created throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s and vary in size from a few hundred to thousands of attendees. The [[Los Angeles Women's Music Festival]] began in 2007 with over 2500 attendees.  Events outside the US include the Sappho Lesbian Witch Camp, near Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada and the Sistajive Women's Music Festival in Australia. Some festivals are focused around the lesbian community, such as the Ohio Lesbian Festival, near Columbus Ohio, which was created in 1988; Christian Lesbians Out (CLOUT), which holds a gathering in early August in Washington, DC; The Old Lesbian Gathering, a festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and RadLesFes, an event held in the middle of November near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Feminist-oriented festivals include the Southern Womyn's Festival in Dade City, Florida; the Gulf Coast Womyn's Festival in Ovett, Missouri; Wiminfest in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Womongathering, the Festival of Womyn's Spirituality; the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, near Hart, Michigan; and the Midwest Womyn's Festival in DeKalb, Illinois.\n\nWhile women's music festivals are centered on music, they support many other facets of lesbian and [[feminist]] culture.  Some festivals are designed to provide a [[safe space]] for women's music and culture. Many festivals are held on college campuses or in remote rural locations, where attendees stay in campsites. Many festivals offer workshops on arts, crafts, fitness, and athletic events that women may not be able find in mainstream culture.  In her book ''Eden Built by Eves'', Bonnie Morris describes how women's music festivals serve women throughout the stages of their lives. Since the festivals are organized by women, for women, daycare and childcare facilities are typically provided. Festivals often provide a safe space for [[coming of age]] rituals for young women, adult romance and commitment ceremonies, the expression of alternative perspectives on motherhood, and the expression of grief and loss.<ref>Morris 1999</ref>\n\n====Lilith Fair====\n[[File:Sarah McLachlan 29 July 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Lilith Fair]] co-founder [[Sarah McLachlan]]]]\n[[Lilith Fair]] was a [[concert tour]] and travelling music festival that consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands.

Her singing for the wedding of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Maria de Medici]] in 1600 was praised by Henry, who called her the \"best singer in all of France\". She worked in the [[Medici]] court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until 1627. By 1614 she was the court's most highly paid musician, because her musical [[virtuosity]] so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany's de facto Regent, Granduchess [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies. In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets. In 1625 she composed a 75-minute \"comedy-ballet\". In all, she wrote sixteen staged works. She was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony changes, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates emotional affect.\n\n[[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619\u20131677) was an Italian [[Baroque]] composer and singer.

Her father wrote to her in 1820, telling her that \"[m]usic will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament [in your life]\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I 82</ref> Felix cautioned her against publishing her works under her own name and seeking a career in music. He wrote:\n<blockquote>'From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for [musical] authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it'.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113\n</ref>  </blockquote>\n\n[[Clara Schumann]] (1819\u20131896) was a German composer and concert pianist who had a 61-year concert career, which changed the format and repertoire of the piano recital and the tastes of the listening public. From an early age, she had a one-hour lesson in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. In 1830, at the age of eleven, she had become a virtuoso soloist and she left on a concert tour of European cities. In the late 1830s, she performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews. [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] described her playing to [[Franz Liszt]], who came to hear one of her concerts and subsequently \"praised her extravagantly\" in a letter that was published in the Parisian ''Revue et Gazette Musicale''.<ref name=\"Nancya250\">Reich (1986), 250.</ref> She was named a ''K\u00f6nigliche und Kaiserliche Kammervirtuosin'' (\"Royal and Imperial Chamber Virtuoso\"), [[Austria]]'s highest musical honor.<ref name=\"Nancya250\" />\n\nShe was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage to [[Robert Schumann]], she played what was then customary, mainly bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was also customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, works such as her Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and her popular Scherzo (Op. 10). Her works include songs, piano pieces, a piano concerto, a [[piano trio]], choral pieces, and three Romances for violin and piano. <!--Her husband however remarked that she did not have the opportunity to do this often, as a result of being a wife and a mother:\n\n{{quote|'Clara has composed a series of small pieces, which show a musical and tender ingenuity such as she has never attained before.

While The Go-Go's and [[The Bangles]], both from the LA club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians.\n\nIn the 1990s, bands such as [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Super Heroines]], The Lovedolls and [[L7 (band)|L7]] became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident and  \"bad\" attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave.

St. Vincent wore a T-shirt with a bikini decal on the magazine cover, a comment on how when women appear with guitars, they're usually dressed very minimally, as a marketing tool to sell the instruments. Haim, a band composed of three sisters, is extremely outspoken when it comes to the promotion of women in music, calling out major music festivals for the lack of female-fronted bands on bills and the lack of payment for female artists as compared to male artists of the same level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/06/13/haim-festival-inequality/|title=HAIM Says a Male Group Got Paid 10 Times More by a Festival|date=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back|title=Live music acts are mostly male-only.

Often, during [[World War II]], these all women's groups would entertain the troops while the male musicians served. However, after the war, these girls groups were thrown aside, as male musicians returned and the public favored the \"normalcy\" it brought, and the over sexualization of females in music returned.<ref name=\"auto5\">Arnwine, B.

When June Norton was young, she wanted to pursue classical music, in hopes that one day she could join the opera. However, this did not seem possible, so she began to pursue [[popular music]]. Norton became the first black woman in the region of Washington DC to appear singing in TV commercials marketed towards southern states. This led to her accomplishments of many awards including the 1962 Achievement Award from the [[National Association of Colored Women]], the TV Personality of the Year award, the 1962 Emphasis Award from the National Association of Market Development, and the 1962 Singer of the Year Award from the [[YMCA]]. She later stepped away from the spotlight and began a career as a counselor and married Thomas C. Cuff. She spent the rest of her working years helping underprivileged youth and female prisoners.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nAnother female pianist, composer, and vocalist made significant contribution to jazz and the American culture. [[Shirley Horn]] (1934\u20132005) recorded more than 25 albums and worked as a side musician for [[Stuff Smith]], [[Toots Thielemans]], [[Charlie Haden]], and [[Oscar Peterson]]. She practiced at the [[Howard University]] Junior School of Music, and later received offers from [[Juilliard]] University and [[Xavier University]], but opted to remain in Washington DC, marry, and have a child. She continued to tour and play gigs constantly. Her first recording was part of Stuff Smith's 1959 release, [[Cat on a Hot Fiddle]]. Her debut recording, [[Embers and Ashes]] attracted a large amount of attention and helped her to realize she wanted to be a concert pianist after all. A few months after this, [[Miles Davis]] contacted Horn and told [[Village Vanguard]] in New York City that he wanted Horn to open for him, and that he refused to play if this was not a possibility. This is when Horn's fame and reputation began to rise. She continued to work with [[Mercury Records]] and [[Verve Records]]. She received many awards including a [[Grammy Award]] in 1999 for Best Jazz vocal album for I Remember Miles, five Washington Area Music Awards, an honorary music degree from the [[Berklee College of Music]], and a 2004 NEA Jazz Master Fellowship and Award from the National Endowment for the Arts.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===Classical music===\nInstrumentalists in classical music may focus on one specific type of playing, such as solo recitals, solo concertos, [[chamber music]], or performing as a member of an orchestra, or they may do different types. Some musicians who play orchestral instruments may do all of these types of performances. Instrumentalists in classical music may do both live performances for an audience and recordings. In some cases, classical performers may do mostly live performances. There has traditionally been a gendered aspect to playing instruments in classical music.\n\nMany album covers for female classical musicians have photographs that emphasize the physical attractiveness of the performer, \"often using risqu\u00e9 images\".<ref>Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan. ''Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World'', Volume 1. SAGE Publications, 2011. p. 294</ref> According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', Classical women musicians are \"too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent\" and they face pressure \"to look sexy onstage and in photos.\"<ref name=\"music.cbc.ca\"/> Duchen states that while \"[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.\"<ref name=\"music.cbc.ca\"/>\n\n====Orchestra====\n[[File:Music.

A music newspaper editorial in 1917 in England encouraged orchestras to allow women to play the \"lighter instruments\", with the understanding that these women performers would relinquish their positions to men once WW I was over.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1990s, to reduce the likelihood of [[gender bias]], some orchestras began conducting [[audition]]s of potential new members behind a screen, so the audition panel could not see if it was a male or female performer. Historically, there has been a tendency for brass sections to be male, and some women brass players have alleged that there is gender bias against female brass players. A study in the 1980s found that women made up 36% of US orchestras; 30% in the United Kingdom, and 16% in East and West Germany.<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/excuse.htm |title=Gender Bias in International Orchestras |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date=n.d.|accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref> Women tended to be hired by lower paid orchestras and they were less present in major orchestras.<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\"/>\n\nIn the past, the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] argued that \"ethnic and gender uniformity\" gave their orchestra a better sound.<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\"/> Several male VPO musicians stated in a 1996 interview that classical music has \"gender-defined qualities which can be most clearly expressed by male uniformity\" in the orchestra.<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\"/> One male VPO member stated that men \"carry secrets that are involved with music and tones, just like in Australian aboriginal or Indian cultures where men play certain instruments, and not the women.\"<ref name=\"osborne-conant.org\"/> One male VPO performer stated that \"pregnancy brings problems.

Singers typically do both live performances and studio recordings. Singers who do live performances may sing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or [[nightclub]]s, or they may perform in larger venues ranging from arts centres to stadiums. Some singers also perform in music videos, which are used to promote the songs. In some styles of music, singers may play a [[rhythm section]] instrument, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass or a percussion instrument while they sing. In some styles of pop, singers perform choreographed dance moves during the show.

She states that \"[[Betty Davis]] is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock.

An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues.  Classic blues songs performed by female vocalists were accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles, and were the first blues to be recorded. The classic female blues singers were pioneers in the [[record industry]], as they were among the first black singers and blues artists who were recorded. They were also instrumental in popularizing the [[12-bar blues]] throughout the US.\n\n[[Ma Rainey|Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey]] (1886\u20131939), known as the \"[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|Mother of]] the Blues\", is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and comedy around 1902.<ref>Stewart-Baxter, Derrick.

Nonetheless, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were purchased by white buyers as well.<ref>Steinberg, Jesse R., and Abrol Fairweather. ''Blues: Thinking Deep about Feeling Low''. Hoboken, N.J. Wiley; Chichester: John Wiley [distributor], 2011, p. 159</ref> [[Marion Harris]] became one of the first white female singers to record the blues.\n\nThe most popular of the classic blues singers was [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bessie Smith]] (no relation to Mamie Smith), who first recorded in 1923 and became known as the \"Empress of the Blues\". She signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and became the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s, recording over 160 songs. Other classic blues singers who recorded extensively until the end of the 1920s were [[Ida Cox]], [[Clara Smith]], and [[Sara Martin]]. These early blues singers were an influence on later singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. These blues women's contributions to the genre included \"increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, [[Broadway musical]]s, [[torch song]]s of the 1930s and 1940s, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rhythm and blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]].\"<ref>Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 8</ref>\n\n===Country music ===\nGender discrimination and sexism occurs frequently in [[country music]]. In more recent times, a popular subgenre has developed: \"Bro-Country\", which has lyrics that sexually objectify women and frame them as assets for men's use. Some popular \"Bro-Country\" artists include [[Luke Bryan]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], and [[Blake Shelton]]. Gender discrimination and sexism has become more prominent in this genre over time, going backwards compared to some categories like [[Rapping|rap]] and pop. Dr. Eric Rasmussen, a professor in the College of Media and Communication and Texas Tech University, argues that compared to the 1990s and 2000s (decade), the country music of the 2010s discriminates more against women. Some of the ways they discriminate include, \"talking more about women's appearance, [showing] women in tight or revealing clothing, comparing women to objects, referring to women in slang [terms] versus their real names, and portraying women as distrustful and cheaters.\"\n\n\"Bro-Country\" may be influenced by historical aspects of Southern culture which have been associated with racism and sexism. Women in country music continue to face these issues, and often find no way to directly deal with them. [[Kacey Musgraves]], a recording artist, describes her experience with sexism in country music by stating that if a label can't get your song off the ground, it's immediately blamed on your personality or the fact that you're female, or that you didn't make a radio station program director feel important. Women like [[Kacey Musgraves]], no matter what they do or change, will almost always fall under some form of scrutiny from her male competitors.\n\nA large number of women singers in the country music genre have been influential to the industry through their success. Despite the popularity of male country artists and the discrimination that is displayed throughout their music, many female artists have worked their way past, leading them to achieve multiple accomplishments.\n\nDolly Parton, a female country singer that has been in the industry for over 55 years, developed a successful career for herself. Parton consistently created new projects to release to her fans and was described as \"unstoppable\" by a pop culture magazine titled ''Rolling Stone''. These projects include over 45 musical albums, multiple film features, a Dollywood theme park, and the creation of a production company.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://login.library.collin.edu/login|title=Collin College Library|website=login.library.collin.edu|access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nCarrie Underwood, the iconic ''American Idol'' winner, also created a lasting impact in the country music genre. With over 251,000 units sold, Underwood's album ''Cry Pretty'' was her fourth album to reach number one on the ''Billboard 200'' list.<ref name=\":3\"/> ''Blown Away, Play On'' and ''Carnival Ride'' were the other three albums that also reached the top of the charts. These achievements led her to become the first women singer to have four country albums as number one in the all-genre ''Billboard 200''.<ref name=\":3\"/> Underwood had multiple other number ones throughout her career, surpassing many other popular artists, as she left a strong impact on the female country music industry.\n\nA women's rights activist and animal lover, Miranda Lambert, is another woman known to have a dominating career within the music industry. Her songs titled \"Over You\" and \"Heart Like Mine\" took over the ''Billboard'' charts and country music radio stations in 2010 and 2011.<ref name=\":3\"/> As a solo female artist, she writes her music through honesty and reality.<ref name=\":3\"/> The messages sent through her music are intended to help other women not to feel alone as they go through difficult life situations. Lambert uses the fame she has earned from the music industry and works with charities like the Humane Society as a way to give back.<ref name=\":3\"/>\n\n===Jazz===\n[[File:Ella Fitzgerald in September 1947.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ella Fitzgerald]] performing with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], [[Milt Jackson]] and [[Timme Rosenkrantz]] in September 1947, New York]]\nWhile woman have been underrepresented in jazz as instrumentalists, composers, songwriters and bandleaders, there have been many notable women singers. [[Bessie Smith]] sang both the blues and jazz. [[Lena Horne]] first appeared in the [[Cotton Club]] as a teenager. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]] were known for their ballads during the swing era. [[Shirley Horn]] sang both jazz and blues. [[Nina Simone]] sang jazz, folk and Rhythm and blues. [[Etta Jones]] sang rhythm and blues and jazz. [[Anita O'Day]] is known for her contributions to Bebop. [[Betty Carter]] sang during the post-bop era. [[Mary Lou Williams]] was a singer and pianist during the swing and hard bop eras. [[Sarah Vaughan]] is known for her singing in the [[Cool jazz]] era. Other notable singers include [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Flora Purim]]. Contemporary jazz singers include [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Melody Gardot]] and singer-bassist [[Esperanza Spalding]]. [[Esperanza Spalding]] has been trying to speak out louder and push towards more conversation about the current discrimination in jazz. In 2017, [[Esperanza Spalding]] spent 77 hours straight creating an entire album titled Exposure to help change herself. It quickly became \"a display of dauntless prowess and grand ambition<sup>[1]</sup>\" and showed, to thousands of people<sup>[1]</sup>, a woman working confidently within the male dominated space of a recording studio.\n\n===Classical music===\n[[File:Cecilia Bartoli 2008c.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Cecilia Bartoli]] onstage in 2008]]\n[[File:Kathleen battle.PNG|thumb|right|180px|[[Kathleen Battle]]]]\nClassical singers typically do both live performances and recordings. Live performances may be in small venues, such as churches, or large venues, such as opera halls or arts centers. Classical singers may specialize in specific types of singing, such as [[art song]], which are songs performed with piano accompaniment, or opera, which is singing accompanied by a [[symphony orchestra]] in a staged, costumed theatrical production.  Classical singers are typically categorized by their voice type, which indicates both their vocal range and in some cases also the \"color\" of their voice. Examples of voice types that indicate the range of a singer's voice include [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (these go from the lowest range to the highest range). Examples of voice types that indicate both the singer's range and the \"color\" of her voice type are [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]]. Whereas popular music singers typically use a [[microphone]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for their vocals, in classical music the voice must be projected into the hall naturally, a skill for which they undertake vocal training.\n\n====Black women====\n[[File:Marian Anderson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marian Anderson]] in 1940]]\n[[Marian Anderson]] (1897\u20131993)<ref>[http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/ande-mar.htm Marian Anderson Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729020030/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/ande-mar.htm# |date=29 July 2013 }}, Lakewood Public Library.

In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]]. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. She sang before a crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on 7 January 1955.\n\n====Notable singers====\nA short list of notable classical singers includes:\n*[[Elly Ameling]]\n*[[Cecilia Bartoli]]\n*[[Kathleen Battle]]\n*[[Maria Callas]]\n*[[Natalie Dessay]]\n*[[Joyce DiDonato]]\n*[[Frederica von Stade]]\n*[[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]]\n*[[Elina Garanca]]\n*[[Susan Graham]]\n*[[Anna Netrebko]]\n*[[Jessye Norman]]\n\n==== Sexism and discrimination of female musicians ====\nWhether it is hip-hop, country, or [[popular music]], female musicians and performers from all genres experience discrimination and sexist treatment.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=Sarah|year=2014|title=Sexism Across Musical Genres: A Comparison|journal=Paper 2484|volume=Honors Theses}}</ref> The treatment of women in the music industry is best highlighted by the phrase denoted by Megan Jordan, heavily agreed upon in current scholarly discourse: 10X THE TALENT = 1/3 OF THE CREDIT.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Meggan|year=2006|title=10x The Talent = 1/3 Of The Credit: How Female Musicians Are Treated Differently In Music|journal=Stars-University of Central Florida|volume=Electronic Theses and Dissertations. 946.}}</ref> The three prominent forms of subtle discrimination experienced by female singers are being mistaken for non-musicians, lack of artistic control compared to their male counterparts, and having their [[sexuality]], age, and [[femininity]] constantly scrutinized.<ref name=\":5\" /> In many cases, female musicians are dismissed into inferior roles, such as a \"gimmick,\" \"good for a girl,\" and \"invisible accessory.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> Males lead most of the music projects and female musicians' artistic freedom is constrained by male bandleaders or managers.<ref name=\":5\" /> Another prevalent form of discrimination towards female vocalists and musicians in the music industry is [[sexual misconduct]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Coopersmith|first=Tristan. \"Leading A Business Through #MeToo: Female Executives Faced Tough Decisions This Year as an Array of Powerful Music Figures Were Accused of Sexual Misconduct.

In [[Music of Egypt|Egypt during the medieval era]], male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means \"a player upon an instrument\". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. Male professional musicians were considered disreputable and lowly, and they earned their living playing at parties. Female professional musicians in Egypt were called Awalim (pl) or Al'meh, which means a \"learned female\". These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the [[harem]] of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded.\n\nIn the 9th century, using male instrumentalists was harshly criticized in a treatise, because male musicians were associated with perceived vices such as playing [[chess]] and writing [[love poetry]]. Following the invasion of Egypt, [[Napoleon]] commissioned reports on the state of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture. The report reveals that there were [[guild]]s of male instrumentalists who played to male audiences, and \"learned female\" singer/musicians who sang and played for women audiences.\n\n===Chinese music===\n[[File:Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels 2.jpg|thumb|right|500px|A half-section of the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279) version of the ''Night Revels of Han Xizai'', original by [[Gu Hongzhong]];<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 148\">Patricia Ebrey (1999), ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 148.</ref> the female musicians in the center of the image are playing [[dizi (instrument)|transverse bamboo flutes]] and ''[[Guan (instrument)|guan]]'', and the male musician is playing a wooden clapper called ''paiban''.]]\n[[File:China singing stars 1940s.jpg|thumb|150px|Six of the seven stars.

Women performers were associated with the [[guqin]] since ancient times. The guqin is a plucked seven-string [[Chinese musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family. It has traditionally been favored by scholars and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement. A notable woman guqin player was [[Cai Wenji]], associated with the piece ''Hujia Shiba-pai''.<ref>\u300a\u80e1\u7b33\u5341\u516b\u62cd\u300b</ref>\n\nWomen musicians also play a key role in Chinese folk music. In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music]] is a genre of traditional Chinese folk ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] flute and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with the topic of a love-stricken woman.\n\nThe [[Chinese pop]] (C-pop) music industry in the 1930s and 1940s was dominated by the [[Seven Great Singing Stars]], who were the most renowned singers of China in the 1940s. [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Gong Qiuxia]], [[Yao Lee]] and [[Bai Hong]] emerged in the 1930s, while [[Bai Guang]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Wu Yingyin]] became popular in the 1940s. After 1949, these early generations of C-pop were denounced by the [[Communist Party of China]] as [[Yellow Music]] as it saw pop music as sexually indecent (the color yellow is associated with eroticism and sex in China). Only after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], by the early 1980s, could Yellow Music be performed again.\n\nNowadays, after China's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, Chinese popular music has been increasingly emulating and taking inspiration from the styles of popular music of South Korea ([[K-pop]]) and of Japan ([[J-pop]]), both of which it now closely resembles. As such, during the 2010s, several girl groups have been established based both on the Japanese model, like [[SNH48]] (created in 2012) and its [[SNH48#Sister groups|sister groups]], as well as on the Korean model, like [[Rocket Girls (band)|Rocket Girls]], created in 2018 from the [[Produce 101 (Chinese TV series)|Chinese version]] of a Korean reality television talent competition show.

This chanting style evolved into [[jatis]] and eventually into [[raga]]s. Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music. The major composers from the historical Indian classical music tradition were men. Modern women vocalists include [[D. K. Pattammal]], [[M. S.

Female vocalists can perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. Traditionally, it has been difficult for female singers to appear publicly. Women were only allowed to perform for religious rituals, called [[Tazieh]], and men were generally forbidden to listen to women. Before the Revolution, [[Women's rights in Iran|Iranian women]] could only sing in private, while working, for other women, or during women's celebrations. [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]] (1905\u20131959) is one of the first female masters of Persian music. Notable female musicians include [[Delkash]] (1923\u20132004); [[Simin Ghanem]] (born 1944); [[Maryam Akhondy]] (born 1957), founder of Barbad Ensemble; Persian classical guitarist [[Lily Afshar]]; singer [[Shakila]], winner of Persian Academy Award; the conductor [[Soodabeh Salem]]; [[Afsaneh Rasaei]]; [[Pirayeh Pourafar]], founder of Nava Ensemble and Lian Ensemble; and [[Mahsa Vahdat]].\n\nThe classical singer [[Fatemeh Vaezi]] (commonly known by her stage name \"Parisa\") has given concerts accompanied by a female orchestra. After 1986 [[Maryam Akhondy]] started working with other Iranian musicians in exile. In 2000 Maryam Akhondy created the all-female a cappella group Banu which sung old folk songs that were part of women's activities and celebrations. Singer [[Sima Bina]] has taught many female students. [[Ghashang Kamkar]] teaches both male and female students.

In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of \"purely musical\" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.\n\nOther notable women scholars include:\n\n*[[Eva Badura-Skoda]]\n*[[Margaret Bent]]\n*[[Suzanne Cusick]]\n*[[Ursula G\u00fcnther]]\n*[[Maud Cuney Hare]]\n*[[Liudmila Kovnatskaya]]\n*[[Kendra Preston Leonard]]\n*[[Rosetta Reitz]]\n*[[Elaine Sisman]]\n*[[Hedi Stadlen]]\n*[[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]] \n*[[Anahit Tsitsikian]]\n\n===Ethnomusicologists===\n[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&nbsp;\u2013 1957) was an American [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]] known for her studies of Native American music and culture.]]\n\n[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.\nEthnomusicology \u2013&nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words \u1f14\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (''ethnos'', \"nation\") and \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (''mousike'', \"music\")&nbsp;\u2013 is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music.

There is a clear distinction between the low number of white women in the field compared to that of white men, but there is an even lower number of other racial and ethnic identities. The proportion of non-white musicians represented in the orchestra workforce \u2013 and of African American and Hispanic / Latino musicians in particular \u2013remains extremely low.<ref name=\"auto6\">{{Cite book|title=American Symphony Orchestra League|volume = 1|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Music Online|doi = 10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.00790}}</ref> The field of orchestra continues to remain predominantly white. Positions such as conductors, executives, and staff are dominated by white individuals, in particular, white males. In high level executive positions, it remains rare to see women or people of color. However, the gender gap narrowed in the early 1990s, with women musicians making up between 46% and 49% of the total musician pool in the two decades since.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The years 1980 to 2014 saw a four-fold increase in the proportion of diverse musicians on stage, driven largely by an increase in musicians from Asian / Pacific Islander backgrounds.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> Over the years, more attention was brought to gender and racial disparity in the field. This awareness has caused positive impacts in the orchestrating field. Data about conductors from 2006 to 2016 reveals there is a gradual but steady trend towards greater racial and ethnic diversity, with the percentage of African American, Latino / Hispanic, Asian /Pacific Islander, American Indian / Alaskan Native, and other non-white conductorsincreasing from 15.7% in 2006 to 21% in 2016.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> Although there has been reconstruction of the whiteness and gender domination of males in the field, there is still work to be done.\n\nMany women within the orchestrating profession experience forms of discrimination whether it be gender, racial, or both. Women, initially, were not encouraged to play professionally because it was deemed inappropriate by society. Women were further considered neither strong enough nor skilled enough to play instruments other than the piano, or to survive grueling rehearsal schedules.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jagow|first=Shelley M.|year=1998|title=Women Orchestral Conductors in America: The Struggle for Acceptance\u2014An Historical View from the Nineteenth Century to the Present|journal=College Music Symposium|volume=38|pages=126\u2013145|issn=0069-5696|jstor=40374324}}</ref> [[Jeri Lynne Johnson]] was the first African-American woman to win an international conducting prize when she was awarded the Taki Concordia conducting fellowship in 2005.

Alongside prominent woman conductors [[Marin Alsop]] and [[JoAnn Falletta]], Ms. Johnson was heralded on the [[NBC]] [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] as one of the nation's leading female conductors.\n\nAccording to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, \"The music world has been happy to have female performers ...for a long time...[;]But owning authority and power in public is another matter. That's where female conductors have had a hard time. Our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining.\"<ref name=\"theguardian.com\" /> The low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study in music school; indeed, in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of [[Doctor of Musical Arts|conducting doctorates]] were women.<ref name=\"motherjones.com\" />\n\nThe turn for women's rights in music began the feminist movement in America in 1848. The movement fueled \u00a0all women to fight for equal rights in a plethora of fields such as voting, education, employment, and marriage. While the women's rights movement meant the start of including women into the orchestrating field, there would still be barriers that these women needed to overcome. Women of color, in particular, were faced with many stereotypes that challenged the worthiness of their work. In fact, black women's work in the field faced more scrutiny than their white counterparts. A classic example of this is seen in a study conducted for the Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education, by Elliot Charles, in 1996. Elliot Examined:\n\nWhether race and gender influenced judgments of musical performances. Four trumpeters and four flutists were videotaped performing the same music excerpt. For each instrument, one white male, one white female, one black male, and one black female, served as models. To control the audio portion of the study, the researcher used two prerecorded performances, one for the trumpets and one for the flutes. This created the same audio for all trumpets and flute performances. College music majors rated each performance on a Likert-type scale. Results revealed black performers of each genders and instruments were rated significantly lower than white performers. The lowest ratings were given to black male and female trumpet players.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=VanWeelden|first=Kimberly|year=2004|title=Racially Stereotyped Music and Conductor Race: Perceptions of Performance|journal=Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education|issue=160|pages=38\u201348|issn=0010-9894|jstor=40319217}}</ref>\n\nThis example demonstrates that gender discrimination was prevalent during this time, but racial discrimination must be accounted for as well.\n\n===Sexism, Racism, and Gender Discrimination===\nWomen conductors faced sexism, racism, and gender discrimination throughout the 19th century and 20th century. \"To break down this apparent employment barrier, women created their own opportunities by founding and organizing all-female orchestras\"; one example is the Fadette Women's Orchestra in Boston founded in 1888 by conductor Caroline B.

The feminist argument that the personal is political was revisited in the image that Riot grrrl set forth, similarly to the culture of Punk that [[self-actualization]] is not to be found in external forces but rather through an individual's true self. By recognizing and reevaluating the institutional structures that affect individual experiences within social situations, an individual can gain the knowledge to better know herself and therefore know how to present herself to others so that they may know her accurately. Riot grrrl termed this movement to self-actualization, girl love \u2013 \"girls learning to love themselves, and each other, against those forces that would otherwise see them destroyed or destroy themselves\".\n\nThe accompanying slogan \"every girl is a riot grrrl\" reinforced the solidarity that women could find amongst themselves. This created an intimate aesthetic and sentimental politic well expressed in the production of zines (a shortened version of \"fanzines\").<ref name=\"Schilt\" /> [[Zine]]s were handmade, crafted by individuals who wanted to connect directly with their readers, with simple items like scissors, glue, and tape. They called out injustices and challenged the norms that typically directed the expression of sexuality and domestic abuse, providing a space for women to exchange personal stories to which many others could relate. They challenged girls and women alike to stand up for themselves in a political atmosphere that actively sought to silence them.<ref name=\"Kearney\" /> The shared personal stories were, at times, met with attitudes that reduced the communication to \"it's all just girls in their bedrooms, sprawled out writing in their diaries, and then they'll send them to each other\", while the choice to share in that way was an aesthetic one.\n\nIn the midst of this raising of awareness, riot grrrls had to address the generalizations that worked for them but that could not apply to women of color. Not all girls could be riot grrrl after all, for lack of privilege barred them from participating in such acts as writing \"SLUT\" across their stomach in an attempt to reclaim sexual agency.<ref name=\"Nguyen 173\u2013196\"/> While this performance is an earnest one, racism had already labeled women of color as that term. As observed by Kearny, \"the gender deviance displayed by riot grrrls is a privilege to which only middle-class white girls have access.\"<ref name=\"Kearney\" /> Another aspect of this need for inclusive [[discourse]] arose in the movement's preference for concrete knowledge and a disregard for the abstract that would foster theoretical inquiry.\n\n===Festivals===\nWomen's music festivals, which may also be called [[womyn]]'s music festivals, have been held since the 1970s. Some women's music festivals are organized for lesbians. The first women's music festival was held in 1973 at Sacramento State University. In May 1974 the first National Woman's Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, founded by [[University of Illinois]] student Kristin Lems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=DIL19740326.2.55&srpos=6&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-national+women's+music+festival------|title=Daily Illini 26 March 1974 \u2013 Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|website=Idnc.library.illinois.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> It celebrated its 40th year in Middleton, Wisconsin, from 2\u20135 July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org|title=National Womens Music Festival \u2013 July 5\u20138, 2018 Middleton, Wisconsin|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> As of 2015, it is a four-day event that includes concerts, workshops, comedy, theatre, films and writing events that \"promote and affirm the creative talents and technical skills of women\" from diverse, multicultural communities, including women with disabilities.

The festival began in 2005 as a celebration of the contributions of women to composition, performance, teaching, scholarship, and music administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esm.rochester.edu/wmf|title=Women in Music Festival|website=Women in Music Festival|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> From its modest beginnings of Eastman students and faculty members performing music by women composers, the Festival has grown to include additional concerts and events throughout Rochester, NY and to host composers-in-residence, who have included [[Tania Le\u00f3n]] (2007), [[Nancy Van de Vate]] (2008), [[Judith Lang Zaimont]] (2009), [[Emma Lou Diemer]] (2010), and [[Hilary Tann]] (2011). The festival has presented more than 291 different works by 158 composers.\n\nMany other festivals have been created throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s and vary in size from a few hundred to thousands of attendees. The [[Los Angeles Women's Music Festival]] began in 2007 with over 2500 attendees.  Events outside the US include the Sappho Lesbian Witch Camp, near Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada and the Sistajive Women's Music Festival in Australia. Some festivals are focused around the lesbian community, such as the Ohio Lesbian Festival, near Columbus Ohio, which was created in 1988; Christian Lesbians Out (CLOUT), which holds a gathering in early August in Washington, DC; The Old Lesbian Gathering, a festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and RadLesFes, an event held in the middle of November near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Feminist-oriented festivals include the Southern Womyn's Festival in Dade City, Florida; the Gulf Coast Womyn's Festival in Ovett, Missouri; Wiminfest in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Womongathering, the Festival of Womyn's Spirituality; the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, near Hart, Michigan; and the Midwest Womyn's Festival in DeKalb, Illinois.\n\nWhile women's music festivals are centered on music, they support many other facets of lesbian and [[feminist]] culture.  Some festivals are designed to provide a [[safe space]] for women's music and culture. Many festivals are held on college campuses or in remote rural locations, where attendees stay in campsites. Many festivals offer workshops on arts, crafts, fitness, and athletic events that women may not be able find in mainstream culture.  In her book ''Eden Built by Eves'', Bonnie Morris describes how women's music festivals serve women throughout the stages of their lives.

They called for the creation of a new Chinese culture based on global and [[Western world|western]] standards, especially [[democracy]] and science.

The ''[[La Jeunesse|New Youth]]'' journal, which was a leading forum for debating the causes of China's weakness, laid the blame on Confucian culture. Chen Duxiu called for \"Mr. Confucius\" to be replaced by \"Mr. Science\" ({{zh|t=\u8cfd\u5148\u751f|s=\u8d5b\u5148\u751f|p=s\u00e0i xi\u0101nsheng|labels=no|first=t}}) and \"Mr. Democracy\" ({{zh|c=\u5fb7\u5148\u751f|p=d\u00e9 xi\u0101nsheng|labels=no}}). Another outcome was the promotion of [[written vernacular Chinese]] ({{Lang|zh|\u767d\u8bdd\u6587}}) over literary or classical Chinese. Hu Shih proclaimed that \"a dead language cannot produce a living literature.\" In theory, the new format allowed people with little education to read texts, articles and books.\n\nHe charged that literary, or [[Classical Chinese]], which had been the written language prior to the movement, was understood by only scholars and officials (ironically, the new vernacular included many foreign words and Japanese neologisms ([[Wasei-kango]]), which made it difficult for many to read).<ref>Chow, May Fourth Movement, pp. 277, 46, 59</ref> Scholars, such as Y.R. Chao ([[Zhao Yuanren]]), began the study of the [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese language and dialects]] using tools of western [[linguistics]]. Hu Shih was among the scholars who used the textual study of [[Dream of the Red Chamber]] and other vernacular fiction as the basis for the national language. Literary societies such as the [[Crescent Moon Society]] flourished.\n\nThe literary output of this time was huge, with many writers who later became famous (such as [[Mao Dun]], [[Lao She]], [[Lu Xun]] and [[Bing Xin]]) publishing their first works. For example, Lu Xun's essays and short fiction created a sensation with their condemnation of Confucian culture. [[A Madman's Diary|Diary of a Madman]] directly implied that China's traditional culture was cannibalistic, and [[The True Story of Ah Q]] showed the typical Chinese as weak and self-deceiving.<ref>Leo Ou-fan Lee, ''Voices from the Iron House: A Study of Lu Xun'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987), pp 53-77; 76-78.</ref> Along with this musicians such as [[Yin Zizhong]] joined the movement through music.\n\nNew Culture leaders and their followers now saw China as a nation among nations, not as culturally unique.<ref>Erez Manela, ''The Wilsonian Moment: Self-Determination and the International Origins of Anticolonial Nationalism'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), Ch 5 \"China's Place Among Nations\"</ref> A large number of Western doctrines became fashionable, particularly those that reinforced the cultural criticism and nation-building impulses of the movement. [[Social Darwinism]], which had been influential since the late nineteenth century, was especially shaping for Lu Xun, among many others.<ref>James Reeve Pusey, ''China and Charles Darwin'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Council on East Asian Studies Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1983).</ref> and was supplemented by almost every \"ism\" of the world. Cai Yuanpei, [[Li Shizeng]], and [[Wu Zhihui]] developed a [[Anarchism in China|Chinese variety of anarchism]]. They argued that Chinese society had to undergo radical social change before political change would be meaningful. {{sfnb|Dirlik|1991}} The pragmatism of [[John Dewey]] became popular, often through the work of [[Hu Shih]], [[Chiang Monlin]], and [[Tao Xingzhi]].\n\nDewey arrived in China in 1919, and spent the following year lecturing. [[Bertrand Russell]] also lectured widely to warm crowds. Lu Xun was associated with the ideas of [[Nietzsche]], which were also propagated by [[Li Shicen]], Mao Dun, and many other intellectuals of the time.\n\nNew Culture leaders, often under the influence of the anarchist program, promoted [[feminism]], even [[free love]], as an attack on the traditional family, changing the terms in which the following generations conceived society. More specifically, the movement replaced sexuality over the traditional Chinese idea of kinship positionality. The substitution is a staple of the emerging individualistic theories that occurred during the era.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Haiyan|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FJAS%2FJAS64_01%2FS0021911805000057a.pdf |title=Tears that Crumbled the Great Wall: The Archaeology of Feeling in the May Fourth Movement Folklore Movement|publisher=Journal of Asian Studies|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> Among the feminist writers was [[Ding Ling]].\n\n== Development and end of movement ==\nThe [[May Fourth Movement|May Fourth Demonstrations]] of 1919 initially united the leaders but soon, there was a debate and falling out over the role of politics. Hu Shih, Cai Yuanpei, and other liberals urged the demonstrating students to return to the classroom, but Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, frustrated with the inadequacy of cultural change, urged more radical political action.<ref>Patrick Fuliang Shan, \u201cAssessing Li Dazhao\u2019s Role in the New Cultural Movement,\u201d in ''A Century of Student Movements in China: The Mountain Movers, 1919-2019'', Rowman Littlefield and Lexington Books, 2020, pp.3-22</ref> They used their roles as Peking University faculty to organize Marxist study groups and the first meeting of the [[Chinese Communist Party]].\n\nLi called for \"fundamental solutions,\" but Hu criticized it as abstract, calling for \"more study of questions, less study of isms.\" <ref>Jerome B. Grieder, ''Hu Shih and the Chinese Renaissance: Liberalism in the Chinese Revolution, 1917-1937'' (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1970), p. 254.</ref> The younger followers who followed Li and Chen into organized politics included [[Mao Zedong]].\n\nOther students heeded Hu Shih's call to return to their studies. The new approaches shaped scholarship for the next generation. The historian [[Gu Jiegang]], for instance, pioneered the application of the [[James Harvey Robinson|New History]] he studied at Columbia University to classical Chinese texts in the Doubting Antiquity Movement.<ref>Laurence A. Schneider, ''Ku Chieh-Kang and China's New History; Nationalism and the Quest for Alternative Traditions'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971).</ref> Gu also inspired his students in the study of Chinese folk traditions which had been ignored or dismissed by Confucian scholars.<ref>Chang-tai Hung, ''Going to the People: Chinese Intellectuals and Folk Literature, 1918-1937'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Council on East Asian Studies Harvard University : Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1985).</ref> Education was high on the New Culture agenda. Cai Yuanpei headed a New Education Society, and university students joined the Mass Education Movement of [[James Yen]] and [[Tao Xingzhi]] which promoted literacy as a foundation for wider political participation.\n\n===Journalism and public opinion===\nChinese newspaper journalism was modernized in the 1920s according to international standards, thanks to the influence of the New Culture Movement. The roles of journalist and editor were professionalized and became prestigious careers. The business side gained importance and with a greater emphasis on advertising and commercial news, the main papers, especially in Shanghai,  moved away from the advocacy journalism that characterized the 1911 revolutionary period.<ref>Timothy B. Weston, \"Minding the Newspaper Business: The Theory and Practice of Journalism in 1920s China,\" ''Twentieth-Century China'' (2006) 31#2 pp 4-31.</ref> Outside the main centers the nationalism promoted in metropolitan dailies was not as distinctive as localism and culturalism.<ref>[[Henrietta Harrison]], \"Newspapers and Nationalism in Rural China 1890-1929,\" ''Past & Present'' (2000)  166#1 pp 181-205</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Indian [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] held numerous lectures in China. He argued that China could encounter trouble by integrating too much western civilization into Chinese society. In spite of Tagore's efforts, western ideals were major components of the New Culture Movement. Democracy became a vital tool for those frustrated with the unstable condition of China whereas science became a crucial instrument to discard the \"darkness of ignorance and superstition.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Schoppa|first=R.Keith|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=170}}</ref>\n\nIn short, New Culture intellectuals advocated and debated a wide range of cosmopolitan solutions that included science, technology, [[individualism]], music and democracy, leaving to the future the question of what organization or political power could carry them out. The anti-imperialist and populist violence of the mid-1920s soon overwhelmed New Culture intellectual inquiry and culture.<ref name=\"Schoppa \">{{cite book|last=Schoppa|first=R.Keith|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=179}}</ref>\n\n== Evaluations and changing views ==\nOrthodox historians viewed the New Culture Movement as a revolutionary break with feudal thought and social practice and the seedbed of revolutionary leaders who created the Communist Party of China and went on to found the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. [[Mao Zedong]] wrote that the May 4th Movement \"marked a new stage in China's bourgeois-democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism\" and argued that \"a powerful camp made its appearance in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, a camp consisting of the working class, the student masses and the new national bourgeoisie.\"<ref>\"The May Fourth Movement\" (1939), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_13.htm Selected Works of Mao Zedong]</ref>\n\nHistorians in the west also saw the movement as marking a break between tradition and modernity, but in recent decades, Chinese and western historians now commonly argue that the changes promoted by New Culture leaders had roots going back several generations and thus were not a sharp break with tradition, which, in any case, was quite varied, as much as an acceleration of earlier trends.<ref>Paul A. Cohen, Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984), pp. 85\u201386.</ref> Research over the last fifty years also suggests that while radical Marxists were important in the New Culture Movement, there were many other influential leaders, including anarchists, conservatives, Christians, and liberals.\n\nThe re-evaluation, while it does not challenge the high evaluation of the thinkers and writers of the period, does not accept their self-image as cultural revolutionaries.<ref>Introduction, Kai-wing Chow, ''Beyond the May Fourth Paradigm : In Search of Chinese Modernity'' (Lanham: Lexington Books/Rowman & Littlefied, 2008) and [[Rana Mitter]], ''A Bitter Revolution : China's Struggle with the Modern World'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref>\n\nOther historians further argue that Mao's communist revolution did not, as it claimed, fulfill the promise of New Culture and enlightenment but rather betrayed its spirit of independent expression and cosmopolitanism.<ref>Schwarcz, Vera. ''The Chinese Enlightenment: Intellectuals and the Legacy of the May Fourth Movement of 1919'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986.</ref> [[Yu Yingshi]], a student of the [[New Confucian]] [[Qian Mu]], recently defended Confucian thought against the New Culture condemnation.

The ''[[La Jeunesse|New Youth]]'' journal, which was a leading forum for debating the causes of China's weakness, laid the blame on Confucian culture. Chen Duxiu called for \"Mr. Confucius\" to be replaced by \"Mr. Science\" ({{zh|t=\u8cfd\u5148\u751f|s=\u8d5b\u5148\u751f|p=s\u00e0i xi\u0101nsheng|labels=no|first=t}}) and \"Mr. Democracy\" ({{zh|c=\u5fb7\u5148\u751f|p=d\u00e9 xi\u0101nsheng|labels=no}}). Another outcome was the promotion of [[written vernacular Chinese]] ({{Lang|zh|\u767d\u8bdd\u6587}}) over literary or classical Chinese. Hu Shih proclaimed that \"a dead language cannot produce a living literature.\" In theory, the new format allowed people with little education to read texts, articles and books.\n\nHe charged that literary, or [[Classical Chinese]], which had been the written language prior to the movement, was understood by only scholars and officials (ironically, the new vernacular included many foreign words and Japanese neologisms ([[Wasei-kango]]), which made it difficult for many to read).<ref>Chow, May Fourth Movement, pp. 277, 46, 59}</ref> Scholars, such as Y.R. Chao ([[Zhao Yuanren]]), began the study of the [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese language and dialects]] using tools of western [[linguistics]]. Hu Shih was among the scholars who used the textual study of [[Dream of the Red Chamber]] and other vernacular fiction as the basis for the national language. Literary societies such as the [[Crescent Moon Society]] flourished.\n\nThe literary output of this time was huge, with many writers who later became famous (such as [[Mao Dun]], [[Lao She]], [[Lu Xun]] and [[Bing Xin]]) publishing their first works. For example, Lu Xun's essays and short fiction created a sensation with their condemnation of Confucian culture. [[A Madman's Diary|Diary of a Madman]] directly implied that China's traditional culture was cannibalistic, and [[The True Story of Ah Q]] showed the typical Chinese as weak and self-deceiving.<ref>Leo Ou-fan Lee, ''Voices from the Iron House: A Study of Lu Xun'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987), pp 53-77; 76-78.</ref> Along with this musicians such as [[Yin Zizhong]] joined the movement through music.\n\nNew Culture leaders and their followers now saw China as a nation among nations, not as culturally unique.<ref>Erez Manela, ''The Wilsonian Moment: Self-Determination and the International Origins of Anticolonial Nationalism'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), Ch 5 \"China's Place Among Nations\"</ref> A large number of Western doctrines became fashionable, particularly those that reinforced the cultural criticism and nation-building impulses of the movement. [[Social Darwinism]], which had been influential since the late nineteenth century, was especially shaping for Lu Xun, among many others.<ref>James Reeve Pusey, ''China and Charles Darwin'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Council on East Asian Studies Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1983).</ref> and was supplemented by almost every \"ism\" of the world. Cai Yuanpei, [[Li Shizeng]], and [[Wu Zhihui]] developed a [[Anarchism in China|Chinese variety of anarchism]]. They argued that Chinese society had to undergo radical social change before political change would be meaningful. {{sfnb|Dirlik|1991}} The pragmatism of [[John Dewey]] became popular, often through the work of [[Hu Shih]], [[Chiang Monlin]], and [[Tao Xingzhi]].\n\nDewey arrived in China in 1919, and spent the following year lecturing. [[Bertrand Russell]] also lectured widely to warm crowds. Lu Xun was associated with the ideas of [[Nietzsche]], which were also propagated by [[Li Shicen]], Mao Dun, and many other intellectuals of the time.\n\nNew Culture leaders, often under the influence of the anarchist program, promoted [[feminism]], even [[free love]], as an attack on the traditional family, changing the terms in which the following generations conceived society. More specifically, the movement replaced sexuality over the traditional Chinese idea of kinship positionality. The substitution is a staple of the emerging individualistic theories that occurred during the era.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Haiyan|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FJAS%2FJAS64_01%2FS0021911805000057a.pdf&code=6eba9fb91a6 75cde3d961c531b3262e2|title=Tears that Crumbled the Great Wall: The Archaeology of Feeling in the May Fourth Movement Folklore Movement|publisher=Journal of Asian Studies|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> Among the feminist writers was [[Ding Ling]].\n\n== Development and end of movement ==\nThe [[May Fourth Movement|May Fourth Demonstrations]] of 1919 initially united the leaders but soon, there was a debate and falling out over the role of politics. Hu Shih, Cai Yuanpei, and other liberals urged the demonstrating students to return to the classroom, but Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, frustrated with the inadequacy of cultural change, urged more radical political action.<ref>Patrick Fuliang Shan, \u201cAssessing Li Dazhao\u2019s Role in the New Cultural Movement,\u201d in ''A Century of Student Movements in China: The Mountain Movers, 1919-2019'', Rowman Littlefield and Lexington Books, 2020, pp.3-22</ref> They used their roles as Peking University faculty to organize Marxist study groups and the first meeting of the [[Chinese Communist Party]].\n\nLi called for \"fundamental solutions,\" but Hu criticized it as abstract, calling for \"more study of questions, less study of isms.\" <ref>Jerome B. Grieder, ''Hu Shih and the Chinese Renaissance: Liberalism in the Chinese Revolution, 1917-1937'' (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1970), p. 254.</ref> The younger followers who followed Li and Chen into organized politics included [[Mao Zedong]].\n\nOther students heeded Hu Shih's call to return to their studies. The new approaches shaped scholarship for the next generation. The historian [[Gu Jiegang]], for instance, pioneered the application of the [[James Harvey Robinson|New History]] he studied at Columbia University to classical Chinese texts in the Doubting Antiquity Movement.<ref>Laurence A. Schneider, ''Ku Chieh-Kang and China's New History; Nationalism and the Quest for Alternative Traditions'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971).</ref> Gu also inspired his students in the study of Chinese folk traditions which had been ignored or dismissed by Confucian scholars.<ref>Chang-tai Hung, ''Going to the People: Chinese Intellectuals and Folk Literature, 1918-1937'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Council on East Asian Studies Harvard University : Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1985).</ref> Education was high on the New Culture agenda. Cai Yuanpei headed a New Education Society, and university students joined the Mass Education Movement of [[James Yen]] and [[Tao Xingzhi]] which promoted literacy as a foundation for wider political participation.\n\n===Journalism and public opinion===\nChinese newspaper journalism was modernized in the 1920s according to international standards, thanks to the influence of the New Culture Movement. The roles of journalist and editor were professionalized and became prestigious careers. The business side gained importance and with a greater emphasis on advertising and commercial news, the main papers, especially in Shanghai,  moved away from the advocacy journalism that characterized the 1911 revolutionary period.<ref>Timothy B. Weston, \"Minding the Newspaper Business: The Theory and Practice of Journalism in 1920s China,\" ''Twentieth-Century China'' (2006) 31#2 pp 4-31.</ref> Outside the main centers the nationalism promoted in metropolitan dailies was not as distinctive as localism and culturalism.<ref>[[Henrietta Harrison]], \"Newspapers and Nationalism in Rural China 1890-1929,\" ''Past & Present'' (2000)  166#1 pp 181-205</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Indian [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] held numerous lectures in China. He argued that China could encounter trouble by integrating too much western civilization into Chinese society. In spite of Tagore's efforts, western ideals were major components of the New Culture Movement. Democracy became a vital tool for those frustrated with the unstable condition of China whereas science became a crucial instrument to discard the \"darkness of ignorance and superstition.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Schoppa|first=R.Keith|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=170}}</ref>\n\nIn short, New Culture intellectuals advocated and debated a wide range of cosmopolitan solutions that included science, technology, [[individualism]], music and democracy, leaving to the future the question of what organization or political power could carry them out. The anti-imperialist and populist violence of the mid-1920s soon overwhelmed New Culture intellectual inquiry and culture.<ref name=\"Schoppa \">{{cite book|last=Schoppa|first=R.Keith|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=179}}</ref>\n\n== Evaluations and changing views ==\nOrthodox historians viewed the New Culture Movement as a revolutionary break with feudal thought and social practice and the seedbed of revolutionary leaders who created the Communist Party of China and went on to found the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. [[Mao Zedong]] wrote that the May 4th Movement \"marked a new stage in China's bourgeois-democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism\" and argued that \"a powerful camp made its appearance in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, a camp consisting of the working class, the student masses and the new national bourgeoisie.\"<ref>\"The May Fourth Movement\" (1939), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_13.htm Selected Works of Mao Zedong]</ref>\n\nHistorians in the west also saw the movement as marking a break between tradition and modernity, but in recent decades, Chinese and western historians now commonly argue that the changes promoted by New Culture leaders had roots going back several generations and thus were not a sharp break with tradition, which, in any case, was quite varied, as much as an acceleration of earlier trends.<ref>Paul A. Cohen, Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984), pp. 85\u201386.</ref> Research over the last fifty years also suggests that while radical Marxists were important in the New Culture Movement, there were many other influential leaders, including anarchists, conservatives, Christians, and liberals.\n\nThe re-evaluation, while it does not challenge the high evaluation of the thinkers and writers of the period, does not accept their self-image as cultural revolutionaries.<ref>Introduction, Kai-wing Chow, ''Beyond the May Fourth Paradigm : In Search of Chinese Modernity'' (Lanham: Lexington Books/Rowman & Littlefied, 2008) and [[Rana Mitter]], ''A Bitter Revolution : China's Struggle with the Modern World'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref>\n\nOther historians further argue that Mao's communist revolution did not, as it claimed, fulfill the promise of New Culture and enlightenment but rather betrayed its spirit of independent expression and cosmopolitanism.<ref>Schwarcz, Vera. ''The Chinese Enlightenment: Intellectuals and the Legacy of the May Fourth Movement of 1919'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986.</ref> [[Yu Yingshi]], a student of the [[New Confucian]] [[Qian Mu]], recently defended Confucian thought against the New Culture condemnation. He reasoned that late imperial China had not been stagnant, irrational and isolated, conditions that would justify radical revolution, but that late Qing thinkers were already taking advantage of the creative potential of Confucius.<ref>\"Neither Renaissance nor Enlightenment: a historian's reflections on the May Fourth movement,\" Ying-shi Y\u00fc, in\n[[Milena Dole\u017eelov\u00e1-Velingerov\u00e1]], Old\u0159ich Kr\u00e1l, Graham Martin Sanders, eds., ''The Appropriation of Cultural Capital: China's May Fourth Project'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001).</ref>\n\n[[Xu Jilin]], a Shanghai intellectual who reflects liberal voices, agreed in effect with the orthodox view that the New Culture Movement was the root of the Chinese Revolution but valued the outcome differently. New Culture intellectuals, said Xu, saw a conflict between nationalism and cosmopolitanism in their struggle to find a \"rational patriotism,\" but the cosmopolitan movement of the 1920s was replaced by a \"new age of nationalism.\" Like a \"wild horse,\" Xu continued, \"jingoism, once unbridled, could no longer be restrained, thus laying the foundations for the eventual outcomes of the history of China during the first half of the twentieth century.\"<ref>\u201cHistorical Memories of May Fourth: Patriotism, but of what kind?\u201d Xu Jilin (translated by Duncan M.

For a full list of characters ordered by rank, see [[list of The Bill characters|list of ''The Bill'' characters]]. The [[Character (arts)|characters]] are all [[police officers]] or civilian staff at the fictional [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] [[police station]] in [[London]].\n\n{{The Bill character biographies toc}}\n\n==E==\n\n===Francis \"Taffy\" Edwards===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Francis \"Taffy\" Edwards\n| first      = Woodentop (16 August 1983)\n| last       = Rites (24 May 1990)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Colin Blumenau]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Francis \"Taffy\" Edwards''' was known as the 'thin streak of Welsh misery'. A quiet country boy who hailed from a poor farming family near [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], he sometimes struggled to adapt to city life. Edwards was extremely lazy, often thinking up ingenious ways to avoid having to do serious work \u2013 but he had an infectious charm and was popular amongst the relief. He would also wade in with the team when needed. Edwards is probably best remembered for when he got hopelessly drunk on his stag night and ended up stripped naked and abandoned in the street by his mates from Sun Hill \u2013 much to the annoyance of Mary, his Welsh bride-to-be. After brushes with pigs, chickens and assorted oddballs, he asked for a transfer back to Wales. His final day convinced him he had made the right decision: Brownlow did not seem to know who he was and Conway thought he had already left. In the end he decided to give his own leaving party a miss and headed home alone. He returned for Ken Melvin's funeral later that year. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==F==\n\n===Colin Fairfax===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Colin Fairfax\n| first      = Episode #278 (13 January 2005)\n| last       = Episode #291 (3 March 2005)\n| occupation = Police Community Support Officer\n| title      = Police Community Support Officer\n| portrayer  = Tim Steed\n}}\n\n'''PCSO Colin Fairfax''' arrived at Sun Hill along with another PCSO, Laura Bryant. Throughout his short time at Sun Hill, he showed to be a bigot and frequently had run ins with PC Leela Kapoor. His time at Sun Hill came to an end when after he spat in PC Kapoor's face whilst in the canteen and subsequently left the station. DC Ken Drummond was tasked with bringing him back into the station and found him drinking in a local pub. DC Drummond tried his best to persuade Fairfax to return but when he refused, DC Drummond went to arrest him. Fairfax retaliated by knocking DC Drummond unconscious and handcuffing him in a petrol-doused van and drove towards Sun Hill police station. Fairfax dived out of the van before it careered into the front of the police station; with Sgt. Smith and SRO Marilyn Chambers working inside. The following explosion and [[Episode 288 (The Bill)|fire]] killed two officers and a few days later; Fairfax was charged with the murders of DC Ken Drummond, PC Andrea Dunbar and SRO Marilyn Chambers.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Will Fletcher===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Will Fletcher\n| image      = \n| first      = Episode #371 (14 December 2005)\n| last       = Be a Man (7 January 2010)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Sergeant\n| portrayer  = [[Gary Lucy]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Will Fletcher''' grew up in [[Hemel Hempstead]] with his parents and sister. He was inspired to join the police by a friend of his father's, who was an Area Car driver in the police force and often told him about his work. Like most others at Sun Hill, he did his training at Hendon. It is not clear where he served his probationary period or indeed how long he has been in the force, but he previously served at Hemel Hempstead and he was later transferred to Sun Hill. He is a fan of cars and motorcycles\u2014on his first day he drove to work without his hands on the wheel as he tried to read a map\u2014in his spare time, he enjoys boxing. When he was injured, he was unable to compete in a boxing tournament with PC [[Dan Casper]], which was something Inspector [[Gina Gold]] set up. However, he stood in his friend's corner for every match and tried to convince Casper to tell Gold about his steroid abuse. He later began a relationship with PC Honey Harman, but they split up after he refused to go on holiday with her in [[Tenerife]]. Harman was later shot and killed after being held captive by drug barons. Fletcher was devastated initially, having been one of the first on the scene when Harman's body was discovered, but later came to terms with her death. He became close friends with Casper, and the two were frequently seen paired on the beat together until Dan resigned. Since then he was paired with PC [[Roger Valentine]], PC [[Benjamin Gayle]] and PC [[Tony Stamp]] among others. He showed strong feelings for colleague PC [[Emma Keane]] and was violently opposed to her marriage to lawyer Matt Hinckley. Despite being beaten up on Keane's wedding day after she revealed to Hinckley that she slept with Will and being able to prove that Hinckley was behind the attack, he turned up at the wedding to wish them well. Later, Fletcher helped Keane to uncover the truth about Hinckley's old girlfriend\u2014who supposedly died a few years earlier\u2014and found that she was actually alive and was only just recovering from a nervous break down after having a miscarriage. Fletcher transferred to CID in August 2008, after his police work impressed [[Neil Manson|DI Manson]]. He was the first uniformed officer to transfer to CID since DC [[Gary Best]]. In July 2009, Fletcher made the move from Trainee DC to a fully-fledged DC. Fletcher left Sun Hill in January 2010, when he transferred to another station as a Sergeant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Suzanne Ford===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Suzanne Ford\n| first      = Runaround (13 September 1988) first job at the police station\n| last       = The Wild Rover (12 March 1992)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = evie longstaff \n}}\n\n'''WPC Suzanne Ford''' was described as 'the ideal WPC'.{{by whom|date=February 2013}} She considered becoming a nurse before eventually joining the Metropolitan Police and saw her policing role as essentially one of serving the community rather than catching crooks. She was a natural police officer \u2013 'one of the boys' who always seemed to get sent out on raids \u2013 but above all a caring woman. She also had a special ability \u2013 sign language, as she had a profoundly deaf sister. She used this skill on one occasion when questioning a deaf suspect. Ford left Sun Hill in 1992.\n{{Clear}}\n\n\n===Jonathan Fox===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Jonathan Fox\n| image      = \n| first      = Episode #210 (28 April 2004)\n| last       = Episode #328 (20 July 2005)\n| occupation = Lawyer\n| title      = Crown Prosecution Service Senior Lawyer\n| portrayer  = [[Larry Lamb]]\n}}\n\n'''CPS Lawyer Jonathan Fox''' was the station's resident CPS Lawyer and whilst at Sun Hill he embarked upon a relationship with Inspector Gina Gold. Jonathan eventually realised that he would always play second fiddle to Gina's commitment to the job and left Sun Hill soon after.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Rosie Fox===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Rosie Fox\n| first      = Deep End (25 August 1998)\n| last       = The Trial Of Eddie Santini (2 April 2000)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable<br>Detective Sergeant\n| portrayer  = [[Caroline Catz]]\n}}\n\n'''Police Constable later Detective Sergeant Rosie Fox''' immediately became the subject of unwanted attention from PC Eddie Santini when she first arrived at Sun Hill. She had been assigned to an undercover investigation with Santini, culminating in him nearly raping her in the locker room. Subsequently, Santini spread lies about her around the station and conducted a campaign of bullying, forcing her to request a transfer away from Sun Hill.  Later promoted to Detective Sergeant, Rosie returned to Sun Hill to investigate the murder of Santini's ex-girlfriend Jessica Orton. She suspected Santini himself of the crime and eventually linked him to it when he was found in possession of the keys to Orton's house. She arrests him for murder. Rosie returned again for Santini's manslaughter trial, but was murdered in her hotel room before she could testify against him as part of the elimination of key witnesses by a major crime lord awaiting trial.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Robin Frank===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Robin Frank\n| first      = Funny Ol' Business \u2013 Cops And Robbers (16 October 1984)\n| last       = Traffic (11 July 1989)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Ashley Gunstock]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Robin Frank''' was a steady, reliable type, known for his commitment and integrity. From [[Bethnal Green]] in the East End, he was easy going, with a naturally friendly manner and ready smile. He was the son of a schoolteacher and worked in office jobs before joining the Met. Married to Angela, a nurse, Frank was a trained area car driver. Members of the public found him thoughtful and straightforward in his dealings, and the relief knew that he always could be depended on \u2013 even if he complained about the more mundane aspects of the job.  He suffered the trauma of being shot by a robber who had taken a woman hostage in a block of flats in 1985. Recuperating, Frank spent much of his time at the CAD desk and working as the station's crime prevention officer. He left Sun Hill in 1989.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Christine Frazer===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Christine Frazer\n| first      = Light Duties (19 July 1988)\n| last       = I Thought You'd Gone (11 January 1990)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Duty Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Barbara Thorn]]\n}}\n\n'''Inspector Christine Frazer''' served at Sun Hill for a year and a half, replacing Inspector Kite. She was the station's first senior female officer, and one of the very few high-ranking females in the Metropolitan Police at the time. Throughout her posting at Sun Hill, this caused much friction between the force, particularly with the young male PCs whom she often rubbed the wrong way, and eventually she unwittingly created a foe in Chief Inspector Derek Conway, whose initial respect and support for her waned considerably towards the end of her tenure.\n\nElsewhere in the station, she was held in high regard, particularly by Sergeants Alec Peters and Tom Penny, who also found her very attractive. Bob Cryer warmed to her eventually but occasionally found cause to criticise her performance, given her tendency to lean towards \"modern\" methods of policing, rather than Cryer's own tried and tested traditional means. She shared past history with DI Frank Burnside, who tried to rekindle romance when he was posted to Sun Hill (she was not interested), and was a target for DS Ted Roach's affections. Frazer refused a relationship but conceded to have a drink with Roach \u2013 gossip later turned this into a full-blown affair and Conway warned Roach to break it off or face immediate transfer. While initially having recommended him for promotion to D.I. in place of Burnside, wearing down a stubborn Conway, her working relationship with Roach suffered and on several subsequent occasions she came down heavily on him for poor choices in his work.\n\nShe was also perhaps the only officer at Sun Hill to have known of Burnside's true history in the force \u2013 most believed him bent over the years \u2013 before ousting his undercover involvement in Operation Countryman to gossiping Sergeants Cryer, Penny and Peters, thus explaining his apparent crooked ways. Burnside was particularly ungrateful afterwards.\n\nIn late 1989, Frazer became the first female inspector to take the Met's riot training course, and during the ensuing mayhem \"froze\" as her team came under heavy attack, exposing them to serious danger. She quickly overcame her fear and successfully completed the course, but couldn't stop the training supervisor from reporting her bungle to Chief Superintendent Brownlow. This, along with continued pressure on her to perform above and beyond to prove herself in the rank as a woman, culminated in a bad appraisal from Conway which ultimately Brownlow agreed with during a heated meeting, and he refused to recommend her for promotion. Instead he suggested she continue at Sun Hill for another year in her present rank. Frazer reluctantly refuses, instead taking extended leave to write a thesis about discrimination in the force, specifically sexism. She does not return to Sun Hill following this period and presumably resigns from the Met during her leave.\n\nDuring her first year on the show, Frazer was written as a \"main character\" and frequently top-billed in the credits (after Sgt. Cryer), with multiple storylines afforded to her. Her appearances were less involved through much of mid-late 1989 as the cast changed around her, however she was given considerably more screen time before her departure in early 1990.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Delia French===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Delia French\n| first      = Don't Like Mondays (25 July 1989)\n| last       = Acting Detective (26 March 1992)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Natasha Williams (actress)|Natasha Williams]]\n}}\n\n'''WPC Delia French''' was once in charge of the station typing pool, before leaving to take a clerical job in the city. She returned to Sun Hill in 1990 as a probationary WPC. Delia was a feisty addition to the ranks of Sun Hill \u2013 she had no qualms in berating members of CID for the poor quality of interview transcripts, and also was a bit of a gossip \u2013 taking great interest in the business affairs of every officer in the station. She could be tough when she wanted to, and was by no means a push-over. Delia also had a razor sharp wit and was not afraid to use it. But her infectious enthusiasm soon broke down barriers and made her friends in the station. Delia went undercover for Burnside on one occasion when a woman who collapsed at an airport was found carrying drugs in her stomach. She took the woman's place and successfully led CID to the dealer. She left Sun Hill shortly after the operation.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==G==\n\n===Roy Galloway===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Roy Galloway\n| first      = Woodentop (16 August 1983)\n| last       = Not Without Cause (7 December 1987)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Robert Pugh]] ''(Pilot)'' <br> [[John Salthouse]] \n}}\n\n'''DI Roy Galloway''' was proud of himself when he became one of the youngest inspectors in the [[Metropolitan Police]]. An impulsive man, he was a thief taker in the classic mould, always seeming to be playing a game of good old fashioned cops and robbers. Nobody is above suspicion for Galloway. Even when fencing information from one of his snouts, he always takes what they say with a grain of salt. Although he sometimes shows a wisdom of years beyond his own age, Galloway was also every bit as fiery as his red-coloured hair suggests. When frustrated, he would not hesitate to take those frustrations out on colleagues. This placed him in many tricky situations with his immediate subordinate, DS [[Ted Roach]], who wanted Galloway's job. At one point, [[June Ackland]] considers resigning after Galloway blames her for his own troubles. Only the timely intervention of Sergeant [[Bob Cryer (The Bill)|Bob Cryer]] stops the situation from escalating out of control. He is married, with one daughter. The pressures of his job lead to him spending less and less time with them, however. Eventually he goes through a bitter divorce, which he takes hard. Characteristically, this only leads to him throwing himself even further into his work. Over time, he mellows to the point where he is even willing to step in defence of Cryer after he accidentally runs into a pensioner in a car during a wet, night-time call out. The two men share a strong long-time bond, but rarely has Galloway been so proactive in helping his uniform colleagues. After three years in [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]], Galloway decides to leave. The exact reasons for his departure are kept vague and confidential, but it comes as a shock to some and a relief to others.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===George Garfield===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = George Garfield\n| first      = Only a Little Bit of Thieving (2 May 1989)\n| last       = The Big Day \u2013 Part 2 (16 December 1999)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Huw Higginson]]\n}}\n\n'''PC George Garfield''' joined the Met at nineteen because it was steady employment and he'd not had much luck with other jobs he'd tried since leaving school. But he didn't much like the leafy suburb of Teddington, to which he was sent \u2013 too dull \u2013 and used his excess energy in the boxing ring. He reached ABA quarter finals standard. After repeated requests for a posting to a busier manor, he was transferred to Sun Hill early in 1989. He got on with most of the people there. Tony Stamp was a good friend. He had run-ins with the likes of Steve Loxton, who could be a bit aggressive if rubbed up the wrong way. Unlike them, Garfield could control his temper, although occasionally he could be something of a bull in a china shop, charging in wildly before he had properly thought out the repercussions of his actions. He could also bear a grudge with the best of them. But as the relief's Federation rep. George was a steady, reliable type, known for his loyalty and integrity. He took pride in his work and his best quality was his commitment to colleagues. He tried hard to never let anybody down, by acting as a trouble shooter for the team \u2013 and served well in the role as he always had his colleague's best interests at heart. But, like so many others, he had been taken under the wing of Bob Cryer more than once. He had money troubles before the night of the party for his twenty-fifth birthday, but they got worse after it. He'd hired a room only to have Quinnan and Jim Carver wreck it by fighting over a girl. Garfield had to pay for the repairs, which meant he had to return his flash XR3 convertible car that he'd just started buying on installments, against the advice of his bank manager. Lending the key of his section-house room to Loxton \u2013 who was spotted nipping up the stairs with a nurse, against the rules \u2013 was another black mark against his name. But his colleagues were on his side when Matthew Boyden let him down \u2013 nipping off to see one of his women friends and leaving him to be beaten up by the villain they were supposed to be trailing. Garfield was knocked down and concussed. There were bets on if and when Garfield might get his own back. They were safe bets. Boyden learned about Garfield's right hook \u2013 the hard way. Over the years, young women seemed to be immune to the Garfield charm. There was some chance he was getting something together with a WPC whom he invited for a pizza, then there was that journalist from the Sun Hill Chronicle. In the end, George's love life proved to be the end for his stint at Sun Hill. A rather messy love triangle involving himself, Dave Quinnan and a nurse, Jenny Delaney, ensured George was not at Sun Hill station for much longer. He left the force on a voyage of self-discovery, briefly returning a couple of months later to settle his differences with Dave at his wedding.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Benjamin Gayle===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Benjamin Gayle\n| first      = Cracking Under Pressure (27 September 2007)\n| last       = Respect \u2013 Part 2 (31 August 2010)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Micah Balfour]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Benjamin Gayle''' arrived at Sun Hill in September 2007. On his first day in the job, he was cornered in a woodland by three gang members \u2013 but fought them all off, even giving one of them a broken collar bone. Ben was known for often having an uneven temper. He once broke a man's nose because he didn't like the way that the man treated his son. This almost lost him his job as a result. Ben later had a professional relationship with Sally, but their relationship ended when Sally got drunk and smashed her car into the side of a parked vehicle. Callum Stone managed to cover for the pair, but the incident resulted in Will Fletcher's transfer to CID, much to his happiness.  \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Arun Ghir===\n{{Infobox character \n| name       = Arun Ghir\n| first      = New Blood (12 June 2008)\n| last       = Decision Time (19 March 2009)\n| occupation = [[Police Officer]]\n| title      = [[Police Constable]]\n| portrayer  = [[Abhin Galeya]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Arun Ghir''' arrived at Sun Hill in June 2008, alongside fellow probationer Millie Brown and transfer Leon Taylor. Arun had a troubled past, and on the day of joining the police force, his father was attacked by racist thugs after he politely asked them to get away from his car. Arun saw this as his chance to put things right, though things didn't always go to plan, given his fiery temper and high enthusiasm.<!-- this is unclear -->\n\nArun was committed and dedicated to the job, wanting to put right any wrongs for everybody, however small they may be \u2013 adamant that he helped to make the streets safer. He did have a tendency to think a bit too highly and took himself too seriously at times, frequently speaking before thinking through what the consequences could be, but still managed to come across as sincere, with a certain amount of naive charm. As dedicated as he was, his maverick streak meant he can be unpredictable and not always straight down the line \u2013 it all depends what the end result was. Arun was suspended from duty by Dale Smith after attempting to help an illegal immigrant escape detection with her son. After some time away from the job, Arun decided that he was not cut out for a job in the police and resigned.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Craig Gilmore===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Craig Gilmore\n| first      = Tour Of Duty (10 April 2001)\n| last       = Episode #088 (6 February 2003)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Sergeant\n| portrayer  = [[Hywel Simons]]\n}}\n\n'''Sergeant Craig Gilmore''' is recruited to replace his predecessor, [[Bob Cryer (The Bill)|Bob Cryer]]. In many ways he is the exact opposite. Whereas Cryer is modest, experienced and respected, Gilmore has been fast-tracked to promotion, has been a sergeant for less than a year and is considered by his colleagues to be arrogant. He is the first openly gay sergeant in the show's history. He left [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] after receiving a severe beating and having a relationship with PC [[Luke Ashton]], a [[The closet|closeted]] [[homosexual|gay man]], who was married to PC [[Kerry Young]] at the time.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Danny Glaze===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Danny Glaze\n| first      = Makeover (11 May 1999)\n| last       = Episode #155 (8 October 2003)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Karl Collins]]\n}}\n\n'''DC Danny Glaze''', a local Londoner, is a streetwise detective with a good sense of humour. He comes to Sun Hill after meeting Liz Rawton in a training course and was persuaded to join her in CID. His [[Afro]] hairstyle made his presence distinctive. Glaze passed his Sergeants exams and was Acting DS for a short time before becoming a DC again. Glaze later gets caught up in the scandal surrounding Des Taviner, when he finds out that Des planted evidence in accused murderer Jeff Simpson's residence. He reluctantly covers for him because he knew Simpson was guilty, but later his conscience begins getting the better of him. Simpson claims he was set up and former Sun Hill officer Detective Inspector Sally Johnson investigates the case. Glaze eventually reveals the truth, but to avoid prosecution, he keeps \u00a320,000, which he came across during a robbery case, and flees to South Africa and he is never seen or heard from again.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Gina Gold===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Gina Gold\n| image      = \n| first      = Episode #021 (27 June 2002) \n| last       = An Honour To Serve (2 October 2008) \n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Roberta Taylor]]\n}}\n\n'''Inspector Gina Gold''' arrived at Sun Hill in June 2002, shortly after the events of the fire. Gina already knew Superintendent Okaro at the time, because they were old flames in the 80s. When Okaro left due to promotion to Borough Commander, he and Gina still remained very good friends. Gina was known for her 'iron fist' \u2013 mainly due to the fact she loved boxing in her spare time, which led PC [[Emma Keane]] wrongfully to make a bullying allegation against her. Consequently, she left on leave, but soon returned. Gina worked closely with Sergeant [[Dale Smith (The Bill)|Dale Smith]], who was one of her closest friends at the station and was one of the only ones who she told about having cancer. From her arrival, she soon earned the respect of the relief but still didn't fear mincing her words. One of her first big actions during her time at Sun Hill occurred in December 2002. Whilst out one evening at linedancing, Gina ran into a fight between two boys; one of the lads was Tommy Renolds. When she took Tommy home she realised that she used to be friends with his mum Beverly at school and her older cousin Marilyn. It transpired that Marilyn had contributed to Gina's brother being convicted of murder. He committed suicide in prison and Gina blamed Marilyn for his death. It ended in a dramatic show-down where Marilyn ended up being shot dead, not before having a dig at Gina's infertility.\n\nOn Gina's departure, she and Smith shared an emotional moment when, after saying that she would be missed, he said, \"Goodnight, Ma'am\". Gina replied tearfully, \"Goodnight, Sergeant\", before looking tearfully around her office.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Beth Green===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Beth Green\n| image       =\n| first       = Baby Trade (16 May 2007)\n| last        = Leap Of Faith \u2013 Part 2 (18 March 2009)\n| portrayer   = [[Louisa Lytton]] \n| occupation  = [[Police Officer]]\n| title       = [[Police Constable]] \n}}\n\n'''PC Beth Green''' arrives at Sun Hill in May 2007, and on her first day on the beat, she is paired with PC [[Emma Keane]]. As they investigate a break-in at a house, Green's nerves get the better of her. As a suspect is being restrained with CS spray, she sprays not only the suspect in the eyes but also Keane. Green reveals that on a previous occasion she had accidentally sprayed herself by spraying a CS can backwards. She is more successful later on in using her CS spray, this time to stop a fleeing suspect. Although Green gets on well with some of her colleagues, particularly PC [[Dan Casper]], who is impressed by her attention to detail and her memory, there are still a few who have doubts about their latest recruit. Keane draws attention to her girlish appearance and nicknames her 'Little Miss Daisy Chain'. PC Will Fletcher is irritated that Green is attracted to him. In one instance, she is hit on the head with a bottle by an escaped convict and knocked out. She is also hit with a rake, knocking her unconscious, and left tied up in a hospital cupboard by escaped murderer Larry Franks. In another instance, she is almost sprayed in the face with acid. Green later goes undercover to aid [[List of The Bill characters (M\u2013P)#Terry_Perkins|Terry Perkins]]'s investigation of a notorious loan shark. Green's cover is Terry's drug addicted daughter seeking money to pay back her dealer. Green later reveals to PC Tony Stamp that she has applied for a job in witness protection. Before she can say anything else the two officers spot a woman called Molly Anderson standing on the edge of a bridge. As Green tries to talk her down, Mel and Nate Roberts arrive. When Anderson jumps into the water, Roberts dives in after her. After a stressful day Green heads back to the station and finds a letter from [[witness protection]]. She is accepted for Witness Protection and leaves at the end of the day.  \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Alistair Greig===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Alistair Greig\n| first      = Getting It Right (3 January 1989)\n| last       = Cooking (28 July 1998)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Sergeant\n| portrayer  = [[Andrew Mackintosh]]\n}}\n\n'''DS Alistair Greig''' joined Sun Hill CID after a stint in the Vice Squad. He was a member of the Metropolitan Police band, playing the [[clarinet]] and was initially of a breezy disposition. A few months of working for [[Frank Burnside|Burnside]] knocked this early chirpiness out of him and though he became outwardly stoical, Alistair retained a sharp, dry sense of humour. An intellectual and prone to being a little aloof, Greig was generally recognised and respected as a hardworking and dedicated detective, but remained peripheral to the CID \"family\".  There was a sense that he preferred to keep even those colleagues with whom he was on good terms at arm's length. He certainly had little time for the frivolous, the self-serving and the outright rule breakers \u2013 that went for both fellow officers and criminals. Greig was put in charge of implementing the Met's anti-burglary initiative, Bumblebee, at Sun Hill, leading a team which included [[Dave Quinnan]] and [[Suzi Croft]]. Unlike most of CID, Greig offered Suzi thoughtful guidance, particularly through the early part of her career and there were occasional hints that Alistair was quite protective of Croft. Despite appearances, Greig was ambitious and it rankled that he was passed over for DI on more than one occasion. He considered a move away from Sun Hill after DCI Meadows chose [[Chris Deakin|Deakin]] to replace [[List_of_The_Bill_characters_(E\u2013L)#Sally_Johnson|Sally Johnson]]. However, Meadows dissuaded him from doing so, giving his assurance that Greig was a valued officer and was next in line. In hindsight, perhaps Greig should have followed his initial instincts. Like [[Jim Carver]], he found himself a victim of the controversial tenure policy in place at the time. He appealed but was unsuccessful. A plea by Meadows to Brownlow also failed. Rather than take what he saw as a pointless, and humiliating option to go back into uniform, Greig transferred to another station.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==H==\n\n===Vicky Hagen===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Vicky Hagen\n| first      = Big Brother (7 May 1998)\n| last       = Sacrifice (26 October 2001)\n| occupation = Policewoman\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Samantha Robson]]\n}}\n\n'''WPC Vicky Hagen''' arrived at Sun Hill under a cloud, having been labelled a \"grass\" by a mate of PC Jarvis for reporting a colleague who had assaulted a prisoner. She transferred from a station in Essex because of the affair and was keen to get a fresh start at the station. It was there where she qualified as an area car driver. She was tough, straightforward and took no nonsense. Vicky made it very clear that being Sun Hill's first female area car driver did not overawe her. Sex was simply not an issue \u2013 she'd work and fit in equally happily with men or women. Since she was attractive, feminine and above all funny \u2013 and quite able to drink the boys under the table \u2013 she eventually fitted in despite earlier reservations, although her abrasive approach occasionally alienated colleagues. Vicky could often make strong judgements on other people though, particularly women \u2013 not because she felt threatened \u2013 but because she wanted them to behave like she did. A thinly disguised man-eater, Hagen fell for the dubious charms of Eddie Santini before moving on to Matt Boyden. When it became clear that Boyden put his troubled daughter before her, Hagen finally demonstrated signs of vulnerability. On the rebound, she picked up a guy for a one-night stand, only for him to commit suicide in the bath. This was the final straw for Vicky, who decided in the circumstances to leave the Met and request a transfer to one of the county forces.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Harry Haines===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Harry Haines\n| first      = Bad Reaction (10 September 1993)\n| last       = Nothing Ventured (31 December 1993)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Gary Whelan]]\n}}\n\n'''DI Harry Haines''' was forcibly transferred to Sun Hill from the Drugs Squad after Burnside's abrupt departure. Built like a prop forward, as befitted a former member of the Divisional rugby team, his easy manner and ironic sense of humour could not disguise the fact that he was a cunning operator and as hard as iron. The move back to divisional CID angered Haines, and the team knew that it wouldn't be long before he tried to get back on the Squad. Indeed, after just three months, interference from Meadows over the discovery of an LSD factory made him choose to leave Sun Hill and return there. He was later seconded to the station in January 1995 to help Meadows track down a consignment of lethal heroin. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Lewis Hardy===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Lewis Hardy\n| first       = Wrong Place, Wrong Time (11 January 2006)      \n| last        = Death Or Glory (19 July 2007) \n| portrayer   = [[Aml Ameen]] \n| occupation  = Police Officer\n| title       = Police Constable \n| relatives   = Dominic Hardy (Cousin)\n}}\n\n'''PC Lewis Hardy''' started at [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] with fellow PC [[Emma Keane]], who had a privileged upbringing. Lewis was a working class black lad who had spent most of his teenage life on the streets with a small gang in Hackney. Lewis was arrested numerous times, finally, for a drug offence of which he was innocent. He was taken under the wing of one of the officers who supported and inspired him to join the Metropolitan Police Force. Lewis was smart with sharp wit who was encouraged by his teachers to go to University. After realising the amount of debt he would get into, he decided to apply to [[Hendon Police College|Hendon]] with the support of the officer from his local station. Lewis may not have always seen eye to eye with some of the older members of the relief, but his personality always shone through. It was difficult to hold a grudge against him. He left [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] after a harrowing but successful undercover operation infiltrating the Sken Man Massive gang of which his cousin, Dominic was a member. Whilst in hospital after being shot he was offered a transfer to [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]] which he quickly snapped up.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sam Harker===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Sam Harker\n| first      = Things That Go Bump in the Night (30 December 1997)\n| last       = Episode #010 (18 April 2002)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Matthew Crompton]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Sam Harker''' served at [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] for five years. A no-nonsense officer, he transferred to Sun Hill from Heathrow police because he wanted to broaden his experience with a spell at an East End [[police station|nick]]. Harker relished his job. He always knew what he would do with his life, coming from a long line of policemen \u2013 his father was a police officer in [[Liverpool]], as was his elder brother. As far as he was concerned, it beat working for a living! He was easy going, with a naturally friendly manner and a ready smile and was not easily fazed. Members of the public found him thoughtful and straightforward in his dealings, and locally he became a popular and respected uniform beat bobby. He also had the sense to leave the troubles of policing at work with his uniform at the end of the shift, and found it easy to relax with his mates and a beer. Tragically, Sam died in hospital after being critically injured in an explosion at Sun Hill after race riots got out of hand. He was the officer who witnessed [[Des Taviner]] throwing the petrol bomb that caused the fire, however he died before he could tell anyone.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Honey Harman===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Honey Harman\n| image      = \n| first      = Episode #098 (20 March 2003)\n| last       = School Of Hard Knocks (25 January 2007)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable \n| spouse     = Scott Burnett (2005)\n| portrayer  = [[Kim Tiddy]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Honey Harman''' was born and raised in [[Ilford]], [[Essex]]. She always excelled in sport at school but did rather poorly in academic studies. As a young adult, she worked as a [[fitness instructor]] and [[personal trainer]]. She eventually became bored with working in [[gyms]] and decided that she wanted to help people and also to work in a physically demanding job, so she joined the [[police]]. Honey was kind-hearted and always wanted to see the best in people; she also believed strongly in first impressions. Although she may not have been the most academically gifted officer the station has seen, her instinct and physical ability never let her down. A [[vegetarian]] who declared her body to be a temple, Honey was physically fearless and never doubted her own abilities. She was willing to put herself in dangerous situations because she knew that she was capable of, at least physically, dealing with anything. Her [[judo]] skills came in more than handy when she got herself into sticky situations whilst chasing suspects. Paperwork was another story \u2013 she hated it with a passion and would do anything to avoid the mounting pile on her desk. Having no awareness of her own attractiveness, Honey was perhaps initially unintentionally inappropriate with some of the men on the relief. Her love life was never plain sailing; Honey split from her [[Association football|footballer]] [[fianc\u00e9]] Fletch after she discovered he was cheating on her. In April 2005, she married Scott Burnett, who unknown to her, had murdered his wife Karen, whose case was under investigation. Scott took Honey to an isolated seaside cottage in Kent. In conversation, it slips out that he killed his wife. He removes the battery from his phone so the police can't track him down but Honey secretly puts it back in. Discovering this, he realised that she betrayed him and the police would be there soon. He stormed out and disappeared beneath the waves. Honey rushed after him and managed to resuscitate him but he was facing a life in jail without the woman he loved\u2014he wished she had not bothered. Scott later hanged himself in prison. Following her kidnapping by a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] drugs gang, Honey attempted to arrest drugs dealer Kristen Shaw, 'for kidnapping a police officer and accessory to murder'. In the ensuing struggle, a gun was accidentally let off, fatally wounding Honey. After Honey died, a shocked Kristen said to her bent policeman boyfriend, [[Zain Nadir]], ''\"I...I didn't mean to \u2013 she's dead, and it's all my fault, but she was trying to take you away from me...\"''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Donna Harris===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Donna Harris\n| first      = Discretion (19 November 1991)\n| last       = Confession (27 February 1996)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Louise Harrison]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Donna Harris''' was one of the most pleasant, straightforward young women to have worked at Sun Hill. Born in Yorkshire, she left her family and friends and came to London to join the Met when she was twenty-one. She wanted to do a worthwhile job. She also wanted to make a clean break from sad memories; her husband had been killed in a car crash there. She married again six years later, this time to a man many years older with a daughter from his first marriage. It was the security she wanted, and in the next year she transferred to Sun Hill to become Collator, hoping the regular hours would mean she'd have more time with her family. It did, and the family grew: she gave birth to their son, now a toddler. Because she had a happy home life and knew she was efficient at her job, Donna didn't have to take flak from her male colleagues. Any 'Be a good girl and...' routines earned quick put-downs. In 1994, she became the analyst for the burglary initiative, Bumblebee. She started it up at Sun Hill, and the work entailed her visiting other police stations. Donna left Sun Hill in 1996, her job as collator becoming redundant with the rise of computerised policing.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Lorna Hart===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Lorna Hart\n| first      = Inner Demons (24 May 2007)\n| last       = Moving Target \u2013 Part 3 (28 November 2007)\n| occupation = Police Civilian Staff\n| title      = Crime Scene Examiner \n| portrayer  = [[Siobhan Redmond]]\n}}\n\n'''CSE Lorna Hart''' joined Sun Hill as a crime scene examiner in May 2007.

He was born and raised in the Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove area of West London and had pounded the beats in some of the more volatile of the Met's Divisions, including a posting at Brixton during the Summer of '81. Haynes was street-smart and energetic; this combined with his enthusiastic nature made him a highly-effective officer. He also had a dark sense of humour. Frazer told Haynes that he had the potential to go for sergeant but he wondered whether it would simply be an empty gesture as part of the Met's black recruitment drive.

One of life's easy achievers, he gained a cluster of GCSEs at school, and scored top grades in four 'A' Levels without really trying. University places were offered, but Ben took a gap year \u2013 which turned into two \u2013 and immersed himself in a zesty lifestyle of music and clubbing. Ben was unusual at Sun Hill in having a liberal, middle-class background. He breezed through training at Hendon, excelling in academic and behavioural studies \u2013 but he was also put on Section 15 for attitude. Undoubtedly bright, his downside was that he showed little interest in the more mundane aspects of police work \u2013 and this was sometimes perceived as laziness. Whilst he was certainly intelligent, Ben could sometimes display an amazing lack of common sense. Always ready to argue a point, he often had frequent run-ins on insubordination and discipline. He had a zero tolerance attitude towards drugs of any kind, following his sister's death from taking ecstasy. Some viewed his anti-drugs opinions as 'obsessive' and his colleagues sometimes became annoyed with Ben's general 'boy-scout' approach to policing, but any comments were tinged with affection.

In 2006, Heaton he had an affair with DAC Georgia Hobbs, but ended the relationship when he found out that DAC Hobbs had pushed to get Sun Hill closed as she had promised the land to a developer. After taping a conversation where she admitted her role to Heaton, he turned both her and the evidence over to the [[Directorate of Professional Standards]]. Heaton also had an affair with Mickey Webb's girlfriend Mia Perry during this time. In 2007, John's old enemy and former colleague in the police, Ray Moore, a gangster and club owner, arrives in Sun Hill from Manchester. Knowing how ruthless Moore can be, Heaton sends Rhiannon and Charlie to Bristol for safety. In 2009, John reaches the toughest point of his career when he discovers that a man he sent down for murder 20 years ago was innocent, and that he let a serial killer go undetected. While Sun Hill's finest struggle to keep faith in the boss that they thought was invincible, John must rebuild his confidence \u2013 and his reputation. He is determined to right the wrongs, win back the respect of his colleagues and ensure that justice is finally served. John Heaton was DC [[Grace Dasari]]'s DCI at her previous job, and knew PC [[Diane Noble]] previously, through her ex-husband.

Reg responds by telling him he is a coward, and saying it is the families of those he killed he should apologise to. Minutes later, armed police have Des surrounded, and Reg arrests him. Later on that afternoon, Des is beaten to death in his cell by a manic depressive, ending his relationship with Reg on bad terms. Shortly after Des's death, Reg receives a video tape Des made immediately prior to going on the run. It's Des's last attempt to apologise to Reg for dragging him into the mess. Reg, as he finishes his drink, forgives Des's memory. In 2003, Reg began a relationship with [[Marilyn Chambers (The Bill)|Marilyn Chambers]], Sun Hill's front desk officer at the time. After dating for a few months, Reg plans to propose to her at the railway station he had taken her to on their first date, where Reg discovered she was actually interested in his hobby of trainspotting. While Reg is waiting at the railway station for Marilyn to arrive she is killed in [[The Sun Hill Fire (2005)]].<ref name=Hollis/> Reg is deeply upset by her death, and he finds her replacement very hard to swallow while he is grieving. Reg's position was later threatened by Superintendent [[John Heaton (The Bill)|John Heaton]]. [[Tony Stamp]] urges him to change his approach to policing. Reg, however, refuses to compromise on his principles and says, \"if Superintendent Heaton's idea of running an efficient nick is to get rid of anyone over 30, I'm not sure I want to work for him\". Heaton started to realise how much respect and loyalty Reg receives from his colleagues. Following [[June Ackland]]'s departure, Reg considers tendering his resignation; however, Tony is able to convince him not to. Reg resigned from the force following [[Emma Keane]]'s death in the terrorist bombs in Sun Hill in May 2008.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Kerry Holmes===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Kerry Holmes\n| first      = The Cross (20 October 1998)\n| last       = All Fall Down \u2013 Part 2 (31 October 2000)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Joy Brook]]\n}}\n\n'''DC Kerry Holmes''', originally from Yorkshire, arrived at Sun Hill a fully-fledged DC, looking to investigate crime on her own, no longer under someone else's supervision. She was bright, intelligent, and highly motivated \u2013 making her an effective detective, particularly as she didn't take no for an answer. Many of the younger male CID officers thought that she was a bit of a swot, earning her the nickname of 'Sherlock', but she was too confident to ever really let the jibes get to her and wasn't slow in coming up with a quick riposte. Kerry also possessed a mischievous streak, asking questions of her senior officers that others wouldn't dare to and then playing the innocent. Rawton was someone who Kerry felt she could go to for information about Sun Hill and the two usually got on fine. But she could also annoy Rawton at times by choosing to ignore her advice on investigation matters and handling colleagues. Where Rawton never allowed her gender to be an issue, Kerry occasionally played the coquette, using her good looks and pleasant manner to charm men in and out of the department; on occasion, this led to friction between the two. She was however a breath of fresh air to the stuffy and very male Sun Hill CID. After the suspension of Sun Hill's CID following Don Beech's corruption, Kerry decided to leave the station, infuriated by CIB's investigation into her conduct.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Michelle Hughes===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Michelle Hughes\n| image      = \n| first      = To Have and To Hold (26 June 1993)\n| last       = TBA\n| occupation = [[Police Officer]]\n| title      = [[Police Constable]]\n| portrayer  = Gail Abbott\n}}\n\n'''WPC Michelle Hughes''' first arrived at the station in 1993 as a probationer, but served at Sun Hill for over three years.

When Phil's wife, Cindy, found out about his antics, and his secret children, she forced him into paying for IVF treatment so they could have a baby. They were not successful. Phil later developed a rivalry with DS [[Stuart Turner (The Bill)|Stuart Turner]], both for results at work and for [[Samantha Nixon|Sam Nixon]]'s affections. During his time at Sun Hill, Phil travelled to [[Romania]] with fellow DS [[Samantha Nixon|Sam Nixon]], where they began a secret relationship, sleeping together in a backstreet B&B and getting shot at in a drive-by shooting.

In fact, any chance he gets, Phil tries to get Steve transferred out of the station. Steve is na\u00efve and likeable, yet slightly awkward and a dreamer. He clearly idolises his brother, but when he realises that he can't meet Phil's high expectations of him, he decides to transfer to Derby.

They were waiting to see how close to Inspector Cato, also from Barton Street, he turned out to be. They didn't have to wait long. Jarvis put as much distance between himself and his unpopular boss as he could. It became clear that he did not approve of some of the older man's methods. It also became clear, as the months went by, that he was unimpressed by some of his colleagues, too. He found Loxton's approach sometimes unprofessional; he seemed not to trust Matthew Boyden; but he got on well with Dave Quinnan and George Garfield. He looked down, in both senses of the words, on some of the women. But there may have been a spark of something for Polly Page although she didn't know it. Jarvis could be bad-tempered, but he was a valuable member of the team \u2013 he was used to fitting in quickly. He did this through a consciously positive outlook on life, which could be undermined by exasperation and flashes of temper. Despite this, he had a well-meaning, good-natured attitude to the job, which could make him seem rather earnest. Popular with his colleagues, he was sometimes irritated that they weren't as straight as he was. A trained Area car driver, Jarvis developed into a reliable and conscientious officer during his time at the station. And good in the police rugby team, too. And long legs could be useful when the only way on to one tower-block balcony is from another tower-block balcony. With Jarvis it was 'Just step this way'. Jarvis went on attachment to the Diplomatic Protection Group for several weeks in 1998, before transferring there permanently later that year. He clashed immediately with new PC Vicky Hagen upon his departure, as she had 'blown the whistle' on a friend of his who had assaulted a prisoner at their station in Essex. When it was revealed that the prisoner was a 14-year-old boy, Jarvis changed his stance and parted on good terms with his colleague.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Amber Johannsen===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Amber Johannsen\n| first      = Episode #264 (1 December 2004)\n| last       = Episode #377 (29 December 2005)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Myfanwy Waring]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Amber Johannsen''' was feisty - but she was neither gutsy nor focused. She was born into a lower-class family but had her sights on the high life; she was looking for a provider. In the mean time, being a police officer offered a stable income, good holidays and \u2013 best of all \u2013 an opportunity to take advantage of her role in society \u2013 oh; and there was a great uniform too. She decided to join the police after briefly dating a police officer. Amber's roots were very modest; her father was a taxi driver and her mum a beauty therapist. Beneath the happy smile, Amber was manipulative and self-obsessed. She liked to get what she wanted and didn't care who she hurt in the process. In many ways, the designer labels she wore showed her determination to get a better life for herself \u2013 and get as far as possible from her working-class background. Until she achieved her goal in society, Amber amused herself by toying with the likes of Steve Hunter. The two things that excited her most were shopping and sex and she was practically addicted to both. She was beautiful and knew it, taking every opportunity to flirt and break hearts \u2013 with [[bisexuality|both men and women]]. Amber wanted the finer things in life and everyone at the station knew that as soon as she found a man to fund it, she'd ditch her uniform quicker than she could manage to read a criminal their rights. This attitude certainly didn't endear her to her colleagues, some of whom made no secret of their dislike for her. Inspector Gold eventually tired of her questionable commitment to the job and prompted her resignation from the force. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sally Johnson===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Sally Johnson\n| first      = Second Sight (6 January 1994)\n| last       = Episode #159 (22 October 2003)\n| occupation = Police Officer \n| title      = Detective Inspector \n| portrayer  = [[Jaye Griffiths]]\n}}\n\n'''DI Sally Johnson''' believed she was God's gift to policing, and she may have turned out to be just that if her interpretation of means-to-an-end had tallied with the Met's. You could never have accused her of lacking in self-belief. Having risen through the ranks at an alarming pace to become a DS at Stafford Row, she was ready to tackle whatever another promotion and Sun Hill could throw at her by way of racist, sexist remarks. If she couldn't deal with it, she wouldn't have got where she was. Johnson had always been aware that her colour and education were an advantage within the force, and that they had led to her promotion in the climate of positive discrimination rather than on her real ability to do the job. This didn't mean that she was incompetent, but like a lot of the fast track promotions, she lacked a lot of basic ground experience. She put in the hours and got her hands dirty, but always found it difficult to accept that she was in charge now, and not one of the lads. And if there was an inner core of loneliness beneath the ambitious exterior, she took care to keep it hidden. Johnson grew up in London, and it was soon clear to her West Indian family that she had brains. They were somewhat surprised when after university she chose to use them in the police force, but she rose through the ranks very quickly and loved going to work, loved being in control of others and, above all, loved catching thieves. Johnson charged along the corridors with her subordinates trying to keep up. Her easy manner won her friends and took the starch out of some of the senior officers. But on occasions her know-it-all air could be irritating. The word 'delegate' was not in her vocabulary \u2013 she enjoyed the work on the streets and in the interview room too much for that. She may not have shown great wisdom in the detectives she had chosen to favour \u2013 making Pearce her pet at the start was perhaps a mistake, and she'd been clumsy in her treatment of Ackland, whose years of experience she undervalued. Johnson's unshakeable faith in her own abilities irritated a number of more experienced officers at the station and her confidence took a long overdue knock when she was subjected to a private prosecution for manslaughter following the raid of a crack dealer's house. Up till then she had been completely comfortable with her power. From then on she had moments of doubt. As her methods came under increasing scrutiny, it was clear that her days at Sun Hill were numbered \u2013 and when she was offered a desk job attachment monitoring overtime, she realised she had no choice but to take it.  Johnson eventually left the Met. to become a private investigator. She returned to Sun Hill in 2003 to investigate claims of a fit up in the Simpson murder case. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==K==\n\n===Brandon Kane===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Brandon Kane\n| first      = Episode #022 (2 July 2002)  \n| last       = Episode #184 (15 January 2004)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Constable\n| spouse     = Tanya Kane <br> (deceased)\n| children   = Zoe Kane (daughter) <br> Jordan Kane <br> (son)\n| portrayer  = [[Pal Aron]]\n}}\n\n'''DC Brandon Kane''' came from a small Asian Leicester family. He was not a practising Hindu and although his parents were, they were fairly liberal about his decision to leave his faith at home. Only his vegetarianism gave away any sign of a religious background. Brandon grew up in a happy atmosphere with his older sister Mira whom he adored, eventually following in her footsteps by training to be an accountant where he met his ex-wife, Tanya, with whom he had 2 children. When their marriage began to crumble, he took time to consider his options in life. After the divorce he decided to give up his job to go into the police service. It was not exactly a 'calling' for Brandon \u2013 it just seemed a natural step to take. Somewhat to his surprise he was good at the profession, and began to enjoy the lifestyle it brought him.  Kane spent three years as a PC at another station, and had been noticed early on by the CID officers where he was based as a bright, meticulous officer, with the potential to be a very good detective. This coupled with a twinkle in the eye and a sense of humour as dry as the Sahara desert, made him a very popular. Brandon hated to be idle \u2013 he always wanted to be up and off doing something; and when he was forced to remain in one place he seemed restless. When he made mistakes in the station and out on a case they tended to stem from his impulsive nature that occasionally made him speak before thinking and act before determining the consequences. After a spell in Sun Hill's Community Safety Unit as a TDC, Brandon transferred to CID as a full-fledged DC following his completion of the trainee investigator course. Brandon was a very friendly man, however there were those who he did not get on with, particularly [[DS Debbie McAllister]], whose guts he absolutely hated. This stemmed from when Tanya died, and Debbie pounced on Brandon as prime suspect in her tragic fall. Brandon almost came close to hitting Debbie and argued with her violently, telling her that \"we both know you're hanging on in CID by your fingertips\" and accused her of trying to score brownie points with [[DCI Jack Meadows]]. He told her she was disgusting and that she made him sick. However, Debbie fought back, saying as Tanya's ex-husband he had no rights and she had every right to gain access to Tanya. However, she knew she'd lost the battle. Brandon's final days at Sun Hill were spent in turmoil. After being taken hostage by PC Cathy Bradford he realised the people he wanted to protect most were his children. True to his genuine good nature, Brandon left the force to be with them.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Leela Kapoor===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Leela Kapoor\n| first      = Episode #268 (15 December 2004)\n| last       = Dead and Buried (26 September 2007)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Seema Bowri]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Leela Kapoor''' had been in the Metropolitan Police for seven years before coming to Sun Hill. She may have been spiky and defensive, but she was also warm with a wicked sense of humour. She served her probation at Barton Street, and prior to joining Sun Hill, saw two of her colleagues assaulting a witness. Leela being Leela, at the forefront of justice and wanting to do the right thing, reported her peers. Life subsequently became rather difficult for her as she was seen as a grass, so she opted for a transfer to another nick. Leela was second generation British Hindu; at home she spoke Hindi but also had Punjabi and Urdu under her belt. Although Leela's home life was happy, she was exposed to the bigotry of society at an early age. Whilst she was fairly protected from racism by her family and circle of friends, her personal circumstances meant she experienced prejudice of a different kind, when her uncle, a high-profile businessman, was accused of embezzlement. Leela's family had to fight a long, public, legal battle to clear her uncle's and the family's name. The Police's handling of the case, and some officer's ignorance when dealing with her family, all contributed to Leela's decision to become a police officer. Leela was not for wearing her ethnicity on her forehead \u2013 she just got on with it and celebrated the fact that she was different. One thing she couldn't stand, however, was being used as a token ethnic officer in the PC initiatives being pedalled by management. Leela was never one to take the easy option, out to prove she could do whatever she put her mind to. She was uncompromising and had a strong moral code, but could at times be quite guarded. If you were fortunate enough or cared enough to get to know the real Leela, you found a warm, caring, and sensitive woman. However, Leela was a tough nut to crack and she had a tendency to withdraw into herself if she felt vulnerable. For this, people perceived her to be difficult and cold, unless they were prepared to dig a little deeper. Leela left Sun Hill after receiving an offer to transfer to the Foreign Office. Little did she know that the position had been orchestrated by Sgt. Stone, who had tired of Leela playing everything by the book in her position as station's Fed Rep, and wanted shot of her.               \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Debbie Keane===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Debbie Keane\n| first       = New Moves (7 March 1995) \n| last        = Taking Sides (22 September 1998) \n| portrayer   = [[Andrea Mason (actress)|Andrea Mason]] \n| occupation  = Police Officer\n| title       = Police Sergeant\n}}\n\n'''PC Debbie Keane''' joined Sun Hill from Hendon along with classmate Nick Slater but soon emerged as the more promising of the two. She had tried a number of different jobs, including Leisure Centre Assistant and Outward Bound Instructor, but until becoming a police officer, nothing had really satisfied her. Debbie was attractive, fit, vivacious and not a complainer. She met any challenge with vigour and enthusiasm. Not afraid to assert herself physically, she could also hold her own in a scrap. Debbie's cheery manner could be infectious and she was definitely somebody you'd want on your side. Her attitude marked her out as a natural leader, but needing to be tempered by experience. Confident and ambitious, Debbie was encouraged by her senior officers to try for her sergeant's exams \u2013 she'd certainly found her niche in the Met.

Emma came across as smart and fun-loving. After graduating from University, Emma trained at Hendon for five weeks before being posted to Sun Hill, and completed her training there, recently graduating from her probationary period. After being involved in an incident where a fellow policeman was killed, Emma was convinced that Inspector Gina Gold was bullying her. She made a false complaint but it was not until they worked together on a rape case that she realised Gina was not really bullying her and withdrawed the complaint. Unfortunately, she goes to see the superintendent and he tells her his hands are tied on the matter but the complaint was later withdrawn. While dating CPS solicitor [[Matt Hinckley]], Emma had a one-night stand with Will Fletcher, Emma later agreed to marry Matt out of guilt for cheating on him. However, the night before her wedding, she opened up to Matt and told him about the brief affair. Matt got his friends to beat up Will but during the course of the next day Will punched Matt and they agree not to press charges against each other. Emma and Matt get married and both go back at work after their honeymoon. Shortly after the wedding, Matt reveals that he wants to start a family with Emma fairly soon but she does not feel ready. Later, when Emma finds out that Matt lied to her about his ex-girlfriend being dead, she confronts him with evidence that she is still alive. The two have an argument and Matt attempts to strangle her. She hit him on the head with a Vodka bottle, which is just within reach. Matt later claimed that Emma tried to kill him but was arrested, following an investigation into the incident. After the incident, Emma grew closer to Will. Emma was killed when she attempted to evacuate a building she suspected was threatened by a terrorist attack. In the absence of her sergeant, [[Callum Stone]], Emma was forced to attempt the evacuation alone, until a bomb went off with Emma inside. When Stone arrived, he attempted frantically to revive the PC, but to no avail. Stone is racked with guilt at Emma's death, and that he may have been able to do something about it, had he been where he should have.

Caring and compassionate, her generous heart was easily touched by a hard-luck story, which sometimes led to other officers accusing her of being too soft on criminals. But her instinctive perception and sympathy meant she could communicate easily with people from all walks of life. An active sportswoman, she was not afraid to be disliked and pull rank in order to get the best performance from those around her.

He later joined the Met to get revenge on Sgt [[June Ackland]] for one reason and one reason only; June had given birth to a boy and put the baby up for adoption. Gabriel's parents adopted June's son and gave him all the praise, making their own son extremely bitter and jealous.

Throughout his time at Sun Hill, Gabriel evolved from a bullying [[bigot]] into a [[serial killer]].\n\nGabriel first appeared as a stranger who frightened away a mugger from off-duty Sergeant June Ackland before he joined Sun Hill. When he arrived at Sun Hill, he brought a mature aged attitude to the force; he was keen to do good and enforce the law. In the beginning he worked mostly by the book, but soon the power went to his head. His first victim was PC Ruby Buxton who resigned from the force when Kent bullied her into lying on the stand at a court appearance. Inspector [[Gina Gold]] was immediately aware of his actions and kept a watchful eye over him after the incident. So greatly annoyed at his superior was Kent that he turned to blackmail when he discovered that she had been caught over the legal alcohol limit and used this to force her hand. After enacting actions of a mental proportion he turned to the physical side of things when involved in the marriage of DC [[Jim Carver]] to Marie Graham. Called out to a disturbance at their home, Gabriel took control of the situation by hitting Jim over the head with a vodka bottle. Both Jim and Marie subsequently ended up in hospital with confusion reigning on what had actually occurred. However, Marie reported seeing Gabriel hit Jim with the bottle. But the clever Gabriel was able to clear his name of her allegation, although Gina was not at all convinced by his side of the story. Gabriel then moved on to June by playing on her insecurities and then seducing her. The two began a relationship, which they kept to themselves. However, Gina had done some digging into Gabriel's background and discovered his birth certificate, showing that his birth name was Robert Ackland \u2013 the son June had given up for adoption. But DC Carver later found the birth certificate and showed it to June. Shocked and horrified that she had committed incest, June confronted Gabriel and he admitted that he was her son. However, he then repented and revealed to June that her real son was in fact his adoptive brother after she told him that his son's birth had been the result of a rape when June was only a teenager and that their relationship was all part of his revenge plan. Shocked and furious, June threatened to tell the whole relief the truth, but Kent convinced her to remain quiet by giving her the chance to meet her real son. PC Kent's secret was again kept behind closed doors.\n\nGabriel continued his menacing ways by using unorthodox methods to stop criminals, exerting physical violence and fabricating evidence. He was assigned as the community officer for the Cole Lane Estate for a period of time where he continued to issue his own brand of justice. He violently assaulted a [[paedophile]] and hired thugs to beat up a [[loan shark]] to punish them for terrorising the residents and their crimes. But things really began to get out of hand when he had two teenage boys beaten up as punishment for robbing an elderly woman. After this incident, his behaviour was reported by [[Laura Bryant]], a Cole Lane resident at the time but he was able to clear his name of her complaint and was removed from his role. For many months, [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] was terrorised by a serial [[sniper]] who targeted criminals. During this reign of terror, four victims were shot dead by the mysterious gunman \u2013 Lee Sandford, one of the teenage residents on the Cole Lane Estate who Gabriel had beaten up, Malcolm Willard who had sexually abused DC [[List of The Bill characters (M\u2013P)#Terry_Perkins|Terry Perkins]], his brother Ben when they were children and Christopher Spinks, a local drug dealer and PC Kerry Young, after she uncovered the truth about Gabriel being corrupt. There were suspicions that Gabriel was the sniper, but Gabriel appeared to be cleared when he was almost shot by the sniper himself when dealing with a suspect. It turned out that the sniper was Jason Hardy, an ex-[[Navy]] friend of Kent's and that Kent himself was a conspirer to the three murders the sniper had carried out. Gabriel held many grievances against criminals in the community and supplied the names of the three victims to Hardy and it was Hardy who pulled the trigger. When the net began to close in on Hardy and officers arrived to arrest him, Kent was one step ahead of them and threw Hardy from his high-rise balcony to protect his secret. However, PC [[Steve Hunter]] witnessed this but Gabriel convinced him that he was trying to hold onto Hardy to prevent him falling, when in fact he had let go of his hand deliberately. But despite Gabriel being proved innocent, his colleagues grew more and more suspicious over his actions and question marks remained over his behaviour.\n\nFor sometime, Gabriel had been obsessed with his colleague PC [[Kerry Young]]. When Kerry slept with Sergeant [[Dale Smith (The Bill)|Dale Smith]], who was secretly in love with her, after a heavy drinking session, Gabriel twisted the situation out of his hatred for the Sergeant by cruelly tricking Kerry into accusing Smithy of [[date-rape]], persuading her to make an official allegation and then spread the news around the whole relief. Kerry, however, withdrew the accusation after realising that Smithy was incapable of rape. After the failure of the rape allegation against Smithy, Gabriel developed a sick interest in Kerry and tried to get close to her. He even kissed her while on duty, but Kerry pushed him away as she was seeing PC [[Cameron Tait]] at the time. But Gabriel convinced himself that she was deliberately 'leading him on' and making him think that they could have had a relationship. And when Kerry agreed to marry Cameron, Gabriel wrongfully accused her of 'pushing him too far' and 'winding him up' and took out all his anger and jealousy on her by violently raping her. Shocked and traumatised by the vicious attack, Kerry confided in Cameron but Gabriel taunted that Kerry slept with him willingly and was just the girl who cried rape when she was unfaithful, for he knew that no one would believe her after her previous cry of rape. Kerry was distraught when Cameron didn't believe her and ended their relationship. Knowing she couldn't report him, Gabriel mentally taunted Kerry and played sick mind games with her, before later admitting to Cameron that he did indeed rape her. Cameron convinced Kerry to report the rape, but Gabriel blackmailed her for neglecting her duty during an armed robbery at a bank and threatened to end her career if she reported the rape. He then played his last sick game with Kerry by deliberately goading Cameron into assaulting him in the station canteen. Cameron's career was put on the line after his attack on Gabriel and he left Sun Hill the next day and returned to Australia. Kerry went completely off the rails when she couldn't tell the truth, but she warned Gabriel that the battle was far from over and swore that she would find a way to destroy him like he destroyed her.\n\nKerry eventually found comfort in Smithy among others when he declared his undying love for her. Finally, her chance to put Gabriel behind bars came when she discovered his true identity from June Ackland, after she tried to tell June about the rape. Kerry vowed to reveal the truth to the rest of the officers but just after she declared her undying love for Smithy, Gabriel used Hardy's sniper rifle to shoot Kerry dead in the arms of her utterly devoted boyfriend outside the station from a nearby rooftop to stop her from exposing him. Gabriel stood victorious as Kerry could no longer expose him, but his cruel victory did not remain glorious for long because he then regretted killing her after he discovered that as a result of the vicious rape, she was pregnant with his unborn child. After acting extremely inappropriately at Kerry's funeral, Gabriel pushed a devastated Smithy too far with his attitude towards Kerry's death that Smithy flipped out at him and attacked him during the rest. Seizing an opportunity to cover his tracks as a rapist and a murderer and to get one over Smithy out of his hatred for the Sergeant and his cruel jealousy of Kerry's love for him, Gabriel announced to the whole relief that Kerry was pregnant with his son when she died and manipulated them into believing that he and Kerry had been secretly dating in her last months of life. Everyone believed him, but were confused at the same time as they never knew about it. Gabriel, however, convinced them that he and Kerry wanted to keep their 'relationship' quiet and told them that they both meant everything to each other, making himself look like he was the love of Kerry's life. Luckily however, a grief-stricken and angry Smithy, Kerry's real boyfriend and the real love of her life, was not as easily fooled as everyone else for he knew that none of Gabriel's stories about Kerry made any sense whatsoever. Although Gabriel almost had him convinced at first, everything finally began to add up when Smithy discovered that Kerry had claimed that Gabriel raped her before she died. However, he still didn't know what to believe until Kerry's grieving father George came to the station to collect Kerry's belongings and to meet Smithy. But unfortunately, Gabriel interceded and told George about Kerry's pregnancy and their secret 'relationship'. But that didn't stop George from telling Smithy what Kerry felt for him and that she called him her 'knight in shining armour'. Gabriel, however, overheard the conversation and once again pushed Smithy too far with all his lies when he told their colleagues that Kerry called him her 'knight in shining armour'. Furious and realising that what Kerry said was indeed true, Smithy reported the rape allegation to the [[Murder Investigation Team]]. Out of all his love for his girlfriend, Smithy swore to expose Gabriel as a rapist and avenge Kerry's death.\n\nA fellow officer PC [[Andrea Dunbar (The Bill)|Andrea Dunbar]] worked alongside Sergeant Smith to expose Gabriel for his crimes, for it was Andrea who Kerry confided in about her rape in Gabriel's hands the day before her death and informed Smithy. Despite the fact that MIT couldn't pin Kerry's rape on Gabriel, Andrea kept digging more into his background after the death of the sniper when she figured that Gabriel was somehow connected to him and the murders of his three victims. Gabriel, however, became suspicious that Andrea was onto him after seeing her talking to PCSO Laura Bryant about his actions on the Cole Lane Estate and threatened her if she didn't back away. Despite the threat, Andrea continued her investigation and finally found the evidence that she and Smithy needed to put Gabriel away. However, Andrea was then exposed as an undercover journalist and Smithy refused to listen to her because of the nature of her deception. But when Andrea convinced him that they had evidence against Gabriel, Smithy agreed to let her collect it from her [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeonhole]]. The evidence that Andrea obtained was a newspaper article from Gabriel's days in the Navy and a photograph of him and Hardy, proving his true identity. However, Gabriel caught her with the article, held her hostage in a store room and admitted all of his crimes when Andrea pieced all the pieces of the jigsaw together.\n\nAfter some convincing from Andrea, he appeared repentant and ready to give himself up until disaster struck at Sun Hill; misguided PCSO Colin Fairfax drove a petrol-laden van through the reception of Sun Hill station, which was followed by a huge explosion. Minutes later, Gabriel seized his opportunity for a second chance, rose from the ashes and left Andrea to perish in the resulting fire with all the evidence she had against him. Gabriel was then hailed by his colleagues, who were all unaware that he had deliberately left Andrea in the fire, as the hero by winning brownie points when he rescued Smithy from the burning station. Smithy, however, was not at all grateful for Gabriel saving his life as his hatred for the PC was just too strong, for he still believed Kerry's rape allegation against him and even believed that he was involved in her murder. Not to mention Andrea telling him that Gabriel was working alongside Jason Hardy and that she had the evidence to prove it. When Andrea's body was later recovered from under a pile of rubble, Gabriel believed he had finally gotten away with all his cruel crimes and seized his opportunity to put them all behind him and make a fresh start.\n\nAfter the fire, Gabriel appeared to be a changed man, keeping himself out of trouble and performing good police work. However, he wasn't a changed man for long when he held off the temptation to begin a relationship with PC [[Sheelagh Murphy]]. Instead, he chose to seek solace in prostitutes but after regaining trust in his colleagues, he became selfish once again by dating Sheelagh while still having a prostitute girlfriend. It was a bumpy relationship, but even when June warned Sheelagh off about Gabriel, Smithy drunkenly revealed to her that Kerry said he raped her and Gabriel himself told her that he pushed the sniper to his death, Sheelagh was never swayed. Despite the rocky nature of the relationship, the two later became engaged. After successfully killing Kerry, Andrea and the sniper, everything seemed to be going well for Gabriel. But several months after the fire, his chances of getting away with everything he had done were once again put at risk. On the day of Sun Hill Police Station's 50th anniversary, Gabriel's world started to collapse when an unexpected visitor came to the station asking to see June Ackland \u2013 his brother, the real Gabriel Kent who had returned to Sun Hill from the US for good. Gabriel tried to convince his colleagues that the man claiming to be Gabriel Kent was an insane person he had come across before who had stolen his identity. Immediately after the real Gabriel was shot and fell off a balcony during a siege at Sun Hill station, Gabriel visited him in hospital and threatened him to keep quiet about his identity. Luckily however, PC Laura Bryant told Sergeant Smith that the man shot during the siege had arrived at the station asking for June and saying that his name was Gabriel Kent. Smithy began to put more pieces of the puzzle together when he told Laura that June had a son she gave up for adoption called Gabriel Kent and that he thought Robert Ackland's birth certificate belonged to PC Gabriel Kent. Smithy and Laura went to June and Laura told her that the gunshot victim said his name was Gabriel Kent. When Smithy told June that he knew she had a son, June told them that the man they had been working with for the past two years was not her son and not Gabriel Kent.\n\nWhen Smithy brought June to the hospital, she recognised her son immediately and identified him as the real Gabriel Kent. June then explained to Smithy how she had her son when she was sixteen following a rape and was forced to give him up by her parents. She then revealed that PC Gabriel Kent was really David Kent, her son's adoptive brother. June explained that David had stolen his brother's identity to work in the Force and get revenge on her because he blamed her for all the errors in his life after his parents adopted her son. June insisted on telling Superintendent [[Adam Okaro]] about her son and PC Kent's true identity, but Smithy persuaded not to as she could have lost her job over keeping it secret for so long. Smithy then confided in June about Kerry's rape allegation against Gabriel and was devastated when it was finally confirmed as true when June told him that Kerry had come to see her before she died and had tried to tell her something but was unable to. Gabriel was worried that his chances were at risk and asked Sheelagh to move away and leave the country with him. Sheelagh really considered Gabriel's idea and told Laura. Horrified, Laura revealed Gabriel's secret to Sheelagh and begged her not to leave with him. Suspicious and stunned by Laura's revelation, Sheelagh went through Gabriel's packed suitcase and found his brother's ID card and mobile phone, only to be caught by him. Gabriel confessed to Sheelagh that he was really David Kent, but swore that he loved her and that they could still get away together. Sheelagh tried to escape, but Gabriel caught her, beat her and tied her up. Laura and PC [[Tony Stamp]] later found her and rescued her. Gabriel then made his way to the hospital to try to kill the real Gabriel by turning off his life support machine and suffocating him with a pillow. As he thought his brother was dead, he left. Luckily, PC Steve Hunter reached the real Gabriel just in time and the doctors successfully resuscitated him.\n\nBut the fake Gabriel knew his time was running out when he saw Smithy arrive with a raid of uniform officers as he and June investigated a disturbance in a block of flats. Knowing that he had been exposed and Smithy had arrived to arrest him, Gabriel snapped at June once again; he dragged her up to the rooftop, vented all his remaining anger on her, handcuffed her to the railing, blamed his troubles on her and confessed to all of his evil crimes. Luckily, Smithy climbed up to where they were in time to save June and overheard Gabriel's confessions. And when Gabriel confessed to the rape and murder of Smithy's beloved girlfriend Kerry, Smithy flew into a rage, charged at Gabriel and the two men had an aggressive fist-fight but before Smithy could arrest him, Gabriel overpowered him and knocked him out unconscious. Realising that his time was finally up, the evil David Kent made one last decision and threw himself off the rooftop to his death to avoid spending the rest of his life in prison, his reign of terror at Sun Hill is finally over.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Brian Kite===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Brian Kite\n| first      = The New Order of Things<br>(21 September 1987)\n| last       = Not Without Cause<br>(7 December 1987)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Simon Slater]]\n}}\n\n'''Inspector Brian Kite''' was an unpopular recruit to the Sun Hill ranks. He kept an eagle eye on his relief. He considered himself the modern face of policing: rule-bound, PACE-quoting, politically correct, making all the right moves. But really he was pedantic, officious and uncompassionate. No one was too upset when his stay at the station turned out to be for only a couple of months. During his time at Sun Hill he came under especially heavy criticism from DS Ted Roach.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Nick Klein===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Nick Klein\n| first      = Integrity \u2013 Part 1 (16 September 1999)\n| last       = Episode #206 (8 April 2004)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Ren\u00e9 Zagger]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Nick Klein''' had three or four years' experience in the job before transferring to Sun Hill from west London. He was already familiar with the area \u2013 partly because he's an East Ender himself, and partly because his off duty passion had led to him becoming fairly well established as a DJ at one of Sun Hill's local clubs. DJing was something he just about managed to fit in alongside his policing, mostly at weekends. Through his acquaintance with the club scene, Klein also met a girlfriend, who was the principal reason he asked for a transfer. Klein was a quick, likeable, clever officer \u2013 confident, versatile, naturally entrepreneurial, so he tended to play somewhat by his own rules. He had a good sense of humour, and a sharp East End wit \u2013 he was rarely stuck for a smart answer. In many ways Klein was simply a straight up East End lad, dealing in the odd bargain and happy on the odd Saturday afternoons when he could get to White Hart Lane with his mates. Klein was also essentially pragmatic \u2013 a relativist, who could usually see various sides to any argument. Alongside many of his colleagues he sometimes seemed to have a breezy, almost nonchalant attitude to his work. Perhaps this was because he'd done a fair amount before \u2013 e.g. travelling \u2013 and for him being a police officer was not a vocation or probably even a lifelong career. It was a different and challenging job for the time being: a chance to see things from the other side. Klein thought he had it all worked out in coming to Sun Hill \u2013 the girlfriend, the club, the DJing. He was rapidly involved in a tricky undercover operation to expose a racist officer at Barton Street however, as a result of which he lost his girlfriend and got a nasty scare when he was almost caught buying grass.  He moved back into the Section House for a while and then went and stayed at home with his parents. Unfortunately Klein's little forays into buying grass morphed themselves into a nasty crack habit. Supt. Okaro allowed him into the rehab programme and gave him the chance to rejoin the officers at Sun Hill \u2013 but it proved to be a while before he won back the complete trust of his colleagues. In the end Nick hung up his uniform when he became a vital witness to a shooting; he went deep into Witness Protection until criminal Dennis Weaver could be brought to justice.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Kirsty Knight===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Kirsty Knight\n| first      = Crossing The Line (18 February 2010)\n| last       = Respect \u2013 Part 2 (31 August 2010)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable \n| portrayer  = [[Sarah Manners]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Kirsty Knight''' arrived at Sun Hill in February 2010, as Sun Hill's ambitious New Area Car Driver.

His Sergeant, Craig Gilmore, was often rude towards him, claiming that he was only a special constable as he couldn't be bothered to do the work to be a proper police officer. While on duty, he stopped a woman for going through a red light, and she killed him after stabbing him in the neck with a steel comb when he was actually trying to get her phone number, so he could ask her on a date.

Duncan manages to combine an air of profound laziness with sudden bursts of enthusiasm If he senses the chance of a good arrest, he pursues a case with dogged determination. There is nothing he enjoys more than arresting a villain, and he thoroughly annoys his victims by treating them with immense affability. Thirty-nine years old, with twenty-one years' service behind him, Duncan can be irritatingly smug about his experience of the job, an inveterate tease and, when roused, witheringly accurate in his put-downs, but his ready wit wins him friends and allies in the station. He is not as impulsive as some and often acts as the middle-man preferring to see both sides of an argument. The chink in his armour is his wife, Shona, who he treats with a healthy degree of respect and secretly adores, until she has an affair and leaves him. Shona is a highflying career woman, working for one of the larger financial institutions, and it is her salary rather than Duncan's that pays for their Docklands Riverside apartment.

He was an instinctual officer, a decent man who understood human weakness because his home life was a happy, difficult, muddle-and-make-do existence. But no superintendent would ever dream of transferring him. He could smell a liar, and his clear-up rate was the best in CID. When Tosh arrived at Sun Hill in 1988 from a station in Essex he already had problems that weighed him down. He was in his late thirties, unlikely to be promoted because he never seemed to care that much about his career progress. He didn't look like a tough crime-buster. He stood at just 5 feet 7&nbsp;inches tall, was a little on the chubby side \u2013 probably because he was always munching snacks on the job. And he was, frankly, scruffy. He seemed to have one suit, one shirt, which he wore Monday to Friday, one tatty old raincoat. It all matched his car, an ancient Volvo which kept breaking down. More to the point, he had a wife, Muriel, too large a mortgage, caused by too many children \u2013 three girls and two boys \u2013 for a constable's pay. He was however a good officer - and always had a ready smile that went right up into his eyes. He was second to none when it came to solving cases, which was why the likes of Burnside were happy to overlook his sartorial shortcomings and to protect him from any flak from above. He reacted strongly when accused of lacking ambition: he did care about his work \u2013 but he also cared deeply about his family. He was once offered the chance to go work in Northern Ireland. Burnside had put him up for it because he thought Tosh needed the money. Tosh turned it down \u2013 it would have put him at risk and then where would his family have been? At one stage, to ease his money problems, Tosh took in a student lodger, which was against Met. rules. The young man got into trouble. Sergeant Penny, Custody Officer at the time, discovered this and, rather than turn a blind eye to it, sent a report 'upstairs' as a result of which Tosh was carpeted. He survived, of course.

He was quite bigoted in his views and preferred a firm policing style rather than the 'social worker' approach of his colleagues. Litten's eagerness was often misplaced and when he attempted to score Brownie points by taking information on a series of armed robberies directly to Galloway, he was reprimanded by both the DI and Bob Cryer. Eventually a successful board led to him being temporarily seconded to CID, whereupon he began lording it over his old mates in Uniform.

He was full of himself, confident that he could do anything the job required. At that time \u2013 when there was a recruitment drive on \u2013 to have the guts and the gift of the gab was more than enough. Loxton had more \u2013 brains, ambition and a soldier's toughness. Many of his colleagues soon thought of him as loathsome Loxton. He seemed to have no patience with people on the streets. Whether they were villains or victims, he seemed to think they had brought their troubles on themselves; they were probably to blame. If they happened to be black, they were certainly to blame. Loxton joined the Army when he first left school. He liked the structure, the discipline, feeling he was part of a group \u2013 get apart from ordinary people, a group with special powers. But the Army was claustrophobic. He left at the end of his contract to join the police where he felt he'd have the status but also the independence. His wife preferred it, too, although Loxton didn't talk about her. He was so tightly buttoned up about his private life, neither Tony Stamp nor Dave Quinnan nor any of the others who spent hours with him dared to ask. Loxton was not mad on macho heroic acts. When a suicidal man jumped into a river, he thought carefully about jumping in after him. He'd done that before and nearly drowned himself. Persistent and practical, Loxton worked hard and got results; that was why even Andrew Monroe had time for him. He took pride in being an excellent Area Car driver. He took pride in wearing the uniform, which was always clean and neat. His aim was to become a firearms officer, but after taking the Lippett's Hill course he changed his mind. Did he discover that he didn't, after all, have the killer instinct or did he reason that with a gun he would be asking to be put in dangerous situations \u2013 and only mugs do that. Loxton performed an illegal search of an off-duty black police officer, after which he was seriously reprimanded. Disillusioned with the job and the limits of modern-day policing, he left the force, not before fitting up a bent solicitor. Returning for Dave Quinnan's wedding in 1999, he admitted that in hindsight it was the worst mistake of his life.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Abe Lyttleton===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Abe Lyttleton\n| first      = Snouts and Red Herrings (11 November 1985)\n| last       = The Chief Superintendent's Party (10 February 1986)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = Ronnie Cush\n}}\n\n'''PC Abe Lyttleton''' came to Sun Hill in November 1985, being his third new posting in three and a half years. Senior officers attributed it to the difficulty of being a \"minority within a minority\" and indeed they were right \u2013 Lyttleton was Sun Hill's first black policeman and he had a lot of eyes on him. The relief were openly welcoming, but he was given a hard time by fellow newcomer Pete Muswell who believed the inclusion of ethnic minorities in the Met was a mistake, and promptly christened him 'Snowball'. Lyttleton rose above Muswell's repeated racist taunts and proved such a capable officer that he even won his tormentor's grudging respect. Lyttleton didn't last long at Sun Hill however, transferring only after a three-month stint. Abe suffered from [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], as revealed when he is forced to go onto a roof and arrest a man who is throwing tiles onto the street.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===General References===\n* {{cite book |title=The Bill: The Inside Story: Behind the Scenes of Britain's Top Police Drama |publisher=HarperCollins, London |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-00-257137-1 |author=Silver, Rachel}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221121351/http://www.thebillbios.co.uk/ The Bill Bios] \n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081222021629/http://www.thebill.co.uk/ The Bill Official Site] \n* {{cite book |title=The Bill: The Complete Lowdown on 20 Years at Sun Hill|publisher=ABC Books, Sydney |year=2003 |isbn=0-7333-1330-2 |author=Tibballs, Geoff}}\n\n{{The Bill}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List of The Bill characters (E-L)}}\n[[Category:Lists of The Bill characters|Characters E]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2013}}\n{{more citations needed|article|date=July 2014}}\n{{in-universe|article|date=July 2014}}\n}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Bill'' characters (E\u2013L)}}{{Use British English|date=March 2012}}\nThis is a '''list of characters''' from the [[police drama]] ''[[The Bill]]'' ordered alphabetically by character surname.

A quiet country boy who hailed from a poor farming family near [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], he sometimes struggled to adapt to city life. Edwards was extremely lazy, often thinking up ingenious ways to avoid having to do serious work \u2013 but he had an infectious charm and was popular amongst the relief. He would also wade in with the team when needed. Edwards is probably best remembered for when he got hopelessly drunk on his stag night and ended up stripped naked and abandoned in the street by his mates from Sun Hill \u2013 much to the annoyance of Mary, his Welsh bride-to-be. After brushes with pigs, chickens and assorted oddballs, he asked for a transfer back to Wales. His final day convinced him he had made the right decision: Brownlow did not seem to know who he was and Conway thought he had already left. In the end he decided to give his own leaving party a miss and headed home alone. He returned for Ken Melvin's funeral later that year. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==F==\n\n===Colin Fairfax===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Colin Fairfax\n| first      = Episode #278 (13 January 2005)\n| last       = Episode #291 (3 March 2005)\n| occupation = Police Community Support Officer\n| title      = Police Community Support Officer\n| portrayer  = Tim Steed\n}}\n\n'''PCSO Colin Fairfax''' arrived at Sun Hill along with another PCSO, Laura Bryant. Throughout his short time at Sun Hill, he showed to be a bigot and frequently had run ins with PC Leela Kapoor. His time at Sun Hill came to an end when after he spat in PC Kapoor's face whilst in the canteen and subsequently left the station. DC Ken Drummond was tasked with bringing him back into the station and found him drinking in a local pub. DC Drummond tried his best to persuade Fairfax to return but when he refused, DC Drummond went to arrest him. Fairfax retaliated by knocking DC Drummond unconscious and handcuffing him in a petrol-doused van and drove towards Sun Hill police station. Fairfax dived out of the van before it careered into the front of the police station; with Sgt. Smith and SRO Marilyn Chambers working inside. The following explosion and [[Episode 288 (The Bill)|fire]] killed two officers and a few days later; Fairfax was charged with the murders of DC Ken Drummond, PC Andrea Dunbar and SRO Marilyn Chambers.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Will Fletcher===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Will Fletcher\n| image      = \n| first      = Episode #371 (14 December 2005)\n| last       = Be a Man (7 January 2010)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Sergeant\n| portrayer  = [[Gary Lucy]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Will Fletcher''' grew up in [[Hemel Hempstead]] with his parents and sister. He was inspired to join the police by a friend of his father's, who was an Area Car driver in the police force and often told him about his work. Like most others at Sun Hill, he did his training at Hendon. It is not clear where he served his probationary period or indeed how long he has been in the force, but he previously served at Hemel Hempstead and he was later transferred to Sun Hill. He is a fan of cars and motorcycles\u2014on his first day he drove to work without his hands on the wheel as he tried to read a map\u2014in his spare time, he enjoys boxing. When he was injured, he was unable to compete in a boxing tournament with PC [[Dan Casper]], which was something Inspector [[Gina Gold]] set up. However, he stood in his friend's corner for every match and tried to convince Casper to tell Gold about his steroid abuse. He later began a relationship with PC Honey Harman, but they split up after he refused to go on holiday with her in [[Tenerife]]. Harman was later shot and killed after being held captive by drug barons. Fletcher was devastated initially, having been one of the first on the scene when Harman's body was discovered, but later came to terms with her death. He became close friends with Casper, and the two were frequently seen paired on the beat together until Dan resigned. Since then he was paired with PC [[Roger Valentine]], PC [[Benjamin Gayle]] and PC [[Tony Stamp]] among others. He showed strong feelings for colleague PC [[Emma Keane]] and was violently opposed to her marriage to lawyer Matt Hinckley. Despite being beaten up on Keane's wedding day after she revealed to Hinckley that she slept with Will and being able to prove that Hinckley was behind the attack, he turned up at the wedding to wish them well. Later, Fletcher helped Keane to uncover the truth about Hinckley's old girlfriend\u2014who supposedly died a few years earlier\u2014and found that she was actually alive and was only just recovering from a nervous break down after having a miscarriage. Fletcher transferred to CID in August 2008, after his police work impressed [[Neil Manson|DI Manson]]. He was the first uniformed officer to transfer to CID since DC [[Gary Best]]. In July 2009, Fletcher made the move from Trainee DC to a fully-fledged DC. Fletcher left Sun Hill in January 2010, when he transferred to another station as a Sergeant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Suzanne Ford===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Suzanne Ford\n| first      = Runaround (13 September 1988) first job at the police station\n| last       = The Wild Rover (12 March 1992)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = evie longstaff \n}}\n\n'''WPC Suzanne Ford''' was described as 'the ideal WPC'.{{by whom|date=February 2013}} She considered becoming a nurse before eventually joining the Metropolitan Police and saw her policing role as essentially one of serving the community rather than catching crooks. She was a natural police officer \u2013 'one of the boys' who always seemed to get sent out on raids \u2013 but above all a caring woman. She also had a special ability \u2013 sign language, as she had a profoundly deaf sister. She used this skill on one occasion when questioning a deaf suspect.

She had been assigned to an undercover investigation with Santini, culminating in him nearly raping her in the locker room. Subsequently, Santini spread lies about her around the station and conducted a campaign of bullying, forcing her to request a transfer away from Sun Hill.  Later promoted to Detective Sergeant, Rosie returned to Sun Hill to investigate the murder of Santini's ex-girlfriend Jessica Orton. She suspected Santini himself of the crime and eventually linked him to it when he was found in possession of the keys to Orton's house. She arrests him for murder. Rosie returned again for Santini's manslaughter trial, but was murdered in her hotel room before she could testify against him as part of the elimination of key witnesses by a major crime lord awaiting trial.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Robin Frank===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Robin Frank\n| first      = Funny Ol' Business \u2013 Cops And Robbers (16 October 1984)\n| last       = Traffic (11 July 1989)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Ashley Gunstock]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Robin Frank''' was a steady, reliable type, known for his commitment and integrity. From [[Bethnal Green]] in the East End, he was easy going, with a naturally friendly manner and ready smile. He was the son of a schoolteacher and worked in office jobs before joining the Met. Married to Angela, a nurse, Frank was a trained area car driver. Members of the public found him thoughtful and straightforward in his dealings, and the relief knew that he always could be depended on \u2013 even if he complained about the more mundane aspects of the job.  He suffered the trauma of being shot by a robber who had taken a woman hostage in a block of flats in 1985. Recuperating, Frank spent much of his time at the CAD desk and working as the station's crime prevention officer. He left Sun Hill in 1989.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Christine Frazer===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Christine Frazer\n| first      = Light Duties (19 July 1988)\n| last       = I Thought You'd Gone (11 January 1990)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Duty Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Barbara Thorn]]\n}}\n\n'''Inspector Christine Frazer''' served at Sun Hill for a year and a half, replacing Inspector Kite. She was the station's first senior female officer, and one of the very few high-ranking females in the Metropolitan Police at the time. Throughout her posting at Sun Hill, this caused much friction between the force, particularly with the young male PCs whom she often rubbed the wrong way, and eventually she unwittingly created a foe in Chief Inspector Derek Conway, whose initial respect and support for her waned considerably towards the end of her tenure.\n\nElsewhere in the station, she was held in high regard, particularly by Sergeants Alec Peters and Tom Penny, who also found her very attractive. Bob Cryer warmed to her eventually but occasionally found cause to criticise her performance, given her tendency to lean towards \"modern\" methods of policing, rather than Cryer's own tried and tested traditional means. She shared past history with DI Frank Burnside, who tried to rekindle romance when he was posted to Sun Hill (she was not interested), and was a target for DS Ted Roach's affections. Frazer refused a relationship but conceded to have a drink with Roach \u2013 gossip later turned this into a full-blown affair and Conway warned Roach to break it off or face immediate transfer. While initially having recommended him for promotion to D.I. in place of Burnside, wearing down a stubborn Conway, her working relationship with Roach suffered and on several subsequent occasions she came down heavily on him for poor choices in his work.\n\nShe was also perhaps the only officer at Sun Hill to have known of Burnside's true history in the force \u2013 most believed him bent over the years \u2013 before ousting his undercover involvement in Operation Countryman to gossiping Sergeants Cryer, Penny and Peters, thus explaining his apparent crooked ways. Burnside was particularly ungrateful afterwards.\n\nIn late 1989, Frazer became the first female inspector to take the Met's riot training course, and during the ensuing mayhem \"froze\" as her team came under heavy attack, exposing them to serious danger. She quickly overcame her fear and successfully completed the course, but couldn't stop the training supervisor from reporting her bungle to Chief Superintendent Brownlow. This, along with continued pressure on her to perform above and beyond to prove herself in the rank as a woman, culminated in a bad appraisal from Conway which ultimately Brownlow agreed with during a heated meeting, and he refused to recommend her for promotion. Instead he suggested she continue at Sun Hill for another year in her present rank. Frazer reluctantly refuses, instead taking extended leave to write a thesis about discrimination in the force, specifically sexism. She does not return to Sun Hill following this period and presumably resigns from the Met during her leave.\n\nDuring her first year on the show, Frazer was written as a \"main character\" and frequently top-billed in the credits (after Sgt. Cryer), with multiple storylines afforded to her. Her appearances were less involved through much of mid-late 1989 as the cast changed around her, however she was given considerably more screen time before her departure in early 1990.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Delia French===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Delia French\n| first      = Don't Like Mondays (25 July 1989)\n| last       = Acting Detective (26 March 1992)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Natasha Williams (actress)|Natasha Williams]]\n}}\n\n'''WPC Delia French''' was once in charge of the station typing pool, before leaving to take a clerical job in the city. She returned to Sun Hill in 1990 as a probationary WPC. Delia was a feisty addition to the ranks of Sun Hill \u2013 she had no qualms in berating members of CID for the poor quality of interview transcripts, and also was a bit of a gossip \u2013 taking great interest in the business affairs of every officer in the station. She could be tough when she wanted to, and was by no means a push-over. Delia also had a razor sharp wit and was not afraid to use it. But her infectious enthusiasm soon broke down barriers and made her friends in the station. Delia went undercover for Burnside on one occasion when a woman who collapsed at an airport was found carrying drugs in her stomach. She took the woman's place and successfully led CID to the dealer. She left Sun Hill shortly after the operation.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==G==\n\n===Roy Galloway===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Roy Galloway\n| first      = Woodentop (16 August 1983)\n| last       = Not Without Cause (7 December 1987)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Robert Pugh]] ''(Pilot)'' <br> [[John Salthouse]] \n}}\n\n'''DI Roy Galloway''' was proud of himself when he became one of the youngest inspectors in the [[Metropolitan Police]]. An impulsive man, he was a thief taker in the classic mould, always seeming to be playing a game of good old fashioned cops and robbers. Nobody is above suspicion for Galloway. Even when fencing information from one of his snouts, he always takes what they say with a grain of salt. Although he sometimes shows a wisdom of years beyond his own age, Galloway was also every bit as fiery as his red-coloured hair suggests. When frustrated, he would not hesitate to take those frustrations out on colleagues. This placed him in many tricky situations with his immediate subordinate, DS [[Ted Roach]], who wanted Galloway's job. At one point, [[June Ackland]] considers resigning after Galloway blames her for his own troubles. Only the timely intervention of Sergeant [[Bob Cryer (The Bill)|Bob Cryer]] stops the situation from escalating out of control. He is married, with one daughter. The pressures of his job lead to him spending less and less time with them, however. Eventually he goes through a bitter divorce, which he takes hard. Characteristically, this only leads to him throwing himself even further into his work. Over time, he mellows to the point where he is even willing to step in defence of Cryer after he accidentally runs into a pensioner in a car during a wet, night-time call out. The two men share a strong long-time bond, but rarely has Galloway been so proactive in helping his uniform colleagues. After three years in [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]], Galloway decides to leave. The exact reasons for his departure are kept vague and confidential, but it comes as a shock to some and a relief to others.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===George Garfield===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = George Garfield\n| first      = Only a Little Bit of Thieving (2 May 1989)\n| last       = The Big Day \u2013 Part 2 (16 December 1999)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Huw Higginson]]\n}}\n\n'''PC George Garfield''' joined the Met at nineteen because it was steady employment and he'd not had much luck with other jobs he'd tried since leaving school. But he didn't much like the leafy suburb of Teddington, to which he was sent \u2013 too dull \u2013 and used his excess energy in the boxing ring. He reached ABA quarter finals standard. After repeated requests for a posting to a busier manor, he was transferred to Sun Hill early in 1989. He got on with most of the people there. Tony Stamp was a good friend. He had run-ins with the likes of Steve Loxton, who could be a bit aggressive if rubbed up the wrong way. Unlike them, Garfield could control his temper, although occasionally he could be something of a bull in a china shop, charging in wildly before he had properly thought out the repercussions of his actions. He could also bear a grudge with the best of them. But as the relief's Federation rep. George was a steady, reliable type, known for his loyalty and integrity. He took pride in his work and his best quality was his commitment to colleagues. He tried hard to never let anybody down, by acting as a trouble shooter for the team \u2013 and served well in the role as he always had his colleague's best interests at heart. But, like so many others, he had been taken under the wing of Bob Cryer more than once. He had money troubles before the night of the party for his twenty-fifth birthday, but they got worse after it. He'd hired a room only to have Quinnan and Jim Carver wreck it by fighting over a girl. Garfield had to pay for the repairs, which meant he had to return his flash XR3 convertible car that he'd just started buying on installments, against the advice of his bank manager. Lending the key of his section-house room to Loxton \u2013 who was spotted nipping up the stairs with a nurse, against the rules \u2013 was another black mark against his name. But his colleagues were on his side when Matthew Boyden let him down \u2013 nipping off to see one of his women friends and leaving him to be beaten up by the villain they were supposed to be trailing. Garfield was knocked down and concussed. There were bets on if and when Garfield might get his own back. They were safe bets. Boyden learned about Garfield's right hook \u2013 the hard way. Over the years, young women seemed to be immune to the Garfield charm. There was some chance he was getting something together with a WPC whom he invited for a pizza, then there was that journalist from the Sun Hill Chronicle. In the end, George's love life proved to be the end for his stint at Sun Hill. A rather messy love triangle involving himself, Dave Quinnan and a nurse, Jenny Delaney, ensured George was not at Sun Hill station for much longer. He left the force on a voyage of self-discovery, briefly returning a couple of months later to settle his differences with Dave at his wedding.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Benjamin Gayle===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Benjamin Gayle\n| first      = Cracking Under Pressure (27 September 2007)\n| last       = Respect \u2013 Part 2 (31 August 2010)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Micah Balfour]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Benjamin Gayle''' arrived at Sun Hill in September 2007. On his first day in the job, he was cornered in a woodland by three gang members \u2013 but fought them all off, even giving one of them a broken collar bone. Ben was known for often having an uneven temper. He once broke a man's nose because he didn't like the way that the man treated his son. This almost lost him his job as a result. Ben later had a professional relationship with Sally, but their relationship ended when Sally got drunk and smashed her car into the side of a parked vehicle.

Arun saw this as his chance to put things right, though things didn't always go to plan, given his fiery temper and high enthusiasm.<!-- this is unclear -->\n\nArun was committed and dedicated to the job, wanting to put right any wrongs for everybody, however small they may be \u2013 adamant that he helped to make the streets safer. He did have a tendency to think a bit too highly and took himself too seriously at times, frequently speaking before thinking through what the consequences could be, but still managed to come across as sincere, with a certain amount of naive charm. As dedicated as he was, his maverick streak meant he can be unpredictable and not always straight down the line \u2013 it all depends what the end result was. Arun was suspended from duty by Dale Smith after attempting to help an illegal immigrant escape detection with her son.

Whereas Cryer is modest, experienced and respected, Gilmore has been fast-tracked to promotion, has been a sergeant for less than a year and is considered by his colleagues to be arrogant. He is the first openly gay sergeant in the show's history.

He comes to Sun Hill after meeting Liz Rawton in a training course and was persuaded to join her in CID. His [[Afro]] hairstyle made his presence distinctive. Glaze passed his Sergeants exams and was Acting DS for a short time before becoming a DC again. Glaze later gets caught up in the scandal surrounding Des Taviner, when he finds out that Des planted evidence in accused murderer Jeff Simpson's residence. He reluctantly covers for him because he knew Simpson was guilty, but later his conscience begins getting the better of him. Simpson claims he was set up and former Sun Hill officer Detective Inspector Sally Johnson investigates the case.

Gina already knew Superintendent Okaro at the time, because they were old flames in the 80s. When Okaro left due to promotion to Borough Commander, he and Gina still remained very good friends. Gina was known for her 'iron fist' \u2013 mainly due to the fact she loved boxing in her spare time, which led PC [[Emma Keane]] wrongfully to make a bullying allegation against her. Consequently, she left on leave, but soon returned. Gina worked closely with Sergeant [[Dale Smith (The Bill)|Dale Smith]], who was one of her closest friends at the station and was one of the only ones who she told about having cancer. From her arrival, she soon earned the respect of the relief but still didn't fear mincing her words. One of her first big actions during her time at Sun Hill occurred in December 2002. Whilst out one evening at linedancing, Gina ran into a fight between two boys; one of the lads was Tommy Renolds. When she took Tommy home she realised that she used to be friends with his mum Beverly at school and her older cousin Marilyn. It transpired that Marilyn had contributed to Gina's brother being convicted of murder. He committed suicide in prison and Gina blamed Marilyn for his death. It ended in a dramatic show-down where Marilyn ended up being shot dead, not before having a dig at Gina's infertility.\n\nOn Gina's departure, she and Smith shared an emotional moment when, after saying that she would be missed, he said, \"Goodnight, Ma'am\".

Green reveals that on a previous occasion she had accidentally sprayed herself by spraying a CS can backwards. She is more successful later on in using her CS spray, this time to stop a fleeing suspect. Although Green gets on well with some of her colleagues, particularly PC [[Dan Casper]], who is impressed by her attention to detail and her memory, there are still a few who have doubts about their latest recruit. Keane draws attention to her girlish appearance and nicknames her 'Little Miss Daisy Chain'. PC Will Fletcher is irritated that Green is attracted to him. In one instance, she is hit on the head with a bottle by an escaped convict and knocked out. She is also hit with a rake, knocking her unconscious, and left tied up in a hospital cupboard by escaped murderer Larry Franks. In another instance, she is almost sprayed in the face with acid. Green later goes undercover to aid [[List of The Bill characters (M\u2013P)#Terry_Perkins|Terry Perkins]]'s investigation of a notorious loan shark. Green's cover is Terry's drug addicted daughter seeking money to pay back her dealer. Green later reveals to PC Tony Stamp that she has applied for a job in witness protection. Before she can say anything else the two officers spot a woman called Molly Anderson standing on the edge of a bridge. As Green tries to talk her down, Mel and Nate Roberts arrive. When Anderson jumps into the water, Roberts dives in after her. After a stressful day Green heads back to the station and finds a letter from [[witness protection]]. She is accepted for Witness Protection and leaves at the end of the day.  \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Alistair Greig===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Alistair Greig\n| first      = Getting It Right (3 January 1989)\n| last       = Cooking (28 July 1998)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Sergeant\n| portrayer  = [[Andrew Mackintosh]]\n}}\n\n'''DS Alistair Greig''' joined Sun Hill CID after a stint in the Vice Squad. He was a member of the Metropolitan Police band, playing the [[clarinet]] and was initially of a breezy disposition. A few months of working for [[Frank Burnside|Burnside]] knocked this early chirpiness out of him and though he became outwardly stoical, Alistair retained a sharp, dry sense of humour. An intellectual and prone to being a little aloof, Greig was generally recognised and respected as a hardworking and dedicated detective, but remained peripheral to the CID \"family\".  There was a sense that he preferred to keep even those colleagues with whom he was on good terms at arm's length. He certainly had little time for the frivolous, the self-serving and the outright rule breakers \u2013 that went for both fellow officers and criminals. Greig was put in charge of implementing the Met's anti-burglary initiative, Bumblebee, at Sun Hill, leading a team which included [[Dave Quinnan]] and [[Suzi Croft]]. Unlike most of CID, Greig offered Suzi thoughtful guidance, particularly through the early part of her career and there were occasional hints that Alistair was quite protective of Croft. Despite appearances, Greig was ambitious and it rankled that he was passed over for DI on more than one occasion. He considered a move away from Sun Hill after DCI Meadows chose [[Chris Deakin|Deakin]] to replace [[List_of_The_Bill_characters_(E\u2013L)#Sally_Johnson|Sally Johnson]]. However, Meadows dissuaded him from doing so, giving his assurance that Greig was a valued officer and was next in line. In hindsight, perhaps Greig should have followed his initial instincts. Like [[Jim Carver]], he found himself a victim of the controversial tenure policy in place at the time. He appealed but was unsuccessful. A plea by Meadows to Brownlow also failed. Rather than take what he saw as a pointless, and humiliating option to go back into uniform, Greig transferred to another station.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==H==\n\n===Vicky Hagen===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Vicky Hagen\n| first      = Big Brother (7 May 1998)\n| last       = Sacrifice (26 October 2001)\n| occupation = Policewoman\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Samantha Robson]]\n}}\n\n'''WPC Vicky Hagen''' arrived at Sun Hill under a cloud, having been labelled a \"grass\" by a mate of PC Jarvis for reporting a colleague who had assaulted a prisoner. She transferred from a station in Essex because of the affair and was keen to get a fresh start at the station. It was there where she qualified as an area car driver. She was tough, straightforward and took no nonsense. Vicky made it very clear that being Sun Hill's first female area car driver did not overawe her. Sex was simply not an issue \u2013 she'd work and fit in equally happily with men or women. Since she was attractive, feminine and above all funny \u2013 and quite able to drink the boys under the table \u2013 she eventually fitted in despite earlier reservations, although her abrasive approach occasionally alienated colleagues. Vicky could often make strong judgements on other people though, particularly women \u2013 not because she felt threatened \u2013 but because she wanted them to behave like she did. A thinly disguised man-eater, Hagen fell for the dubious charms of Eddie Santini before moving on to Matt Boyden. When it became clear that Boyden put his troubled daughter before her, Hagen finally demonstrated signs of vulnerability. On the rebound, she picked up a guy for a one-night stand, only for him to commit suicide in the bath. This was the final straw for Vicky, who decided in the circumstances to leave the Met and request a transfer to one of the county forces.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Harry Haines===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Harry Haines\n| first      = Bad Reaction (10 September 1993)\n| last       = Nothing Ventured (31 December 1993)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Gary Whelan]]\n}}\n\n'''DI Harry Haines''' was forcibly transferred to Sun Hill from the Drugs Squad after Burnside's abrupt departure. Built like a prop forward, as befitted a former member of the Divisional rugby team, his easy manner and ironic sense of humour could not disguise the fact that he was a cunning operator and as hard as iron. The move back to divisional CID angered Haines, and the team knew that it wouldn't be long before he tried to get back on the Squad. Indeed, after just three months, interference from Meadows over the discovery of an LSD factory made him choose to leave Sun Hill and return there. He was later seconded to the station in January 1995 to help Meadows track down a consignment of lethal heroin. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Lewis Hardy===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Lewis Hardy\n| first       = Wrong Place, Wrong Time (11 January 2006)      \n| last        = Death Or Glory (19 July 2007) \n| portrayer   = [[Aml Ameen]] \n| occupation  = Police Officer\n| title       = Police Constable \n| relatives   = Dominic Hardy (Cousin)\n}}\n\n'''PC Lewis Hardy''' started at [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] with fellow PC [[Emma Keane]], who had a privileged upbringing. Lewis was a working class black lad who had spent most of his teenage life on the streets with a small gang in Hackney. Lewis was arrested numerous times, finally, for a drug offence of which he was innocent. He was taken under the wing of one of the officers who supported and inspired him to join the Metropolitan Police Force. Lewis was smart with sharp wit who was encouraged by his teachers to go to University. After realising the amount of debt he would get into, he decided to apply to [[Hendon Police College|Hendon]] with the support of the officer from his local station. Lewis may not have always seen eye to eye with some of the older members of the relief, but his personality always shone through. It was difficult to hold a grudge against him. He left [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] after a harrowing but successful undercover operation infiltrating the Sken Man Massive gang of which his cousin, Dominic was a member. Whilst in hospital after being shot he was offered a transfer to [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]] which he quickly snapped up.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sam Harker===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Sam Harker\n| first      = Things That Go Bump in the Night (30 December 1997)\n| last       = Episode #010 (18 April 2002)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Matthew Crompton]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Sam Harker''' served at [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] for five years. A no-nonsense officer, he transferred to Sun Hill from Heathrow police because he wanted to broaden his experience with a spell at an East End [[police station|nick]]. Harker relished his job. He always knew what he would do with his life, coming from a long line of policemen \u2013 his father was a police officer in [[Liverpool]], as was his elder brother. As far as he was concerned, it beat working for a living! He was easy going, with a naturally friendly manner and a ready smile and was not easily fazed. Members of the public found him thoughtful and straightforward in his dealings, and locally he became a popular and respected uniform beat bobby. He also had the sense to leave the troubles of policing at work with his uniform at the end of the shift, and found it easy to relax with his mates and a beer. Tragically, Sam died in hospital after being critically injured in an explosion at Sun Hill after race riots got out of hand.

She always excelled in sport at school but did rather poorly in academic studies. As a young adult, she worked as a [[fitness instructor]] and [[personal trainer]]. She eventually became bored with working in [[gyms]] and decided that she wanted to help people and also to work in a physically demanding job, so she joined the [[police]]. Honey was kind-hearted and always wanted to see the best in people; she also believed strongly in first impressions. Although she may not have been the most academically gifted officer the station has seen, her instinct and physical ability never let her down. A [[vegetarian]] who declared her body to be a temple, Honey was physically fearless and never doubted her own abilities. She was willing to put herself in dangerous situations because she knew that she was capable of, at least physically, dealing with anything. Her [[judo]] skills came in more than handy when she got herself into sticky situations whilst chasing suspects. Paperwork was another story \u2013 she hated it with a passion and would do anything to avoid the mounting pile on her desk. Having no awareness of her own attractiveness, Honey was perhaps initially unintentionally inappropriate with some of the men on the relief. Her love life was never plain sailing; Honey split from her [[Association football|footballer]] [[fianc\u00e9]] Fletch after she discovered he was cheating on her. In April 2005, she married Scott Burnett, who unknown to her, had murdered his wife Karen, whose case was under investigation. Scott took Honey to an isolated seaside cottage in Kent. In conversation, it slips out that he killed his wife. He removes the battery from his phone so the police can't track him down but Honey secretly puts it back in. Discovering this, he realised that she betrayed him and the police would be there soon. He stormed out and disappeared beneath the waves. Honey rushed after him and managed to resuscitate him but he was facing a life in jail without the woman he loved\u2014he wished she had not bothered. Scott later hanged himself in prison. Following her kidnapping by a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] drugs gang, Honey attempted to arrest drugs dealer Kristen Shaw, 'for kidnapping a police officer and accessory to murder'. In the ensuing struggle, a gun was accidentally let off, fatally wounding Honey. After Honey died, a shocked Kristen said to her bent policeman boyfriend, [[Zain Nadir]], ''\"I...I didn't mean to \u2013 she's dead, and it's all my fault, but she was trying to take you away from me...\"''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Donna Harris===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Donna Harris\n| first      = Discretion (19 November 1991)\n| last       = Confession (27 February 1996)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Louise Harrison]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Donna Harris''' was one of the most pleasant, straightforward young women to have worked at Sun Hill. Born in Yorkshire, she left her family and friends and came to London to join the Met when she was twenty-one. She wanted to do a worthwhile job. She also wanted to make a clean break from sad memories; her husband had been killed in a car crash there. She married again six years later, this time to a man many years older with a daughter from his first marriage. It was the security she wanted, and in the next year she transferred to Sun Hill to become Collator, hoping the regular hours would mean she'd have more time with her family. It did, and the family grew: she gave birth to their son, now a toddler. Because she had a happy home life and knew she was efficient at her job, Donna didn't have to take flak from her male colleagues. Any 'Be a good girl and...' routines earned quick put-downs. In 1994, she became the analyst for the burglary initiative, Bumblebee. She started it up at Sun Hill, and the work entailed her visiting other police stations. Donna left Sun Hill in 1996, her job as collator becoming redundant with the rise of computerised policing.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Lorna Hart===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Lorna Hart\n| first      = Inner Demons (24 May 2007)\n| last       = Moving Target \u2013 Part 3 (28 November 2007)\n| occupation = Police Civilian Staff\n| title      = Crime Scene Examiner \n| portrayer  = [[Siobhan Redmond]]\n}}\n\n'''CSE Lorna Hart''' joined Sun Hill as a crime scene examiner in May 2007.

He was born and raised in the Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove area of West London and had pounded the beats in some of the more volatile of the Met's Divisions, including a posting at Brixton during the Summer of '81. Haynes was street-smart and energetic; this combined with his enthusiastic nature made him a highly-effective officer. He also had a dark sense of humour. Frazer told Haynes that he had the potential to go for sergeant but he wondered whether it would simply be an empty gesture as part of the Met's black recruitment drive.

One of life's easy achievers, he gained a cluster of GCSEs at school, and scored top grades in four 'A' Levels without really trying. University places were offered, but Ben took a gap year \u2013 which turned into two \u2013 and immersed himself in a zesty lifestyle of music and clubbing. Ben was unusual at Sun Hill in having a liberal, middle-class background. He breezed through training at Hendon, excelling in academic and behavioural studies \u2013 but he was also put on Section 15 for attitude. Undoubtedly bright, his downside was that he showed little interest in the more mundane aspects of police work \u2013 and this was sometimes perceived as laziness. Whilst he was certainly intelligent, Ben could sometimes display an amazing lack of common sense. Always ready to argue a point, he often had frequent run-ins on insubordination and discipline. He had a zero tolerance attitude towards drugs of any kind, following his sister's death from taking ecstasy. Some viewed his anti-drugs opinions as 'obsessive' and his colleagues sometimes became annoyed with Ben's general 'boy-scout' approach to policing, but any comments were tinged with affection.

In 2006, Heaton he had an affair with DAC Georgia Hobbs, but ended the relationship when he found out that DAC Hobbs had pushed to get Sun Hill closed as she had promised the land to a developer. After taping a conversation where she admitted her role to Heaton, he turned both her and the evidence over to the [[Directorate of Professional Standards]]. Heaton also had an affair with Mickey Webb's girlfriend Mia Perry during this time. In 2007, John's old enemy and former colleague in the police, Ray Moore, a gangster and club owner, arrives in Sun Hill from Manchester. Knowing how ruthless Moore can be, Heaton sends Rhiannon and Charlie to Bristol for safety. In 2009, John reaches the toughest point of his career when he discovers that a man he sent down for murder 20 years ago was innocent, and that he let a serial killer go undetected. While Sun Hill's finest struggle to keep faith in the boss that they thought was invincible, John must rebuild his confidence \u2013 and his reputation. He is determined to right the wrongs, win back the respect of his colleagues and ensure that justice is finally served. John Heaton was DC [[Grace Dasari]]'s DCI at her previous job, and knew PC [[Diane Noble]] previously, through her ex-husband.

Many of the younger male CID officers thought that she was a bit of a swot, earning her the nickname of 'Sherlock', but she was too confident to ever really let the jibes get to her and wasn't slow in coming up with a quick riposte. Kerry also possessed a mischievous streak, asking questions of her senior officers that others wouldn't dare to and then playing the innocent. Rawton was someone who Kerry felt she could go to for information about Sun Hill and the two usually got on fine. But she could also annoy Rawton at times by choosing to ignore her advice on investigation matters and handling colleagues. Where Rawton never allowed her gender to be an issue, Kerry occasionally played the coquette, using her good looks and pleasant manner to charm men in and out of the department; on occasion, this led to friction between the two. She was however a breath of fresh air to the stuffy and very male Sun Hill CID. After the suspension of Sun Hill's CID following Don Beech's corruption, Kerry decided to leave the station, infuriated by CIB's investigation into her conduct.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Michelle Hughes===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Michelle Hughes\n| image      = \n| first      = To Have and To Hold (26 June 1993)\n| last       = TBA\n| occupation = [[Police Officer]]\n| title      = [[Police Constable]]\n| portrayer  = Gail Abbott\n}}\n\n'''WPC Michelle Hughes''' first arrived at the station in 1993 as a probationer, but served at Sun Hill for over three years.

Phil later developed a rivalry with DS [[Stuart Turner (The Bill)|Stuart Turner]], both for results at work and for [[Samantha Nixon|Sam Nixon]]'s affections. During his time at Sun Hill, Phil travelled to [[Romania]] with fellow DS [[Samantha Nixon|Sam Nixon]], where they began a secret relationship, sleeping together in a backstreet B&B and getting shot at in a drive-by shooting.

In fact, any chance he gets, Phil tries to get Steve transferred out of the station. Steve is na\u00efve and likeable, yet slightly awkward and a dreamer. He clearly idolises his brother, but when he realises that he can't meet Phil's high expectations of him, he decides to transfer to Derby.

They were waiting to see how close to Inspector Cato, also from Barton Street, he turned out to be. They didn't have to wait long. Jarvis put as much distance between himself and his unpopular boss as he could. It became clear that he did not approve of some of the older man's methods. It also became clear, as the months went by, that he was unimpressed by some of his colleagues, too. He found Loxton's approach sometimes unprofessional; he seemed not to trust Matthew Boyden; but he got on well with Dave Quinnan and George Garfield. He looked down, in both senses of the words, on some of the women. But there may have been a spark of something for Polly Page although she didn't know it. Jarvis could be bad-tempered, but he was a valuable member of the team \u2013 he was used to fitting in quickly. He did this through a consciously positive outlook on life, which could be undermined by exasperation and flashes of temper. Despite this, he had a well-meaning, good-natured attitude to the job, which could make him seem rather earnest. Popular with his colleagues, he was sometimes irritated that they weren't as straight as he was. A trained Area car driver, Jarvis developed into a reliable and conscientious officer during his time at the station. And good in the police rugby team, too. And long legs could be useful when the only way on to one tower-block balcony is from another tower-block balcony. With Jarvis it was 'Just step this way'. Jarvis went on attachment to the Diplomatic Protection Group for several weeks in 1998, before transferring there permanently later that year. He clashed immediately with new PC Vicky Hagen upon his departure, as she had 'blown the whistle' on a friend of his who had assaulted a prisoner at their station in Essex. When it was revealed that the prisoner was a 14-year-old boy, Jarvis changed his stance and parted on good terms with his colleague.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Amber Johannsen===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Amber Johannsen\n| first      = Episode #264 (1 December 2004)\n| last       = Episode #377 (29 December 2005)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Myfanwy Waring]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Amber Johannsen''' was feisty - but she was neither gutsy nor focused. She was born into a lower-class family but had her sights on the high life; she was looking for a provider. In the mean time, being a police officer offered a stable income, good holidays and \u2013 best of all \u2013 an opportunity to take advantage of her role in society \u2013 oh; and there was a great uniform too. She decided to join the police after briefly dating a police officer. Amber's roots were very modest; her father was a taxi driver and her mum a beauty therapist. Beneath the happy smile, Amber was manipulative and self-obsessed. She liked to get what she wanted and didn't care who she hurt in the process. In many ways, the designer labels she wore showed her determination to get a better life for herself \u2013 and get as far as possible from her working-class background. Until she achieved her goal in society, Amber amused herself by toying with the likes of Steve Hunter. The two things that excited her most were shopping and sex and she was practically addicted to both. She was beautiful and knew it, taking every opportunity to flirt and break hearts \u2013 with [[bisexuality|both men and women]]. Amber wanted the finer things in life and everyone at the station knew that as soon as she found a man to fund it, she'd ditch her uniform quicker than she could manage to read a criminal their rights. This attitude certainly didn't endear her to her colleagues, some of whom made no secret of their dislike for her. Inspector Gold eventually tired of her questionable commitment to the job and prompted her resignation from the force. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sally Johnson===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Sally Johnson\n| first      = Second Sight (6 January 1994)\n| last       = Episode #159 (22 October 2003)\n| occupation = Police Officer \n| title      = Detective Inspector \n| portrayer  = [[Jaye Griffiths]]\n}}\n\n'''DI Sally Johnson''' believed she was God's gift to policing, and she may have turned out to be just that if her interpretation of means-to-an-end had tallied with the Met's. You could never have accused her of lacking in self-belief. Having risen through the ranks at an alarming pace to become a DS at Stafford Row, she was ready to tackle whatever another promotion and Sun Hill could throw at her by way of racist, sexist remarks. If she couldn't deal with it, she wouldn't have got where she was. Johnson had always been aware that her colour and education were an advantage within the force, and that they had led to her promotion in the climate of positive discrimination rather than on her real ability to do the job. This didn't mean that she was incompetent, but like a lot of the fast track promotions, she lacked a lot of basic ground experience. She put in the hours and got her hands dirty, but always found it difficult to accept that she was in charge now, and not one of the lads. And if there was an inner core of loneliness beneath the ambitious exterior, she took care to keep it hidden. Johnson grew up in London, and it was soon clear to her West Indian family that she had brains. They were somewhat surprised when after university she chose to use them in the police force, but she rose through the ranks very quickly and loved going to work, loved being in control of others and, above all, loved catching thieves. Johnson charged along the corridors with her subordinates trying to keep up. Her easy manner won her friends and took the starch out of some of the senior officers. But on occasions her know-it-all air could be irritating. The word 'delegate' was not in her vocabulary \u2013 she enjoyed the work on the streets and in the interview room too much for that. She may not have shown great wisdom in the detectives she had chosen to favour \u2013 making Pearce her pet at the start was perhaps a mistake, and she'd been clumsy in her treatment of Ackland, whose years of experience she undervalued. Johnson's unshakeable faith in her own abilities irritated a number of more experienced officers at the station and her confidence took a long overdue knock when she was subjected to a private prosecution for manslaughter following the raid of a crack dealer's house. Up till then she had been completely comfortable with her power. From then on she had moments of doubt. As her methods came under increasing scrutiny, it was clear that her days at Sun Hill were numbered \u2013 and when she was offered a desk job attachment monitoring overtime, she realised she had no choice but to take it.  Johnson eventually left the Met. to become a private investigator. She returned to Sun Hill in 2003 to investigate claims of a fit up in the Simpson murder case. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==K==\n\n===Brandon Kane===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Brandon Kane\n| first      = Episode #022 (2 July 2002)  \n| last       = Episode #184 (15 January 2004)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Detective Constable\n| spouse     = Tanya Kane <br> (deceased)\n| children   = Zoe Kane (daughter) <br> Jordan Kane <br> (son)\n| portrayer  = [[Pal Aron]]\n}}\n\n'''DC Brandon Kane''' came from a small Asian Leicester family. He was not a practising Hindu and although his parents were, they were fairly liberal about his decision to leave his faith at home. Only his vegetarianism gave away any sign of a religious background. Brandon grew up in a happy atmosphere with his older sister Mira whom he adored, eventually following in her footsteps by training to be an accountant where he met his ex-wife, Tanya, with whom he had 2 children. When their marriage began to crumble, he took time to consider his options in life. After the divorce he decided to give up his job to go into the police service. It was not exactly a 'calling' for Brandon \u2013 it just seemed a natural step to take. Somewhat to his surprise he was good at the profession, and began to enjoy the lifestyle it brought him.  Kane spent three years as a PC at another station, and had been noticed early on by the CID officers where he was based as a bright, meticulous officer, with the potential to be a very good detective. This coupled with a twinkle in the eye and a sense of humour as dry as the Sahara desert, made him a very popular. Brandon hated to be idle \u2013 he always wanted to be up and off doing something; and when he was forced to remain in one place he seemed restless. When he made mistakes in the station and out on a case they tended to stem from his impulsive nature that occasionally made him speak before thinking and act before determining the consequences. After a spell in Sun Hill's Community Safety Unit as a TDC, Brandon transferred to CID as a full-fledged DC following his completion of the trainee investigator course. Brandon was a very friendly man, however there were those who he did not get on with, particularly [[DS Debbie McAllister]], whose guts he absolutely hated. This stemmed from when Tanya died, and Debbie pounced on Brandon as prime suspect in her tragic fall. Brandon almost came close to hitting Debbie and argued with her violently, telling her that \"we both know you're hanging on in CID by your fingertips\" and accused her of trying to score brownie points with [[DCI Jack Meadows]]. He told her she was disgusting and that she made him sick. However, Debbie fought back, saying as Tanya's ex-husband he had no rights and she had every right to gain access to Tanya. However, she knew she'd lost the battle. Brandon's final days at Sun Hill were spent in turmoil. After being taken hostage by PC Cathy Bradford he realised the people he wanted to protect most were his children. True to his genuine good nature, Brandon left the force to be with them.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Leela Kapoor===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Leela Kapoor\n| first      = Episode #268 (15 December 2004)\n| last       = Dead and Buried (26 September 2007)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Seema Bowri]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Leela Kapoor''' had been in the Metropolitan Police for seven years before coming to Sun Hill. She may have been spiky and defensive, but she was also warm with a wicked sense of humour. She served her probation at Barton Street, and prior to joining Sun Hill, saw two of her colleagues assaulting a witness. Leela being Leela, at the forefront of justice and wanting to do the right thing, reported her peers. Life subsequently became rather difficult for her as she was seen as a grass, so she opted for a transfer to another nick. Leela was second generation British Hindu; at home she spoke Hindi but also had Punjabi and Urdu under her belt. Although Leela's home life was happy, she was exposed to the bigotry of society at an early age. Whilst she was fairly protected from racism by her family and circle of friends, her personal circumstances meant she experienced prejudice of a different kind, when her uncle, a high-profile businessman, was accused of embezzlement. Leela's family had to fight a long, public, legal battle to clear her uncle's and the family's name. The Police's handling of the case, and some officer's ignorance when dealing with her family, all contributed to Leela's decision to become a police officer. Leela was not for wearing her ethnicity on her forehead \u2013 she just got on with it and celebrated the fact that she was different. One thing she couldn't stand, however, was being used as a token ethnic officer in the PC initiatives being pedalled by management. Leela was never one to take the easy option, out to prove she could do whatever she put her mind to. She was uncompromising and had a strong moral code, but could at times be quite guarded. If you were fortunate enough or cared enough to get to know the real Leela, you found a warm, caring, and sensitive woman. However, Leela was a tough nut to crack and she had a tendency to withdraw into herself if she felt vulnerable. For this, people perceived her to be difficult and cold, unless they were prepared to dig a little deeper. Leela left Sun Hill after receiving an offer to transfer to the Foreign Office. Little did she know that the position had been orchestrated by Sgt. Stone, who had tired of Leela playing everything by the book in her position as station's Fed Rep, and wanted shot of her.               \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Debbie Keane===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Debbie Keane\n| first       = New Moves (7 March 1995) \n| last        = Taking Sides (22 September 1998) \n| portrayer   = [[Andrea Mason (actress)|Andrea Mason]] \n| occupation  = Police Officer\n| title       = Police Sergeant\n}}\n\n'''PC Debbie Keane''' joined Sun Hill from Hendon along with classmate Nick Slater but soon emerged as the more promising of the two. She had tried a number of different jobs, including Leisure Centre Assistant and Outward Bound Instructor, but until becoming a police officer, nothing had really satisfied her. Debbie was attractive, fit, vivacious and not a complainer. She met any challenge with vigour and enthusiasm. Not afraid to assert herself physically, she could also hold her own in a scrap. Debbie's cheery manner could be infectious and she was definitely somebody you'd want on your side. Her attitude marked her out as a natural leader, but needing to be tempered by experience. Confident and ambitious, Debbie was encouraged by her senior officers to try for her sergeant's exams \u2013 she'd certainly found her niche in the Met.

Emma came across as smart and fun-loving. After graduating from University, Emma trained at Hendon for five weeks before being posted to Sun Hill, and completed her training there, recently graduating from her probationary period. After being involved in an incident where a fellow policeman was killed, Emma was convinced that Inspector Gina Gold was bullying her. She made a false complaint but it was not until they worked together on a rape case that she realised Gina was not really bullying her and withdrawed the complaint. Unfortunately, she goes to see the superintendent and he tells her his hands are tied on the matter but the complaint was later withdrawn. While dating CPS solicitor [[Matt Hinckley]], Emma had a one-night stand with Will Fletcher, Emma later agreed to marry Matt out of guilt for cheating on him. However, the night before her wedding, she opened up to Matt and told him about the brief affair. Matt got his friends to beat up Will but during the course of the next day Will punched Matt and they agree not to press charges against each other. Emma and Matt get married and both go back at work after their honeymoon. Shortly after the wedding, Matt reveals that he wants to start a family with Emma fairly soon but she does not feel ready. Later, when Emma finds out that Matt lied to her about his ex-girlfriend being dead, she confronts him with evidence that she is still alive. The two have an argument and Matt attempts to strangle her. She hit him on the head with a Vodka bottle, which is just within reach. Matt later claimed that Emma tried to kill him but was arrested, following an investigation into the incident. After the incident, Emma grew closer to Will. Emma was killed when she attempted to evacuate a building she suspected was threatened by a terrorist attack. In the absence of her sergeant, [[Callum Stone]], Emma was forced to attempt the evacuation alone, until a bomb went off with Emma inside. When Stone arrived, he attempted frantically to revive the PC, but to no avail. Stone is racked with guilt at Emma's death, and that he may have been able to do something about it, had he been where he should have.

He also throws [[Zain Nadir]] off the case after he tries to interfere with a witness in order to secure Smithy's release.

Caring and compassionate, her generous heart was easily touched by a hard-luck story, which sometimes led to other officers accusing her of being too soft on criminals. But her instinctive perception and sympathy meant she could communicate easily with people from all walks of life. An active sportswoman, she was not afraid to be disliked and pull rank in order to get the best performance from those around her.

On the outside, Gabriel appeared to be a respectable police officer, but he was just as quick to exploit trust as he was to gain it. Before joining the [[Metropolitan Police]], Gabriel spent sixteen years in the [[Royal Navy]]. He was not highly regarded by other sailors and was thought of as a bully with a short temper. He later joined the Met to get revenge on Sgt [[June Ackland]] for one reason and one reason only; June had given birth to a boy and put the baby up for adoption. Gabriel's parents adopted June's son and gave him all the praise, making their own son extremely bitter and jealous. Gabriel arrived at Sun Hill under his brother's ID to seek revenge on June, but the mode of his insanity grew and grew as he demolished people and his colleagues when he committed crimes of [[fraud]], [[perjury]], conspiracy to [[pervert the course of justice]], [[rape]], [[murder]] and conspiracy to murder. Throughout his time at Sun Hill, Gabriel evolved from a bullying [[bigot]] into a [[serial killer]].\n\nGabriel first appeared as a stranger who frightened away a mugger from off-duty Sergeant June Ackland before he joined Sun Hill. When he arrived at Sun Hill, he brought a mature aged attitude to the force; he was keen to do good and enforce the law. In the beginning he worked mostly by the book, but soon the power went to his head. His first victim was PC Ruby Buxton who resigned from the force when Kent bullied her into lying on the stand at a court appearance. Inspector [[Gina Gold]] was immediately aware of his actions and kept a watchful eye over him after the incident. So greatly annoyed at his superior was Kent that he turned to blackmail when he discovered that she had been caught over the legal alcohol limit and used this to force her hand. After enacting actions of a mental proportion he turned to the physical side of things when involved in the marriage of DC [[Jim Carver]] to Marie Graham. Called out to a disturbance at their home, Gabriel took control of the situation by hitting Jim over the head with a vodka bottle. Both Jim and Marie subsequently ended up in hospital with confusion reigning on what had actually occurred. However, Marie reported seeing Gabriel hit Jim with the bottle. But the clever Gabriel was able to clear his name of her allegation, although Gina was not at all convinced by his side of the story. Gabriel then moved on to June by playing on her insecurities and then seducing her. The two began a relationship, which they kept to themselves. However, Gina had done some digging into Gabriel's background and discovered his birth certificate, showing that his birth name was Robert Ackland \u2013 the son June had given up for adoption. But DC Carver later found the birth certificate and showed it to June. Shocked and horrified that she had committed incest, June confronted Gabriel and he admitted that he was her son. However, he then repented and revealed to June that her real son was in fact his adoptive brother after she told him that his son's birth had been the result of a rape when June was only a teenager and that their relationship was all part of his revenge plan. Shocked and furious, June threatened to tell the whole relief the truth, but Kent convinced her to remain quiet by giving her the chance to meet her real son. PC Kent's secret was again kept behind closed doors.\n\nGabriel continued his menacing ways by using unorthodox methods to stop criminals, exerting physical violence and fabricating evidence. He was assigned as the community officer for the Cole Lane Estate for a period of time where he continued to issue his own brand of justice. He violently assaulted a [[paedophile]] and hired thugs to beat up a [[loan shark]] to punish them for terrorising the residents and their crimes. But things really began to get out of hand when he had two teenage boys beaten up as punishment for robbing an elderly woman. After this incident, his behaviour was reported by [[Laura Bryant]], a Cole Lane resident at the time but he was able to clear his name of her complaint and was removed from his role. For many months, [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] was terrorised by a serial [[sniper]] who targeted criminals. During this reign of terror, four victims were shot dead by the mysterious gunman \u2013 Lee Sandford, one of the teenage residents on the Cole Lane Estate who Gabriel had beaten up, Malcolm Willard who had sexually abused DC [[List of The Bill characters (M\u2013P)#Terry_Perkins|Terry Perkins]], his brother Ben when they were children and Christopher Spinks, a local drug dealer and PC Kerry Young, after she uncovered the truth about Gabriel being corrupt. There were suspicions that Gabriel was the sniper, but Gabriel appeared to be cleared when he was almost shot by the sniper himself when dealing with a suspect. It turned out that the sniper was Jason Hardy, an ex-[[Navy]] friend of Kent's and that Kent himself was a conspirer to the three murders the sniper had carried out. Gabriel held many grievances against criminals in the community and supplied the names of the three victims to Hardy and it was Hardy who pulled the trigger. When the net began to close in on Hardy and officers arrived to arrest him, Kent was one step ahead of them and threw Hardy from his high-rise balcony to protect his secret. However, PC [[Steve Hunter]] witnessed this but Gabriel convinced him that he was trying to hold onto Hardy to prevent him falling, when in fact he had let go of his hand deliberately. But despite Gabriel being proved innocent, his colleagues grew more and more suspicious over his actions and question marks remained over his behaviour.\n\nFor sometime, Gabriel had been obsessed with his colleague PC [[Kerry Young]]. When Kerry slept with Sergeant [[Dale Smith (The Bill)|Dale Smith]], who was secretly in love with her, after a heavy drinking session, Gabriel twisted the situation out of his hatred for the Sergeant by cruelly tricking Kerry into accusing Smithy of [[date-rape]], persuading her to make an official allegation and then spread the news around the whole relief. Kerry, however, withdrew the accusation after realising that Smithy was incapable of rape. After the failure of the rape allegation against Smithy, Gabriel developed a sick interest in Kerry and tried to get close to her. He even kissed her while on duty, but Kerry pushed him away as she was seeing PC [[Cameron Tait]] at the time. But Gabriel convinced himself that she was deliberately 'leading him on' and making him think that they could have had a relationship. And when Kerry agreed to marry Cameron, Gabriel wrongfully accused her of 'pushing him too far' and 'winding him up' and took out all his anger and jealousy on her by violently raping her. Shocked and traumatised by the vicious attack, Kerry confided in Cameron but Gabriel taunted that Kerry slept with him willingly and was just the girl who cried rape when she was unfaithful, for he knew that no one would believe her after her previous cry of rape. Kerry was distraught when Cameron didn't believe her and ended their relationship. Knowing she couldn't report him, Gabriel mentally taunted Kerry and played sick mind games with her, before later admitting to Cameron that he did indeed rape her. Cameron convinced Kerry to report the rape, but Gabriel blackmailed her for neglecting her duty during an armed robbery at a bank and threatened to end her career if she reported the rape. He then played his last sick game with Kerry by deliberately goading Cameron into assaulting him in the station canteen. Cameron's career was put on the line after his attack on Gabriel and he left Sun Hill the next day and returned to Australia. Kerry went completely off the rails when she couldn't tell the truth, but she warned Gabriel that the battle was far from over and swore that she would find a way to destroy him like he destroyed her.\n\nKerry eventually found comfort in Smithy among others when he declared his undying love for her. Finally, her chance to put Gabriel behind bars came when she discovered his true identity from June Ackland, after she tried to tell June about the rape. Kerry vowed to reveal the truth to the rest of the officers but just after she declared her undying love for Smithy, Gabriel used Hardy's sniper rifle to shoot Kerry dead in the arms of her utterly devoted boyfriend outside the station from a nearby rooftop to stop her from exposing him. Gabriel stood victorious as Kerry could no longer expose him, but his cruel victory did not remain glorious for long because he then regretted killing her after he discovered that as a result of the vicious rape, she was pregnant with his unborn child. After acting extremely inappropriately at Kerry's funeral, Gabriel pushed a devastated Smithy too far with his attitude towards Kerry's death that Smithy flipped out at him and attacked him during the rest. Seizing an opportunity to cover his tracks as a rapist and a murderer and to get one over Smithy out of his hatred for the Sergeant and his cruel jealousy of Kerry's love for him, Gabriel announced to the whole relief that Kerry was pregnant with his son when she died and manipulated them into believing that he and Kerry had been secretly dating in her last months of life. Everyone believed him, but were confused at the same time as they never knew about it. Gabriel, however, convinced them that he and Kerry wanted to keep their 'relationship' quiet and told them that they both meant everything to each other, making himself look like he was the love of Kerry's life. Luckily however, a grief-stricken and angry Smithy, Kerry's real boyfriend and the real love of her life, was not as easily fooled as everyone else for he knew that none of Gabriel's stories about Kerry made any sense whatsoever. Although Gabriel almost had him convinced at first, everything finally began to add up when Smithy discovered that Kerry had claimed that Gabriel raped her before she died. However, he still didn't know what to believe until Kerry's grieving father George came to the station to collect Kerry's belongings and to meet Smithy. But unfortunately, Gabriel interceded and told George about Kerry's pregnancy and their secret 'relationship'. But that didn't stop George from telling Smithy what Kerry felt for him and that she called him her 'knight in shining armour'. Gabriel, however, overheard the conversation and once again pushed Smithy too far with all his lies when he told their colleagues that Kerry called him her 'knight in shining armour'. Furious and realising that what Kerry said was indeed true, Smithy reported the rape allegation to the [[Murder Investigation Team]]. Out of all his love for his girlfriend, Smithy swore to expose Gabriel as a rapist and avenge Kerry's death.\n\nA fellow officer PC [[Andrea Dunbar (The Bill)|Andrea Dunbar]] worked alongside Sergeant Smith to expose Gabriel for his crimes, for it was Andrea who Kerry confided in about her rape in Gabriel's hands the day before her death and informed Smithy. Despite the fact that MIT couldn't pin Kerry's rape on Gabriel, Andrea kept digging more into his background after the death of the sniper when she figured that Gabriel was somehow connected to him and the murders of his three victims. Gabriel, however, became suspicious that Andrea was onto him after seeing her talking to PCSO Laura Bryant about his actions on the Cole Lane Estate and threatened her if she didn't back away. Despite the threat, Andrea continued her investigation and finally found the evidence that she and Smithy needed to put Gabriel away. However, Andrea was then exposed as an undercover journalist and Smithy refused to listen to her because of the nature of her deception. But when Andrea convinced him that they had evidence against Gabriel, Smithy agreed to let her collect it from her [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeonhole]]. The evidence that Andrea obtained was a newspaper article from Gabriel's days in the Navy and a photograph of him and Hardy, proving his true identity. However, Gabriel caught her with the article, held her hostage in a store room and admitted all of his crimes when Andrea pieced all the pieces of the jigsaw together.\n\nAfter some convincing from Andrea, he appeared repentant and ready to give himself up until disaster struck at Sun Hill; misguided PCSO Colin Fairfax drove a petrol-laden van through the reception of Sun Hill station, which was followed by a huge explosion. Minutes later, Gabriel seized his opportunity for a second chance, rose from the ashes and left Andrea to perish in the resulting fire with all the evidence she had against him. Gabriel was then hailed by his colleagues, who were all unaware that he had deliberately left Andrea in the fire, as the hero by winning brownie points when he rescued Smithy from the burning station. Smithy, however, was not at all grateful for Gabriel saving his life as his hatred for the PC was just too strong, for he still believed Kerry's rape allegation against him and even believed that he was involved in her murder. Not to mention Andrea telling him that Gabriel was working alongside Jason Hardy and that she had the evidence to prove it. When Andrea's body was later recovered from under a pile of rubble, Gabriel believed he had finally gotten away with all his cruel crimes and seized his opportunity to put them all behind him and make a fresh start.\n\nAfter the fire, Gabriel appeared to be a changed man, keeping himself out of trouble and performing good police work. However, he wasn't a changed man for long when he held off the temptation to begin a relationship with PC [[Sheelagh Murphy]]. Instead, he chose to seek solace in prostitutes but after regaining trust in his colleagues, he became selfish once again by dating Sheelagh while still having a prostitute girlfriend. It was a bumpy relationship, but even when June warned Sheelagh off about Gabriel, Smithy drunkenly revealed to her that Kerry said he raped her and Gabriel himself told her that he pushed the sniper to his death, Sheelagh was never swayed. Despite the rocky nature of the relationship, the two later became engaged. After successfully killing Kerry, Andrea and the sniper, everything seemed to be going well for Gabriel. But several months after the fire, his chances of getting away with everything he had done were once again put at risk. On the day of Sun Hill Police Station's 50th anniversary, Gabriel's world started to collapse when an unexpected visitor came to the station asking to see June Ackland \u2013 his brother, the real Gabriel Kent who had returned to Sun Hill from the US for good. Gabriel tried to convince his colleagues that the man claiming to be Gabriel Kent was an insane person he had come across before who had stolen his identity. Immediately after the real Gabriel was shot and fell off a balcony during a siege at Sun Hill station, Gabriel visited him in hospital and threatened him to keep quiet about his identity. Luckily however, PC Laura Bryant told Sergeant Smith that the man shot during the siege had arrived at the station asking for June and saying that his name was Gabriel Kent. Smithy began to put more pieces of the puzzle together when he told Laura that June had a son she gave up for adoption called Gabriel Kent and that he thought Robert Ackland's birth certificate belonged to PC Gabriel Kent. Smithy and Laura went to June and Laura told her that the gunshot victim said his name was Gabriel Kent. When Smithy told June that he knew she had a son, June told them that the man they had been working with for the past two years was not her son and not Gabriel Kent.\n\nWhen Smithy brought June to the hospital, she recognised her son immediately and identified him as the real Gabriel Kent. June then explained to Smithy how she had her son when she was sixteen following a rape and was forced to give him up by her parents. She then revealed that PC Gabriel Kent was really David Kent, her son's adoptive brother. June explained that David had stolen his brother's identity to work in the Force and get revenge on her because he blamed her for all the errors in his life after his parents adopted her son. June insisted on telling Superintendent [[Adam Okaro]] about her son and PC Kent's true identity, but Smithy persuaded not to as she could have lost her job over keeping it secret for so long. Smithy then confided in June about Kerry's rape allegation against Gabriel and was devastated when it was finally confirmed as true when June told him that Kerry had come to see her before she died and had tried to tell her something but was unable to. Gabriel was worried that his chances were at risk and asked Sheelagh to move away and leave the country with him. Sheelagh really considered Gabriel's idea and told Laura. Horrified, Laura revealed Gabriel's secret to Sheelagh and begged her not to leave with him. Suspicious and stunned by Laura's revelation, Sheelagh went through Gabriel's packed suitcase and found his brother's ID card and mobile phone, only to be caught by him. Gabriel confessed to Sheelagh that he was really David Kent, but swore that he loved her and that they could still get away together. Sheelagh tried to escape, but Gabriel caught her, beat her and tied her up. Laura and PC [[Tony Stamp]] later found her and rescued her. Gabriel then made his way to the hospital to try to kill the real Gabriel by turning off his life support machine and suffocating him with a pillow. As he thought his brother was dead, he left. Luckily, PC Steve Hunter reached the real Gabriel just in time and the doctors successfully resuscitated him.\n\nBut the fake Gabriel knew his time was running out when he saw Smithy arrive with a raid of uniform officers as he and June investigated a disturbance in a block of flats. Knowing that he had been exposed and Smithy had arrived to arrest him, Gabriel snapped at June once again; he dragged her up to the rooftop, vented all his remaining anger on her, handcuffed her to the railing, blamed his troubles on her and confessed to all of his evil crimes. Luckily, Smithy climbed up to where they were in time to save June and overheard Gabriel's confessions. And when Gabriel confessed to the rape and murder of Smithy's beloved girlfriend Kerry, Smithy flew into a rage, charged at Gabriel and the two men had an aggressive fist-fight but before Smithy could arrest him, Gabriel overpowered him and knocked him out unconscious. Realising that his time was finally up, the evil David Kent made one last decision and threw himself off the rooftop to his death to avoid spending the rest of his life in prison, his reign of terror at Sun Hill is finally over.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Brian Kite===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Brian Kite\n| first      = The New Order of Things<br>(21 September 1987)\n| last       = Not Without Cause<br>(7 December 1987)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Inspector\n| portrayer  = [[Simon Slater]]\n}}\n\n'''Inspector Brian Kite''' was an unpopular recruit to the Sun Hill ranks. He kept an eagle eye on his relief. He considered himself the modern face of policing: rule-bound, PACE-quoting, politically correct, making all the right moves. But really he was pedantic, officious and uncompassionate. No one was too upset when his stay at the station turned out to be for only a couple of months. During his time at Sun Hill he came under especially heavy criticism from DS Ted Roach.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Nick Klein===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Nick Klein\n| first      = Integrity \u2013 Part 1 (16 September 1999)\n| last       = Episode #206 (8 April 2004)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable\n| portrayer  = [[Ren\u00e9 Zagger]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Nick Klein''' had three or four years' experience in the job before transferring to Sun Hill from west London. He was already familiar with the area \u2013 partly because he's an East Ender himself, and partly because his off duty passion had led to him becoming fairly well established as a DJ at one of Sun Hill's local clubs. DJ-ing was something he just about managed to fit in alongside his policing, mostly at weekends. Through his acquaintance with the club scene, Klein also met a girlfriend, who was the principal reason he asked for a transfer. Klein was a quick, likeable, clever officer \u2013 confident, versatile, naturally entrepreneurial, so he tended to play somewhat by his own rules. He had a good sense of humour, and a sharp East End wit \u2013 he was rarely stuck for a smart answer. In many ways Klein was simply a straight up East End lad, dealing in the odd bargain and happy on the odd Saturday afternoons when he could get to White Hart Lane with his mates. Klein was also essentially pragmatic \u2013 a relativist, who could usually see various sides to any argument. Alongside many of his colleagues he sometimes seemed to have a breezy, almost nonchalant attitude to his work. Perhaps this was because he'd done a fair amount before \u2013 e.g. travelling \u2013 and for him being a police officer was not a vocation or probably even a lifelong career. It was a different and challenging job for the time being: a chance to see things from the other side. Klein thought he had it all worked out in coming to Sun Hill \u2013 the girlfriend, the club, the DJ-ing. He was rapidly involved in a tricky undercover operation to expose a racist officer at Barton Street however, as a result of which he lost his girlfriend and got a nasty scare when he was almost caught buying grass.  He moved back into the Section House for a while and then went and stayed at home with his parents. Unfortunately Klein's little forays into buying grass morphed themselves into a nasty crack habit. Supt. Okaro allowed him into the rehab programme and gave him the chance to rejoin the officers at Sun Hill \u2013 but it proved to be a while before he won back the complete trust of his colleagues. In the end Nick hung up his uniform when he became a vital witness to a shooting; he went deep into Witness Protection until criminal Dennis Weaver could be brought to justice.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Kirsty Knight===\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Kirsty Knight\n| first      = Crossing The Line (18 February 2010)\n| last       = Respect \u2013 Part 2 (31 August 2010)\n| occupation = Police Officer\n| title      = Police Constable \n| portrayer  = [[Sarah Manners]]\n}}\n\n'''PC Kirsty Knight''' arrived at Sun Hill in February 2010, as Sun Hill's ambitious New Area Car Driver. She was hand-picked from a group of recruits by Sergeant Jo Masters. Kirsty arrived at a bad time, when the [[morale]] amongst her colleagues was low due to the suspension of [[Callum Stone]]. Kirsty attempted to defend Callum's suspension, but this only landed her in more trouble that she really needed.

He served as a volunteer special constable for only three weeks. In his short time at Sun Hill, Terry became good friends with Des Taviner and fell out with Tony Stamp, who he famously called Moany Tony. His Sergeant, Craig Gilmore, was often rude towards him, claiming that he was only a special constable as he couldn't be bothered to do the work to be a proper police officer. While on duty, he stopped a woman for going through a red light, and she killed him after stabbing him in the neck with a steel comb when he was actually trying to get her phone number, so he could ask her on a date. After his death, according to local newspapers, he had split from his wife, Dani, with whom he had one son.

Marion was a quiet sort of person, and was not known for being as active in the station as her successors, Robbie Cryer, Marilyn Chambers and Julian Tavell.

A bulky Glaswegian with an ironic sense of humour, he quickly makes his presence felt, particularly with the women in the station, whom he treats with a combination of appreciative chivalry and old-fashioned sexism. Duncan manages to combine an air of profound laziness with sudden bursts of enthusiasm If he senses the chance of a good arrest, he pursues a case with dogged determination. There is nothing he enjoys more than arresting a villain, and he thoroughly annoys his victims by treating them with immense affability. Thirty-nine years old, with twenty-one years' service behind him, Duncan can be irritatingly smug about his experience of the job, an inveterate tease and, when roused, witheringly accurate in his put-downs, but his ready wit wins him friends and allies in the station. He is not as impulsive as some and often acts as the middle-man preferring to see both sides of an argument. The chink in his armour is his wife, Shona, who he treats with a healthy degree of respect and secretly adores, until she has an affair and leaves him. Shona is a highflying career woman, working for one of the larger financial institutions, and it is her salary rather than Duncan's that pays for their Docklands Riverside apartment. When Shona says jump, Duncan's only question is how high, a fact that his colleagues come to understand when they realise that it is her job that dictated the move to Sun Hill. Duncan is beginning a life on his own and slowly beginning to realise that he is up for standing on his own two feet.

He was an instinctual officer, a decent man who understood human weakness because his home life was a happy, difficult, muddle-and-make-do existence. But no superintendent would ever dream of transferring him. He could smell a liar, and his clear-up rate was the best in CID. When Tosh arrived at Sun Hill in 1988 from a station in Essex he already had problems that weighed him down. He was in his late thirties, unlikely to be promoted because he never seemed to care that much about his career progress. He didn't look like a tough crime-buster. He stood at just 5 feet 7&nbsp;inches tall, was a little on the chubby side \u2013 probably because he was always munching snacks on the job. And he was, frankly, scruffy. He seemed to have one suit, one shirt, which he wore Monday to Friday, one tatty old raincoat. It all matched his car, an ancient Volvo which kept breaking down. More to the point, he had a wife, Muriel, too large a mortgage, caused by too many children \u2013 three girls and two boys \u2013 for a constable's pay. He was however a good officer - and always had a ready smile that went right up into his eyes. He was second to none when it came to solving cases, which was why the likes of Burnside were happy to overlook his sartorial shortcomings and to protect him from any flak from above. He reacted strongly when accused of lacking ambition: he did care about his work \u2013 but he also cared deeply about his family. He was once offered the chance to go work in Northern Ireland. Burnside had put him up for it because he thought Tosh needed the money. Tosh turned it down \u2013 it would have put him at risk and then where would his family have been? At one stage, to ease his money problems, Tosh took in a student lodger, which was against Met. rules. The young man got into trouble. Sergeant Penny, Custody Officer at the time, discovered this and, rather than turn a blind eye to it, sent a report 'upstairs' as a result of which Tosh was carpeted. He survived, of course. He was far too good at sniffing out villains for a sniffy little man like Penny to put down.

He was quite bigoted in his views and preferred a firm policing style rather than the 'social worker' approach of his colleagues. Litten's eagerness was often misplaced and when he attempted to score Brownie points by taking information on a series of armed robberies directly to Galloway, he was reprimanded by both the DI and Bob Cryer. Eventually a successful board led to him being temporarily seconded to CID, whereupon he began lording it over his old mates in Uniform. There was a vague spark of romantic interest between Litten and June Ackland, although it was never clear whether anything happened between them.

He was full of himself, confident that he could do anything the job required. At that time \u2013 when there was a recruitment drive on \u2013 to have the guts and the gift of the gab was more than enough. Loxton had more \u2013 brains, ambition and a soldier's toughness. Many of his colleagues soon thought of him as loathsome Loxton. He seemed to have no patience with people on the streets. Whether they were villains or victims, he seemed to think they had brought their troubles on themselves; they were probably to blame. If they happened to be black, they were certainly to blame. Loxton joined the Army when he first left school. He liked the structure, the discipline, feeling he was part of a group \u2013 get apart from ordinary people, a group with special powers. But the Army was claustrophobic. He left at the end of his contract to join the police where he felt he'd have the status but also the independence. His wife preferred it, too, although Loxton didn't talk about her. He was so tightly buttoned up about his private life, neither Tony Stamp nor Dave Quinnan nor any of the others who spent hours with him dared to ask. Loxton was not mad on macho heroic acts. When a suicidal man jumped into a river, he thought carefully about jumping in after him. He'd done that before and nearly drowned himself. Persistent and practical, Loxton worked hard and got results; that was why even Andrew Monroe had time for him. He took pride in being an excellent Area Car driver. He took pride in wearing the uniform, which was always clean and neat. His aim was to become a firearms officer, but after taking the Lippett's Hill course he changed his mind. Did he discover that he didn't, after all, have the killer instinct or did he reason that with a gun he would be asking to be put in dangerous situations \u2013 and only mugs do that. Loxton performed an illegal search of an off-duty black police officer, after which he was seriously reprimanded. Disillusioned with the job and the limits of modern-day policing, he left the force, not before fitting up a bent solicitor.

The relief were openly welcoming, but he was given a hard time by fellow newcomer Pete Muswell who believed the inclusion of ethnic minorities in the Met was a mistake, and promptly christened him 'Snowball'. Lyttleton rose above Muswell's repeated racist taunts and proved such a capable officer that he even won his tormentor's grudging respect.
