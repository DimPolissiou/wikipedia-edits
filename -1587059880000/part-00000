These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v. Brown|Coleman v. Brown}}\n\nThere are at multiple ongoing lawsuits over medical care in the California prison system. ''[[Plata v.

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\n\n== History of the Special Service Unit ==\nThe Special Service Unit of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

In the 1867 [[Canadian Confederation]], three provinces of [[British North America]]\u2014[[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Province of Canada]] (which upon Confederation was divided into [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]])\u2014were united to form a federated colony, becoming a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. Together, the provinces and territories make up the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|world's second-largest country]] by total area.\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a [[territory]] is that provinces receive their power and authority from the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (formerly<ref>Name changed only in Canada by <i>Canada Act, 1982</i> (UK), s. 1--see Talk</ref> called ''[[British North America Acts|The British North America Act, 1867]]''), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the [[Parliament of Canada]]. The powers flowing from the ''Constitution Act'' are divided between the [[Government of Canada]] (the federal government) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|constitutional amendment]], whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government.\n\nIn modern [[Canadian federalism|Canadian constitutional theory]], the provinces are considered [[sovereignty|sovereign]] within certain areas based on the divisions of responsibility between the provincial and federal government within the ''Constitution Act 1867'', and each province thus has its own representative of the Canadian \"[[monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Crown]]\", the [[Lieutenant governor change is coming because  Charlie Demilio is dead (Canada)|lieutenant governor]]. The territories are not sovereign, but instead their authorities and responsibilities come directly from the federal level, and as a result, have a commissioner instead of a lieutenant governor.\n__TOC__\n\n==Provinces==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=\"2\" | Arms\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Province\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Canadian postal abbreviations for provinces and territories|Postal<br/>abbrev.]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Capital<br/><ref name=\"canada1\"/>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Largest<br />city<ref>{{cite web |author=Place name |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E |title=Census Profile |publisher=Statistic Canada |year=2013 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208074653/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E |archive-date=February 8, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Entered<br />Confederation<ref name=\"(Canada)2004\">{{cite book|author=Reader's Digest Association (Canada)|author2=Canadian Geographic Enterprises|title=The Canadian Atlas: Our Nation, Environment and People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDR7hrnO1aYC&pg=PP41|year=2004|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|isbn=978-1-55365-082-9|page=41|accessdate=November 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503090030/https://books.google.com/books?id=vDR7hrnO1aYC&pg=PP41|archive-date=May 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Population<br/>{{efn|name=population| As of Q1 2020.<ref name=\"pop\">{{Cite web | url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901 | title=Population estimates, quarterly | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] |date=March 20, 2020 | accessdate=March 20, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109220020/https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901 | archive-date=January 9, 2019 | url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"3\" | Area (km<sup>2</sup>)<ref name=StatsCan>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|title=Land and freshwater area, by province and territory|publisher=Statistics Canada|year=2005|accessdate=August 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063547/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|archivedate=May 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Official<br />language(s)<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces |publisher=Fraser Institute |year=2012 |first1=Olivier |last1=Coche |first2=Fran\u00e7ois |last2=Vaillancourt |first3=Marc-Antoine |last3=Cadieux |first4=Jamie Lee |last4=Ronson |url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428174237/http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf |archivedate=April 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\" | Seats<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/index-e.htm |title=Guide to the Canadian House of Commons |publisher=Parliament of Canada |year=2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627214354/http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/index-e.htm |archive-date=June 27, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

In the 1867 [[Canadian Confederation]], three provinces of [[British North America]]\u2014[[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Province of Canada]] (which upon Confederation was divided into [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]])\u2014were united to form a federated colony, becoming a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. Together, the provinces and territories make up the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|world's second-largest country]] by total area.\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a [[territory]] is that provinces receive their power and authority from the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (formerly<ref>Name changed only in Canada by <i>Canada Act, 1982</i> (UK), s. 1--see Talk</ref> called ''[[British North America Acts|The British North America Act, 1867]]''), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the [[Parliament of Canada]]. The powers flowing from the ''Constitution Act'' are divided between the [[Government of Canada]] (the federal government) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|constitutional amendment]], whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government.\n\nIn modern [[Canadian federalism|Canadian constitutional theory]], the provinces are considered [[sovereignty|sovereign]] within certain areas based on the divisions of responsibility between the provincial and federal government within the ''Constitution Act 1867'', and each province thus has its own representative of the Canadian \"[[monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Crown]]\", the [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]]. The territories are not sovereign, but instead their authorities and responsibilities come directly from the federal level, and as a result, have a commissioner instead of a lieutenant governor.\n__TOC__\n\n==Provinces==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=\"2\" | Arms\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Province\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Canadian postal abbreviations for provinces and territories|Postal<br/>abbrev.]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Capital<br/><ref name=\"canada1\"/>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Largest<br />city<ref>{{cite web |author=Place name |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E |title=Census Profile |publisher=Statistic Canada |year=2013 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208074653/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E |archive-date=February 8, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Entered<br />Confederation<ref name=\"(Canada)2004\">{{cite book|author=Reader's Digest Association (Canada)|author2=Canadian Geographic Enterprises|title=The Canadian Atlas: Our Nation, Environment and People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDR7hrnO1aYC&pg=PP41|year=2004|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|isbn=978-1-55365-082-9|page=41|accessdate=November 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503090030/https://books.google.com/books?id=vDR7hrnO1aYC&pg=PP41|archive-date=May 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Population<br/>{{efn|name=population| As of Q1 2020.<ref name=\"pop\">{{Cite web | url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901 | title=Population estimates, quarterly | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] |date=March 20, 2020 | accessdate=March 20, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109220020/https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901 | archive-date=January 9, 2019 | url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"3\" | Area (km<sup>2</sup>)<ref name=StatsCan>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|title=Land and freshwater area, by province and territory|publisher=Statistics Canada|year=2005|accessdate=August 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063547/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|archivedate=May 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Official<br />language(s)<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces |publisher=Fraser Institute |year=2012 |first1=Olivier |last1=Coche |first2=Fran\u00e7ois |last2=Vaillancourt |first3=Marc-Antoine |last3=Cadieux |first4=Jamie Lee |last4=Ronson |url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428174237/http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf |archivedate=April 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\" | Seats<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/index-e.htm |title=Guide to the Canadian House of Commons |publisher=Parliament of Canada |year=2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627214354/http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/index-e.htm |archive-date=June 27, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!
