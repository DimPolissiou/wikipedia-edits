She is at first rude and cruel to Sarah, but she grudgingly mellows over time. Later in the series, she leaves for Sydney to live with her daughter Carolyn, and to become a better person.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Brett Climo]] as Elizabeth's son, George Bligh, a good-hearted man who takes Sarah under his protection and gradually falls in love with her. He is Elaine's widower; at the beginning of the series, he appears to be father to James and Anna; eventually it emerges that Anna is actually a secret child of his sister Carolyn and their friend Jack, taken in by George and Elaine to spare Carolyn any scandal. His worst flaw may be his trust in people who seek to take advantage of him.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Craig Hall (actor)|Craig Hall]] as Jack Duncan, the secret past lover of Carolyn, who now faces many challenges in his work as a doctor in a hospital run by the Bligh family.

He marries Olivia, but is tormented by the realisation that he is gay, and tries to commit suicide. He later feels betrayed when his wife has an affair, but returns to Ash Park to live for his young son.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood]] as Olivia Bligh, James' wife, a newlywed from England at the start of the series. She develops anger toward James for his indifference to her desperate need for affection, but does try to come to terms with his \"condition\".<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Abby Earl]] as Anna Bligh, the secret child of Carolyn and Jack, who was raised believing she was daughter of George and Elaine. Anna marries a local farmer, Gino, after rebelling against the Bligh family. The marriage faces difficulties, however, when Gino goes into debt, and his attempts to expand the farm fail.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Frankie J.

Much like her secret daughter Anna, Carolyn was the rebel child of her generation. For a long time, she gave up on her relationship with the Bligh family, and has had little contact for years. Once her secret is revealed, she is reunited with her long-separated daughter Anna and they develop an even closer relationship than before. Later on Carolyn works for Sir Richard Bennett, encountering new problems.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Tim Draxl]] as Doctor Henry Fox (regular: season 3\u20136), the doctor who helps to save George's life after he is shot.

Although she means well, her gossiping ways can sometimes make her seem rude and intrusive. Sarah dislikes her at first, but as time goes on, finds her helpful as someone who always knows who has done what in the village.\n* [[Dominic Allburn]] as Harry Polson (regular: season 1; recurring: season 4; regular: season 6), Amy Polson's gay brother. He has a brief romantic involvement with James, but when much of the village learns of Harry's true nature, he leaves Inverness for a new life elsewhere. Later, when he returns after having been severely beaten, Sarah helps him to settle back into a more stable life at Inverness.\n* [[Aaron Pederson]] as Frank Griggs, an Aboriginal man, broken by the effects of war and racism. He paints watercolours and is discovered by Carolyn who encourages him to show his work. Frank and Jack bond over shared military experience. Early in their friendship, Jack remarks that \u201ca bullet can\u2019t tell the colour of your skin. We all took the same risks.\u201d Both men learn to trust each other and begin to break free of their self-imposes prisons.\n\n=== Main departed cast ===\n* Aldo Mignone as Gino Poletti (seasons 1\u20134), the young, handsome Italian farmer who has set Anna's heart on fire. He has a real passion for farming and trying to please everybody, but his ambitious business decisions are not very successful.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Jenni Baird]] as Regina Standish (season 1\u20135), the widowed, wealthy and still money-hungry sister of George's late wife, Elaine. Regina is the opposite of who Elaine had been: cold, bitter, and scheming, she despises Jews and openly displays religious intolerance toward Sarah. Regina has now set her sights on the widower George's inheritance, and would take extreme actions to achieve her goals regardless of anyone she sees as an obstacle. After being committed in an asylum for the murder of Millie Davis and a policeman, Regina was let go in 1958. She returned to the town and helped Sarah and George fight Sir Richard's cruel intentions. She committed suicide at the end of season 5, overdosing on morphine and making her death appear to be homicide.\n* Matt Levett as Andrew Swanson (guest: season 6; regular: season 2; recurring: season 1), a somewhat entitled heir apparent who tries to win the hand of Anna Bligh.\n* Ben Winspear as Doctor Rene Nordmann (regular: season 3; recurring: season 2), the long-lost first love and husband of Sarah Adams. First seen only in flashback, Rene had been arrested by the Nazi occupiers of Paris, and had disappeared without a trace. Later, when Sarah is amazed to learn that he is still alive, she travels to Paris to rescue him from the deep psychological damage caused by his long ordeal of imprisonment and torture. Rene has great difficulty adjusting to normal life, and still seems to carry his imprisonment within him.\n* [[Brenna Harding]] as Rose O'Connell (regular: season 4; recurring: season 3)\n* [[Robert Coleby]] as Douglas Goddard, a retiree who ran a club for [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Australian war veterans]]. He married Elizabeth Bligh but died in season 5.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Heather Mitchell]] as Prudence Swanson, the wealthy friend of Elizabeth. Prudence socializes with Elizabeth whenever she comes to visit Sydney. As a member of Sydney's upper class, she is very aristocratic and looks down her nose at Sarah when she arrives for a garden party.\n* [[Judi Farr]] as Peg Maloney, the aunt of Sarah Adams, who writes to her frequently from her home in Sydney. She and Sarah have grown very close, and when Sarah later decides to take a difficult action, she asks Peg for help.\n* [[Dina Panozzo]] as Carla Poletti, the mother of Gino. She is very critical of the relationship with Anna and her son, saying that it will never work because she is not Catholic. But when George accedes, she does so as well.\n* [[Krew Boylan]] and then [[Amy Mathews]] as Amy Polson, the maid of the Bligh household. When Regina suspects that James is gay she manipulates Amy into spying for her, which eventually forces Elizabeth to fire Amy with great sorrow.\n* Angelo D'Angelo as Amo Poletti, the father of Gino\n* Jacinta Acevski as Alma Grey\n* Scott Grimley as Norman Parker (driver)\n* Rick Donald as Lloyd Ellis-Parker, a talented portrait artist on temporary assignment, who seems to offer Olivia the romantic affection she desperately craves.\n* Michael Sheasby as Bert Ford, a local yobbo who always seems to be looking for a fight. His suspicion of outsiders and religious intolerance make Sarah a natural target, as are the Italian Poletti family. Bert disappears under mysterious circumstances, but his unknown fate continues to haunt his former victims.\n* [[Mark Lee (Australian actor)|Mark Lee]] as Sir Richard Bennett, a rich and powerful, but unprincipled owner of a major city newspaper. He is used to taking whatever he wishes to possess, including the people around him.\n* [[Conrad Coleby]] as Matthew Goddard, Douglas' son who returns to town after his father's death.

A new life awaits her, however, when she comes to work for the local hospital near the Bligh family, whom she met while serving as a nurse on the ship taking them all back to Australia from Europe. Later, she is astonished to hear a report that her husband is still alive following World War II, and her life again spins into troubled times.<ref name=\"maincast\">{{cite news|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/a-place-to-call-home/characters/|title=Characters|date=4 May 2014|work=[[Yahoo!7]]|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Noni Hazlehurst]] as Elizabeth Bligh, the headstrong and stubborn matriarch of the Bligh family. She is at first rude and cruel to Sarah, but she grudgingly mellows over time. Later in the series, she leaves for Sydney to live with her daughter Carolyn, and to become a better person.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Brett Climo]] as Elizabeth's son, George Bligh, a good-hearted man who takes Sarah under his protection and gradually falls in love with her. He is Elaine's widower; at the beginning of the series, he appears to be father to James and Anna; eventually it emerges that Anna is actually a secret child of his sister Carolyn and their friend Jack, taken in by George and Elaine to spare Carolyn any scandal. His worst flaw may be his trust in people who seek to take advantage of him.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Craig Hall (actor)|Craig Hall]] as Jack Duncan, the secret past lover of Carolyn, who now faces many challenges in his work as a doctor in a hospital run by the Bligh family. He is a genuine person despite his personal problems and would do anything to help others.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[David Berry (actor)|David Berry]] as James Bligh (regular: seasons 1\u20134, 6; recurring: season 5), the only son of George and Elaine, who grows up unaware of his \"sister\" Anna's true background. He marries Olivia, but is tormented by the realisation that he is gay, and tries to commit suicide. He later feels betrayed when his wife has an affair, but returns to Ash Park to live for his young son.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood]] as Olivia Bligh, James' wife, a newlywed from England at the start of the series. She develops anger toward James for his indifference to her desperate need for affection, but does try to come to terms with his \"condition\".<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Abby Earl]] as Anna Bligh, the secret child of Carolyn and Jack, who was raised believing she was daughter of George and Elaine. Anna marries a local farmer, Gino, after rebelling against the Bligh family. The marriage faces difficulties, however, when Gino goes into debt, and his attempts to expand the farm fail.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Frankie J. Holden]] as Roy Briggs, a kindly old farmer who lives alone at the series start. He is very generous toward Sarah from the time she arrives in town, eventually offering her a refuge in his small home. They develop an easy, informal, mutually-supportive friendship.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Sara Wiseman]] as Carolyn Bligh (regular: season 2\u20136; recurring: season 1). Much like her secret daughter Anna, Carolyn was the rebel child of her generation. For a long time, she gave up on her relationship with the Bligh family, and has had little contact for years. Once her secret is revealed, she is reunited with her long-separated daughter Anna and they develop an even closer relationship than before. Later on Carolyn works for Sir Richard Bennett, encountering new problems.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Tim Draxl]] as Doctor Henry Fox (regular: season 3\u20136), the doctor who helps to save George's life after he is shot. Henry then goes on to befriend James, and they realize their mutual attraction to each other is stronger than mere friendship. Henry falls under the devious control of Regina, when she blackmails him into supplying her with morphine for her addiction.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Deborah Kennedy]] as Doris Collins (regular: season 4\u20136; recurring: seasons 1\u20133), the most widely-known member of the Inverness village, who seems omnipresent on her bicycle. Although she means well, her gossiping ways can sometimes make her seem rude and intrusive. Sarah dislikes her at first, but as time goes on, finds her helpful as someone who always knows who has done what in the village.\n* [[Dominic Allburn]] as Harry Polson (regular: season 1; recurring: season 4; regular: season 6), Amy Polson's gay brother. He has a brief romantic involvement with James, but when much of the village learns of Harry's true nature, he leaves Inverness for a new life elsewhere. Later, when he returns after having been severely beaten, Sarah helps him to settle back into a more stable life at Inverness.\n* [[Aaron Pederson as Frank Griggs]] is an Aboriginal man, broken by the effects of war and racism. He paints watercolours and is discovered by Carolyn who encourages him to show his work. Frank and Jack bond over shared military experience. Early in their friendship, Jack remarks that \u201ca bullet can\u2019t tell the colour of your skin. We all took the same risks.\u201d Both men learn to trust each other and begin to break free of their self-imposes prisons.\n\n=== Main departed cast ===\n* Aldo Mignone as Gino Poletti (seasons 1\u20134), the young, handsome Italian farmer who has set Anna's heart on fire. He has a real passion for farming and trying to please everybody, but his ambitious business decisions are not very successful.<ref name=\"maincast\"/>\n* [[Jenni Baird]] as Regina Standish (season 1\u20135), the widowed, wealthy and still money-hungry sister of George's late wife, Elaine. Regina is the opposite of who Elaine had been: cold, bitter, and scheming, she despises Jews and openly displays religious intolerance toward Sarah. Regina has now set her sights on the widower George's inheritance, and would take extreme actions to achieve her goals regardless of anyone she sees as an obstacle. After being committed in an asylum for the murder of Millie Davis and a policeman, Regina was let go in 1958. She returned to the town and helped Sarah and George fight Sir Richard's cruel intentions. She committed suicide at the end of season 5, overdosing on morphine and making her death appear to be homicide.\n* Matt Levett as Andrew Swanson (guest: season 6; regular: season 2; recurring: season 1), a somewhat entitled heir apparent who tries to win the hand of Anna Bligh.\n* Ben Winspear as Doctor Rene Nordmann (regular: season 3; recurring: season 2), the long-lost first love and husband of Sarah Adams. First seen only in flashback, Rene had been arrested by the Nazi occupiers of Paris, and had disappeared without a trace. Later, when Sarah is amazed to learn that he is still alive, she travels to Paris to rescue him from the deep psychological damage caused by his long ordeal of imprisonment and torture. Rene has great difficulty adjusting to normal life, and still seems to carry his imprisonment within him.\n* [[Brenna Harding]] as Rose O'Connell (regular: season 4; recurring: season 3)\n* [[Robert Coleby]] as Douglas Goddard, a retiree who ran a club for [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Australian war veterans]]. He married Elizabeth Bligh but died in season 5.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Heather Mitchell]] as Prudence Swanson, the wealthy friend of Elizabeth. Prudence socializes with Elizabeth whenever she comes to visit Sydney. As a member of Sydney's upper class, she is very aristocratic and looks down her nose at Sarah when she arrives for a garden party.\n* [[Judi Farr]] as Peg Maloney, the aunt of Sarah Adams, who writes to her frequently from her home in Sydney. She and Sarah have grown very close, and when Sarah later decides to take a difficult action, she asks Peg for help.\n* [[Dina Panozzo]] as Carla Poletti, the mother of Gino. She is very critical of the relationship with Anna and her son, saying that it will never work because she is not Catholic. But when George accedes, she does so as well.\n* [[Krew Boylan]] and then [[Amy Mathews]] as Amy Polson, the maid of the Bligh household. When Regina suspects that James is gay she manipulates Amy into spying for her, which eventually forces Elizabeth to fire Amy with great sorrow.\n* Angelo D'Angelo as Amo Poletti, the father of Gino\n* Jacinta Acevski as Alma Grey\n* Scott Grimley as Norman Parker (driver)\n* Rick Donald as Lloyd Ellis-Parker, a talented portrait artist on temporary assignment, who seems to offer Olivia the romantic affection she desperately craves.\n* Michael Sheasby as Bert Ford, a local yobbo who always seems to be looking for a fight. His suspicion of outsiders and religious intolerance make Sarah a natural target, as are the Italian Poletti family.

Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the \"bare metal\". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU.

The graphics frameworks [[OpenGL]] and [[OpenCL]] are still supported by the operating system, but will no longer be maintained; developers are encouraged to use Apple's [[Metal (API)|Metal]] library instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imore.com/opengl-and-opencl-be-depreciated-ios-12-and-macos-mojave|title=OpenGL and OpenCL to be deprecated in iOS 12 and macOS Mojave|first=Anthony|last=Casella|date=June 5, 2018|work=iMore}}</ref>\n\nOpenGL is a cross-platform graphics framework designed to support a wide range of processors. Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the \"bare metal\". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces driver overhead and improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to send commands to the GPU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/28/why-macos-mojave-requires-metal----and-deprecates-opengl|title=Why macOS Mojave requires Metal \u2014 and deprecates OpenGL|last=Dilger|first=Daniel E.|work=Apple Insider|date=June 28, 2018|access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nmacOS does not natively support [[Vulkan (API)|Vulkan]], the Khronos group's official successor to OpenGL. The [[MoltenVK]] library can be used as a bridge, translating most of the Vulkan 1.0 API into the Metal API.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/vulkan-is-coming-to-macos-ios-but-no-thanks-to-apple/|title=Vulkan is coming to macOS and iOS, but no thanks to Apple|work=Ars Technica|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/12465/khronos-group-extends-vulkan-portability-with-opensource|title=Bringing Vulkan to Apple's Platforms: Khronos Group Announces Open Source MoltenVK 1.0 & SDKs|last=Oh|first=Nate|work=Anandtech|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nContinuing the process started in [[macOS High Sierra]] (10.13), which issued warnings about compatibility with 32-bit applications, Mojave issues warnings when opening 32-bit apps that they will not be supported in future updates.

Lee''' {{postnominals|country=CAN|CM|OBC}} (25 June 1933 \u2013 19 February 2020) was a Canadian businessman and philanthropist. He was the founder and chairman of [https://www.prospero.ca/ Prospero], a real estate firm based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], specializing in sales and leasing, property management, development, investment, and syndication. \n\n==Biography==\nLee was born and raised in Vancouver and grew up in the [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]] section. His father immigrated from China and settled in Vancouver, where he opened a restaurant. Lee worked in his father's restaurant as a cook.\n\nLee studied at a Chinese school for 12 years. In his early teenage years, he became interested in the real estate business and often shared this interest with his father. He aspired to become an entrepreneur. Lee enrolled at the Sauder School of Business at the [[University of British Columbia]] where he studied business and graduated in 1956.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">[http://www.vanymca.org/centres/robertlee/who-we-are Who We Are | Robert Lee YMCA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[https://www.straight.com/article-812671/vancouver/making-mogul The making of real-estate mogul Robert H.

Lee | Chinese Canadian Stories<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from Sauder, Lee opened a real estate business and began to build an extensive network that included Tong Louie, the founder of the retail store chain [[London Drugs]] and philanthropist [[David Lam (real estate entrepreneur)|David Lam]], later B.C.\u2019s lieutenant governor, who immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong in 1967.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nLee's breakthrough into real estate came in the 1960s, when there was widespread fear of a Communist China takeover of the British colony of Hong Kong. A mass exodus of Hong Kong Chinese immigrants made their way to Vancouver and many of these newcomers were advised to visit Lee because he could speak their language.\n\nDuring this time, he expanded his business into apartment building. In 1979, he founded Prospero, which had a diverse real estate portfolio, from retail, to office, and industrial properties.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Prospero now has properties in the Okanagan, on Vancouver Island, and in Greater Vancouver. The company also has a property management division and is now run by Lee's son, Derek.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nAn ardent philanthropist, Lee donated money to a myriad of causes in Vancouver's Chinatown, including the Chinese School which he graduated from as well as to the University of British Columbia, where the [[Robert H.

He was the founder and chairman of [https://www.prospero.ca/ Prospero], a real estate firm based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], specializing in sales and leasing, property management, development, investment, and syndication. \n\n==Biography==\nLee was born and raised in Vancouver and grew up in the [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]] section. His father immigrated from China and settled in Vancouver, where he opened a restaurant. Lee worked in his father's restaurant as a cook.\n\nLee studied at a Chinese school for 12 years. In his early teenage years, he became interested in the real estate business and often shared this interest with his father. He aspired to become an entrepreneur. Lee enrolled at the Sauder School of Business at the [[University of British Columbia]] where he studied business and graduated in 1956.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">[http://www.vanymca.org/centres/robertlee/who-we-are Who We Are | Robert Lee YMCA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[https://www.straight.com/article-812671/vancouver/making-mogul The making of real-estate mogul Robert H.

A mass exodus of Hong Kong Chinese immigrants made their way to Vancouver and many of these newcomers were advised to visit Lee because he could speak their language.\n\nDuring this time, he expanded his business into apartment building. In 1979, he founded Prospero, which had a diverse real estate portfolio, from retail, to office, and industrial properties.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Prospero now has properties in the Okanagan, on Vancouver Island, and in Greater Vancouver. The company also has a property management division and is now run by Lee's son, Derek.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nAn ardent philanthropist, Lee donated money to a myriad of causes in Vancouver's Chinatown, including the Chinese School which he graduated from as well as to the University of British Columbia, where the [[Robert H. Lee Graduate School]] was named in his honor. He also sent money to his ancestral home village in China.
