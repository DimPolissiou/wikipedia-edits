After making his first film ''[[Nuts in May (film)|Nuts in May]]'', [[Universal Studios|Universal]] offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody ''[[Mud and Sand]]''.\n\nBy 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with [[Joe Rock]] for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native [[Australia]], which she accepted.<ref>Bergan 1992, p. 33.</ref> The 12 two-reel comedies were ''[[Mandarin Mix-Up]]'' (1924), ''[[Detained (film)|Detained]]'' (1924), ''[[Monsieur Don't Care]]'' (1924), ''[[West of Hot Dog]]'' (1924), ''[[Somewhere in Wrong]]'' (1925), ''[[Twins (1925 film)|Twins]]'' (1925), ''[[Pie-Eyed]]'' (1925), ''[[The Snow Hawk]]'' (1925), ''[[Navy Blue Days]]'' (1925), ''[[The Sleuth (1925 film)|The Sleuth]]'' (1925), ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1925) and ''[[Half a Man (film)|Half a Man]]'' (1925).\n\n==Laurel and Hardy==\n{{Main|Laurel and Hardy}}\n[[File:Laurel and Hardy in Lucky Dog.jpg|thumb|left|Laurel with Hardy in ''[[The Lucky Dog (1921 film)|The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921), long before they became a team.]]\nLaurel next signed with the [[Hal Roach]] studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]'' (in which [[Oliver Hardy]] had a part under the name \"Babe\" Hardy). It had been his intention to work primarily as a writer and director.\n\nThe same year, Hardy, a member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy ''All Star'' players, was injured in a kitchen mishap and hospitalised. Because he was unable to work on the scheduled film, ''Get 'Em Young'', Laurel was asked to return to acting to fill in. Starting early in 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in several short films, including ''[[Duck Soup (1927 film)|Duck Soup]]'', ''[[Slipping Wives]]'' and ''[[With Love and Hisses]]''. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios' supervising director [[Leo McCarey]] noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the ''[[Laurel and Hardy]]'' series later that year.\n\nTogether, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'', ''[[Should Married Men Go Home?]]'', ''[[Two Tars]]'', ''[[Be Big!]]'', ''[[Big Business (1929 film)|Big Business]]'', and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short ''[[Unaccustomed As We Are]]'' in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in [[Technicolor]]) musical feature ''[[The Rogue Song]]''. Their first starring feature ''[[Pardon Us]]'' was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler ''[[The Music Box (film)|The Music Box]],'' which won an [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject]].\n\n===Trouble at Roach Studio===\nDuring the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was \"teamed\" with [[Harry Langdon]] for the 1939 film ''[[Zenobia (film)|Zenobia]]''. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with [[Patsy Kelly]] to be called \"The Hardy Family.\" But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that [[Laurel and Hardy]] made after Laurel returned was ''[[A Chump at Oxford]]''. Subsequently, they made ''[[Saps at Sea]]'', which was their last film for Roach.\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:Stan in color.jpg|thumb|upright|Stan Laurel in a still from ''[[The Tree in a Test Tube]]'' (1943), a colour short made for the US Department of Agriculture]]\nIn 1941, [[Laurel and Hardy]] signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century-Fox|20th Century-Fox]] to make ten films over five years. Laurel found, to his shock, that he and Hardy were hired only as actors, and were not expected to contribute to the staging, writing, or editing of the productions. When the films proved very successful, Laurel and Hardy were granted more freedom and gradually added more of their own material. They had made six Fox features when the studio suddenly abandoned [[B-picture]] production in December 1944. The team had signed another contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1942, resulting in two more features.<ref>[[Scott MacGillivray|MacGillivray, Scott]].

The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled ''[[Atoll K]]''. (The film was entitled ''Utopia'' in the US and ''Robinson Crusoeland'' in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering.

Stan joined with two other former Karno performers, [[Edgar Hurley]] and his wife Ethel (known as \u201cWren\u201d)to form \u201cThe Three Comiques\u201d.  On the advice of booking agent [[Gordon Bostock]], they call themselves \"the Keystone Trio\". Stan started to do his character as an imitation of Charlie Chaplin, and the Hurleys began to do their parts as silent comedians [[Chester Conklin]] and [[Mabel Normand]]. They played successfully from February through October 1915, until the Hurleys and Stan parted ways. \n<ref>https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/support/stan-laurels-life-laughter</ref>\nBetween 1916 and 1918, he teamed up with Alice Cooke and [[Baldwin Cooke]], who became his lifelong friends to form the \u201cthe Stan Jefferson Trio\u201d. \n\nAmongst other performers, Laurel worked briefly alongside [[Oliver Hardy]] in the silent film short ''[[The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921),<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> before the two were a team. It was around this time that Laurel met [[Mae Dahlberg]]. Around the same time, he adopted the stage name of Laurel at Dahlberg's suggestion that his stage name Stan Jefferson was unlucky, due to it having thirteen letters.{{#tag:ref|Laurel disputed this and claimed that it just \"sounded good\".<ref>McCabe 1961, p. 18.</ref>|group=N}} The pair were performing together when Laurel was offered $75 a week to star in two-reel comedies. After making his first film ''[[Nuts in May (film)|Nuts in May]]'', [[Universal Studios|Universal]] offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody ''[[Mud and Sand]]''.\n\nBy 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with [[Joe Rock]] for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native [[Australia]], which she accepted.<ref>Bergan 1992, p. 33.</ref> The 12 two-reel comedies were ''[[Mandarin Mix-Up]]'' (1924), ''[[Detained (film)|Detained]]'' (1924), ''[[Monsieur Don't Care]]'' (1924), ''[[West of Hot Dog]]'' (1924), ''[[Somewhere in Wrong]]'' (1925), ''[[Twins (1925 film)|Twins]]'' (1925), ''[[Pie-Eyed]]'' (1925), ''[[The Snow Hawk]]'' (1925), ''[[Navy Blue Days]]'' (1925), ''[[The Sleuth (1925 film)|The Sleuth]]'' (1925), ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1925) and ''[[Half a Man (film)|Half a Man]]'' (1925).\n\n==Laurel and Hardy==\n{{Main|Laurel and Hardy}}\n[[File:Laurel and Hardy in Lucky Dog.jpg|thumb|left|Laurel with Hardy in ''[[The Lucky Dog (1921 film)|The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921), long before they became a team.]]\nLaurel next signed with the [[Hal Roach]] studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]'' (in which [[Oliver Hardy]] had a part under the name \"Babe\" Hardy). It had been his intention to work primarily as a writer and director.\n\nThe same year, Hardy, a member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy ''All Star'' players, was injured in a kitchen mishap and hospitalised. Because he was unable to work on the scheduled film, ''Get 'Em Young'', Laurel was asked to return to acting to fill in. Starting early in 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in several short films, including ''[[Duck Soup (1927 film)|Duck Soup]]'', ''[[Slipping Wives]]'' and ''[[With Love and Hisses]]''. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios' supervising director [[Leo McCarey]] noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the ''[[Laurel and Hardy]]'' series later that year.\n\nTogether, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'', ''[[Should Married Men Go Home?]]'', ''[[Two Tars]]'', ''[[Be Big!]]'', ''[[Big Business (1929 film)|Big Business]]'', and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short ''[[Unaccustomed As We Are]]'' in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in [[Technicolor]]) musical feature ''[[The Rogue Song]]''. Their first starring feature ''[[Pardon Us]]'' was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler ''[[The Music Box (film)|The Music Box]],'' which won an [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject]].\n\n===Trouble at Roach Studio===\nDuring the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was \"teamed\" with [[Harry Langdon]] for the 1939 film ''[[Zenobia (film)|Zenobia]]''. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with [[Patsy Kelly]] to be called \"The Hardy Family.\" But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that [[Laurel and Hardy]] made after Laurel returned was ''[[A Chump at Oxford]]''. Subsequently, they made ''[[Saps at Sea]]'', which was their last film for Roach.\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:Stan in color.jpg|thumb|upright|Stan Laurel in a still from ''[[The Tree in a Test Tube]]'' (1943), a colour short made for the US Department of Agriculture]]\nIn 1941, [[Laurel and Hardy]] signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century-Fox|20th Century-Fox]] to make ten films over five years. Laurel found, to his shock, that he and Hardy were hired only as actors, and were not expected to contribute to the staging, writing, or editing of the productions. When the films proved very successful, Laurel and Hardy were granted more freedom and gradually added more of their own material. They had made six Fox features when the studio suddenly abandoned [[B-picture]] production in December 1944. The team had signed another contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1942, resulting in two more features.<ref>[[Scott MacGillivray|MacGillivray, Scott]].

The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled ''[[Atoll K]]''. (The film was entitled ''Utopia'' in the US and ''Robinson Crusoeland'' in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering. In 1952, Laurel and Hardy toured Europe successfully, and they returned in 1953 for another tour of the continent. During this tour, Laurel fell ill and was unable to perform for several weeks.<ref>Bergen 1992, p. 118.</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, Hardy had a heart attack and cancelled the tour. In 1955, they were planning to do a television series called ''Laurel and Hardy's Fabulous Fables'' based on children's stories. The plans were delayed after Laurel suffered a [[stroke]] on 25 April 1955, from which he recovered.

She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology.

Tony Norman (Morbid Angel) joined on guitar and bass, and Anthony Rezhawk joined as the new vocalist.

After disbanding, its members gained recognition by playing in influential [[extreme metal]] bands, such as [[Morbid Angel]] ([[David Vincent]], [[Pete Sandoval]]), [[Napalm Death]] ([[Jesse Pintado]]) and [[Nausea (band, Los Angeles)|Nausea]] (Oscar Garcia, Alfred \"Garvey\" Estrada). To date, Terrorizer has released four studio albums, and broken up twice (once in 1989 and another in 2006). The band reunited again in 2009, this time without Pintado, who had died three years earlier.\n\n==History==\nThe group released its debut album, ''[[World Downfall]]'', in 1989.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=357}}</ref> It is seen as one of the classics of early grindcore.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r19881|pure_url=yes}} World Downfall - Terrorizer | AllMusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> An album containing two rehearsal sessions of the band from 1987 was released in 2003.\n\nThe band split around 1990 when Vincent offered Sandoval a spot in [[Morbid Angel]], while Pintado was being courted to join [[Napalm Death]]; Sandoval saw Terrorizer stagnating, while Morbid Angel and Napalm Death at the time were rapidly gaining popularity. As a result, only Garcia remained; Garcia claims not to have talked to Sandoval since.<ref name=\"sttg\">{{Cite web| title = Slave to the Grind | publisher = Death by Digital| year = 2019 | url = https://reelhouse.org/deathbydigital/slave-to-the-grind/slave-to-the-grind }}</ref>\n\nIn early 2005, it was rumored that Terrorizer were to reform with their original line-up; however, of the original line up, only Jesse Pintado and Pete Sandoval returned. The band released its second studio album, ''[[Darker Days Ahead]]'', in August 2006, on [[Century Media Records]]. Tony Norman (Morbid Angel) joined on guitar and bass, and Anthony Rezhawk joined as the new vocalist. Pintado had been recording and playing shows with Rezhawk's band Resistant Culture and asked him to join Terrorizer.

Settlement in \"real time\" means a payment transaction is not subjected to any waiting period, with transactions being settled as soon as they are processed. \"Gross settlement\" means the transaction is settled on a one-to-one without bundling or [[net settlement|netting]] with any other transaction. \"Settlement\" means that once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.\n\n\n==History==\nAs of 1985, three central banks had implemented RTGS systems, while by the end of 2005, RTGS systems had been implemented by 90 central banks.<ref>Morten Bech, Bart Hobijn, \"Technology Diffusion within Central Banking: The Case of Real-Time Gross Settlement\", Staff Report nj. 260, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Working Paper, September 2007, p. 2</ref>\n\nThe first system that had the attributes of a RTGS system was the US [[Fedwire]] system which was launched in 1970.  This was based on a previous method of transferring funds electronically between US federal reserve banks via [[telegraph]].  The United Kingdom and France both independently developed RTGS type systems in 1984.  The UK system was developed by the Bankers Clearing House in February 1984 and was called [[CHAPS]].  The French system was called SAGITTAIRE.  A number of other developed countries launched systems over the next few years.  These systems were diverse in operation and technology, being country specific as they were usually based upon previous processes and procedures used in each country.\n\nIn the 1990s international finance organizations emphasised the importance of large-value funds transfer systems which banks use to settle interbank transfers for their own account as well as for their customers as a key part of a country's financial infrastructure.  By 1997 a number of countries, inside as well as outside the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], had introduced real-time gross settlement systems for large-value funds transfers. Nearly all G-10 countries had plans to have RTGS systems in operation in the course of 1997 and many other countries were also considering introducing such systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d22.pdf |title=Real-time gross settlement systems |author=Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the central banks of the Group of Ten countries |date=March 5, 1997 |publisher=BIS}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nRTGS systems are usually operated by a country's [[central bank]] as it is seen as a critical infrastructure for a country's economy. Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging [[goods and services]], and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money.<ref>Biago Bossone and Massimo Cirasino, \"The Oversight of the Payment Systems: A Framework for the Development and Governanace of Payment Systems in Emerging Economies\"The World Bank, July 2001, p.7</ref>\n\nRTGS system does not require any physical exchange of money; the central bank makes adjustments in the electronic accounts of Bank A and Bank B, reducing the balance in Bank A's account by the amount in question and increasing the balance of Bank B's account by the same amount. The RTGS system is suited for low-volume, high-value transactions. It lowers settlement risk, besides giving an accurate picture of an institution's account at any point of time. The objective of RTGS systems by central banks throughout the world is to minimize risk in high-value electronic payment settlement systems. In an RTGS system, transactions are settled across accounts held at a central bank on a continuous gross basis. Settlement is immediate, final and irrevocable. Credit risks due to settlement lags are eliminated. The best RTGS national payment system cover up to 95% of high-value transactions within the national monetary market.\n\nRTGS systems are an alternative to systems of settling transactions at the end of the day, also known as the net settlement system, such as the [[BACS]] system in the United Kingdom. In a net settlement system, all the inter-institution transactions during the day are accumulated, and at the end of the day, the central bank adjusts the accounts of the institutions by the net amounts of these transactions.\n\nThe [[World Bank]] has been paying increasing attention to payment system development as a key component of the financial infrastructure of a country, and has provided various forms of assistance to over 100 countries. Most of the RTGS systems in place are secure and have been designed around international standards and best practices.<ref>Massimo Cirasino and Jose Antonio Garcia, \"Measuring Payment System Development\", The World Bank, 2008</ref> \n\nThere are several reasons for central banks to adopt RTGS. First, a decision to adopt is influenced by competitive pressure from the global financial markets. Second, it is more beneficial to adopt an RTGS system for central bank when this allows access to a broad system of other countries' RTGS systems. Third, it is very likely that the knowledge acquired through experiences with RTGS systems spills over to other central banks and helps them make their adoption decision. Fourth, central banks do not necessarily have to install and develop RTGS themselves. The possibility of sharing development with providers that have built RTGS systems in more than one country ([[CGI Group|CGI]] of UK holding the IP, CMA Small System of Sweden, JV Perago of South Africa, [[SIA S.p.A.]] of Italy and Montran of USA) has presumably lowered the cost and hence made it feasible for many countries to adopt.<ref>Morten Bech, Bart Hobijn, \" Technology Diffusion within

from one [[bank]] to any other bank on a \"real-time\" and on a \"[[gross (economics)|gross]]\" basis. Settlement in \"real time\" means a payment transaction is not subjected to any waiting period, with transactions being settled as soon as they are processed. \"Gross settlement\" means the transaction is settled on a one-to-oneout bundling or [[net settlement|netting]] with any other transaction. \"Settlement\" means that once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.\n\n\n==History==\nAs of 1985, three central banks had implemented RTGS systems, while by the end of 2005, RTGS systems had been implemented by 90 central banks.<ref>Morten Bech, Bart Hobijn, \"Technology Diffusion within Central Banking: The Case of Real-Time Gross Settlement\", Staff Report nj. 260, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Working Paper, September 2007, p. 2</ref>\n\nThe first system that had the attributes of a RTGS system was the US [[Fedwire]] system which was launched in 1970.  This was based on a previous method of transferring funds electronically between US federal reserve banks via [[telegraph]].  The United Kingdom and France both independently developed RTGS type systems in 1984.  The UK system was developed by the Bankers Clearing House in February 1984 and was called [[CHAPS]].  The French system was called SAGITTAIRE.  A number of other developed countries launched systems over the next few years.  These systems were diverse in operation and technology, being country specific as they were usually based upon previous processes and procedures used in each country.\n\nIn the 1990s international finance organizations emphasised the importance of large-value funds transfer systems which banks use to settle interbank transfers for their own account as well as for their customers as a key part of a country's financial infrastructure.  By 1997 a number of countries, inside as well as outside the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], had introduced real-time gross settlement systems for large-value funds transfers. Nearly all G-10 countries had plans to have RTGS systems in operation in the course of 1997 and many other countries were also considering introducing such systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d22.pdf |title=Real-time gross settlement systems |author=Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the central banks of the Group of Ten countries |date=March 5, 1997 |publisher=BIS}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nRTGS systems are usually operated by a country's [[central bank]] as it is seen as a critical infrastructure for a country's economy. Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging [[goods and services]], and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money.<ref>Biago Bossone and Massimo Cirasino, \"The Oversight of the Payment Systems: A Framework for the Development and Governanace of Payment Systems in Emerging Economies\"The World Bank, July 2001, p.7</ref>\n\nRTGS system does not require any physical exchange of money; the central bank makes adjustments in the electronic accounts of Bank A and Bank B, reducing the balance in Bank A's account by the amount in question and increasing the balance of Bank B's account by the same amount. The RTGS system is suited for low-volume, high-value transactions. It lowers settlement risk, besides giving an accurate picture of an institution's account at any point of time. The objective of RTGS systems by central banks throughout the world is to minimize risk in high-value electronic payment settlement systems. In an RTGS system, transactions are settled across accounts held at a central bank on a continuous gross basis. Settlement is immediate, final and irrevocable. Credit risks due to settlement lags are eliminated. The best RTGS national payment system cover up to 95% of high-value transactions within the national monetary market.\n\nRTGS systems are an alternative to systems of settling transactions at the end of the day, also known as the net settlement system, such as the [[BACS]] system in the United Kingdom. In a net settlement system, all the inter-institution transactions during the day are accumulated, and at the end of the day, the central bank adjusts the accounts of the institutions by the net amounts of these transactions.\n\nThe [[World Bank]] has been paying increasing attention to payment system development as a key component of the financial infrastructure of a country, and has provided various forms of assistance to over 100 countries. Most of the RTGS systems in place are secure and have been designed around international standards and best practices.<ref>Massimo Cirasino and Jose Antonio Garcia, \"Measuring Payment System Development\", The World Bank, 2008</ref> \n\nThere are several reasons for central banks to adopt RTGS. First, a decision to adopt is influenced by competitive pressure from the global financial markets. Second, it is more beneficial to adopt an RTGS system for central bank when this allows access to a broad system of other countries' RTGS systems. Third, it is very likely that the knowledge acquired through experiences with RTGS systems spills over to other central banks and helps them make their adoption decision. Fourth, central banks do not necessarily have to install and develop RTGS themselves. The possibility of sharing development with providers that have built RTGS systems in more than one country ([[CGI Group|CGI]] of UK holding the IP, CMA Small System of Sweden, JV Perago of South Africa, [[SIA S.p.A.]] of Italy and Montran of USA) has presumably lowered the cost and hence made it feasible for many countries to adopt.<ref>Morten Bech, Bart Hobijn, \" Technology Diffusion within Central Banking: The Case of Real-Time Gross Settlement\", Staff Report nj. 260, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Working Paper, September 2006, p. 16\u201317</ref>\n\n== Existing systems ==\nBelow is a listing of countries and their RTGS systems:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Country!!System\n|-\n\n|-\n| {{flag|Angola}} || SPTR ({{lang-pt|Sistema de pagamentos em tempo real}};

{"title_page": "Goodness of fit", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2018}}\n{{Regression bar}}\nThe '''goodness of fit''' of a [[statistical model]] describes how well it fits a set of observations. Measures of goodness of fit typically summarize the discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model in question. Such measures can be used in [[statistical hypothesis testing]], e.g. to [[normality test|test for normality]] of [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual]]s, to test whether two samples are drawn from identical distributions  (see [[Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov]] test), or whether outcome frequencies follow a specified distribution (see [[Pearson's chi-squared test]]).  In the [[analysis of variance]], one of the components into which the variance is partitioned may be a [[lack-of-fit sum of squares]].\n\n==Fit of distributions==\n\nIn assessing whether a given distribution is suited to a data-set, the following [[statistical hypothesis test|test]]s and their underlying measures of fit can be used:\n*[[Bayesian information criterion]]\n*[[Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test]]\n*[[Cram\u00e9r\u2013von Mises criterion]]\n*[[Anderson\u2013Darling test]]\n*[[Shapiro\u2013Wilk test]]\n*[[Chi-squared test]]\n*[[Akaike information criterion]]\n*[[Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test]]\n*[[Kuiper's test]]\n*Kernelized Stein discrepancy<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/liub16.html |title=A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests |last1=Liu |first1=Qiang |last2=Lee |first2=Jason |last3=Jordan |first3=Michael |date=20 June 2016 |publisher=Proceedings of Machine Learning Research |book-title=Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning |pages=276\u2013284 |location=New York, New York, USA |conference=The 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning }}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/chwialkowski16.html |title=A Kernel Test of Goodness of Fit |last1= Chwialkowski |first1=Kacper |last2=Strathmann |first2=Heiko |last3=Gretton |first3=Arthur |date=20 June 2016 |publisher=Proceedings of Machine Learning Research |book-title=Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning |pages=2606-2615 |location=New York, New York, USA |conference=The 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning }}</ref>\n*Zhang's Z<sub>K</sub>, Z<sub>C</sub> and Z<sub>A</sub> tests<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Jin |title=Powerful goodness-of-fit tests based on the likelihood ratio |journal=J.

The chi-squared distribution has (''k'' &minus; ''c'') [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], where ''k'' is the number of non-empty cells and ''c'' is the number of estimated parameters (including location and scale parameters and shape parameters) for the distribution plus one. For example, for a 3-parameter [[Weibull distribution]], ''c'' = 4.\n\n====Example: equal frequencies of men and women====\n\nFor example, to test the hypothesis that a random sample of 100 people has been drawn from a population in which men and women are equal in frequency, the observed number of men and women would be compared to the theoretical frequencies of 50 men and 50 women. If there were 44 men in the sample and 56 women, then\n\n:<math> \\chi^2 = {(44 - 50)^2 \\over 50} + {(56 - 50)^2 \\over 50} = 1.44</math>\n\nIf the null hypothesis is true (i.e., men and women are chosen with equal probability in the sample), the test statistic will be drawn from a chi-squared distribution with one [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degree of freedom]].  Though one might expect two degrees of freedom (one each for the men and women), we must take into account that the total number of men and women is constrained (100), and thus there is only one degree of freedom (2&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1).  Alternatively, if the male count is known the female count is determined, and vice versa.\n\nConsultation of the [[chi-squared distribution]] for 1 degree of freedom shows that the [[probability]] of observing this difference (or a more extreme difference than this) if men and women are equally numerous in the population is approximately 0.23. This probability is higher than conventional criteria for [[statistical significance]] (.001-.05), so normally we would not reject the null hypothesis that the number of men in the population is the same as the number of women (i.e. we would consider our sample within the range of what we'd expect for a 50/50 male/female ratio.)\n\nNote the assumption that the mechanism that has generated the sample is random, in the sense of independent random selection with the same probability, here 0.5 for both males and females. If, for example, each of the 44 males selected brought a male buddy, and each of the 56 females brought a female buddy, each <math display=\"inline\">{(O_i - E_i)}^2</math> will increase by a factor of 4, while each <math display=\"inline\">E_i</math> will increase by a factor of 2. The value of the statistic will double to 2.88.  Knowing this underlying mechanism, we should of course be counting pairs.  In general, the mechanism, if not defensibly random, will not be known. The distribution to which the test statistic should be referred may, accordingly, be very different from chi-squared.<ref>{{cite book |last=Maindonald |first=J. H. |last2=Braun |first2=W.

There are ''n'' trials each with probability of success, denoted by ''p''.  Provided that ''np''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u226b&nbsp;1 for every ''i'' (where ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''k''), then\n\n<math> \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} {\\frac{(N_i - np_i)^2}{np_i}} = \\sum_{\\mathrm{all\\ cells}}^{} {\\frac{(\\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{E})^2}{\\mathrm{E}}}.</math>\n\nThis has approximately a chi-squared distribution with ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom.  The fact that there are ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom is a consequence of the restriction <math> \\sum N_i=n</math>.  We know there are ''k'' observed cell counts, however, once any ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 are known, the remaining one is uniquely determined.  Basically, one can say, there are only ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 freely determined cell counts, thus ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom.\n\n===''G''-test===\n\n[[G-test|''G''-tests]] are [[likelihood ratio test|likelihood-ratio]] tests of [[statistical significance]] that are increasingly being used in situations where Pearson's chi-squared tests were previously recommended.<ref>{{cite book|author=McDonald, J.H.|year=2014|title=Handbook of Biological Statistics|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=Sparky House Publishing|edition=Third|chapter=G\u2013test of goodness-of-fit|url=http://www.biostathandbook.com/gtestgof.html|pages=53\u201358}}</ref>\n\nThe general formula for ''G'' is\n:<math> G = 2\\sum_{i} {O_{i} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{O_i}{E_i}\\right)}, </math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">O_i</math> and <math display=\"inline\">E_i</math> are the same as for the chi-squared test, <math display=\"inline\">\\ln</math> denotes the [[natural logarithm]], and the sum is taken over all non-empty cells.

Measures of goodness of fit typically summarize the discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model in question. Such measures can be used in [[statistical hypothesis testing]], e.g. to [[normality test|test for normality]] of [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual]]s, to test whether two samples are drawn from identical distributions  (see [[Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov]] test), or whether outcome frequencies follow a specified distribution (see [[Pearson's chi-squared test]]).  In the [[analysis of variance]], one of the components into which the variance is partitioned may be a [[lack-of-fit sum of squares]].\n\n==Fit of distributions==\n\nIn assessing whether a given distribution is suited to a data-set, the following [[statistical hypothesis test|test]]s and their underlying measures of fit can be used:\n*[[Bayesian information criterion]]\n*[[Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test]]\n*[[Cram\u00e9r\u2013von Mises criterion]]\n*[[Anderson\u2013Darling test]]\n*[[Shapiro\u2013Wilk test]]\n*[[Chi-squared test]]\n*[[Akaike information criterion]]\n*[[Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test]]\n*[[Kuiper's test]]\n*Kernelized Stein discrepancy<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/liub16.html |title=A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests |last1=Liu |first1=Qiang |last2=Lee |first2=Jason |last3=Jordan |first3=Michael |date=20 June 2016 |publisher=Proceedings of Machine Learning Research |book-title=Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning |pages=276\u2013284 |location=New York, New York, USA |conference=The 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning }}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/chwialkowski16.html |title=A Kernel Test of Goodness of Fit |last1= Chwialkowski |first1=Kacper |last2=Strathmann |first2=Heiko |last3=Gretton |first3=Arthur |date=20 June 2016 |publisher=Proceedings of Machine Learning Research |book-title=Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning |pages=2606-2615 |location=New York, New York, USA |conference=The 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning }}</ref>\n*Zhang's Z<sub>K</sub>, Z<sub>C</sub> and Z<sub>A</sub> tests<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Jin |title=Powerful goodness-of-fit tests based on the likelihood ratio |journal=J.

The chi-squared distribution has (''k'' &minus; ''c'') [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], where ''k'' is the number of non-empty cells and ''c'' is the number of estimated parameters (including location and scale parameters and shape parameters) for the distribution plus one. For example, for a 3-parameter [[Weibull distribution]], ''c'' = 4.\n\n====Example: equal frequencies of men and women====\n\nFor example, to test the hypothesis that a random sample of 100 people has been drawn from a population in which men and women are equal in frequency, the observed number of men and women would be compared to the theoretical frequencies of 50 men and 50 women. If there were 44 men in the sample and 56 women, then\n\n:<math> \\chi^2 = {(44 - 50)^2 \\over 50} + {(56 - 50)^2 \\over 50} = 1.44</math>\n\nIf the null hypothesis is true (i.e., men and women are chosen with equal probability in the sample), the test statistic will be drawn from a chi-squared distribution with one [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degree of freedom]].  Though one might expect two degrees of freedom (one each for the men and women), we must take into account that the total number of men and women is constrained (100), and thus there is only one degree of freedom (2&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1).  Alternatively, if the male count is known the female count is determined, and vice versa.\n\nConsultation of the [[chi-squared distribution]] for 1 degree of freedom shows that the [[probability]] of observing this difference (or a more extreme difference than this) if men and women are equally numerous in the population is approximately 0.23. This probability is higher than conventional criteria for [[statistical significance]] (.001-.05), so normally we would not reject the null hypothesis that the number of men in the population is the same as the number of women (i.e. we would consider our sample within the range of what we'd expect for a 50/50 male/female ratio.)\n\nNote the assumption that the mechanism that has generated the sample is random, in the sense of independent random selection with the same probability, here 0.5 for both males and females. If, for example, each of the 44 males selected brought a male buddy, and each of the 56 females brought a female buddy, each <math display=\"inline\">{(O_i - E_i)}^2</math> will increase by a factor of 4, while each <math display=\"inline\">E_i</math> will increase by a factor of 2. The value of the statistic will double to 2.88.  Knowing this underlying mechanism, we should of course be counting pairs.  In general, the mechanism, if not defensibly random, will not be known. The distribution to which the test statistic should be referred may, accordingly, be very different from chi-squared. See<ref>{{cite book |last=Maindonald |first=J. H. |last2=Braun |first2=W.

There are ''n'' trials each with probability of success, denoted by ''p''.  Provided that ''np''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u226b&nbsp;1 for every ''i'' (where ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''k''), then\n\n<math> \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} {\\frac{(N_i - np_i)^2}{np_i}} = \\sum_{\\mathrm{all\\ cells}}^{} {\\frac{(\\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{E})^2}{\\mathrm{E}}}.</math>\n\nThis has approximately a chi-squared distribution with ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom.  The fact that there are ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom is a consequence of the restriction <math> \\sum N_i=n</math>.  We know there are ''k'' observed cell counts, however, once any ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 are known, the remaining one is uniquely determined.  Basically, one can say, there are only ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 freely determined cell counts, thus ''k''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom.\n\n===''G''-test===\n\n[[G-test|''G''-tests]] are [[likelihood ratio test|likelihood-ratio]] tests of [[statistical significance]] that are increasingly being used in situations where Pearson's chi-squared tests were previously recommended.<ref>{{cite book|author=McDonald, J.H.|year=2014|title=Handbook of Biological Statistics|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=Sparky House Publishing|edition=Third|chapter=G\u2013test of goodness-of-fit|url=http://www.biostathandbook.com/gtestgof.html|pages=53\u201358}}</ref>\n\nThe general formula for ''G'' is\n:<math> G = 2\\sum_{i} {O_{i} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{O_i}{E_i}\\right)}, </math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">O_i</math> and <math display=\"inline\">E_i</math> are the same as for the chi-squared test, <math display=\"inline\">\\ln</math> denotes the [[natural logarithm]], and the sum is taken over all non-empty cells. Furthermore, the total observed count should be equal to the total expected count:<math display=\"block\">\\sum_i O_i = \\sum_i E_i = N</math>where <math display=\"inline\">N</math> is the total number of observations.\n\n''G''-tests have been recommended at least since the 1981 edition of the popular statistics textbook by [[Robert R.
