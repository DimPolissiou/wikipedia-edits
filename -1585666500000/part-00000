The [[American Kennel Club]] standards, however, consider an all-too aggressive or all-too timid Chow-Chow to be unacceptable.<ref name=\"AKC\" /> For that reason, some owners have attributed a cat-like personality to the Chow-Chow.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chow Chow Temperament Evaluation, Handling & Placement Tips for Animal Shelters |url=http://www.chowwelfare.com/cciw/sheltereval.htm|work=Chow Chow Information and Adoption Center|publisher=Wisconsin Chow Chow Rescue|accessdate=July 10, 2012|author=The Chow Chow Club, Inc.'s Welfare Committee|year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chow Chow |url=http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/chow-chow#personality|work=dogtime|publisher=DogTime Media Network|accessdate=July 10, 2012|author=dogtime}}</ref>\n\nChow-Chow are not excessively active, meaning that they can be housed in an apartment. However, a Chow-Chow living in an apartment will need daily exercise to prevent restlessness and boredom. Upon realizing that exercise is a daily occurrence, Chow-Chow will tend to be more assertive with owners in anticipation of such activities.\n\nThis breed of dog has many strong loyal bonds with friends and family, but the Chow-Chow dog is usually overly protective of one or two main family members.<ref><nowiki> Breed.

Retrieved April 3, 2013 {{unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}</ref> It is in the breed's nature to be quiet and well-behaved, but it is also resistant to training. Chow-Chows become very stubborn and attach to certain individuals as they age. This makes training them when they are puppies crucial, because they gain respect for those who care for them.\n\nTo avoid aggression and over-protectiveness as an adult, continuous socialization as early as possible could allow the dog to adjust. When a Chow-Chow reaches adolescence it rejects authority from any owner who failed to earn its admiration. Aggression can be one distinctive behavioural characteristic in this breed, though while some are of an aggressive nature, many are known to be easy-going in nature \u2013 sometimes adopting an aloof disposition to individuals other than their owners. Aggression when it does appear is often towards other dogs of the same gender, especially Chows. Due to their strong hunting instincts, it is recommended that these dogs stay fenced, leashed, and away from cats and small dogs. This is why it is crucial that they are socialized early and consistently to act appropriately with strangers. \nAt first, chow-chows are very hesitant in interacting with strangers. However, this problem can be avoided if the owners train the chow-chow at a young age.\n\nOwning a Chow-Chow can raise the cost of homeowners insurance because some companies consider them high-risk dogs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Will Your Canine Affect Your Homeowners Insurance Policy?|url=http://www.insuranceagents.com/2009-06-canine.html|work=InsuranceAgents.com|publisher=AgentInsider.com|accessdate=July 10, 2012|author=InsuranceAgents.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014123233/http://www.insuranceagents.com/2009-06-canine.html|archive-date=October 14, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> In a study in the ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association'', Chow-Chow were responsible for 8 out of 238 fatalities related to dog bites from 1979 to 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|last=J.

Both create a thick woolly layer, as it gets closer to the skin. They should be brushed four times a week; however shedding seasons may require daily grooming.

However, a Chow-Chow living in an apartment will need daily exercise to prevent restlessness and boredom. Upon realizing that exercise is a daily occurrence, Chow-Chow will tend to be more assertive with owners in anticipation of such activities.\n\nThis breed of dog has many strong loyal bonds with friends and family, but the Chow-Chow dog is usually overly protective of one or two main family members.<ref><nowiki> Breed.

Retrieved April 3, 2013 {{unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}</ref> It is in the breed's nature to be quiet and well-behaved, but it is also resistant to training. Chow-Chows become very stubborn and attach to certain individuals as they age. This makes training them when they are puppies crucial, because they gain respect for those who care for them.\n\nTo avoid aggression and over-protectiveness as an adult, continuous socialization as early as possible could allow the dog to adjust. When a Chow-Chow reaches adolescence it rejects authority from any owner who failed to earn its admiration. Aggression can be one distinctive behavioural characteristic in this breed, though while some are of an aggressive nature, many are known to be easy-going in nature \u2013 sometimes adopting an aloof disposition to individuals other than their owners. Aggression when it does appear is often towards other dogs of the same gender, especially Chows. Due to their strong hunting instincts, it is recommended that these dogs stay fenced, leashed, and away from cats and small dogs. This is why it is crucial that they are socialized early and consistently to act appropriately with strangers. \nAt first, chow-chows are very hesitant in interacting with strangers. However, this problem can be avoided if the owners train the chow-chow at a young age.\n\nOwning a Chow-Chow can raise the cost of homeowners insurance because some companies consider them high-risk dogs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Will Your Canine Affect Your Homeowners Insurance Policy?|url=http://www.insuranceagents.com/2009-06-canine.html|work=InsuranceAgents.com|publisher=AgentInsider.com|accessdate=July 10, 2012|author=InsuranceAgents.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014123233/http://www.insuranceagents.com/2009-06-canine.html|archive-date=October 14, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> In a study in the ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association'', Chow-Chow were responsible for 8 out of 238 fatalities related to dog bites from 1979 to 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|last=J.

In 1610, the year after [[Galileo Galilei]] turned a [[telescope]] to the sky, he became the first person to observe Saturn's rings, though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature. In 1655, [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first person to describe them as a disk surrounding Saturn.<ref name=\"history_of_the_rings\" /> Although many people think of Saturn's rings as being made up of a series of tiny ringlets (a concept that goes back to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]]),<ref name=\"history_of_the_rings\" /> true gaps are few. It is more correct to think of the rings as an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular disk]] with [[concentric]] local [[maxima and minima]] in density and brightness.<ref name=\"Tiscareno\" /> On the scale of the clumps within the rings there is much empty space.\n\nThe rings have numerous gaps where particle density drops sharply: two opened by known moons embedded within them, and many others at locations of known destabilizing [[orbital resonance]]s with the [[moons of Saturn]]. Other gaps remain unexplained. Stabilizing resonances, on the other hand, are responsible for the longevity of several rings, such as the [[#Colombo Gap and Titan Ringlet|Titan Ringlet]] and the [[#G Ring|G Ring]].\n\nWell beyond the main rings is the [[#Phoebe ring|Phoebe ring]], which is presumed to originate from [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] and thus to share its [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]] orbital motion. It is aligned with the plane of Saturn's orbit. [[Saturn]] has an axial tilt of 27 degrees, so this ring is tilted at an angle of 27 degrees to the more visible rings orbiting above Saturn's equator.  \n[[File:Saturn and its 3 moons.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|''[[Voyager 2]]'' view of [[Saturn]] casting a shadow across its rings.

He had been making observations of the planet Saturn from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in ''De corpore saturni,'' in which he came close to suggesting the planet had a ring. However Wren was unsure whether the ring was independent of the planet, or physically attached to it.

Within the Roche limit, bodies of rocky material are dense enough to accrete additional material, whereas less-dense bodies of ice are not. Once outside the rings, the newly formed moons could have continued to evolve through random mergers. This process may explain the variation in silicate content of Saturn's moons out to Rhea, as well as the trend towards less silicate content closer to Saturn. Rhea would then be the oldest of the moons formed from the primordial rings, with moons closer to Saturn being progressively younger.<ref name=\"Charnoz_2011\" />\n\nThe brightness and purity of the water ice in Saturn's rings has also been cited as evidence that the rings are much younger than Saturn,<ref name=\"Gohd-surprisingly\"/> as the infall of meteoric dust would have led to darkening of the rings. However, new research indicates that the B Ring may be massive enough to have diluted infalling material and thus avoided substantial darkening over the age of the Solar System.

It was discovered in 1850 by [[William Cranch Bond|William]] and [[George Phillips Bond|George Bond]], though [[William Rutter Dawes|William R. Dawes]] and [[Johann Gottfried Galle|Johann Galle]] also saw it independently. [[William Lassell]] termed it the \"Crepe Ring\" because it seemed to be composed of darker material than the brighter A and B Rings.<ref name=\"Harland\">Harland, David M., ''Mission to Saturn: Cassini and the Huygens Probe'', Chichester: Praxis Publishing, 2002.</ref>\n\nIts vertical thickness is estimated at 5 m its mass at around 1.1{{E-sp|18}} kg, and its [[optical depth]] varies from 0.05 to 0.12.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} That is, between 5 and 12 percent of light shining perpendicularly through the ring is blocked, so that when seen from above, the ring is close to transparent.

Within the gap lies the bright but narrow Colombo Ringlet, centered at 77,883&nbsp;km from Saturn's center, which is slightly [[ellipse|elliptical]] rather than circular. This ringlet is also called the Titan Ringlet as it is governed by an orbital resonance with the moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].<ref name=\"Porco1984\" /> At this location within the rings, the length of a ring particle's [[apsidal precession]] is equal to the length of Titan's orbital motion, so that the outer end of this eccentric ringlet always points towards Titan.<ref name=\"Porco1984\">{{cite journal |display-authors=1 |last=Porco |first=C. |authorlink=Carolyn Porco |last2=Nicholson |first2=P.

There are wave-like structures in the middle of both rings.

Its thickness is estimated as 5 to 15 m and its optical depth varies from 0.4 to greater than 5,<ref name=\"Hedman2016\" /> meaning that >99% of the light passing through some parts of the B Ring is blocked. The B Ring contains a great deal of variation in its density and brightness, nearly all of it unexplained. These are concentric, appearing as narrow ringlets, though the B Ring does not contain any gaps.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}. In places, the outer edge of the B Ring contains vertical structures deviating up to 2.5&nbsp;km from the main ring plane.\n\nA 2016 study of spiral density waves using stellar occultations indicated that the B Ring's surface density is in the range of 40 to 140 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, lower than previously believed, and that the ring's optical depth has little correlation with its mass density (a finding previously reported for the A and C rings).<ref name=\"Hedman2016\">{{cite journal|last1= Hedman|first1= M.M.|last2= Nicholson|first2= P.D.|title=The B-ring's surface mass density from hidden density waves: Less than meets the eye?|journal= Icarus|volume= 279|pages= 109\u2013124|date= 2016-01-22|doi= 10.1016/j.icarus.2016.01.007|arxiv = 1601.07955 |bibcode = 2016Icar..279..109H }}</ref><ref name=\"NASA-20160202\">{{cite web |last=Dyches |first=Preston |title=Saturn's Rings: Less than Meets the Eye? |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4886 |work=[[NASA]] |date=2 February 2016 |accessdate=3 February 2016 }}</ref> The total mass of the B Ring was estimated to be somewhere in the range of 7 to {{val|24|e=18}} kg.

It was discovered in 1675 by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]] at the [[Paris Observatory]] using a [[refracting telescope]] that had a 2.5-inch [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with a 20-foot-long [[focal length]] and a 90x [[magnification]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Thomas William|title=Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes|url=https://archive.org/details/celestialobject02webbgoog|year=1859|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|page=[https://archive.org/details/celestialobject02webbgoog/page/n154 130]}}</ref><ref>Archie Frederick Collins, The greatest eye in the world: astronomical telescopes and their stories, page 8</ref> From Earth it appears as a thin black gap in the rings.

Ring particles at this location orbit twice for every orbit of the moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Unit6/rings.html|title=Lecture 41: Planetary Rings|work=ohio-state.edu}}</ref> The resonance causes Mimas' pulls on these ring particles to accumulate, destabilizing their orbits and leading to a sharp cutoff in ring density. Many of the other gaps between ringlets within the Cassini Division, however, are unexplained.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n=== Huygens Gap ===\nThe Huygens Gap is located at the inner edge of the Cassini Division. It contains the dense, eccentric Huygens Ringlet in the middle. This ringlet exhibits irregular [[azimuthal]] variations of geometrical width and optical depth, which may be caused by the nearby 2:1 resonance with [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and the influence of the eccentric outer edge of the B-ring. There is an additional narrow ringlet just outside the Huygens Ringlet.<ref name=Porco2005/>\n\n== A Ring ==\n{{redirect|A Ring|the letter|\u00c5}}\n[[File:PIA06534 Encke Division.jpg|thumb|left|The central ringlet of the A Ring's Encke Gap coincides with [[Pan (moon)|Pan]]'s orbit, implying its particles oscillate in [[horseshoe orbit]]s.]]\nThe A Ring is the outermost of the large, bright rings. Its inner boundary is the [[#Cassini Division|Cassini Division]] and its sharp outer boundary is close to the orbit of the small moon [[Atlas (moon)|Atlas]]. The A Ring is interrupted at a location 22% of the ring width from its outer edge by the [[#Encke Gap|Encke Gap]]. A narrower gap 2% of the ring width from the outer edge is called the [[#Keeler Gap|Keeler Gap]].\n\nThe thickness of the A Ring is estimated to be 10 to 30 m, its surface density from 35 to 40 g/cm<sup>2</sup> and its total mass as 4 to {{val|5|e=18}} kg<ref name=\"Hedman2016\" /> (just under the mass of [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]]). Its optical depth varies from 0.4 to 0.9.<ref name=\"Hedman2016\" />\n\nSimilarly to the B Ring, the A Ring's outer edge is maintained by orbital resonances, albeit in this case a more complicated set. It is primarily acted on by the 7:6 resonance with [[Janus (moon)|Janus]] and [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]], with other contributions from the 5:3 resonance with [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and various resonances with [[Prometheus (moon)|Prometheus]] and [[Pandora (moon)|Pandora]].{{sfn|El Moutamid et al|2015}}<ref name=\"Spahn2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Spahn |first1=Frank |last2=Hoffmann |first2=Holger |last3=Sei\u00df |first3=Martin |last4=Seiler |first4=Michael |last5=Gr\u00e4tz |first5=Fabio M. |title=The radial density profile of Saturn's A ring |date=19 June 2019 |language=en|arxiv=1906.08036 }}</ref> Other orbital resonances also excite many [[Density wave theory|spiral density waves]] in the A Ring (and, to a lesser extent, other rings as well), which account for most of its structure.

In 1610, the year after [[Galileo Galilei]] turned a [[telescope]] to the sky, he became the first person to observe Saturn's rings, though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature. In 1655, [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first person to describe them as a disk surrounding Saturn.<ref name=\"history_of_the_rings\" /> Although many people think of Saturn's rings as being made up of a series of tiny ringlets (a concept that goes back to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]]),<ref name=\"history_of_the_rings\" /> true gaps are few. It is more correct to think of the rings as an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular disk]] with [[concentric]] local [[maxima and minima]] in density and brightness.<ref name=\"Tiscareno\" /> On the scale of the clumps within the rings there is much empty space.\n\nThe rings have numerous gaps where particle density drops sharply: two opened by known moons embedded within them, and many others at locations of known destabilizing [[orbital resonance]]s with the [[moons of Saturn]]. Other gaps remain unexplained. Stabilizing resonances, on the other hand, are responsible for the longevity of several rings, such as the [[#Colombo Gap and Titan Ringlet|Titan Ringlet]] and the [[#G Ring|G Ring]].\n\nWell beyond the main rings is the [[#Phoebe ring|Phoebe ring]], which is presumed to originate from [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] and thus to share its [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]] orbital motion. It is aligned with the plane of Saturn's orbit. [[Saturn]] has an axial tilt of 27 degrees, so this ring is tilted at an angle of 27 degrees to the more visible rings orbiting above Saturn's equator.  \n[[File:Saturn and its 3 moons.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|''[[Voyager 2]]'' view of [[Saturn]] casting a shadow across its rings.

He had been making observations of the planet Saturn from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in ''De corpore saturni,'' in which he came close to suggesting the planet had a ring. However Wren was unsure whether the ring was independent of the planet, or physically attached to it.

Within the Roche limit, bodies of rocky material are dense enough to accrete additional material, whereas less-dense bodies of ice are not. Once outside the rings, the newly formed moons could have continued to evolve through random mergers. This process may explain the variation in silicate content of Saturn's moons out to Rhea, as well as the trend towards less silicate content closer to Saturn. Rhea would then be the oldest of the moons formed from the primordial rings, with moons closer to Saturn being progressively younger.<ref name=\"Charnoz_2011\" />\n\nThe brightness and purity of the water ice in Saturn's rings has also been cited as evidence that the rings are much younger than Saturn,<ref name=\"Gohd-surprisingly\"/> as the infall of meteoric dust would have led to darkening of the rings. However, new research indicates that the B Ring may be massive enough to have diluted infalling material and thus avoided substantial darkening over the age of the Solar System.

Along with the C Ring, which was discovered in 1850 and is similar in character to the Cassini Division, these regions constitute the ''main rings''. The main rings are denser and contain larger particles than the tenuous ''dusty rings''. The latter include the D Ring, extending inward to Saturn's cloud tops, the G and E Rings and others beyond the main ring system. These diffuse rings are characterised as \"dusty\" because of the small size of their particles (often about a [[micrometre|\u03bcm]]); their chemical composition is, like the main rings, almost entirely water ice. The narrow F Ring, just off the outer edge of the A Ring, is more difficult to categorize; parts of it are very dense, but it also contains a great deal of dust-size particles.\n{{Clear}}\n{{wide image|Saturn's rings dark side mosaic.jpg|2200px|Natural-color mosaic of ''Cassini'' narrow-angle camera images of the unilluminated side of Saturn's D, C, B, A and F rings (left to right) taken on May 9, 2007 (distances are to the planet's center).}}\n\n=== Physical parameters of the rings ===\n''Notes:''<br />\n<sup>(1)</sup> Names as designated by the [[International Astronomical Union]], unless otherwise noted.

The [[Cassini\u2013Huygens#Instruments|Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument]] (MIMI) observed a gentle gradient punctuated by three sharp drops in plasma flow on each side of the moon in a nearly symmetric pattern. This could be explained if they were absorbed by solid material in the form of an equatorial disk containing denser rings or arcs, with particles perhaps several decimeters to approximately a meter in diameter. A more recent piece of evidence consistent with the presence of Rhean rings is a set of small ultraviolet-bright spots distributed in a line that extends three quarters of the way around the moon's circumference, within 2 degrees of the equator.
