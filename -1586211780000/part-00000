This was followed by a season at the [[Newcastle Knights]], and another in England at [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]], with whom he won the 2001 [[Challenge Cup]] Final. In 2020 he was names as an Immortal for St Helens. Since retiring in 2001 he has spent the last 15 years coaching in the NRL mainly as an assistant coach. Teams he has worked at include the Newcastle Knights, Parramatta Eels, New Zealand Warriors and Penrith Panthers.\n\n==Playing career==\nWhile attending Gosford High School, Fairleigh played for the [[Australia national schoolboys rugby league team|Australian Schoolboys team]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=SportingPulse Homepage for Australian Secondary Schools Rugby League|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-2130-0-0-0&sID=26424|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=SportingPulse}}</ref> He made his first grade d\u00e9but for the [[North Sydney Bears|Bears]] in round 17 of 1989 and for ten seasons from 1990 was a permanent first grade player and North Sydney stalwart. During this period he was consistently one of the dominant forwards in the NRL. He made his [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] d\u00e9but in game III of 1991, Fairleigh was selected for the New South Wales team on the interchange bench. He was not selected in 1992 but appeared again in 1993 off the interchange bench in games I & II and as a prop-forward in the run-on side of game III.\n\nHe played State of Origin from 1991 to 1997, playing in 10 games. Although not selected for Origin in 1994, Fairleigh won the [[Dally M Medal|Rothman's Medal]] in 1994 for the best and fairest player in the NRL with a record tally of 33 votes. Fairleigh made his Test d\u00e9but for [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] in a [[1994 French rugby league Oceania tour|one-off test]] against [[France national rugby league team|France]] when [[Bradley Clyde]] withdrew. At the end of the [[1994 NSWRL season]], he was one of the first forwards selected for the [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]].  He appeared in twelve minor tour matches and two Tests, scoring five tries on tour. He had been selected as a reserve for the second Test but withdrew on the morning of the match with a virus. He played in the third Test against Great Britain and in the sole test against France, scoring a try in the 74-0 drubbing. His Origin (and national) representative careers benefitted from the fracas of the [[Super League war]] and he appeared in all three games of the 1995 and 1997 series for a career total of ten appearances for the [[New South Wales Rugby League team|Blues]]. He was also selected in the Australian team to play against Fiji and Papua New Guinea in 1996. In 1996 he was named in the World Team and was named Dally M Second Row of the Year. He was second in the Rothmans Medal in 1996 behind teammate [[Jason Taylor (rugby league)|Jason Taylor]].\n\nFairleigh played a total of 193 games for Norths and played in 3 of their 4 preliminary final losses during the 1990s as the club fell agonizingly short of a grand final appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2015/09/24/top-10-preliminary-final-heartbreaks/|title=Top 10 preliminary final heartbreaks|website=www.nrl.com}}</ref>\n\nFollowing North's merger with [[Manly Warringah Sea Eagles]] at the end of 1999, Fairleigh moved to Newcastle and was in 2000 named the club's Player of the Year, Players' Player and Coach's Player of the Year. 2001 saw him finish his club career with a season for [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in England where he was named in the Super League Dream Team as well being chosen as one of St Helens 100 greatest players. The same year he played in the winning St Helens team in the 100th Challenge Cup Final against Bradford Bulls at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]]. As [[Super League V]] champions, [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] played against [[2000 NRL season|2000 NRL]] Premiers, the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in the [[2001 World Club Challenge]].

He spent 5 years developing Rugby League in the Cook Islands with a special focus on developing a competitive  International programme. 'The Kukis' going into the 2013 World Cup Tournament had never  won a World Cup match. The team lost to the [[United States national rugby league team|USA]] and [[Tonga national rugby league team|Tonga]], but they won their last match against the Tournament co-hosts [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] creating history for the sport of [[rugby league]] in the [[Cook Islands]]. As part of the World Cup qualification process the Cook Islands beat Samoa in a play-off to enter the Pacific Cup in 2009. The Cook Islands then went on to beat Fiji 24-22 in the Semi Final and were then beaten by Papua New Guinea in the Final. In 2016 Fairleigh took time off from coaching NRL football to give back to grassroots football.
