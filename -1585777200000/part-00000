It was first published in 1945, and appeared in revised and expanded editions in 1949 and 1956; the third and final edition appeared in 1968. It has been called \"the first truly insightful English-language Chinese cookbook\",{{sfnb|Mendelson|2016| p = ix}} and is the source of commonly used English terms for Chinese cooking techniques such as \"[[stir fry]]\" and \"[[pot stickers]]\".{{sfnb|Hayford|2012|p =  }} \n\n[[Pearl S. Buck]], at that time the most widely read American author on the subject of China, wrote in her Preface to the book that she wanted to nominate Mrs. Chao for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]: \"what better road to universal peace is there than to gather around the table where new and delicious dishes are set forth, dishes which, though yet untasted by us, we are destined to enjoy and love?\"{{sfnb|Chao|1945| p = 20}}\n\n==Background==\nDuring [[World War II]], Mrs. Chao's husband, Yuen Ren Chao, ran the Special Language Training Program at Harvard to teach Chinese to American soldiers. Each night the instructors gathered at the Chao home to prepare the teaching material for the next day, sometimes late into the night. Mrs. Chao developed a repertoire of dishes to feed them that could be prepared in an American kitchen using ingredients from local groceries.{{sfnb|Hayford|2012| pp = 77-79}} Then Agnes Hocking, wife of Harvard professor [[William Ernest Hocking]], and friend of many years, told her to write the book.{{sfnb|Chao|1945| p = xiii}}\n\nHer \"Author's Note\" explains she was \"ashamed\" to have written it, first because as a medical doctor she should have been practicing medicine, second: \"I didn't write the book\".{{sfnb|Chao|1945| p = xii}} She goes on to explain how she, her daughter [[Rulan Chao Pian|Rulan]] and her husband collaborated:\n:The way I didn\u2019t was like this. You know I speak little English and write less. So I cooked my dishes in Chinese, my daughter Rulan put my Chinese into English, and my husband, finding the English dull, put much of it back into Chinese again.<ref>Hayford (2012) p. 78, quoting from ''How To Cook and Eat'', p. 21</ref>\n\n[[Jason Epstein]], who met Mr. and Mrs. Chao when he edited the 1972 reprint of the book, claims \"it is obvious from the text that the professor wrote the entire book in his wife's name, using her recipes,\" that is, \"pretending to be his wife....\" <ref>{{cite| first = Jason| last = Epstein| year = 2010|title = Eating| publisher = Knopf Doubleday | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o-2JDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=Mrs.+Chao%27s+cookbook&source=bl&ots=evWJVecaEt&sig=20zjENTWIY6a3BG3j7qbHwxALVU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV4_HU1uHTAhWjj1QKHfhtCro4ChDoAQgsMAI#v=onepage&q=Mrs.%20Chao's%20cookbook&f=false | pages = 103\u2013105}}</ref> The only evidence he invokes in support of this claim, however, is that Buwei Yang Chao did not speak or write much English. It is clear from the collaboration method described however that Buwei Yang Chao wrote the book in Chinese, which was then translated into English by her daughter and revised by her husband. Yuen Ren confirms this working process in a 1977 interview.\"<ref>Chao, Yuen Ren.

The ingredients are generally limited to those available in the local markets in larger cities, though soy sauce, scallions, and sherry are used in most recipes.

This section includes an account of the types of meals eaten in different parts of China by different classes of people and explains the difference between a meal \u2014 \"''fan'', a period of rice\" \u2014 and a snack \u2014 ''[[dian xin]]'' \"something to dot the heart\". Chao describes the customary behavior, for instance at the end of a banquet, with what Janet Theophano calls \"a spirit of frivolity and playfulness\".{{sfnb|Theophano|2002| p = 260}}\n\nIndividual chapters then deal with \"Eating Materials\", \"Cooking Materials\", \"Cooking and Eating Utensils\", \"Methods of Readying\", and \"Methods of Cooking\". Chapter V, \"Methods of Readying\" has sub-sections on \"Cleaning\", \"Cutting, Picking etc.\", \"Mixing and Fixing\", and \"Precooking\". Precise directions tell how to perform such tasks as \"rolling knife pieces\" ({{zh-cp|c=\u6efe\u5200\u584a|p=g\u01d4n d\u0101o ku\u00e0i}}) on a carrot or other crisp vegetable. There are detailed descriptions, observations, and directives on these cooking techniques.{{sfnb|Hayford|2012| p = 79-80}}\n\nSometimes humor colors the description, as with that of ''chao'' ({{lang|zh|\u7092}} ''ch\u01ceo''), for which Chao created the English term \"stir-fry\":\n\n::with its aspiration, low-rising tone and all, cannot be accurately translated into English.

A final chapter is \"Meals and Menus\".\n\n==Reception and commentary== \nThe ''New York Times'' review of the 1945 first edition called it \"something novel in the way of a cook book\" and said that it \"strikes us as being an authentic account of the Chinese culinary system, which is every bit as complicated as the culture that has produced it\".<ref>Jane Holt \"[https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/international-affairs/year-of-china/sites/brown.edu.about.administration.international-affairs.year-of-china/files/uploads/New%20York%20Times%20Cookbook%20Review1945.pdf Cook Book Review],\" New York Times 1945</ref><ref>Quoted in Theophano, \u201cHome Cooking,\u201d p. 139.</ref>\n\nLater writers have seen the work as more than a collection of recipes.

Two laws of 1864 introduced the office of prefect into the new Romanian state, modelled on the [[Prefect (France)|French equivalent]]. Another law was enacted in 1872, while an 1883 law reduced the prefect's role to executing Government decisions. The office was strengthened by law in 1892; it was provided that \"at the head of each county there is a prefect...named by royal decree, upon the recommendation of the Minister of the Interior...he represents the executive power in the entire district placed under his administration\". The 1925 law for administrative unity regarded the prefect as the representative of the central authorities, with power to control local officials. Named by royal decree following a recommendation of the Interior Minister, the prefect, aside from fulfilling general conditions for civil servants, had to be at least thirty years of age and to have completed a state-recognised university. Prefects already in office for at least a year were exempt.<ref name=\"Arges\">{{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120520002501/http://www.prefecturaarges.ro:8080/prefectura/index.jsp?pagina=scurt_istoric Short History], Arge\u0219 County Prefecture</ref>\n\nA 1929 law was the first to distinguish between appointed and elected local authorities. The prefect was no longer the head of the county administration, but the \"representative of the government\", charged with exercising \"control and supervision over all local authorities\". The central authorities named him; he represented executive power. The law created a new institution, the county administrative commission, and the prefect was its president. In 1936, a law was adopted enhancing the prefect's powers: he was now head of the county administration, supervising all cultural institutions and public services. He was also chief of [[Romanian Police|police]] and of the [[Jandarmeria Rom\u00e2n\u0103|gendarmerie]]. In 1938, following the imposition of a royal dictatorship by King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] (''see [[National Renaissance Front]]''), the counties' administrative autonomy was abolished in favour of the larger ''\u0163inuturi''. The prefect, named by royal decree, became a career bureaucrat, able to name mayors of rural and non-resident urban communes and to designate ''ex officio'' members of the town councils.<ref name=\"Arges\"/> Under the dictatorship, prefects were active-duty military officers with the rank of colonel or higher.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Florin Grecu, [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/172/art08-Grecu.php \"Regimul \u015fi principiile Constitu\u0163iei de la 1938\" (\"The Regime and Principles of the 1938 Constitution\")], ''Sfera politicii'', nr. 172, November-December 2012; accessed August 4, 2013</ref>\n\nFrom 1940 to 1944, during the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship and based on a decree-law of September 1940, the prefect was restored as a public functionary, with the counties again having their own juridical personality, income and budget. The prefect's role as representative of the Government was also brought back.<ref name=\"Arges\"/> The new prefects were named on September 20, and in forty-five counties, they belonged to the [[Iron Guard]].

The office&mdash;one that represented the Government locally and headed devolved public services of ministries and other agencies&mdash;was enshrined in the constitution passed by referendum in December 1991, as well as by a law that year and in 2001. Further legislative reform began with the 2004 Law on the Prefect.<ref name=\"Arges\"/> This de-politicised the office of prefect and deputy prefect, making them high public functionaries who occupy their positions through competitive selection.

Two laws of 1864 introduced the office of prefect into the new Romanian state, modelled on the [[Prefect (France)|French equivalent]]. Another law was enacted in 1872, while an 1883 law reduced the prefect's role to executing Government decisions. The office was strengthened by law in 1892; it was provided that \"at the head of each county there is a prefect...named by royal decree, upon the recommendation of the Minister of the Interior...he represents the executive power in the entire district placed under his administration\". The 1925 law for administrative unity regarded the prefect as the representative of the central authorities, with power to control local officials. Named by royal decree following a recommendation of the Interior Minister, the prefect, aside from fulfilling general conditions for civil servants, had to be at least thirty years of age and to have completed a state-recognised university. Prefects already in office for at least a year were exempt.<ref name=\"Arges\">{{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120520002501/http://www.prefecturaarges.ro:8080/prefectura/index.jsp?pagina=scurt_istoric Short History], Arge\u015f County Prefecture</ref>\n\nA 1929 law was the first to distinguish between appointed and elected local authorities. The prefect was no longer the head of the county administration, but the \"representative of the government\", charged with exercising \"control and supervision over all local authorities\". The central authorities named him; he represented executive power. The law created a new institution, the county administrative commission, and the prefect was its president. In 1936, a law was adopted enhancing the prefect's powers: he was now head of the county administration, supervising all cultural institutions and public services. He was also chief of [[Romanian Police|police]] and of the [[Jandarmeria Rom\u00e2n\u0103|gendarmerie]]. In 1938, following the imposition of a royal dictatorship by King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] (''see [[National Renaissance Front]]''), the counties' administrative autonomy was abolished in favour of the larger ''\u0163inuturi''. The prefect, named by royal decree, became a career bureaucrat, able to name mayors of rural and non-resident urban communes and to designate ''ex officio'' members of the town councils.<ref name=\"Arges\"/> Under the dictatorship, prefects were active-duty military officers with the rank of colonel or higher.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Florin Grecu, [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/172/art08-Grecu.php \"Regimul \u015fi principiile Constitu\u0163iei de la 1938\" (\"The Regime and Principles of the 1938 Constitution\")], ''Sfera politicii'', nr. 172, November-December 2012; accessed August 4, 2013</ref>\n\nFrom 1940 to 1944, during the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship and based on a decree-law of September 1940, the prefect was restored as a public functionary, with the counties again having their own juridical personality, income and budget. The prefect's role as representative of the Government was also brought back.<ref name=\"Arges\"/> The new prefects were named on September 20, and in forty-five counties, they belonged to the [[Iron Guard]].

This was largely due to the fact that the U.S. entered the war much later, when most of the European countries were already pressured to advance their aircraft technologies to outcompete one another. The Europeans had already developed standardized [[mass production]] of aircraft, while the U.S. was forced to expand to meet their wartime necessities. Even so, most of the aircraft used by the U.S. in wartime were from Britain or France. In August 1917, Congress passed the Aero Bill which dedicated $640 million towards aircraft production; however, the U.S. economy overall was unable to successfully transition into a mass-producing aircraft industry in such a short amount of time.<ref>The American Aerospace Industry: From Workshop to Global Enterprise.

Because the bulk of the aircraft demand had come from military uses, the post-war period resulted in a surplus of aircraft left over from wartime accompanied by a lack of demand, creating an excess supply of unused aircraft.\n\nMilitary aviation dominated the aircraft industry up until the mid-1920s, and it was during the late 1920s when civil aviation appeared and began to rise. Beginning in the mid-1920s, in order to sustain the existence of the aircraft industry, the U.S. government endorsed and subsidized airlines to carry [[airmail]] throughout the country, leading to the U.S. having the largest airmail system in the world. The U.S. implemented the Kelly Airmail Act of 1925 which induced competition amongst airlines and eventually led to the expansion from carrying mail to carrying people and commercial goods. The emergence of an expansive airmail system allowed for easier and faster correspondence and transport. Aircraft as a means of passenger travel also began to emerge during this time period, though passenger [[air travel]] did not surge until after [[World War II]]. Unemployment was not significantly affected by the emergence of the civil aviation industry, as the jobs that were created were occupied by people who previously worked in the army and were then unemployed after the war's end.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|jstor=4468514|title=Growth of the Airline Industry|first=Schroeder|last=Boulton|date=15 November 2017|journal=The Analysts Journal|volume=11|issue=4|pages=29\u201332}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nU.S. aircraft production surged throughout World War II. The U.S. experienced an immense amount of government spending on defense production and a shift from automobile production to aircraft production. At the beginning of the war, the U.S.' aircraft production was one of the lowest in the world, but by 1945, the U.S. aircraft production alone had already produced more than a third of the world's total aircraft production. Aircraft production made up the most of the U.S.' manufacturing output during the World War II era from 1940\u20131945, contributing to the surge in GDP growth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usaaf.net/digest/aircraft_and_equipment.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808032032/http://www.usaaf.net/digest/aircraft_and_equipment.htm |archive-date=2014-08-08 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the airline industry in response to wartime needs also led to higher demand for labor. Increasingly more pilots, flight staff, engineers, and researchers were needed to operate the aircraft as well as develop advanced technology, leading to increased job creation. During this time, unemployment rates decreased significantly, dropping to nearly the full employment rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c2644.pdf|title= The Measurement and Behavior of Unemployment|website=Nber.org|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Post WWII===\nThe end of World War II, immediately followed by demobilization, led to airplane companies losing a total of $35 million in 1946 in sales and $115 million in 1947. There was once again an excess in aircraft supply post-war and not a high enough corresponding demand. Accordingly, unemployment increased slightly by 2% in the 2 years following the end of World War II. However, with the technological improvements in passenger travel safety and comfort, accompanied by an increasing demand in commercial aviation, the airline industry was soon driving revenues that were 500% of its revenues by 1945. This increase in commercial demand was also fueled by an increase in consumer confidence in airlines, reinforced by the creation of the Federal Aviation Administration in 1958, which managed aviation safety.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nEconomist [[Alfred E. Kahn|Alfred Kahn]] became the chairman of the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] in the mid-1970s, which eventually led to Congress passing the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] of 1978. This allowed for free market competition in the airline industry, to meet the pressure of the decreasing world price of air travel. This ultimately allowed the U.S. airline industry to operate competitively in the international market.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/intro/airlineindustry.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-24 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141015015550/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/intro/airlineindustry.html |archive-date=2014-10-15 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Twenty-first century===\nThe American airline industry has suffered significantly as a result of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11]]. The attacks of September 11 dramatically decreased consumer confidence in the airline industry. The airline industry lost more than $330 million each day within the first week of the attack, totaling losses between $1 and $2 billion. In the following years, the decrease in demand accompanied by the decreasing price of air travel reduced revenues immensely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/may020503.pdf|title=Statement of James C.

Another large part of airline expenses comes from wages for employees, which make up 40% of airlines' expenses.  To compensate for rising costs and decreasing revenues, airlines have decreased the number of planes in service and thus have also laid off workers, negatively impacting the economy's unemployment rate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/FAA_Economic_Impact_Rpt_2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611205215/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/FAA_Economic_Impact_Rpt_2011.pdf |archive-date=2014-06-11 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Annual U.S. Schedule Service Passenger Airlines Financial Reports, $ millions<ref name=bts26_16rev>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/bts26_16rev.pdf\n|title= 4th Quarter 2015 Airline Financial Data\n|publisher= [[Bureau of Transportation Statistics]]\n|date= May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The U.S. has three major international carriers ([[Delta Air Lines]], [[American Airlines]], and [[United Airlines]]) and eight additional large carriers that operate mainly domestic flights but have some international destinations ([[Alaska Airlines]], [[Allegiant Air]], [[Frontier Airlines]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[Southwest Airlines]], [[Spirit Airlines]], and [[Sun Country Airlines]]). At the end of 2014, the three international carriers plus Southwest controlled more than 80% of all passenger travel in the U.S. market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/12/29/airtran-airways/|title=Two decades after launch, AirTran takes its final flight|website=Mashable.com|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere is currently no government regulation of ticket pricing, although the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] retains jurisdiction over aircraft safety, pilot training, and accident investigations (through the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]]).  The [[Transportation Security Administration]] provides security at airports and the federal government provides billions of dollars annually to maintain air transport facilities and manage the country's air traffic control system.\n\nMany airlines operate on a \"[[hub and spoke]]\" model. This system gives the predominant airline in a given airport a strong competitive position as it feeds passengers to and from the hub, maximizing the number of passengers on each flight. Examples of airline hubs include [[United Airlines]] at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]], [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Liberty]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago-O'Hare]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]] and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]]; [[Delta Air Lines]] at [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport|Cincinnati]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit]], [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis,]] and [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle]]; and [[American Airlines]] at [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], Chicago-O'Hare, [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]] and [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix]].\n\n===Air cargo===\n[[Air cargo]] comprises a large number of daily flights in the United States and are operated by private parcel companies such as [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service]].  These organizations operate some of the largest fleets in the world.  Most air cargo moved by these organizations is time sensitive overnight and 2nd day parcels.  The [[U.S. Postal Service]] also moves much of its letters and time sensitive parcels via air, but on regularly scheduled passenger flights.  At one time the U.S. Mail charged a premium for letters sent by [[airmail]], but no longer does so except for overnight express mail.\n\n==Delays==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n!colspan=2|Ranking of Major Airports by Lowest <br />On-Time Arrival Performance (2007)<ref>GAO report, p. 12</ref>\n|-\n|'''Airport'''\n|'''% on time'''\n|-\n|[[LaGuardia Airport|New York- LaGuardia]]||58.48\n|-\n|[[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]]||59.45\n|-\n|[[John F.

For cities closer together in the Northeastern part of the country (e.g. [[Boston]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], and [[Washington D.C.]]), the [[Northeast Corridor]] rail line carries the majority of intercity traffic.\n\nSince the start of the [[Great Recession]], air traffic in the U.S. has declined and the U.S. government reported 1.2 million fewer scheduled domestic flights in 2013 than in 2007 (with decreases averaging between 9 and 24% at large and medium-sized airports, respectively).<ref name=\"transportation.house.gov\"/> At the same time, the airline industry has also experienced rapid consolidation with all of nation's largest carriers experiencing mergers.<ref name=\"transportation.house.gov\"/> The average domestic airline fare steadily increased from 2009 until the first quarter of 2017 where it retreated to the same average of 2009, the lowest the average fare has been since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/airfares/programs/economics_and_finance/air_travel_price_index/html/AnnualFares.html|title=Annual U.S. Domestic Average Itinerary Fare in Current and Constant Dollars - Bureau of Transportation Statistics|website=Rita.dot.gov|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===World War I===\nWhen the U.S. entered the [[World War I]] in April 1917, it had already been lagging behind its European counterparts in aircraft production. This was largely due to the fact that the U.S. entered the war much later, when most of the European countries were already pressured to advance their aircraft technologies to outcompete one another. The Europeans had already developed standardized [[mass production]] of aircraft, while the U.S. was forced to expand to meet their wartime necessities. Even so, most of the aircraft used by the U.S. in wartime were from Britain or France. In August 1917, Congress passed the Aero Bill which dedicated $640 million towards aircraft production; however, the U.S. economy overall was unable to successfully transition into a mass-producing aircraft industry in such a short amount of time.<ref>The American Aerospace Industry: From Workshop to Global Enterprise.

Because the bulk of the aircraft demand had come from military uses, the post-war period resulted in a surplus of aircraft left over from wartime accompanied by a lack of demand, creating an excess supply of unused aircraft.\n\nMilitary aviation dominated the aircraft industry up until the mid-1920s, and it was during the late 1920s when civil aviation appeared and began to rise. Beginning in the mid-1920s, in order to sustain the existence of the aircraft industry, the U.S. government endorsed and subsidized airlines to carry [[airmail]] throughout the country, leading to the U.S. having the largest airmail system in the world. The U.S. implemented the Kelly Airmail Act of 1925 which induced competition amongst airlines and eventually led to the expansion from carrying mail to carrying people and commercial goods. The emergence of an expansive airmail system allowed for easier and faster correspondence and transport. Aircraft as a means of passenger travel also began to emerge during this time period, though passenger [[air travel]] did not surge until after [[World War II]]. Unemployment was not significantly affected by the emergence of the civil aviation industry, as the jobs that were created were occupied by people who previously worked in the army and were then unemployed after the war's end.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|jstor=4468514|title=Growth of the Airline Industry|first=Schroeder|last=Boulton|date=15 November 2017|journal=The Analysts Journal|volume=11|issue=4|pages=29\u201332}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nU.S. aircraft production surged throughout World War II. The U.S. experienced an immense amount of government spending on defense production and a shift from automobile production to aircraft production. At the beginning of the war, the U.S.' aircraft production was one of the lowest in the world, but by 1945, the U.S. aircraft production alone had already produced more than a third of the world's total aircraft production. Aircraft production made up the most of the U.S.' manufacturing output during the World War II era from 1940-1945, contributing to the surge in GDP growth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usaaf.net/digest/aircraft_and_equipment.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808032032/http://www.usaaf.net/digest/aircraft_and_equipment.htm |archive-date=2014-08-08 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the airline industry in response to wartime needs also led to higher demand for labor. Increasingly more pilots, flight staff, engineers, and researchers were needed to operate the aircraft as well as develop advanced technology, leading to increased job creation. During this time, unemployment rates decreased significantly, dropping to nearly the full employment rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c2644.pdf|title= The Measurement and Behavior of Unemployment|website=Nber.org|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Post WWII===\nThe end of World War II, immediately followed by demobilization, led to airplane companies losing a total of $35 million in 1946 in sales and $115 million in 1947. There was once again an excess in aircraft supply post-war and not a high enough corresponding demand. Accordingly, unemployment increased slightly by 2% in the 2 years following the end of World War II. However, with the technological improvements in passenger travel safety and comfort, accompanied by an increasing demand in commercial aviation, the airline industry was soon driving revenues that were 500% of its revenues by 1945. This increase in commercial demand was also fueled by an increase in consumer confidence in airlines, reinforced by the creation of the Federal Aviation Administration in 1958, which managed aviation safety.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nEconomist [[Alfred E. Kahn|Alfred Kahn]] became the chairman of the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] in the mid-1970s, which eventually led to Congress passing the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] of 1978. This allowed for free market competition in the airline industry, to meet the pressure of the decreasing world price of air travel. This ultimately allowed the U.S. airline industry to operate competitively in the international market.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/intro/airlineindustry.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-24 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141015015550/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/intro/airlineindustry.html |archive-date=2014-10-15 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Twenty-first century===\nThe American airline industry has suffered significantly as a result of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11]]. The attacks of September 11 dramatically decreased consumer confidence in the airline industry.

In the following years, the decrease in demand accompanied by the decreasing price of air travel reduced revenues immensely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/may020503.pdf|title=Statement of James C.

Another large part of airline expenses comes from wages for employees, which make up 40% of airlines' expenses.  To compensate for rising costs and decreasing revenues, airlines have decreased the number of planes in service and thus have also laid off workers, negatively impacting the economy's unemployment rate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/FAA_Economic_Impact_Rpt_2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611205215/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/FAA_Economic_Impact_Rpt_2011.pdf |archive-date=2014-06-11 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Annual U.S. Schedule Service Passenger Airlines Financial Reports, $ millions<ref name=bts26_16rev>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/bts26_16rev.pdf\n|title= 4th Quarter 2015 Airline Financial Data\n|publisher= [[Bureau of Transportation Statistics]]\n|date= May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The aircraft industry contributes to the economy through many different avenues, including manufacturing and the airline industry. As of 2009, the [[National Air Traffic Controllers Association]] reported airline operations helped \"generate $150.5 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product, while airport operations contributed an additional $44.6 billion.\"\n\n'''Economic Impact of Commercial Aviation on the U.S. Economy (2006-2009)'''\n{| class=\"Economic Impact of Commercial Aviation on the U.S. Economy (2006-2009)\"\n|-\n| Annual Economic Activity/Output  || $1.2-$1.3 trillion\n|-\n| Annual Personal Earnings  || $370\u2013$405 billion\n|-\n| Share of GDP  || 4.9-5.2 percent\n|-\n| Job Impact  || 9.7-10.5 million\n|}\n\n==Airports==\n[[File:Atlanta Airport Aerial Angle (31435634003) (2).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]], the [[world's busiest airports by passenger traffic|world's busiest airport]] by passenger traffic]]\n[[File:JFKNewYorkTerm4 1.jpg|thumb|Terminal 4 of [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], the busiest international air passenger gateway to the United States]]\n{{Further|List of airports in the United States}}\n\n===Operations===\nPublic [[airport]]s are usually constructed and operated by [[local governments]]. The main exceptions are on military bases.  Like highways and passenger rail, the federal government subsidizes air travel with $14 billion of federal funds going to airport operations in 2002.<ref name=subs>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/advocacy/resources/subsidies/transport.htm|title=U.S. Transportation Subsidies|website=Trainweb.org|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Security and regulation===\nAir transportation security in the United States is regulated by the [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]], an agency of the US Department of Homeland Security. Passengers must provide a valid federal or state-issued ID in order to be allowed onto a flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids|title=Identification|date=16 December 2014|website=Tsa.gov|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> A person must also go through a pat-down procedure or a body scan before boarding a flight to ensure that they have no prohibited items.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/pat-downs |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706043038/http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/pat-downs |archive-date=2014-07-06 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> These security policies have been adopted by the US government ever since the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 Terrorist Attacks]] in which terrorists managed to hijack several commercial airliners. Items that are prohibited on airplanes include firearms, tools, or other objects that can be used as weapons, explosive or flammable materials, and other dangerous or debilitating chemicals or substances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items#11|title=What Can I Bring?|website=Tsa.gov|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Airlines==\n{{Further|List of airlines of the United States}}\n\n===Passenger airlines===\nThe U.S. has no single [[flag airline|flag carrier]] and [[passenger airline]]s in the United States have always been privately owned. The U.S. has three major international carriers ([[Delta Air Lines]], [[American Airlines]], and [[United Airlines]]) and eight additional large carriers that operate mainly domestic flights but have some international destinations ([[Alaska Airlines]], [[Allegiant Air]], [[Frontier Airlines]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[Southwest Airlines]], [[Spirit Airlines]], and [[Sun Country Airlines]]). At the end of 2014, the three international carriers plus Southwest controlled more than 80% of all passenger travel in the U.S. market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/12/29/airtran-airways/|title=Two decades after launch, AirTran takes its final flight|website=Mashable.com|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere is currently no government regulation of ticket pricing, although the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] retains jurisdiction over aircraft safety, pilot training, and accident investigations (through the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]]).  The [[Transportation Security Administration]] provides security at airports and the federal government provides billions of dollars annually to maintain air transport facilities and manage the country's air traffic control system.\n\nMany airlines operate on a \"[[hub and spoke]]\" model. This system gives the predominant airline in a given airport a strong competitive position as it feeds passengers to and from the hub, maximizing the number of passengers on each flight. Examples of airline hubs include [[United Airlines]] at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]], [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Liberty]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago-O'Hare]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]] and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]]; [[Delta Air Lines]] at [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport|Cincinnati]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit]], [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis,]] and [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle]]; and [[American Airlines]] at [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], Chicago-O'Hare, [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]] and [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix]].\n\n===Air cargo===\n[[Air cargo]] comprises a large number of daily flights in the United States and are operated by private parcel companies such as [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service]].  These organizations operate some of the largest fleets in the world.  Most air cargo moved by these organizations is time sensitive overnight and 2nd day parcels.  The [[U.S. Postal Service]] also moves much of its letters and time sensitive parcels via air, but on regularly scheduled passenger flights.  At one time the U.S. Mail charged a premium for letters sent by [[airmail]], but no longer does so except for overnight express mail.\n\n==Delays==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n!colspan=2|Ranking of Major Airports by Lowest <br />On-Time Arrival Performance (2007)<ref>GAO report, p. 12</ref>\n|-\n|'''Airport'''\n|'''% on time'''\n|-\n|[[LaGuardia Airport|New York- LaGuardia]]||58.48\n|-\n|[[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]]||59.45\n|-\n|[[John F.

The [[California High Speed Rail]] project has been justified among other things as a ways to decrease congestion and thereby delays on the busy San Francisco Bay Area - Metro Los Angeles air corridor.\n\n==Network statistics==\n* Airports: 14,951 (2008 est.)<ref name=\"ciafactbook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html|title=CIA&nbsp;\u2014 THe World Factbook&nbsp;\u2014 United States|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=2009-06-14}}</ref>\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* Airports with paved runways:\n** Total: '''5,146'''\n** Over 10,000&nbsp;ft: (3,048 m): '''190'''\n** 8,000&nbsp;ft (2,438 m) to 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,048 m): '''227'''\n** 5,000&nbsp;ft (1,524 m) to 8,000&nbsp;ft (2,438 m): '''1,464'''\n** 3,000&nbsp;ft (914 m) to 5,000&nbsp;ft (1,524 m): '''2,307'''\n** under 3,000&nbsp;ft (914 m): '''958''' (1999 est.)\n{{Col-break}}\n* Airports with unpaved runways:\n** Total: '''9,805'''\n** 8,000&nbsp;ft (2,438 m) to 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,048 m): '''6'''\n** 5,000&nbsp;ft (1,524 m) to 8,000&nbsp;ft (2,438 m): '''156'''\n** 3,000&nbsp;ft (914 m) to 5,000&nbsp;ft (1,524 m): '''1,734'''\n** Under 3,000&nbsp;ft (914 m): '''7,909''' (1999 est.)\n{{Col-end}}\n\n* [[Heliport]]s: '''146''' (CIA, 2007 est.)<ref name=\"ciafactbook\" />\n\n==Air traffic control==\n===National Airspace System===\n{{main|National Airspace System}}\n{{empty-section|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Next Generation Air Transportation System===\n{{main|Next Generation Air Transportation System}}\n{{empty-section|date=August 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Federal Aviation Administration]] \u2013 The national aviation authority of the United States\n* [[Space-A travel]] \u2013 A system for military-related people to travel free on military flights\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Air travel in the United States}}\n* [http://www.dot.gov/ U.S. Department of Transportation] (DOT)\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/big_picture_facet.html NASA graphic map of air travel in US], including top view, side view, and 9/11/2001\u20136 minute graphic\n* [https://www.myflightsearch.com Air Tickets booking in USA]\n\n{{World topic|Air transportation in|title=[[Aviation|Air transportation]] around the World|noredlinks=yes}}\n{{World topic|Aviation in|title=[[Aviation]] around the World|noredlinks=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Transportation in the United States| ]]\n[[Category:Aviation in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1940-1945 \u2192 1940\u20131945 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_transportation_in_the_United_States"}
