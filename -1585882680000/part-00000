Though originally a goal of only $400,000 was set to cover the costs of development and documentary filming, ''Broken Age'' became the largest crowd-funded video game project at the time, raising over 3.45 million dollars from more than 87,000 backers within the month. It remains one of [[List of highest funded crowdfunding projects|the highest-backed crowd-funded projects]] of any type, and its success helped to establish [[crowdfunding in video games|Kickstarter and other crowd-funding mechanisms]] as a viable alternative to traditional [[venture capital]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] funding for niche video game titles. The game's development was chronicled by an episodic series of documentaries produced by 2 Player Productions.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Broken Age'' is a [[point-and-click adventure game]], where the player-controlled character can be directed to move about the screen, examine objects, and talk to non-player characters to learn more about the game world. The game features two playable characters, each located in seemingly separate worlds; the player can switch from one character to the other via the game's interface at any time, but otherwise these characters do not interact in any direct way. The game employs context-sensitive actions instead of using verb lists as early adventure games would use, as Schafer stated that in essence, \"there really was always one verb, which was 'interact with'\" and opted for the more modern approach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/3/5059690/broken-age-preview | title = Broken Age built around context-based interactions, not a list of verbs | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date =2013-11-03 | accessdate = 2013-11-03 | first  = Megan | last =  Farokhmanesh  }}</ref> Each character has separate item inventories as they collect objects; items can then be used by dragging them onto context-sensitive areas on the screen or combined with other inventory items.\n\n==Plot==\n===Act 1===\n''Broken Age'' tells the story of two teenagers with no immediately apparent connection, each \"seeking to break the tradition in their lives\".<ref name=\"polygon name\"/>\n\nVella Tartine (voiced by [[Masasa Moyo]]) is a young woman living in the Badlands, a land ravaged by the Mogs, giant creatures that come from beyond a wall called the Plague Dam. They are appeased by the sacrifice of young girls at a number of Maiden's Feasts held at various villages. They appear every fourteen years for those maidens. Vella is chosen to be sacrificed to Mog Chothra at the feast in her hometown of Sugar Bunting (formerly a town made up of warriors named Steel Bunting) but concludes that if the monster could be killed, the rituals could be ended. She finds a way to escape the beast's attack and ends up in Meriloft, a small colony which rests on a cluster of semisolid clouds. They are dealing with the aftermath of their own Feast, affirming her belief that the rites are disastrous to their people and should be ended. She then finds her way to a nearby port town, Shellmound, where they are preparing for their own Feast. There she discovers the Dead Eye God's temple, which turns out to be an ancient spaceship, the Maloruna, half-buried by the sand. She is able to wake its pilot, Alex, from his three hundred year stasis, and he helps her to rig the ship's scanning system to fire a laser at Mog Chothra when he shows up for the Feast. Vella's plan works, and she is able to bring down the creature.\n\nShay Volta (voiced by [[Elijah Wood]]) is a young man and seemingly the only passenger on the spaceship Bossa Nostra (Bassinostra), an \"incubator vessel\". The ship's computer has two [[artificial intelligence]]s (A.I.s). The computer's diurnal A.I., named \"MOM\", acts as a mother figure to Shay, occupying him with infantile \"missions\" and boring routines, while preventing him from learning about or exploring anything farther than the outside of the ship. The computer's nocturnal A.I. acts as a father figure to Shay and is more understanding of Shay's desire for independence, but appears to be too busy to spend time with Shay. The computer asserts that he is part of ''Project Dandelion'', a last-ditch effort by his home planet, Loruna, to protect Shay (the only survivor of his race following the planet's destruction) and try to find a home for him. When Shay sneaks into the bowels of the ship, he finds a stowaway named Marek wearing a wolf costume. Marek claims that, unbeknownst to him, a war rages in the galaxy, and tells Shay that he needs his help to save some innocent creatures who have been imprisoned in different areas of the galaxy as a result. Marek guides Shay through various missions against the computer's knowledge and control, trying to rescue a number of the creatures at each location before their position is discovered by an enemy force. During one of these rescues, Shay refuses to leave the last creature behind, causing the ship to be attacked, and trapping Marek under a pile of debris. In the ensuing chaos, Shay is knocked unconscious.\n\nAct 1 ends when Vella, going up to the downed Mog Chothra, discovers the monster is mechanical. Shay emerges confused from inside, revealing his belief of being in space was merely part of an illusion and he was unwittingly controlling Mog Chothra. Vella attempts to punch Shay but misses and falls into Mog Chothra's mouth. The mouth closes behind her, leaving them both trapped in each other's worlds, uncertain of what to do in their new surroundings.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nShay, trapped outside Mog Chothra, is reminded that the ship's AIs are actually his real parents; his father, Ray Volta, stuck outside with Shay, warns that his mother is still trapped within. As Ray tries to find a way back inside, Shay, recovered from his shock of the outside world, takes a look around when the ship takes off, stranding them there. Shay meets Alex, learning that he was a previous subject of ''Project Dandelion''. Alex was born on his ship, the Maloruna, a Diamond Age Dandelion Cruiser. His parents never showed him any pictures of Loruna. They lived for about 20 years after the crash (280 years ago), and then died three months apart from each other; their passing was one of the reasons why he went into ''crysolation''. Before his ship's crash, Alex had a talking cello named Marek who told him to hack the controls and rescue innocent creatures, just like Shay, who realizes that they were really capturing girls.\n\nShay offers to help repair Alex's ship to return to Loruna, where Alex believes Shay's ship is heading. Meanwhile, Vella (having accidentally reactivated the computer's autopilot) works her way into the ship and encounters Marek, who is still pinned under debris. Marek directs Vella to get into the control room as to stop Shay's mother, Hope Volta. Vella pretends that she is Shay to trick his mother into opening the door, but they are both quickly locked inside by Marek, who reveals himself to be Marekai, a member of a race called the Thrush. Marekai told Hope their world was dying so she went forth and found salvation, as many have before her: their ships were the Mogs. It turns out that Loruna is not a planet but an empire beyond the Plague Dam. He then directs the ship to deliver Vella there. Meanwhile, Shay makes his way through Shellmound and Meriloft to find parts to repair Alex's ship and go back to Loruna. He retraces Vella's journey and talks to the people with whom she interacted in Act 1 and her family, as they search for her.\n\nBack on Vella's side: Vella frees herself and Hope, and the true nature of ''Project Dandelion'' is revealed: the Thrush, believing the rest of the beings on the planet to be filled with disease, barricaded themselves with the humans whom they govern beyond the Plague Dam, and over the generations, modified their normal human DNA to become \"superior\"; but also lost certain traits necessary for survival. Project Dandelion has been used to send out uniquely attuned human children from their normal human population who could locate a special maiden via the Maiden's Feasts to \"true\" their bloodline. Vella was the one Shay selected amongst the other Maidens (who are alive but held captive), and the Thrush is planning on killing her to incorporate her genetics into theirs.\n\nKnowing her potential fate, Vella creates a bomb from the ship's power core to destroy the hangar where all of the Mog ships are kept. After planting the bomb, Hope and Vella set their ship to escape. Meanwhile, Shay helps Alex reactivate his ship and they set a course directly for the Plague Dam, accompanied by Shay's father and Vella's family. Right outside the gate, the two ships collide and the Thrush starts attacking the ships, which are both stuck on autopilot. Shay and Vella work together to cause Alex's ship reactor to overheat, melting both ships together. Everyone but Shay escapes, and Vella and Hope encourage him to jump to safety; Shay jumps, just missing a ledge, but is saved by the noble sacrifice of one of his robots, Grabbin' Gary. The fused ships soon solidify, forming a bridge between the mainland and the Plague Dam. Shay and Vella finally meet. After a moment's hesitation, they smile at one another.\n\nWithin the credit sequence, it is shown that the Thrush is deposed from power, the Plague Dam is demolished, and the humans of Loruna and the Badlands form a peaceful alliance. Many images in the credits include the notable people, animals, and machines shown throughout the game living much better lives.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Announcement and fund-raising===\n[[File:Double Fine Adventure logo.jpg|thumb|right|Promotional art used to promote the project on Kickstarter, with the Double Fine two-headed baby logo, used as part of the rewards for Kickstarter backers]]\n\n''Double Fine Adventure'' was announced by way of a [[Kickstarter]] project initiated on February 8, 2012. The idea came after Double Fine's [[Tim Schafer]] was interviewed for 2 Player Productions' upcoming Kickstarter-funded documentary on the game ''[[Minecraft]]''.<ref name=\"pcworld 2player\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/250101/2_player_productions_interview.html#tk.rss_main | title = 2 Player Productions Interview | first = Dave | last= Daw | date = 2012-02-17 | accessdate= 2012-02-17 | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] }}</ref> After the interview, Schafer and 2 Player discussed the idea of the production company filming a documentary about Double Fine as a future project.<ref name=\"pcworld 2player\"/> Double Fine had already had experience as a studio being filmed during development of ''[[Psychonauts]]'' for an episode of [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]]'s ''[[Icons (TV series)|Icons]]'' series.<ref name=\"vb interview\">{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/21/double-fines-tim-schafer-on-kickstarter-success-i-did-not-expect-this-interview/ | title = Double Fine's Tim Schafer on Kickstarter success: It can happen again (interview) | publisher = [[Venture Beat]] | date = 2012-02-21 | accessdate = 2012-02-21 | first = Stefanie | last = Fogel }}</ref> When 2 Player completed the ''Minecraft'' project, around November 2011, they wanted to create a more in-depth documentary, recognizing that Double Fine had the right type of environment where such a documentary would be possible.<ref name=\"pcworld 2player\"/> The two studios began to work out the specifics of the project, but Schafer realized that publisher interference would make an honest portrayal of game development impossible. Double Fine lacked the resources to self-fund a game, and 2 Player lacked the ability to fund the film, so the two companies elected to crowd-fund the project on Kickstarter, a method Schafer had seen successfully used to raise much smaller amounts for independent game developers. The creation of a new game was initially considered \"kind of as a sidenote\" by Schafer to accommodate the documentary filming.<ref name=\"kickstarter\"/><ref name=\"gb interview\"/>\n\nThe [[adventure game]] genre was selected to offer the public a product that would not have existed without their support, and help to distinguish the project from the developer's publisher-financed work.<ref name=\"gb interview\">{{cite web | url = http://www.giantbomb.com/news/16-million-and-counting/3981/ |title = $1.6 Million and Counting | first = Patrick | last = Klepek | date = 2012-02-13 | accessdate = 2012-02-13 | publisher = [[Giant Bomb]] }}</ref> Schafer, a veteran of [[LucasArts adventure games|LucasArts]], has long been associated with adventure games, a genre that has long been stigmatized as commercially niche, particularly since the release of Schafer's own ''[[Grim Fandango]]''.<ref name=\"kickstarter\">{{cite web | url = http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/66710809/double-fine-adventure | title = Double Fine Adventure | publisher = [[Double Fine Productions]] | date = 2012-02-08 | accessdate = 2012-02-09 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Andrew Simon|date=2017|title=Crowdfunding Nostalgia: Kickstarter and the Revival of Classic PC Game Genres|journal=The Computer Games Journal|language=en|volume=6|issue=1\u20132|pages=17\u201332|doi=10.1007/s40869-017-0031-x|issn=2052-773X}}</ref> In his pitch to the public, Schafer argued that funding for such a project would be very difficult to come by, stating \"If I were to go to a publisher right now and pitch an adventure game, they'd laugh in my face.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/09/double-fine-kickstarter |title=Tim Schafer persuades fans to finance next adventure game |work=[[Wired UK]] |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2012-02-10 |first=Mark |last=Brown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212003117/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/09/double-fine-kickstarter |archivedate=2012-02-12 }}</ref> Ron Gilbert, another ex-LucasArts adventure game designer at Double Fine, has long expressed this sentiment, writing in his personal blog, \"From first-hand experience, I can tell you that if you even utter the words \"adventure game\" in a meeting with a publisher you can just pack up your spiffy concept art and leave.

The [[open-source software|open-source]] [[Moai (software)|Moai game platform]] was chosen as the foundation for the game's engine. Nathan Martz, the technical director for Double Fine, stated that the open source nature of Moai allowed them to easily alter any aspect of the code base, while also supporting all of the targeted platforms.<ref name=\"lua\">{{cite web |url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/169585/Double_Fines_Kickstarterfunded_adventure_game_to_use_the_Luabased_Moai_platform.php |title=Double Fine's Kickstarter-funded adventure game to use the Lua-based Moai platform |first=Tom |last=Curtis |date=2012-05-01 |access-date=2012-05-01 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}</ref>\n\nProgrammers created a test game involving a red robot, while the artists created a mock-up test scenario to establish an art and animation style inspired by the fine art illustrations of lead artist Nathan Stapley, as well as to work out answers to basic interface questions. A sequence involving an unnamed lumberjack character and a cabin in the woods was created and the team decided to use a system of skeletal animation using segmented 2D characters. Once Schafer had established the basic storyline, involving the intersecting stories of a boy in a sci-fi world and a girl in a fantasy world, concept artists were gathered for an \"art jam\" to brainstorm and produce concept art for the game's creatures and locations. Schafer also asked the community for ideas, several of which were then illustrated by the concept artists.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schafer |first=Tim |title=Writing Update #3: Let's brainstorm Locations together! |url=http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewthread/7054/ |work=Double Fine Action Forums |publisher=Double Fine Productions |access-date=1 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808092237/http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewthread/7054# |archive-date=2013-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSchafer re-evaluated the state of the project in July 2013 and recognized that at their current rate, they would not be able to complete the game until 2015.

Schafer opted to adjust the schedule and split the game into two acts, allowing them to fund the second act with money made from sales of the first.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Double Fine Adventure! |number=10 |title=Part One of Something Great |date=2013-07-02 |time=26:59 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG5e6B5MHak&t=1619 |access-date=2016-01-01 |publisher=Double Fine Productions}}</ref> They had noticed that breaking the game into halves would fit naturally with events already occurring at the midpoint of the story, making the split relatively simple from a production perspective.<ref name=\"gi afterwords\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/06/25/afterwords-broken-age.aspx |title=Afterwords \u2013 Broken Age In Retrospect With Tim Schafer |first=Ben |last=Hanson |date=2015-06-25 |access-date=2015-06-25 |work=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref>\n\nThe first playable version of the game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s Early Access platform in January 2014, allowing Double Fine to obtain revenue from sales to fund the remaining development while gaining additional testing input before releasing a final version of the first act.

He preferred this so that the narrative end of the game before the credits could be focused solely on Vella and Shay, instead of having each character appears to speak a line or so as to explain their fate.<ref name=\"gi afterwords\"/>\n\nA retail version of the game, containing both acts, for Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms will be published through partnership with [[Nordic Games GmbH|Nordic Games]], who had helped to bring retail releases of Double Fine's earlier games in 2014.

[[John Walker (journalist)|John Walker]] from [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] was quick to point out that this doesn't pose a major threat to publishers on a large scale, but added that it would force publishers to ask themselves questions such as \"Are we really in touch with our audience\u2019s desires?\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/09/thought-double-fines-kickstarter-asks-some-big-questions/ |title=Thought: Double Fine's Kickstarter Asks Big Questions |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun | first = John | last = Walker|date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> Johnny Cullen of [[VG247]] compared the Double Fine Kickstarter to the release of [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[In Rainbows]]'', which the band had sold through their website in a [[pay-what-you-want]] model prior to a physical printing, without the interference of a music publisher. Cullen noted the model of crowd-sourcing has previously not worked for some game developers, and does not expect it to be a guaranteed success for future efforts, as he believes Double Fine is a unique studio with a dedicated fan base, aspects that are not shared by all developers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2012/02/09/double-fines-kickstart-provides-a-radiohead-moment/ | title = Double Fine's Kickstarter provides a Radiohead moment | publisher = [[VG247]] | first = Johnny | last = Cullen | date = 2012-02-09 | accessdate = 2012-02-09 }}</ref>\n\nInitial commentary largely framed Double Fine as exceptional, citing Double Fine's reputation,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/features/devs-celebrate-double-fines-kickstarter-success | title = Devs celebrate Double Fine's Kickstarter success | date = 2012-02-10 | accessdate = 2012-02-10 | work = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] }}</ref> experience with the under-serviced genre,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5883864/why-the-internet-gave-this-video-game-1-million-in-a-single-day | title = Why the Internet Gave This Man $1 Million.

Though originally a goal of only $400,000 was set to cover the costs of development and documentary filming, ''Broken Age'' became the largest crowd-funded video game project at the time, raising over 3.45 million dollars from more than 87,000 backers within the month. It remains one of [[List of highest funded crowdfunding projects|the highest-backed crowd-funded projects]] of any type, and its success helped to establish [[crowdfunding in video games|Kickstarter and other crowd-funding mechanisms]] as a viable alternative to traditional [[venture capital]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] funding for niche video game titles. The game's development was chronicled by an episodic series of documentaries produced by 2 Player Productions.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Broken Age'' is a [[point-and-click adventure game]], where the player-controlled character can be directed to move about the screen, examine objects, and talk to non-player characters to learn more about the game world. The game features two playable characters, each located in seemingly separate worlds; the player can switch from one character to the other via the game's interface at any time, but otherwise these characters do not interact in any direct way. The game employs context-sensitive actions instead of using verb lists as early adventure games would use, as Schafer stated that in essence, \"there really was always one verb, which was 'interact with'\" and opted for the more modern approach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/3/5059690/broken-age-preview | title = Broken Age built around context-based interactions, not a list of verbs | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date =2013-11-03 | accessdate = 2013-11-03 | first  = Megan | last =  Farokhmanesh  }}</ref> Each character has separate item inventories as they collect objects; items can then be used by dragging them onto context-sensitive areas on the screen or combined with other inventory items.\n\n==Plot==\n===Act 1===\n''Broken Age'' tells the story of two teenagers with no immediately apparent connection, each \"seeking to break the tradition in their lives\".<ref name=\"polygon name\"/>\n\nVella Tartine (voiced by [[Masasa Moyo]]) is a young woman living in the Badlands, a land ravaged by the Mogs, giant creatures that come from beyond a wall called the Plague Dam. They are appeased by the sacrifice of young girls at a number of ''Maiden's Feasts'' held at various villages. They appear every fourteen years for those maidens. Vella is chosen to be sacrificed to Mog Chothra at the feast in her hometown of Sugar Bunting (formerly a town made up of warriors named Steel Bunting) but concludes that if the monster could be killed, the rituals could be ended. She finds a way to escape the beast's attack and ends up in Meriloft, a small colony which rests on a cluster of semisolid clouds. They are dealing with the aftermath of their own Feast, affirming her belief that the rites are disastrous to their people and should be ended. She then finds her way to a nearby port town, Shellmound, where they are preparing for their own Feast. There she discovers the Dead Eye God's temple, which turns out to be an ancient spaceship, the Maloruna, half-buried by the sand. She is able to wake its pilot, Alex, from his three hundred year stasis, and he helps her to rig the ship's scanning system to fire a laser at Mog Chothra when he shows up for the Feast. Vella's plan works, and she is able to bring down the creature.\n\nShay Volta (voiced by [[Elijah Wood]]) is a young man and seemingly the only passenger on the spaceship Bossa Nostra (Bassinostra), an \"incubator vessel\". The ship's computer has two [[artificial intelligence]]s (A.I.s). The computer's diurnal A.I., named \"MOM\", acts as a mother figure to Shay, occupying him with infantile \"missions\" and boring routines, while preventing him from learning about or exploring anything farther than the outside of the ship. The computer's nocturnal A.I. acts as a father figure to Shay and is more understanding of Shay's desire for independence, but appears to be too busy to spend time with Shay. The computer asserts that he is part of ''Project Dandelion'', a last-ditch effort by his home planet, Loruna, to protect Shay (the only survivor of his race following the planet's destruction) and try to find a home for him. When Shay sneaks into the bowels of the ship, he finds a stowaway named Marek wearing a wolf costume. Marek claims that, unbeknownst to him, a war rages in the galaxy, and tells Shay that he needs his help to save some innocent creatures who have been imprisoned in different areas of the galaxy as a result. Marek guides Shay through various missions against the computer's knowledge and control, trying to rescue a number of the creatures at each location before their position is discovered by an enemy force. During one of these rescues, Shay refuses to leave the last creature behind, causing the ship to be attacked, and trapping Marek under a pile of debris. In the ensuing chaos, Shay is knocked unconscious.\n\nAct 1 ends when Vella, going up to the downed Mog Chothra, discovers the monster is mechanical. Shay emerges confused from inside, revealing his belief of being in space was merely part of an illusion and he was unwittingly controlling Mog Chothra. Vella attempts to punch Shay but misses and falls into Mog Chothra's mouth. The mouth closes behind her, leaving them both trapped in each other's worlds, uncertain of what to do in their new surroundings.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nShay, trapped outside Mog Chothra, is reminded that the ship's AIs are actually his real parents; his father, Ray Volta, stuck outside with Shay, warns that his mother is still trapped within. As Ray tries to find a way back inside, Shay, recovered from his shock of the outside world, takes a look around when the ship takes off, stranding them there. Shay meets Alex, learning that he was a previous subject of ''Project Dandelion''. Alex was born on his ship, the Maloruna, a Diamond Age Dandelion Cruiser. His parents never showed him any pictures of Loruna. They lived for about 20 years after the crash (280 years ago), and then died three months apart from each other; their passing was one of the reasons why he went into ''crysolation''. Before his ship's crash, Alex had a talking cello named Marek who told him to hack the controls and rescue innocent creatures, just like Shay, who realizes that they were really capturing girls.\n\nShay offers to help repair Alex's ship to return to Loruna, where Alex believes Shay's ship is heading. Meanwhile, Vella (having accidentally reactivated the computer's autopilot) works her way into the ship and encounters Marek, who is still pinned under debris. Marek directs Vella to get into the control room as to stop Shay's mother, Hope Volta. Vella pretends that she is Shay to trick his mother into opening the door, but they are both quickly locked inside by Marek, who reveals himself to be Marekai, a member of a race called the Thrush. Marekai told Hope their world was dying so she went forth and found salvation, as many have before her: their ships were the Mogs. It turns out that Loruna is not a planet but an empire beyond the Plague Dam. He then directs the ship to deliver Vella there. Meanwhile, Shay makes his way through Shellmound and Meriloft to find parts to repair Alex's ship and go back to Loruna. He retraces Vella's journey and talks to the people with whom she interacted in Act 1 and her family, as they search for her.\n\nBack on Vella's side: Vella frees herself and Hope, and the true nature of ''Project Dandelion'' is revealed: the Thrush, believing the rest of the beings on the planet to be filled with disease, barricaded themselves with the humans whom they govern beyond the Plague Dam, and over the generations, modified their normal human DNA to become \"superior\"; but also lost certain traits necessary for survival. Project Dandelion has been used to send out uniquely attuned human children from their normal human population who could locate a special maiden via the Maiden's Feasts to \"true\" their bloodline. Vella was the one Shay selected amongst the other Maidens (who are alive but held captive), and the Thrush is planning on killing her to incorporate her genetics into theirs.\n\nKnowing her potential fate, Vella creates a bomb from the ship's power core to destroy the hangar where all of the Mog ships are kept. After planting the bomb, Hope and Vella set their ship to escape. Meanwhile, Shay helps Alex reactivate his ship and they set a course directly for the Plague Dam, accompanied by Shay's father and Vella's family. Right outside the gate, the two ships collide and the Thrush starts attacking the ships, which are both stuck on autopilot. Shay and Vella work together to cause Alex's ship reactor to overheat, melting both ships together. Everyone but Shay escapes, and Vella and Hope encourage him to jump to safety; Shay jumps, just missing a ledge, but is saved by the noble sacrifice of one of his robots, Grabbin' Gary. The fused ships soon solidify, forming a bridge between the mainland and the Plague Dam. Shay and Vella finally meet. After a moment's hesitation, they smile at one another.\n\nWithin the credit sequence, it is shown that the Thrush is deposed from power, the Plague Dam is demolished, and the humans of Loruna and the Badlands form a peaceful alliance. Many images in the credits include the notable people, animals, and machines shown throughout the game living much better lives.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Announcement and fund-raising===\n[[File:Double Fine Adventure logo.jpg|thumb|right|Promotional art used to promote the project on Kickstarter, with the Double Fine two-headed baby logo, used as part of the rewards for Kickstarter backers]]\n\n''Double Fine Adventure'' was announced by way of a [[Kickstarter]] project initiated on February 8, 2012.

A sequence involving an unnamed lumberjack character and a cabin in the woods was created and the team decided to use a system of skeletal animation using segmented 2D characters. Once Schafer had established the basic storyline, involving the intersecting stories of a boy in a sci-fi world and a girl in a fantasy world, concept artists were gathered for an \"art jam\" to brainstorm and produce concept art for the game's creatures and locations.

Schafer opted to adjust the schedule and split the game into two acts, allowing them to fund the second act with money made from sales of the first.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Double Fine Adventure! |number=10 |title=Part One of Something Great |date=2013-07-02 |time=26:59 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG5e6B5MHak&t=1619 |access-date=2016-01-01 |publisher=Double Fine Productions}}</ref> They had noticed that breaking the game into halves would fit naturally with events already occurring at the midpoint of the story, making the split relatively simple from a production perspective.<ref name=\"gi afterwords\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/06/25/afterwords-broken-age.aspx |title=Afterwords \u2013 Broken Age In Retrospect With Tim Schafer |first=Ben |last=Hanson |date=2015-06-25 |access-date=2015-06-25 |work=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref>\n\nThe first playable version of the game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s Early Access platform in January 2014, allowing Double Fine to obtain revenue from sales to fund the remaining development while gaining additional testing input before releasing a final version of the first act.

He served as the head football coach at [[Northern Illinois University]] from 1929 to 1954, compiling a record of 132\u201370\u201320. Evans was also the head basketball coach at Northern Illinois from 1929 to 1940, tallying a mark of 125\u201393, and served three stints at head baseball coach at the school (1930\u20131934, 1937\u20131944, 1946\u20131947), amassing a record of 118\u2013115\u20133. Evans was the [[athletic director]] at Northern Illinois from 1929 to 1968. His 132 wins are the most of any head coach in the [[Northern Illinois Huskies football]] program's history.\n\nA native of [[El Paso, Illinois]], Evans attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]], where was a member of the [[1918 Illinois Fighting Illini football team]] led by head coach [[Robert Zuppke]]. He then moved on to the now-defunct [[Des Moines University (1865\u20131929)|Des Moines University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], which was later acquired by the [[University of Sioux Falls]]; this should not be confused with the present [[Des Moines University]]. At Des Moines, Evans won 11 varsity letters and captained teams in four different sports directed by head coach [[Harry M. Bell]].\n\nEvans began his coaching career at [[Boone High School]] in [[Boone, Iowa]], where he spent four years before moving to [[DeKalb High School (Illinois)|DeKalb High School]] in [[DeKalb, Illinois]] for one year.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Evans Signed as Coach by State Teachers' College |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42904066/the_daily_chronicle/ |newspaper=[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]] |location=[[DeKalb, Illinois]] |date=May 23, 1929 |page=1 |access-date=January 24, 2020 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{Open access}} }}</ref>\n\nEvans later earned a master's degree from [[Columbia University]].

He served as the head football coach at [[Northern Illinois University]] from 1929 to 1954, compiling a record of 132\u201370\u201320. Evans was also the head basketball coach at Northern Illinois from 1929 to 1940, tallying a mark of 125\u201393, and served three stints at head baseball coach at the school (1930\u20131934, 1937\u20131944, 1946\u20131947), amassing a record of 118\u2013115\u20133. Evans was the [[athletic director]] at Northern Illinois from 1929 to 1968. His 132 wins are the most of any head coach in the [[Northern Illinois Huskies football]] program's history.\n\nA native of [[El Paso, Illinois]], Evans attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]], where was a member of the [[1918 Illinois Fighting Illini football team]] led by head coach [[Robert Zuppke]]. He then moved on to the now-defunct [[Des Moines University (1865\u20131929)|Des Moines University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], which was later acquired by the [[University of Sioux Falls]]; this should not be confused with the present [[Des Moines University]]. At Des Moines, Evans won 11 varsity letters and captained teams in four different sports directed by head coach [[Harry M. Bell]].\n\nEvans began his coaching career at [[Boone High School]] in [[Boone, Iowa]], where he spent four years before moving to [[DeKalb High School (Illinois)|DeKalb High School]] in [[DeKalb, Illinois]] for one year.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Evans Signed as Coach by State Teachers' College |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42904066/the_daily_chronicle/ |newspaper=[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]] |location=[[DeKalb, Illinois]] |date=May 23, 1929 |page=1 |access-date=January 24, 2020 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{Open access}} }}</ref>\n\nEvans later earned a master's degree from [[Columbia University]].

It is located on the Venezuelan central coast, facing the Caribbean Sea. It was devastated by the floods that occurred in 1999 known as the [[Vargas tragedy]].\n\n==History==\nCaraballeda was founded as the original port for the capital, Caracas, by Captain [[Diego de Losada]] in early 1568. The name is derived from the Carballeda Virgin, patron saint of the town of [[Rionegro del Puente]] in [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]], Spain, which was the birthplace of Diego de Losada.\n\nCaraballeda was granted considerable privileges of self-government by the Spanish Cabinet. For eighteen years the city did well, and was one of the most prosperous in the colony; but in 1586 the governor of Venezuela, Don Luis de Rojas y Mendoza, a tyrant, attempted to take the power of appointing Caraballeda's officials. Rather than submit, most of the city's inhabitants abandoned their houses and fields and wandered off.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/landofbolivarorw01spen/landofbolivarorw01spen_djvu.txt | title= Land of Bolivar Or War, Peace, and Adventure in the Republic of Venezuela  | publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Searle & Rivington | date=1878 | accessdate=December 14, 2013 | author=Spence, James Mudie}}</ref> The successor of Rojas endeavoured to persuade them back again, but in vain.

Lamar]] visited the area during a [[American bison|buffalo]]-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838, he proposed that the republic's capital, then in [[Houston]], be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] (near the present-day [[Congress Avenue Bridge]]). In 1839, the site was chosen to replace [[Houston]] as the capital of the [[Republic of Texas]] and was incorporated under the name \"Waterloo\". Shortly afterward, the name was changed to Austin in honor of [[Stephen F. Austin]], the \"Father of Texas\" and the republic's first secretary of state. The city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the [[Texas State Capitol]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austintexas.org/travel_trade/why_austin/historyheritage |title=History Lesson |accessdate=July 28, 2008 |publisher=Austin Convention & Visitors Bureau}}</ref> After a severe lull in economic growth from the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Austin resumed its steady development. \n\nIn 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for [[Stephen F.

Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the [[Archive War]], but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]]. Without the governmental body, Austin's population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s.

Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.

Highway 183 leads northwest of Austin toward [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]].\n\nIn the mid-1980s, construction was completed on [[State Highway Loop 360 (Texas)|Loop 360]], a scenic highway that curves through the hill country from near the 71/Mopac interchange in the south to near the 183/Mopac interchange in the north. The iconic [[Pennybacker Bridge]], also known as the \"360 Bridge,\" crosses Lake Austin to connect the northern and southern portions of Loop 360.\n\n===Tollways===\n[[File:Texas45.jpg|thumb|right|Interchange of [[Interstate 35]] and [[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]]]]\n[[State Highway 130 (Texas)|State Highway 130]] is a bypass route designed to relieve traffic congestion, starting from Interstate 35 just north of Georgetown and running along a parallel route to the east, where it bypasses [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]], Austin, [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]] and [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]] before ending at [[Interstate 10]] east of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]], where drivers could drive {{convert|30|mi|km}} west to return to Interstate 35 in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. The first segment was opened in November 2006, which was located east of [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]] at Austin's southeast corner on [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]]. Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[US Highway 183|US 183]] well south of Austin, where it splits off and goes west. The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete with last leg, which opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 41-mile section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest posted [[speed limits in the United States|speed limit in the United States]].\n\n[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] runs east\u2013west from just south of Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor. Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with the Manor Expressway as a nickname.\nDespite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.<ref name=\"Toll Road Revenue\">{{Cite news| first = Ben | last = Wear | title = Positive signs for financial future of Texas 130; | date = September 28, 2009 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&p_field_label-0=Author&p_text_label-0=Ben%20Wear&p_field_label-1=title&p_bool_label-1=AND&s_dispstring=Toll%20revenue%20exceed%20AND%20byline(Ben%20Wear)%20AND%20date(09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Toll%20revenue%20exceed)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no | work = Austin American-Statesman | pages = B\u20131 | accessdate = August 7, 2010 | quote = Report on the tollway...has been making more money than projected.}}</ref>\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:AUSCentralConcourse.JPG|thumb|The Barbara Jordan Terminal at [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]]]]\nAustin's airport is [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city.

Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.

[[U.S. Highway 183 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 183]] runs from northwest to southeast, and [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]] crosses the southern part of the city from east to west, completing a rough \"box\" around central and north-central Austin. Austin is the largest city in the United States to be served by only one Interstate Highway.\n\n[[U.S. Highway 290 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 290]] enters Austin from the east and merges into Interstate 35. Its highway designation continues south on I-35 and then becomes part of Highway 71, continuing to the west. Highway 290 splits from Highway 71 in southwest Austin, in an interchange known as \"The Y.\" Highway 71 continues to [[Brady, Texas]], and Highway 290 continues west to intersect [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]] near [[Junction, Texas|Junction]]. Interstate 35 continues south through [[San Antonio]] to [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] on the Texas-Mexico border. Interstate 35 is the highway link to the Dallas-Fort Worth metro-plex in northern Texas. There are two links to Houston, Texas (Highway 290 and State Highway 71/Interstate 10). Highway 183 leads northwest of Austin toward [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]].\n\nIn the mid-1980s, construction was completed on [[State Highway Loop 360 (Texas)|Loop 360]], a scenic highway that curves through the hill country from near the 71/Mopac interchange in the south to near the 183/Mopac interchange in the north.

The first segment was opened in November 2006, which was located east of [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]] at Austin's southeast corner on [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]]. Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[US Highway 183|US 183]] well south of Austin, where it splits off and goes west. The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete with last leg, which opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor.

Each section must be at least three phrases long.<ref>White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p.50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.</ref>]]\n\n'''Binary form''' is a [[musical form]] in 2 related sections, both of which are usually repeated. Binary is also a structure used to choreograph [[dance]]. In music this is usually performed as A-A-B-B.\n\nBinary form was popular during the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], often used to structure movements of [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] [[sonata (music)|sonatas]]. It was also used for short, one-movement works.  Around the middle of the 18th century, the form largely fell from use as the principal design of entire movements as [[sonata form]] and organic [[musical development|development]] gained prominence. When it is found in later works, it usually takes the form of the theme in a set of [[variation form|variation]]s, or the [[Minuet]], [[Scherzo]], or Trio sections of a \"minuet and trio\" or \"scherzo and trio\" movement in a [[sonata]], [[symphony]], etc. Many larger forms incorporate binary structures, and many more complicated forms (such as the 18th-century [[sonata form]]) share certain characteristics with binary form.\n\n==Structure==\nMost strictly, a piece in binary form is characterized by two complementary, related sections of roughly equal duration, which come up frequently. The first section will start in a certain [[key (music)|key]], and will usually [[Modulation (music)|modulate]] to a [[closely related key|related key]]:\n*compositions in major keys will typically modulate to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]], the fifth scale degree above the [[tonic (music)|tonic]]\n*compositions in minor keys will typically modulate to the [[relative key|relative major]], the major key centered on the third scale degree above the tonic; alternatively the first section could close in the dominant minor, or with an imperfect [[cadence (music)|cadence]] in the original key.\n\nThe second section of the piece begins in the newly established key, where it remains for an indefinite period of time. After some  harmonic activity, the piece will eventually modulate back to its original key before ending. More often than not, especially in 18th-century compositions, the A and B sections are separated by [[bar (music)|double bars]] with repeat signs, meaning both sections were to be repeated.<ref>Bartlette, Christopher, and Steven G. Laitz (2010).  Graduate Review of Tonal Theory.

Binary is also a structure used to choreograph [[dance]]. In music this is usually performed as A-A-B-B.\n\nBinary form was popular during the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], often used to structure movements of [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] [[sonata (music)|sonatas]]. It was also used for short, one-movement works.  Around the middle of the 18th century, the form largely fell from use as the principal design of entire movements as [[sonata form]] and organic [[musical development|development]] gained prominence. When it is found in later works, it usually takes the form of the theme in a set of [[variation form|variation]]s, or the [[Minuet]], [[Scherzo]], or Trio sections of a \"minuet and trio\" or \"scherzo and trio\" movement in a [[sonata]], [[symphony]], etc. Many larger forms incorporate binary structures, and many more complicated forms (such as the 18th-century [[sonata form]]) share certain characteristics with binary form.\n\n==Structure==\nMost strictly, a piece in binary form is characterized by two complementary, related sections of roughly equal duration, which come up frequently. The first section will start in a certain [[key (music)|key]], and will usually [[Modulation (music)|modulate]] to a [[closely related key|related key]]:\n*compositions in major keys will typically modulate to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]], the fifth scale degree above the [[tonic (music)|tonic]]\n*compositions in minor keys will typically modulate to the [[relative key|relative major]], the major key centered on the third scale degree above the tonic; alternatively the first section could close in the dominant minor, or with an imperfect [[cadence (music)|cadence]] in the original key.\n\nThe second section of the piece begins in the newly established key, where it remains for an indefinite period of time. After some  harmonic activity, the piece will eventually modulate back to its original key before ending. More often than not, especially in 18th-century compositions, the A and B sections are separated by [[bar (music)|double bars]] with repeat signs, meaning both sections were to be repeated.<ref>Bartlette, Christopher, and Steven G.
