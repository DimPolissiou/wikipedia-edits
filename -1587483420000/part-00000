Not all of the films were fantasy-based by any means. Many of the plots featured actual historical personalities such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cleopatra]], and [[Hannibal]], although great liberties were taken with the storylines. [[Gladiators]] and [[slaves]] rebelling against tyrannical rulers, pirates and swashbucklers were also popular subjects.\n\nAs Robert Rushing defines it, peplum, \"in its most stereotypical form, [...] depicts muscle-bound heroes (professional bodybuilders, athletes, wrestlers, or brawny actors) in mythological antiquity, fighting fantastic monsters and saving scantily clad beauties. Rather than lavish epics set in the classical world, they are low-budget films that focus on the hero's extraordinary body.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1=Amanda Ann |last2=Palmer |first2=R.

In addition, the plots typically involved two women vying for the affection of the bodybuilder hero: the good love interest (a [[damsel in distress]] needing rescue), and an evil femme fatale queen who sought to dominate the hero.\n\nAlso, the films typically featured an ambitious ruler who would ascend the throne by murdering those who stood in his path, and often it was only the muscular hero who could depose him. Thus, Maria Elena D'Amelio points out the hero's often political goal: \"to restore a legitimate sovereign against an evil dictator.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cornelius |first1=Michael G. |title=Of Muscles and Men: Essays on the Sword and Sandal Film |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786489022 |page=15 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=fyTXCoiaAe4C |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany of the peplum films involved a clash between two populations, one civilized and the other barbaric, which typically included a scene of a village or city being burned to the ground by invaders. For their musical content, most films contained a colorful dancing girls sequence, meant to underline pagan [[decadence]].\n\n==Precursors of the sword-and-sandal wave (pre-1958)==\n===Italian films of the silent era===\nItalian filmmakers paved the way for the peplum genre with some of the earliest silent films dealing with the subject, including the following:\n \n*''The Sack of Rome'' (1905)\n*''[[Agrippina (film)|Agrippina]]'' (1911)\n*''[[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]]'' (1911)\n*''The Queen of Nineveh'' (1911, directed by [[Luigi Maggi]])\n* ''[[Brutus (1911 film)|Brutus]]'' (1911)\n*''[[Quo Vadis (1913 film)|Quo Vadis]]''  (1913, directed by [[Enrico Guazzoni]])\n* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (1913 film)|Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1913)\n*''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914, directed by [[Giovanni Pastrone]])\n* ''[[Julius Caesar (1914 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1914)\n*''Saffo'' (''Sappho'', 1918, directed by Antonio Molinari)\n*''[[The Crusaders (1918 film)|The Crusaders]]'' (1918)\n* ''[[Fabiola (1918 film)|Fabiola]]'' (1918)\n*''Attila'' (1919, directed by F.

Maciste became the public's favorite character in the film however, and Pagano was called back many times to reprise the role. The Maciste character appeared in at least two dozen Italian silent films from 1914 through 1926, all of which featured a protagonist named Maciste although the films were set in many different time periods and geographical locations.\n\nHere is a complete list of the silent Maciste films in chronological order: \n*''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914) introduced the Maciste character\n*''Maciste'' (1915) {{a.k.a.}} \"The Marvelous Maciste\"\n*''Maciste bersagliere'' (\"Maciste the Ranger\", 1916)\n*''Maciste alpino'' (\"Maciste The Warrior\", 1916)\n*''Maciste atleta'' (\"Maciste the Athlete\", 1917)\n*''Maciste medium'' (\"Maciste the Clairvoyant\", 1917)\n*''Maciste poliziotto'' (\"Maciste the Detective\", 1917)\n*''Maciste turista'' (\"Maciste the Tourist\", 1917)\n*''Maciste sonnambulo'' (\"Maciste the Sleepwalker\", 1918)\n*''La Rivincita di Maciste'' (\"The Revenge of Maciste\", 1919)\n*''Il Testamento di Maciste'' (\"Maciste's Will\", 1919)\n*''Il Viaggio di Maciste'' (\"Maciste's Journey\", 1919)\n*''Maciste I'' (\"Maciste the First\", 1919)\n*''Maciste contro la morte'' (\"Maciste vs Death\", 1919)\n*''Maciste innamorato'' (\"Maciste in Love\", 1919)\n*''Maciste in vacanza'' (\"Maciste on Vacation\", 1920)\n*''Maciste salvato dalle acque'' (\"Maciste Rescued from the Waters\", 1920)\n*''Maciste e la figlia del re della plata'' (\"Maciste and the Silver King's Daughter\", 1922)\n*''Maciste und die Japanerin'' (\"Maciste and the Japanese\", 1922)\n*''Maciste contro Maciste'' (\"Maciste vs. Maciste\", 1923)\n*''Maciste und die chinesische truhe'' (\"Maciste and the Chinese Trunk\", 1923)\n*''Maciste e il nipote di America'' (\"Maciste's American Nephew\", 1924)\n*''Maciste imperatore'' (\"Emperor Maciste\", 1924)\n*''Maciste contro lo sceicco'' (\"Maciste vs. the Sheik\", 1925)\n*''Maciste all'inferno'' (\"Maciste in Hell\", 1926)\n*''Maciste nella gabbia dei leoni'' (\"Maciste in the Lions' Den\", 1926)\n*''il Gigante delle Dolemite'' (\"The Giant From the Dolomite\", released in 1927)\n\n===Italian fascist and post-war historical epics (1937-1956)===\nThe Italian film industry released several historical films in the early sound era, such as the big-budget ''[[Scipione l'Africano]]'' (''[[Scipio Africanus]]: The Defeat of Hannibal'') in 1937. In 1949, the postwar Italian film industry remade ''[[Fabiola (1949 film)|Fabiola]]'' (which had been previously filmed twice in the silent era). The film was released in the United Kingdom and in the United States in 1951 in an edited, English-dubbed version. ''Fabiola'' was an Italian-French co-production like the following films ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1950 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1950) and ''[[Messalina (1951 film)|Messalina]]'' (1951). \n\nDuring the 1950s, a number of American historical epics shot in Italy were released. In 1951, [[MGM]] producer [[Sam Zimbalist]] cleverly used the lower production costs, use of frozen funds and the expertise of the Italian film industry to shoot the large-scale [[Technicolor]] epic ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' in Rome. In addition to its fictional account linking the [[Great Fire of Rome]], the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]] and Emperor [[Nero]], the film - following the novel \"Quo vadis\" by the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz - featured also a mighty protagonist named [[Ursus (film character)|Ursus]] (Italian filmmakers later made several pepla in the 1960s exploiting the Ursus character).   MGM also planned ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'' to be filmed in Italy as early as 1952.<ref>Pryor, Thomas M. \"''Ben-Hur'' to Ride for Metro Again.\" ''New York Times.'' December 8, 1952.</ref>\n\n[[Riccardo Freda]]'s ''[[Sins of Rome]]'' was filmed in 1953 and released by [[RKO]] in an edited, English-dubbed version the following year. Unlike ''Quo Vadis'', there were no American actors or production crew.  The Anthony Quinn film ''[[Attila (1954 film)|Attila]]'' (directed by [[Pietro Francisci]] in 1954), the Kirk Douglas epic ''[[Ulysses (1955 film)|Ulysses]]'' (co-directed by an uncredited [[Mario Bava]] in 1954) and ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'' (directed by [[Robert Wise]] with [[Sergio Leone]] as an uncredited [[second unit director]] in 1955) were the first of the big peplum films of the 1950s. Riccardo Freda directed another peplum, ''[[Theodora, Slave Empress]]'' in 1954, starring his wife [[Gianna Maria Canale]]. Howard Hawks directed his ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'' (starring Joan Collins) in Italy and Egypt in 1955. [[Robert Rossen]] made his film ''[[Alexander the Great (1956 film)|Alexander the Great]]'' in Egypt in 1956, with a music score by famed Italian composer Mario Nascimbene.\n\n==The main sword-and-sandal period (1958-1965)==\n\nTo cash in on the success of the Kirk Douglas film ''Ulysses'', Pietro Francisci planned to make a film about [[Hercules]], but searched unsuccessfully for years for a physically convincing yet experienced actor. His daughter spotted [[United States|American]] [[bodybuilding|bodybuilder]] [[Steve Reeves]] in the American film ''[[Athena (film)|Athena]]'' and he was hired to play Hercules in 1957 when the film was made. (Reeves was paid $10,000 to star in the film).<ref>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-may-04-mn-26532-story.html</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|editor-first=Roy|editor-last=Frumkes|url=http://www.drkrm.com/reeves.html|title=An Interview with Steve Reeves from ''The Perfect Vision Magazine''|volume=6|issue=22|date=July 1994}}</ref>\n\nThe genre's instantaneous growth began with the U.S. theatrical release of ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' in 1959. American producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] acquired the U.S. distribution rights for $120,000, spent $1 million promoting the film and made more than $5 million profit.<ref>p.73 Frayling, Christopher ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone'' I.B.Tauris, 2006</ref> This spawned the [[1959 in film|1959]] Steve Reeves sequel ''[[Hercules Unchained]]'', the 1959 re-release of [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949), and literally dozens of imitations that followed in their wake. Italian filmmakers resurrected their 1920s Maciste character in a brand new 1960s sound film series (1960\u20131964), followed rapidly by Ursus, Samson, Goliath and various other mighty-muscled heroes.\n\nAlmost all peplum films of this period featured bodybuilder stars, the most popular being [[Steve Reeves]], [[Reg Park]] and [[Gordon Scott]].<ref name=\"Hugh2\">{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Howard |title=Cinema Italiano: The Complete Guide from Classics to Cult |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9781848856080 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIyNKi9XUgIC |accessdate=15 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Some of these stars, such as [[Mickey Hargitay]], [[Reg Lewis (bodybuilder)|Reg Lewis]], [[Mark Forest]], [[Gordon Mitchell]] and [[Dan Vadis]], had starred in [[Mae West]]'s touring stage review in the United States in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Hugh2\" /> Bodybuilders of Italian origin, on the other hand, would adopt English pseudonyms for the screen; thus, stuntman Sergio Ciani became [[Alan Steel]], and ex-gondolier Adriano Bellini was called [[Kirk Morris]].<ref name=\"Hugh2\" />\n\nTo be sure, many of the films enjoyed widespread popularity among general audiences, and had production values that were typical for popular films of their day. Some films included frequent re-use of the impressive film sets that had been created for ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.\n\nAlthough many of the bigger budget pepla were released theatrically in the US, fourteen of them were released directly to [[Embassy Pictures]] [[television]] in a syndicated TV package called ''[[The Sons of Hercules]]''. Since few American viewers had a familiarity with Italian film heroes such as Maciste or Ursus, the characters were re-named<ref name=\"Hugh2\" /> and the films molded into a [[Film series|series]] of sorts by splicing on the same opening and closing theme song and newly designed voice-over narration that attempted to link the protagonist of each film to the Hercules mythos.  These films ran on Saturday afternoons in the 1960s.\n\nPeplum films were, and still are, often ridiculed for their low budgets and bad English dubbing. The contrived plots, poorly [[overdub]]bed [[dialogue]], novice acting skills of the bodybuilder leads, and primitive [[special effects]] that were often inadequate to depict the [[mythological creature]]s on screen all conspire to give these films a certain [[Camp (style)|camp]] appeal now. In the 1990s, several of them have been subjects of riffing and satire in the United States comedy series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n\nHowever, in the early 1960s, a group of French critics, mostly writing for the [[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]], such as [[Luc Moullet]], started to celebrate the genre and some of its directors, including [[Vittorio Cottafavi]], [[Riccardo Freda]], [[Mario Bava]], [[Pietro Francisci]], [[Duccio Tessari]], and [[Sergio Leone]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brunetta |first1=Gian Piero |title=Cent'anni di cinema italiano |date=2004 |publisher=Laterza |isbn=9788842073468 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vxmjQgAACAAJ |accessdate=14 February 2019 |page=329 |language=it}}</ref> Not only directors, but also some of the screenwriters, often put together in teams, worked past the typically formulaic plot structure to include a mixture of \"bits of philosophical readings and scraps of psychoanalysis, reflections on the biggest political systems, the fate of the world and humanity, fatalistic notions of accepting the will of destiny and the gods, anthropocentric belief in the powers of the human physique, and brilliant syntheses of military treatises\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brunetta |first1=Gian Piero |title=Cent'anni di cinema italiano |date=2004 |publisher=Laterza |isbn=9788842073468 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vxmjQgAACAAJ |accessdate=14 February 2019 |pages=329\u2013330 |language=it |quote=frammenti di letture filosofiche e briciole di psicanalisi, meditazioni sui massimi sistemi politici, sul destino del mondo e dell'umanit\u00e0, concezioni fatalistiche di accetazione della volont\u00e0 del destino e degli dei, fiducia antropocentrica nella potenza fisica e sintesi fulminee di trattatistica militare}}</ref>\n\nWith reference to the genre's free use of ancient mythology and other influences, Italian director [[Vittorio Cottafavi]], who directed a number of peplum films, used the term \"neo-mythologism\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Winkler |first1=Martin M. |title=Troy: From Homer's Iliad to Hollywood Epic |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781405178549 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDv2znATTy4C |accessdate=14 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Hercules series (1958\u20131965)===\n[[File:HerculesMagazine.jpg|thumb|A poster for ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' starring [[Steve Reeves]]]]\nA series of 19 Hercules movies were made in Italy in the late '50s and early '60s.

(See \"Goliath\" section below)\nNone of these films in their original Italian versions involved the Hercules character in any way. Likewise, most of the ''Sons of Hercules'' movies shown on American TV in the 1960s had nothing to do with Hercules in their original Italian versions.\n\n(see also ''[[The Three Stooges Meet Hercules]]'' (1962), an American-made genre parody starring peplum star [[Samson Burke]] as Hercules)\n\n===Goliath series (1959\u20131964)===\nThe Italians used Goliath as the superhero protagonist in a series of adventure films (pepla) in the early 1960s. He was a man possessed of amazing strength, although he seemed to be a different person in each film. After the classic ''[[Hercules (1957 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, a 1959 Steve Reeves film ''[[Il terrore dei barbari]]'' (''[[Terror of the Barbarians]]'') was re-titled ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' in the U.S. The film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a generic beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not related to each other in any way (the 1960 Italian peplum ''[[David and Goliath (1960 film)|David and Goliath]]'' starring [[Orson Welles]] was not part of this series, since that movie was just a historical retelling of the Biblical story).\n\nThe titles in the Italian ''Goliath'' adventure series were as follows: (the first title listed for each film is the film's original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses)\n\n* ''[[Il terrore dei barbari]]'' / ''[[Terror of the Barbarians]]'' (1959) ('''''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]''''' in the U.S.), starring Steve Reeves as Goliath (although he is referred to as \"Emiliano\" in the original Italian-language version)\n* ''[[Goliath contro i giganti]]'' / ''Goliath Against the Giants'' ('''''[[Goliath Against the Giants]]''''') (1960) starring Brad Harris\n* ''[[Goliath e la schiava ribelle]]'' / ''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'' ('''''[[Tyrant of Lydia Against The Son of Hercules]]''''') (1963) starring Gordon Scott\n* ''[[Golia e il cavaliere mascherato]]'' / ''Goliath and the Masked Rider'' ('''''[[Hercules and the Masked Rider]]''''') (1964) starring Alan Steel (note: Goliath is referred to as \"Hercules\" in English-dubbed prints)\n* ''[[Golia alla conquista di Bagdad]]'' / ''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad]]'' ('''''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus]]''''', 1964) starring Rock Stevens (aka Peter Lupus)\n\nThe name Goliath was also inserted into the English titles of three other Italian pepla that were re-titled for U.S. distribution in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as \"Goliath movies\" in Italy.\n\nBoth ''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]'' (1961) and ''[[Goliath and the Sins of Babylon]]'' (1963) actually featured the famed Italian folk hero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name \"Maciste\" meant anything to American audiences.\n\n''[[Goliath and the Dragon]]'' (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules movie called ''[[The Revenge of Hercules]]'', but it was re-titled ''Goliath and the Dragon'' in the U.S. since at the time ''Goliath and the Barbarians'' was breaking box-office records, and the distributors may have thought the name \"Hercules\" was trademarked by distributor [[Joseph E. Levine]].\n\n===Maciste series (1960\u20131965)===\n{{main|Maciste}}\nThere were a total of 25 Maciste films from the 1960s peplum craze (not counting the two dozen silent Maciste films made in Italy pre-1930). By 1960, seeing how well the two Steve Reeves ''Hercules'' films were doing at the box office, Italian producers decided to revive the 1920s silent film character ''Maciste'' in a new series of color/sound films. Unlike the other Italian peplum protagonists, Maciste found himself in a variety of time periods ranging from the [[Ice Age]] to 16th century Scotland. Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed. However, in the first film of the 1960s series, he mentions to another character that the name \"Maciste\" means \"born of the rock\" (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth itself in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually entitled \"The Giant from the Dolomite\", hinting that Maciste may be more god than man, which would explain his great strength. <br>\nThe first title listed for each film is the film's original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses (note how many times Maciste's name in the Italian title is altered to an entirely different name in the American title):\n\n* ''[[Maciste nella valle dei re]]'' / ''Maciste in the Valley of the Kings'' ('''[[Son of Samson]]''', 1960) {{a.k.a.}} ''Maciste the Mighty'', {{a.k.a.}} ''Maciste the Giant'', starring Mark Forest\n* ''[[Maciste nella terra dei ciclopi]]'' / ''[[Maciste in the Land of the Cyclops]]'' ('''[[Atlas in the Land of the Cyclops]]''', 1961) starring Gordon Mitchell\n* ''[[Maciste contro il vampiro]]'' / ''[[Maciste Vs. the Vampire]]'' ('''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]''', 1961) starring Gordon Scott\n* ''[[Il trionfo di Maciste]]'' / ''The Triumph of Maciste'' ('''[[Triumph of the Son of Hercules]]''', 1961) starring Kirk Morris\n* ''[[Maciste alla corte del gran khan]]'' / ''[[Maciste at the Court of the Great Khan]]'' ('''[[Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World]]''', 1961) starring Gordon Scott\n* ''[[Maciste, l'uomo pi\u00f9 forte del mondo]]'' / ''[[Maciste, the Strongest Man in the World]]'' ('''[[Mole Men vs the Son of Hercules]]''', 1961) starring Mark Forest\n* ''[[Maciste contro Ercole nella valle dei guai]]'' / ''[[Maciste Against Hercules in the Vale of Woe]]'' ('''[[Hercules in the Vale of Woe]]''', 1961) starring Kirk Morris as Maciste;

this movie is very scarce since it was never distributed in the U.S. and is apparently not even available in English)\n\nIn 1973, the Spanish cult film director [[Jesus Franco]] directed two low-budget \"Maciste films\" for French producers: ''Maciste contre la Reine des Amazones'' (''Maciste vs the Queen of the Amazons'') and ''Les exploits \u00e9rotiques de Maciste dans l'Atlantide'' (''The Erotic Exploits of Maciste in Atlantis''). The films had almost identical casts, both starring Val Davis as Maciste, and appear to have been shot back-to-back. The former was distributed in Italy as a \"Karzan\" movie (a cheap Tarzan imitation), while the latter film was released only in France with hardcore inserts as ''Les Gloutonnes'' (\"The Gobblers\"). These two films were totally unrelated to the 1960s Italian Maciste series.\n\n===Ursus series (1960\u20131964)===\n{{main|Ursus (film character)}}\n\nFollowing [[Buddy Baer]]'s portrayal of Ursus in the classic 1951 film ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', [[Ursus (film character)|Ursus]] was used as a superhuman Roman-era character who became the protagonist in a series of Italian adventure films made in the early 1960s.\n\nWhen the \"Hercules\" film craze hit in 1959, Italian filmmakers were looking for other muscleman characters similar to Hercules whom they could exploit, resulting in the nine-film Ursus series listed below. Ursus was referred to as a \"Son of Hercules\" in two of the films when they were dubbed in English (in an attempt to cash in on the then-popular \"Hercules\" craze), although in the original Italian films, Ursus had no connection to Hercules whatsoever. In the English-dubbed version of one Ursus film (retitled ''Hercules, Prisoner of Evil''), Ursus was actually referred to throughout the entire film as \"Hercules\".\n\nThere were a total of nine Italian films that featured Ursus as the main character, listed below as follows: Italian title / English translation of the Italian title (American release title);\n\n* ''Ursus'' / ''Ursus'' ('''[[Ursus, Son of Hercules]]''', 1960) {{a.k.a.}} ''[[Mighty Ursus]]'' (United Kingdom), starring Ed Fury\n* ''[[La Vendetta di Ursus]]'' / ''[[The Revenge of Ursus]]'' ('''[[The Vengeance of Ursus]]''', 1961) starring Samson Burke\n* ''Ursus e la Ragazza Tartara'' / ''Ursus and the Tartar Girl'' ('''[[Ursus and the Tartar Princess]]''', 1961) {{a.k.a.}} ''The Tartar Invasion'', {{a.k.a.}} ''The Tartar Girl''; starring Joe Robinson, Akim Tamiroff, Yoko Tani; directed by Remigio Del Grosso\n* ''[[Ursus Nella Valle dei Leoni]]'' / ''Ursus in the Valley of the Lions'' ('''[[Valley of the Lions]]''', 1962) starring Ed Fury; this film revealed the origin story of Ursus\n* ''Ursus il gladiatore ribelle'' / ''[[Ursus the Rebel Gladiator]]'' ('''[[The Rebel Gladiators]]''', 1962) starring Dan Vadis\n* ''Ursus Nella Terra di Fuoco'' / ''[[Ursus in the Land of Fire]]'' ('''[[Son of Hercules in the Land of Fire]]''', 1963) {{a.k.a.}} ''Son of Atlas in the Land of Fire''; starring Ed Fury\n* ''[[Ursus il terrore dei Kirghisi]]'' / ''[[Ursus, the Terror of the Kirghiz]]'' ('''[[Hercules, Prisoner of Evil]]''', 1964) starring Reg Park\n* ''[[Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili]]'' / ''[[Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles]]'' ('''[[Samson and His Mighty Challenge]]''', 1964) starring Yan Larvor as Ursus ({{a.k.a.}} ''Combate dei Gigantes'' or ''Le Grand Defi'')\n* ''Gli Invincibili Tre'' / ''The Invincible Three'' ('''[[Three Avengers]]''', 1964) starring Alan Steel as Ursus\n\n===Samson series (1961\u20131964)===\nA character named Samson was featured in a series of five Italian peplum films in the 1960s, no doubt inspired by the 1959 re-release of the epic Victor Mature film ''Samson and Delilah''. The character was similar to the Biblical Samson in the third and fifth films only; in the other three, he just appears to be a very strong man (not related at all to the Biblical figure).\n\nThe titles are listed as follows: Italian title / its English translation (U.S. release title in parentheses);\n\n* ''[[Samson (1961 Italian film)|Sansone]]'' / ''[[Samson (1961 Italian film)|Samson]]'' ('''Samson''') 1961, starring Brad Harris, {{a.k.a.}} in France as ''Samson Against Hercules''\n* ''[[Sansone contro i pirati]]'' / ''[[Samson Against the Pirates]]'' ('''[[Samson and the Sea Beast]]''') 1963, starring Kirk Morris\n* ''[[Ercole sfida Sansone]]'' / ''[[Hercules challenges Samson]]'' ('''[[Hercules, Samson and Ulysses]]''') 1963, starring Richard Lloyd\n* ''Sansone contro il corsaro nero'' / ''Samson Against the Black Pirate'' ('''[[Hercules and the Black Pirate]]''') 1963, starring Alan Steel\n* ''[[Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili]]'' / ''[[Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles]]'' ('''[[Samson and the Mighty Challenge]]''') 1964, starring Nadir Baltimore as Samson ({{a.k.a.}} ''[[Samson and His Mighty Challenge]]'', ''Combate dei Gigantes'' or ''Le Grand D\u00e9fi'')\n\nThe name Samson was also inserted into the U.S. titles of six other Italian movies when they were dubbed in English for U.S. distribution, although these films actually featured the adventures of the famed Italian folk hero Maciste.\n\n''[[Samson Against the Sheik]]'' (1962), ''Son of Samson'' (1960), ''[[Samson and the Slave Queen]]'' (1963), ''[[Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World]]'' (1961), ''[[Samson vs. the Giant King]]'' (1964), and ''[[Samson in King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1964) were all re-titled Maciste movies, because the American distributors did not feel the name Maciste was marketable to U.S. filmgoers.\n\n''Samson and the Treasure of the Incas'' ({{a.k.a.}} ''Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas'') (1965) sounds like a peplum title, but was actually a spaghetti Western.\n\n===''The Sons of Hercules'' (TV syndication package)===\n{{main|The Sons of Hercules}}\n''The Sons of Hercules'' was a syndicated television show that aired in the United States in the 1960s. The series repackaged 14 randomly chosen Italian peplum films by unifying them with memorable title and end title theme songs and a standard voice-over intro relating the main hero in each film to Hercules any way they could. In some areas, each film was split into two one-hour episodes, so the 14 films were shown as 28 weekly episodes. None of the films were ever theatrically released in the U.S.\n\nThe films are not listed in chronological order, since they were not really related to each other in any way. The first title listed below for each film was its American broadcast television title, followed in parentheses by the English translation of its original Italian theatrical title:\n\n* ''[[Ursus, Son of Hercules]]'' (''Ursus'') 1961, starring Ed Fury,  {{a.k.a.}} ''Mighty Ursus'' in England\n* ''[[Mole Men vs the Son of Hercules]]'' (''[[Maciste, the Strongest Man in the World]]'') 1961, starring Mark Forest\n* ''[[Triumph of the Son of Hercules]]'' (''The Triumph of Maciste'') 1961, starring Kirk Morris\n* ''[[Fire Monsters Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''Maciste vs. the Monsters'') 1962, starring Reg Lewis\n* ''[[Venus Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''Mars, God Of War'') 1962, starring Roger Browne\n* ''[[Ulysses Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''[[Ulysses against Hercules]]'') 1962, starring Mike Lane\n* ''Medusa Against the Son of Hercules'' (''Perseus The Invincible'') 1962, starring Richard Harrison\n* ''[[Son of Hercules in the Land of Fire]]'' (''Ursus In The Land Of Fire'') 1963, starring Ed Fury\n* ''[[Tyrant of Lydia Against The Son of Hercules]]'' (''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'') 1963, starring Gordon Scott\n* ''[[Messalina Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''The Last Gladiator'') 1963, starring Richard Harrison\n* ''[[The Beast of Babylon Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''Hero of Babylon'') 1963, starring Gordon Scott, {{a.k.a.}} ''Goliath, King of the Slaves'' \n* ''[[Terror of Rome Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''Maciste, Gladiator of Sparta'') 1964, starring Mark Forest\n* ''[[Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness]]'' (''[[Hercules the Invincible]]'') 1964, starring Dan Vadis\n* ''[[Devil of the Desert Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''[[Anthar the Invincible]]'') 1964, starring Kirk Morris, directed by [[Antonio Margheriti]], {{a.k.a.}} ''The Slave Merchants'', {{a.k.a.}} ''Soraya, Queen of the Desert''\n\n===Steve Reeves pepla (in chronological order of production)===\n{{main|Steve Reeves}}\n\nSteve Reeves appeared in 14 pepla made in Italy from 1958 to 1964, and most of his films are highly regarded examples of the genre.

Then in 1982, the box-office successes of [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]]'s ''[[Quest for Fire (film)|Quest for Fire]]'' (1981) and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) spurred a second renaissance of [[sword and sorcery]] Italian pepla in the five years immediately following. Most of these films had low budgets, focusing more on barbarians and pirates so as to avoid the need for expensive Greco-Roman sets. The filmmakers tried to compensate for their shortcomings with the addition of some graphic gore and nudity. Many of these 1980s entries were helmed by noted Italian horror film directors ([[Joe D'Amato]], [[Lucio Fulci]], [[Luigi Cozzi]], etc.) and many featured actors [[Lou Ferrigno]], [[Miles O'Keefe]] and [[Sabrina Siani]]. Here is a list of the 1980s pepla:\n\n* ''Adam and Eve'' (1983) {{a.k.a.}} ''Adamo ed Eva, la prima storia d'amore'', contains stock footage from ''One Million Years B.C.''

Not all of the films were fantasy-based by any means. Many of the plots featured actual historical personalities such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cleopatra]], and [[Hannibal]], although great liberties were taken with the storylines. [[Gladiators]] and [[slaves]] rebelling against tyrannical rulers, pirates and swashbucklers were also popular subjects.\n\nAs Robert Rushing defines it, peplum, \"in its most stereotypical form, [...] depicts muscle-bound heroes (professional bodybuilders, athletes, wrestlers, or brawny actors) in mythological antiquity, fighting fantastic monsters and saving scantily clad beauties. Rather than lavish epics set in the classical world, they are low-budget films that focus on the hero's extraordinary body.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1=Amanda Ann |last2=Palmer |first2=R.

In addition, the plots typically involved two women vying for the affection of the bodybuilder hero: the good love interest (a [[damsel in distress]] needing rescue), and an evil femme fatale queen who sought to dominate the hero.\n\nAlso, the films typically featured an ambitious ruler who would ascend the throne by murdering those who stood in his path, and often it was only the muscular hero who could depose him. Thus, Maria Elena D'Amelio points out the hero's often political goal: \"to restore a legitimate sovereign against an evil dictator.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cornelius |first1=Michael G. |title=Of Muscles and Men: Essays on the Sword and Sandal Film |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786489022 |page=15 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=fyTXCoiaAe4C |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany of the peplum films involved a clash between two populations, one civilized and the other barbaric, which typically included a scene of a village or city being burned to the ground by invaders. For their musical content, most films contained a colorful dancing girls sequence, meant to underline pagan [[decadence]].\n\n==Precursors of the sword-and-sandal wave (pre-1958)==\n===Italian films of the silent era===\nItalian filmmakers paved the way for the peplum genre with some of the earliest silent films dealing with the subject, including the following:\n \n*''The Sack of Rome'' (1905)\n*''[[Agrippina (film)|Agrippina]]'' (1911)\n*''[[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]]'' (1911)\n*''The Queen of Nineveh'' (1911, directed by [[Luigi Maggi]])\n* ''[[Brutus (1911 film)|Brutus]]'' (1911)\n*''[[Quo Vadis (1913 film)|Quo Vadis]]''  (1913, directed by [[Enrico Guazzoni]])\n* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (1913 film)|Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1913)\n*''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914, directed by [[Giovanni Pastrone]])\n* ''[[Julius Caesar (1914 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1914)\n*''Saffo'' (''Sappho'', 1918, directed by Antonio Molinari)\n*''[[The Crusaders (1918 film)|The Crusaders]]'' (1918)\n* ''[[Fabiola (1918 film)|Fabiola]]'' (1918)\n*''Attila'' (1919, directed by F.

Maciste became the public's favorite character in the film however, and Pagano was called back many times to reprise the role. The Maciste character appeared in at least two dozen Italian silent films from 1914 through 1926, all of which featured a protagonist named Maciste although the films were set in many different time periods and geographical locations.\n\nHere is a complete list of the silent Maciste films in chronological order: \n*''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914) introduced the Maciste character\n*''Maciste'' (1915) {{a.k.a.}} \"The Marvelous Maciste\"\n*''Maciste bersagliere'' (\"Maciste the Ranger\", 1916)\n*''Maciste alpino'' (\"Maciste The Warrior\", 1916)\n*''Maciste atleta'' (\"Maciste the Athlete\", 1917)\n*''Maciste medium'' (\"Maciste the Clairvoyant\", 1917)\n*''Maciste poliziotto'' (\"Maciste the Detective\", 1917)\n*''Maciste turista'' (\"Maciste the Tourist\", 1917)\n*''Maciste sonnambulo'' (\"Maciste the Sleepwalker\", 1918)\n*''La Rivincita di Maciste'' (\"The Revenge of Maciste\", 1919)\n*''Il Testamento di Maciste'' (\"Maciste's Will\", 1919)\n*''Il Viaggio di Maciste'' (\"Maciste's Journey\", 1919)\n*''Maciste I'' (\"Maciste the First\", 1919)\n*''Maciste contro la morte'' (\"Maciste vs Death\", 1919)\n*''Maciste innamorato'' (\"Maciste in Love\", 1919)\n*''Maciste in vacanza'' (\"Maciste on Vacation\", 1920)\n*''Maciste salvato dalle acque'' (\"Maciste Rescued from the Waters\", 1920)\n*''Maciste e la figlia del re della plata'' (\"Maciste and the Silver King's Daughter\", 1922)\n*''Maciste und die Japanerin'' (\"Maciste and the Japanese\", 1922)\n*''Maciste contro Maciste'' (\"Maciste vs. Maciste\", 1923)\n*''Maciste und die chinesische truhe'' (\"Maciste and the Chinese Trunk\", 1923)\n*''Maciste e il nipote di America'' (\"Maciste's American Nephew\", 1924)\n*''Maciste imperatore'' (\"Emperor Maciste\", 1924)\n*''Maciste contro lo sceicco'' (\"Maciste vs. the Sheik\", 1925)\n*''Maciste all'inferno'' (\"Maciste in Hell\", 1926)\n*''Maciste nella gabbia dei leoni'' (\"Maciste in the Lions' Den\", 1926)\n*''il Gigante delle Dolemite'' (\"The Giant From the Dolomite\", released in 1927)\n\n===Italian fascist and post-war historical epics (1937-1956)===\nThe Italian film industry released several historical films in the early sound era, such as the big-budget ''[[Scipione l'Africano]]'' (''[[Scipio Africanus]]: The Defeat of Hannibal'') in 1937. In 1949, the postwar Italian film industry remade ''[[Fabiola (1949 film)|Fabiola]]'' (which had been previously filmed twice in the silent era). The film was released in the United Kingdom and in the United States in 1951 in an edited, English-dubbed version. ''Fabiola'' was an Italian-French co-production like the following films ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1950 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1950) and ''[[Messalina (1951 film)|Messalina]]'' (1951). \n\nDuring the 1950s, a number of American historical epics shot in Italy were released. In 1951, [[MGM]] producer [[Sam Zimbalist]] cleverly used the lower production costs, use of frozen funds and the expertise of the Italian film industry to shoot the large-scale [[Technicolor]] epic ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' in Rome. In addition to its fictional account linking the [[Great Fire of Rome]], the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]] and Emperor [[Nero]], the film - following the novel \"Quo vadis\" by the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz - featured also a mighty protagonist named [[Ursus (film character)|Ursus]] (Italian filmmakers later made several pepla in the 1960s exploiting the Ursus character).   MGM also planned ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'' to be filmed in Italy as early as 1952.<ref>Pryor, Thomas M. \"''Ben-Hur'' to Ride for Metro Again.\" ''New York Times.'' December 8, 1952.</ref>\n\n[[Riccardo Freda]]'s ''[[Sins of Rome]]'' was filmed in 1953 and released by [[RKO]] in an edited, English-dubbed version the following year. Unlike ''Quo Vadis'', there were no American actors or production crew.  The Anthony Quinn film ''[[Attila (1954 film)|Attila]]'' (directed by [[Pietro Francisci]] in 1954), the Kirk Douglas epic ''[[Ulysses (1955 film)|Ulysses]]'' (co-directed by an uncredited [[Mario Bava]] in 1954) and ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'' (directed by [[Robert Wise]] with [[Sergio Leone]] as an uncredited [[second unit director]] in 1955) were the first of the big peplum films of the 1950s. Riccardo Freda directed another peplum, ''[[Theodora, Slave Empress]]'' in 1954, starring his wife [[Gianna Maria Canale]]. Howard Hawks directed his ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'' (starring Joan Collins) in Italy and Egypt in 1955. [[Robert Rossen]] made his film ''[[Alexander the Great (1956 film)|Alexander the Great]]'' in Egypt in 1956, with a music score by famed Italian composer Mario Nascimbene.\n\n==The main sword-and-sandal period (1958-1965)==\n\nTo cash in on the success of the Kirk Douglas film ''Ulysses'', Pietro Francisci planned to make a film about [[Hercules]], but searched unsuccessfully for years for a physically convincing yet experienced actor. His daughter spotted [[United States|American]] [[bodybuilding|bodybuilder]] [[Steve Reeves]] in the American film ''[[Athena (film)|Athena]]'' and he was hired to play Hercules in 1957 when the film was made. (Reeves was paid $10,000 to star in the film).<ref>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-may-04-mn-26532-story.html</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|editor-first=Roy|editor-last=Frumkes|url=http://www.drkrm.com/reeves.html|title=An Interview with Steve Reeves from ''The Perfect Vision Magazine''|volume=6|issue=22|date=July 1994}}</ref>\n\nThe genre's instantaneous growth began with the U.S. theatrical release of ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' in 1959. American producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] acquired the U.S. distribution rights for $120,000, spent $1 million promoting the film and made more than $5 million profit.<ref>p.73 Frayling, Christopher ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone'' I.B.Tauris, 2006</ref> This spawned the [[1959 in film|1959]] Steve Reeves sequel ''[[Hercules Unchained]]'', the 1959 re-release of [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949), and literally dozens of imitations that followed in their wake. Italian filmmakers resurrected their 1920s Maciste character in a brand new 1960s sound film series (1960\u20131964), followed rapidly by Ursus, Samson, Goliath and various other mighty-muscled heroes.\n\nAlmost all peplum films of this period featured bodybuilder stars, the most popular being [[Steve Reeves]], [[Reg Park]] and [[Gordon Scott]].<ref name=\"Hugh2\">{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Howard |title=Cinema Italiano: The Complete Guide from Classics to Cult |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9781848856080 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIyNKi9XUgIC |accessdate=15 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Some of these stars, such as [[Mickey Hargitay]], [[Reg Lewis (bodybuilder)|Reg Lewis]], [[Mark Forest]], [[Gordon Mitchell]] and [[Dan Vadis]], had starred in [[Mae West]]'s touring stage review in the United States in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Hugh2\" /> Bodybuilders of Italian origin, on the other hand, would adopt English pseudonyms for the screen; thus, stuntman Sergio Ciani became [[Alan Steel]], and ex-gondolier Adriano Bellini was called [[Kirk Morris]].<ref name=\"Hugh2\" />\n\nTo be sure, many of the films enjoyed widespread popularity among general audiences, and had production values that were typical for popular films of their day. Some films included frequent re-use of the impressive film sets that had been created for ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.\n\nAlthough many of the bigger budget pepla were released theatrically in the US, fourteen of them were released directly to [[Embassy Pictures]] [[television]] in a syndicated TV package called ''[[The Sons of Hercules]]''. Since few American viewers had a familiarity with Italian film heroes such as Maciste or Ursus, the characters were re-named<ref name=\"Hugh2\" /> and the films molded into a [[Film series|series]] of sorts by splicing on the same opening and closing theme song and newly designed voice-over narration that attempted to link the protagonist of each film to the Hercules mythos.  These films ran on Saturday afternoons in the 1960s.\n\nPeplum films were, and still are, often ridiculed for their low budgets and bad English dubbing. The contrived plots, poorly [[overdub]]bed [[dialogue]], novice acting skills of the bodybuilder leads, and primitive [[special effects]] that were often inadequate to depict the [[mythological creature]]s on screen all conspire to give these films a certain [[Camp (style)|camp]] appeal now. In the 1990s, several of them have been subjects of riffing and satire in the United States comedy series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n\nHowever, in the early 1960s, a group of French critics, mostly writing for the [[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]], such as [[Luc Moullet]], started to celebrate the genre and some of its directors, including [[Vittorio Cottafavi]], [[Riccardo Freda]], [[Mario Bava]], [[Pietro Francisci]], [[Duccio Tessari]], and [[Sergio Leone]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brunetta |first1=Gian Piero |title=Cent'anni di cinema italiano |date=2004 |publisher=Laterza |isbn=9788842073468 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vxmjQgAACAAJ |accessdate=14 February 2019 |page=329 |language=it}}</ref> Not only directors, but also some of the screenwriters, often put together in teams, worked past the typically formulaic plot structure to include a mixture of \"bits of philosophical readings and scraps of psychoanalysis, reflections on the biggest political systems, the fate of the world and humanity, fatalistic notions of accepting the will of destiny and the gods, anthropocentric belief in the powers of the human physique, and brilliant syntheses of military treatises\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brunetta |first1=Gian Piero |title=Cent'anni di cinema italiano |date=2004 |publisher=Laterza |isbn=9788842073468 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vxmjQgAACAAJ |accessdate=14 February 2019 |pages=329\u2013330 |language=it |quote=frammenti di letture filosofiche e briciole di psicanalisi, meditazioni sui massimi sistemi politici, sul destino del mondo e dell'umanit\u00e0, concezioni fatalistiche di accetazione della volont\u00e0 del destino e degli dei, fiducia antropocentrica nella potenza fisica e sintesi fulminee di trattatistica militare}}</ref>\n\nWith reference to the genre's free use of ancient mythology and other influences, Italian director [[Vittorio Cottafavi]], who directed a number of peplum films, used the term \"neo-mythologism\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Winkler |first1=Martin M. |title=Troy: From Homer's Iliad to Hollywood Epic |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781405178549 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDv2znATTy4C |accessdate=14 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Hercules series (1958\u20131965)===\n[[File:HerculesMagazine.jpg|thumb|A poster for ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' starring [[Steve Reeves]]]]\nA series of 19 Hercules movies were made in Italy in the late '50s and early '60s.

The actors who played Hercules in these films were [[Steve Reeves]] followed by [[Gordon Scott]], Kirk Morris, [[Mickey Hargitay]], [[Mark Forest]], [[Alan Steel]], [[Dan Vadis]], [[Brad Harris]], [[Reg Park]], [[Peter Lupus]] (billed as [[Rock Stevens]]) and [[Mike Lane]].

Likewise, most of the ''Sons of Hercules'' movies shown on American TV in the 1960s had nothing to do with Hercules in their original Italian versions.\n\n(see also ''[[The Three Stooges Meet Hercules]]'' (1962), an American-made genre parody starring peplum star [[Samson Burke]] as Hercules)\n\n===Goliath series (1959\u20131964)===\nThe Italians used Goliath as the superhero protagonist in a series of adventure films (pepla) in the early 1960s. He was a man possessed of amazing strength, although he seemed to be a different person in each film. After the classic ''[[Hercules (1957 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, a 1959 Steve Reeves film ''[[Il terrore dei barbari]]'' (''[[Terror of the Barbarians]]'') was re-titled ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' in the U.S. The film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a generic beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not related to each other in any way (the 1960 Italian peplum ''[[David and Goliath (1960 film)|David and Goliath]]'' starring [[Orson Welles]] was not part of this series, since that movie was just a historical retelling of the Biblical story).\n\nThe titles in the Italian ''Goliath'' adventure series were as follows: (the first title listed for each film is the film's original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses)\n\n* ''[[Il terrore dei barbari]]'' / ''[[Terror of the Barbarians]]'' (1959) ('''''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]''''' in the U.S.), starring Steve Reeves as Goliath (although he is referred to as \"Emiliano\" in the original Italian-language version)\n* ''[[Goliath contro i giganti]]'' / ''Goliath Against the Giants'' ('''''[[Goliath Against the Giants]]''''') (1960) starring Brad Harris\n* ''[[Goliath e la schiava ribelle]]'' / ''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'' ('''''[[Tyrant of Lydia Against The Son of Hercules]]''''') (1963) starring Gordon Scott\n* ''[[Golia e il cavaliere mascherato]]'' / ''Goliath and the Masked Rider'' ('''''[[Hercules and the Masked Rider]]''''') (1964) starring Alan Steel (note: Goliath is referred to as \"Hercules\" in English-dubbed prints)\n* ''[[Golia alla conquista di Bagdad]]'' / ''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad]]'' ('''''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus]]''''', 1964) starring Rock Stevens (aka Peter Lupus)\n\nThe name Goliath was also inserted into the English titles of three other Italian pepla that were re-titled for U.S. distribution in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as \"Goliath movies\" in Italy.\n\nBoth ''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]'' (1961) and ''[[Goliath and the Sins of Babylon]]'' (1963) actually featured the famed Italian folk hero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name \"Maciste\" meant anything to American audiences.\n\n''[[Goliath and the Dragon]]'' (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules movie called ''[[The Revenge of Hercules]]'', but it was re-titled ''Goliath and the Dragon'' in the U.S. since at the time ''Goliath and the Barbarians'' was breaking box-office records, and the distributors may have thought the name \"Hercules\" was trademarked by distributor [[Joseph E. Levine]].\n\n===Maciste series (1960\u20131965)===\n{{main|Maciste}}\nThere were a total of 25 Maciste films from the 1960s peplum craze (not counting the two dozen silent Maciste films made in Italy pre-1930). By 1960, seeing how well the two Steve Reeves ''Hercules'' films were doing at the box office, Italian producers decided to revive the 1920s silent film character ''Maciste'' in a new series of color/sound films. Unlike the other Italian peplum protagonists, Maciste found himself in a variety of time periods ranging from the [[Ice Age]] to 16th century Scotland. Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed. However, in the first film of the 1960s series, he mentions to another character that the name \"Maciste\" means \"born of the rock\" (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth itself in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually entitled \"The Giant from the Dolomite\", hinting that Maciste may be more god than man, which would explain his great strength. <br>\nThe first title listed for each film is the film's original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses (note how many times Maciste's name in the Italian title is altered to an entirely different name in the American title):\n\n* ''[[Maciste nella valle dei re]]'' / ''Maciste in the Valley of the Kings'' ('''[[Son of Samson]]''', 1960) {{a.k.a.}} ''Maciste the Mighty'', {{a.k.a.}} ''Maciste the Giant'', starring Mark Forest\n* ''[[Maciste nella terra dei ciclopi]]'' / ''[[Maciste in the Land of the Cyclops]]'' ('''[[Atlas in the Land of the Cyclops]]''', 1961) starring Gordon Mitchell\n* ''[[Maciste contro il vampiro]]'' / ''[[Maciste Vs. the Vampire]]'' ('''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]''', 1961) starring Gordon Scott\n* ''[[Il trionfo di Maciste]]'' / ''The Triumph of Maciste'' ('''[[Triumph of the Son of Hercules]]''', 1961) starring Kirk Morris\n* ''[[Maciste alla corte del gran khan]]'' / ''[[Maciste at the Court of the Great Khan]]'' ('''[[Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World]]''', 1961) starring Gordon Scott\n* ''[[Maciste, l'uomo pi\u00f9 forte del mondo]]'' / ''[[Maciste, the Strongest Man in the World]]'' ('''[[Mole Men vs the Son of Hercules]]''', 1961) starring Mark Forest\n* ''[[Maciste contro Ercole nella valle dei guai]]'' / ''[[Maciste Against Hercules in the Vale of Woe]]'' ('''[[Hercules in the Vale of Woe]]''', 1961) starring Kirk Morris as Maciste;

this movie is very scarce since it was never distributed in the U.S. and is apparently not even available in English)\n\nIn 1973, the Spanish cult film director [[Jesus Franco]] directed two low-budget \"Maciste films\" for French producers: ''Maciste contre la Reine des Amazones'' (''Maciste vs the Queen of the Amazons'') and ''Les exploits \u00e9rotiques de Maciste dans l'Atlantide'' (''The Erotic Exploits of Maciste in Atlantis''). The films had almost identical casts, both starring Val Davis as Maciste, and appear to have been shot back-to-back. The former was distributed in Italy as a \"Karzan\" movie (a cheap Tarzan imitation), while the latter film was released only in France with hardcore inserts as ''Les Gloutonnes'' (\"The Gobblers\"). These two films were totally unrelated to the 1960s Italian Maciste series.\n\n===Ursus series (1960\u20131964)===\n{{main|Ursus (film character)}}\n\nFollowing [[Buddy Baer]]'s portrayal of Ursus in the classic 1951 film ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', [[Ursus (film character)|Ursus]] was used as a superhuman Roman-era character who became the protagonist in a series of Italian adventure films made in the early 1960s.\n\nWhen the \"Hercules\" film craze hit in 1959, Italian filmmakers were looking for other muscleman characters similar to Hercules whom they could exploit, resulting in the nine-film Ursus series listed below. Ursus was referred to as a \"Son of Hercules\" in two of the films when they were dubbed in English (in an attempt to cash in on the then-popular \"Hercules\" craze), although in the original Italian films, Ursus had no connection to Hercules whatsoever. In the English-dubbed version of one Ursus film (retitled ''Hercules, Prisoner of Evil''), Ursus was actually referred to throughout the entire film as \"Hercules\".\n\nThere were a total of nine Italian films that featured Ursus as the main character, listed below as follows: Italian title / English translation of the Italian title (American release title);\n\n* ''Ursus'' / ''Ursus'' ('''[[Ursus, Son of Hercules]]''', 1960) {{a.k.a.}} ''[[Mighty Ursus]]'' (United Kingdom), starring Ed Fury\n* ''[[La Vendetta di Ursus]]'' / ''[[The Revenge of Ursus]]'' ('''[[The Vengeance of Ursus]]''', 1961) starring Samson Burke\n* ''Ursus e la Ragazza Tartara'' / ''Ursus and the Tartar Girl'' ('''[[Ursus and the Tartar Princess]]''', 1961) {{a.k.a.}} ''The Tartar Invasion'', {{a.k.a.}} ''The Tartar Girl''; starring Joe Robinson, Akim Tamiroff, Yoko Tani; directed by Remigio Del Grosso\n* ''[[Ursus Nella Valle dei Leoni]]'' / ''Ursus in the Valley of the Lions'' ('''[[Valley of the Lions]]''', 1962) starring Ed Fury; this film revealed the origin story of Ursus\n* ''Ursus il gladiatore ribelle'' / ''[[Ursus the Rebel Gladiator]]'' ('''[[The Rebel Gladiators]]''', 1962) starring Dan Vadis\n* ''Ursus Nella Terra di Fuoco'' / ''[[Ursus in the Land of Fire]]'' ('''[[Son of Hercules in the Land of Fire]]''', 1963) {{a.k.a.}} ''Son of Atlas in the Land of Fire''; starring Ed Fury\n* ''[[Ursus il terrore dei Kirghisi]]'' / ''[[Ursus, the Terror of the Kirghiz]]'' ('''[[Hercules, Prisoner of Evil]]''', 1964) starring Reg Park\n* ''[[Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili]]'' / ''[[Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles]]'' ('''[[Samson and His Mighty Challenge]]''', 1964) starring Yan Larvor as Ursus ({{a.k.a.}} ''Combate dei Gigantes'' or ''Le Grand Defi'')\n* ''Gli Invincibili Tre'' / ''The Invincible Three'' ('''[[Three Avengers]]''', 1964) starring Alan Steel as Ursus\n\n===Samson series (1961\u20131964)===\nA character named Samson was featured in a series of five Italian peplum films in the 1960s, no doubt inspired by the 1959 re-release of the epic Victor Mature film ''Samson and Delilah''. The character was similar to the Biblical Samson in the third and fifth films only; in the other three, he just appears to be a very strong man (not related at all to the Biblical figure).\n\nThe titles are listed as follows: Italian title / its English translation (U.S. release title in parentheses);\n\n* ''[[Samson (1961 Italian film)|Sansone]]'' / ''[[Samson (1961 Italian film)|Samson]]'' ('''Samson''') 1961, starring Brad Harris, {{a.k.a.}} in France as ''Samson Against Hercules''\n* ''[[Sansone contro i pirati]]'' / ''[[Samson Against the Pirates]]'' ('''[[Samson and the Sea Beast]]''') 1963, starring Kirk Morris\n* ''[[Ercole sfida Sansone]]'' / ''[[Hercules challenges Samson]]'' ('''[[Hercules, Samson and Ulysses]]''') 1963, starring Richard Lloyd\n* ''Sansone contro il corsaro nero'' / ''Samson Against the Black Pirate'' ('''[[Hercules and the Black Pirate]]''') 1963, starring Alan Steel\n* ''[[Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili]]'' / ''[[Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles]]'' ('''[[Samson and the Mighty Challenge]]''') 1964, starring Nadir Baltimore as Samson ({{a.k.a.}} ''[[Samson and His Mighty Challenge]]'', ''Combate dei Gigantes'' or ''Le Grand D\u00e9fi'')\n\nThe name Samson was also inserted into the U.S. titles of six other Italian movies when they were dubbed in English for U.S. distribution, although these films actually featured the adventures of the famed Italian folk hero Maciste.\n\n''[[Samson Against the Sheik]]'' (1962), ''Son of Samson'' (1960), ''[[Samson and the Slave Queen]]'' (1963), ''[[Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World]]'' (1961), ''[[Samson vs. the Giant King]]'' (1964), and ''[[Samson in King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1964) were all re-titled Maciste movies, because the American distributors did not feel the name Maciste was marketable to U.S. filmgoers.\n\n''Samson and the Treasure of the Incas'' ({{a.k.a.}} ''Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas'') (1965) sounds like a peplum title, but was actually a spaghetti Western.\n\n===''The Sons of Hercules'' (TV syndication package)===\n{{main|The Sons of Hercules}}\n''The Sons of Hercules'' was a syndicated television show that aired in the United States in the 1960s. The series repackaged 14 randomly chosen Italian peplum films by unifying them with memorable title and end title theme songs and a standard voice-over intro relating the main hero in each film to Hercules any way they could. In some areas, each film was split into two one-hour episodes, so the 14 films were shown as 28 weekly episodes. None of the films were ever theatrically released in the U.S.\n\nThe films are not listed in chronological order, since they were not really related to each other in any way. The first title listed below for each film was its American broadcast television title, followed in parentheses by the English translation of its original Italian theatrical title:\n\n* ''[[Ursus, Son of Hercules]]'' (''Ursus'') 1961, starring Ed Fury,  {{a.k.a.}} ''Mighty Ursus'' in England\n* ''[[Mole Men vs the Son of Hercules]]'' (''[[Maciste, the Strongest Man in the World]]'') 1961, starring Mark Forest\n* ''[[Triumph of the Son of Hercules]]'' (''The Triumph of Maciste'') 1961, starring Kirk Morris\n* ''[[Fire Monsters Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''Maciste vs. the Monsters'') 1962, starring Reg Lewis\n* ''[[Venus Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''Mars, God Of War'') 1962, starring Roger Browne\n* ''[[Ulysses Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''[[Ulysses against Hercules]]'') 1962, starring Mike Lane\n* ''Medusa Against the Son of Hercules'' (''Perseus The Invincible'') 1962, starring Richard Harrison\n* ''[[Son of Hercules in the Land of Fire]]'' (''Ursus In The Land Of Fire'') 1963, starring Ed Fury\n* ''[[Tyrant of Lydia Against The Son of Hercules]]'' (''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'') 1963, starring Gordon Scott\n* ''[[Messalina Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''The Last Gladiator'') 1963, starring Richard Harrison\n* ''[[The Beast of Babylon Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''Hero of Babylon'') 1963, starring Gordon Scott, {{a.k.a.}} ''Goliath, King of the Slaves'' \n* ''[[Terror of Rome Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''Maciste, Gladiator of Sparta'') 1964, starring Mark Forest\n* ''[[Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness]]'' (''[[Hercules the Invincible]]'') 1964, starring Dan Vadis\n* ''[[Devil of the Desert Against the Son of Hercules]]'' (''[[Anthar the Invincible]]'') 1964, starring Kirk Morris, directed by [[Antonio Margheriti]], {{a.k.a.}} ''The Slave Merchants'', {{a.k.a.}} ''Soraya, Queen of the Desert''\n\n===Steve Reeves pepla (in chronological order of production)===\n{{main|Steve Reeves}}\n\nSteve Reeves appeared in 14 pepla made in Italy from 1958 to 1964, and most of his films are highly regarded examples of the genre. His pepla are listed below in order of production, not in order of release. The U.S. release titles are shown below, followed by the original Italian title and its translation (in parentheses)\n\n* ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) (''Le fatiche di Ercole'' / ''The Labors of Hercules'') actually filmed in 1957, released in Italy in 1958, released in the U.S. in 1959\n* ''[[Hercules Unchained]]'' (1959) (''Ercole e la regina di Lidia'' / ''Hercules and the Queen of Lydia'') released in the U.S. in 1960\n* ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' (1959) (''Il terrore dei barbari'' / ''Terror of the Barbarians'')\n* ''[[The Giant of Marathon]]'' (1959) (''La battaglia di Maratona'' / ''The Battle of Marathon'')\n* ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1959 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1959) (''Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei'' / ''The Last Days of Pompeii'')\n* ''[[The White Warrior]]'' (1959) (''Hadji Murad il Diavolo Bianco'' / ''Hadji Murad, The White Devil'') directed by [[Riccardo Freda]]\n* ''[[Morgan, the Pirate]]'' (1960) (''Morgan, il pirata''/ ''Morgan, the Pirate'')\n* ''[[Il Ladro di Bagdad|The Thief of Baghdad]]'' (1960) (''Il Ladro di Bagdad'' / ''[[The Thief of Baghdad (1961 film)|The Thief of Baghdad]]'')\n* ''[[The Trojan Horse (film)|The Trojan Horse]]'' (1961) (''La guerra di Troia''/ ''The Trojan War'')\n* ''[[Duel of the Titans]]'' (1961) (''Romolo e Remo'' / ''Romulus And Remus'')\n* ''[[The Slave (1962 film)|The Slave]]'' (1962) (''Il Figlio di Spartaco'' / ''Son of [[Spartacus]]'')\n* ''[[The Avenger (1962 film)|The Avenger]]'' (1962) (''La leggenda di Enea'' / ''The Legend Of Aeneas'')  {{a.k.a.}} ''The Last Glory of Troy''; (this was a sequel to ''The Trojan Horse'')\n* ''[[Sandokan the Great (film)|Sandokan the Great]]'' (1963) (''Sandokan, la tigre di Mompracem''/ ''Sandokan, the Tiger of Mompracem'') directed by [[Umberto Lenzi]]\n* ''[[Pirates of Malaysia]]'' (1964) {{aka}} ''Sandokan, the Pirate of Malaysia'', {{a.k.a.}} ''Pirates of the Seven Seas''; this was a sequel to ''Sandokan the Great'', directed by Umberto Lenzi\n\n==Other (non-series) Italian pepla==\nThere were many 1950s and 1960s Italian pepla that did not feature a major superhero (such as Hercules, Maciste or Samson), and as such they fall into a sort of miscellaneous category. Many were of the ''Cappa e spada'' ([[swashbuckler]]) variety, though they often feature well-known characters such as Ali Baba, Julius Caesar, Ulysses, Cleopatra, the Three Musketeers, Zorro, Theseus, Perseus, Achilles, Robin Hood, and [[Sandokan]].

Then in 1982, the box-office successes of [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]]'s ''[[Quest for Fire (film)|Quest for Fire]]'' (1981) and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) spurred a second renaissance of [[sword and sorcery]] Italian pepla in the five years immediately following. Most of these films had low budgets, focusing more on barbarians and pirates so as to avoid the need for expensive Greco-Roman sets. The filmmakers tried to compensate for their shortcomings with the addition of some graphic gore and nudity. Many of these 1980s entries were helmed by noted Italian horror film directors ([[Joe D'Amato]], [[Lucio Fulci]], [[Luigi Cozzi]], etc.) and many featured actors [[Lou Ferrigno]], [[Miles O'Keefe]] and [[Sabrina Siani]]. Here is a list of the 1980s pepla:\n\n* ''Adam and Eve'' (1983) {{a.k.a.}} ''Adamo ed Eva, la prima storia d'amore'', contains stock footage from ''One Million Years B.C.''

It is one of the [[Magnificent Seven cemeteries]]. Established by [[Act of Parliament]] and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. Consecrated by [[Charles James Blomfield]], [[Bishop of London]] in June 1840, it is one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small [[columbarium]], and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. It is also known as an urban haven for nature. It was awarded a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery grant]] to carry out essential restoration and develop a visitor centre, among other improvements.\n\nAlthough the cemetery was originally established by a private company, it is now the property of the [[Crown property|Crown]].<ref name = \"Royal Parks\">{{cite web| url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/brompton-cemetery|title= Brompton Cemetery|publisher = [[The Royal Parks]]|access-date = 21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Charles Booth 1889 map - detail showing Lillie Bridge.png|thumb|Charles Booth 1889 map \u2013 detail showing Brompton Cemetery]]\nBrompton Cemetery is adjacent to [[West Brompton station]] in west London, England.

In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground in [[Brompton, London]]. The moving spirit behind the project was the architect and engineer, [[Stephen Geary]], and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Geary was appointed as architect but was later forced to resign. Securing the land \u2013 some 40 acres \u2013 from local landowner, [[William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington|Lord Kensington]] and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol41/pp246-252|title=Survey of London|last=|first=|publisher=London City Council|year=1983|isbn=|editor-last=Sheppard|editor-first=F.H.W.|volume=41|location=London|pages=246\u2013252|chapter=Brompton|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the '[[Magnificent Seven cemeteries|Magnificent Seven]]') forming a ring around the edge of London.\n\nThe site, previously market gardens, having been bought with the intervention of John Gunter of [[Fulham]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/wamdocs/BromptonCemeterypp_10_15.pdf|title=Kensington and Chelsea Brompton Cemetery Conservation Area Proposals Statement.|website=Royal Borough Kensington and Chelsea|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> was {{convert|39|acre|m2}} in area. Brompton Cemetery was eventually designed by architect, Benjamin Baud with at its centre a modest domed chapel dated 1839, in the style of the [[basilica of St. Peter's]] in Rome at it southern end, reached by long colonnades, and flanked by catacombs. It was intended to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. It is rectangular in shape with the north end pointing to the northwest and the south end to the southeast. It has a central \"nave\" which runs from [[Old Brompton Road]] towards the central colonnade and chapel.\n\nBelow the colonnades are catacombs which were originally conceived as a cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in the grounds of the cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the cemetery suffered bomb damage.\n\n==Heritage status==\nThe cemetery is listed Grade I in the English Heritage [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England|Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]] and five of the individual monuments are listed as Grade II.<ref>Leaflet entitled \"Brompton Cemetery\" issued by the Friends of Brompton Cemetery</ref><ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1000248|desc=Brompton Cemetery|access-date=10 February 2016|mode=cs2}}</ref> [[Frederick Richards Leyland]]'s is the only [[Grade II*]] listed funerary monument.\n\n==Burials==\nBrompton was closed to burials between 1952 and 1966, except for family interments, but is once again a working cemetery, with plots for interments and a 'Garden of Remembrance' for the deposit of cremated remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org/ |title=Brompton Cemetery |publisher=Brompton-cemetery.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> Many nationalities and faiths from across the world are represented in the cemetery.\n\n===Military graves===\nFrom 1854 to 1939, Brompton Cemetery became the London District's Military Cemetery. The [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] purchased a plot in the north west corner where they have a monument in the form of an obelisk; the [[Brigade of the Guards]] has its own section south of that. There are 289 Commonwealth service personnel of [[World War I]] and 79 of [[World War II]], whose graves are registered and maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].

Aside from the stonemason's and sculptor's craft, there is a vast array of lettering, decorative ironwork (sadly in a very corroded state) and ceramics. Some graves and mausolea are the work of noted artists and architects.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nAlthough never envisaged as a park, [[John Claudius Loudon|JC Loudon]] devised the original planting scheme that was not fully realised. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. The fact of the enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. Each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin, broad-leaf pea and ferns. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for [[market garden]]s, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. In Autumn, there can be a display of [[Fungiidae|fungi]], a [[Mycology|mycologist's]] trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and several families of foxes. Among the birds, there are many garden species with the addition of [[European green woodpecker|green woodpecker]]s and occasionally, [[kestrel]]s. The macaws are only visitors.\n\n==Public access==\nThe cemetery is open daily to the public throughout the year, with opening times varying with the seasons. It is regularly visited by the [[Parks Police Service]] to monitor and curb occurrences of anti-social behaviour.\nDog walking and cycling, under strict control, is permitted on indicated paths. Through traffic is forbidden and there is no parking. Any visiting vehicles must observe a 5&nbsp;mph limit. The [[byelaws]] are displayed on boards at both entrances.\nThe Friends of Brompton Cemetery organise Open Days, regular tours and other public attractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org|title=The Friends of Brompton Cemetery}}</ref>\n\nThe cemetery has a reputation for being a popular [[Cruising for sex|cruising ground]] for gay men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://qxmagazine.com/pdf/gayhistory-west.pdf|title=Go west, young man|work=QX Magazine International|accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==A connection with Beatrix Potter==\n[[Image:Nutkins 002.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Nutkins gravestone]]\n\n[[Beatrix Potter]], who lived in Old Brompton Road nearby and enjoyed walking around it, may have taken the names of some of her characters from tombstones in the cemetery.

It is one of the [[Magnificent Seven cemeteries]]. Established by [[Act of Parliament]] and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. Consecrated by [[Charles James Blomfield]], [[Bishop of London]] in June 1840, it is one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small [[columbarium]], and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. It is also known as an urban haven for nature. It was awarded a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery grant]] to carry out essential restoration and develop a visitor centre, among other improvements.\n\nAlthough the cemetery was originally established by a private company, it is now the property of the [[Crown property|Crown]].<ref name = \"Royal Parks\">{{cite web| url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/brompton-cemetery|title= Brompton Cemetery|publisher = [[The Royal Parks]]|access-date = 21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Charles Booth 1889 map - detail showing Lillie Bridge.png|thumb|Charles Booth 1889 map \u2013 detail showing Brompton Cemetery]]\nBrompton Cemetery is adjacent to [[West Brompton station]] in west London, England.

In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground in [[Brompton, London]]. The moving spirit behind the project was the architect and engineer, [[Stephen Geary]], and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Geary was appointed as architect but was later forced to resign. Securing the land \u2013 some 40 acres \u2013 from local landowner, [[William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington|Lord Kensington]] and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol41/pp246-252|title=Survey of London|last=|first=|publisher=London City Council|year=1983|isbn=|editor-last=Sheppard|editor-first=F.H.W.|volume=41|location=London|pages=246\u2013252|chapter=Brompton|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the '[[Magnificent Seven cemeteries|Magnificent Seven]]') forming a ring around the edge of London.\n\nThe site, previously market gardens, having been bought with the intervention of John Gunter of [[Fulham]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/wamdocs/BromptonCemeterypp_10_15.pdf|title=Kensington and Chelsea Brompton Cemetery Conservation Area Proposals Statement.|website=Royal Borough Kensington and Chelsea|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> was {{convert|39|acre|m2}} in area. Brompton Cemetery was eventually designed by architect, Benjamin Baud with at its centre a modest domed chapel dated 1839, in the style of the [[basilica of St. Peter's]] in Rome at it southern end, reached by long colonnades, and flanked by catacombs. It was intended to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. It is rectangular in shape with the north end pointing to the northwest and the south end to the southeast. It has a central \"nave\" which runs from [[Old Brompton Road]] towards the central colonnade and chapel.\n\nBelow the colonnades are catacombs which were originally conceived as a cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in the grounds of the cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the cemetery suffered bomb damage.\n\n==Heritage status==\nThe cemetery is listed Grade I in the English Heritage [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England|Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]] and five of the individual monuments are listed as Grade II.<ref>Leaflet entitled \"Brompton Cemetery\" issued by the Friends of Brompton Cemetery</ref><ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1000248|desc=Brompton Cemetery|access-date=10 February 2016|mode=cs2}}</ref> [[Frederick Richards Leyland]]'s is the only [[Grade II*]] listed funerary monument.\n\n==Burials==\nBrompton was closed to burials between 1952 and 1966, except for family interments, but is once again a working cemetery, with plots for interments and a 'Garden of Remembrance' for the deposit of cremated remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org/ |title=Brompton Cemetery |publisher=Brompton-cemetery.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> Many nationalities and faiths from across the world are represented in the cemetery.\n\n===Military graves===\nFrom 1854 to 1939, Brompton Cemetery became the London District's Military Cemetery. The [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] purchased a plot in the north west corner where they have a monument in the form of an obelisk; the [[Brigade of the Guards]] has its own section south of that. There are 289 Commonwealth service personnel of [[World War I]] and 79 of [[World War II]], whose graves are registered and maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].

He shared the grave with a 17-month-old Sioux girl named White Star believed to have fallen from her mother's arms while on horseback. 105 years later a British woman named Elizabeth Knight traced his family and campaigned with them to have his remains returned to the land of his birth.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/09/26/chief-long-wolfs-last-journey/48cd6840-f6fa-4b47-8e03-0c31d419608b/|title=Chief Long Wolf's Last Journey|last=Balz|first=Dan|date=26 September 1997|work=Washington Post|access-date=25 June 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> In 1997, Chief Long Wolf was finally moved to a new plot in the Wolf Creek Cemetery (ancestral burial ground of the Oglala Sioux tribe) at [[Pine Ridge, South Dakota]].\nHis great grandson John Black Feather said \"Back then, they had burials at sea, they did ask his wife if she wanted to take him home and she figured that as soon as they hit the water they would throw him overboard, so that's why they left him here.\"<ref name = \"BBC history\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/05/10/brompton_cemetery_feature.shtml |title=Brompton Cemetery |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://cgi.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/25/chief.long.wolf/ |title=Chief Long Wolf goes home, 105 years late |publisher=CNN |date=25 September 1997 |accessdate=1 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419032411/http://cgi.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/25/chief.long.wolf/ |archivedate=19 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |archivedate=26 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050926210653/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1997%2F05%2F05%2Fnwol05.html |title=Sioux reclaim tribal chief from English grave |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=1 March 2010 |date=5 May 1997 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/05/05/nwol05.html |last=Weaver |first=Maurice |location=London |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere was a [[Brul\u00e9|Brul\u00e9 Sioux]] tribesman buried in Brompton named [[Paul Eagle Star]].

Aside from the stonemason's and sculptor's craft, there is a vast array of lettering, decorative ironwork (sadly in a very corroded state) and ceramics. Some graves and mausolea are the work of noted artists and architects.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nAlthough never envisaged as a park, [[John Claudius Loudon|JC Loudon]] devised the original planting scheme that was not fully realised. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. The fact of the enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. Each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin, broad-leaf pea and ferns. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for [[market garden]]s, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. In Autumn, there can be a display of [[Fungiidae|fungi]], a [[Mycology|mycologist's]] trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and several families of foxes. Among the birds, there are many garden species with the addition of [[European green woodpecker|green woodpecker]]s and occasionally, [[kestrel]]s. The macaws are only visitors.\n\n==Public access==\nThe cemetery is open daily to the public throughout the year, with opening times varying with the seasons. It is regularly visited by the [[Parks Police Service]] to monitor and curb occurrences of anti-social behaviour.\nDog walking and cycling, under strict control, is permitted on indicated paths. Through traffic is forbidden and there is no parking. Any visiting vehicles must observe a 5&nbsp;mph limit. The [[byelaws]] are displayed on boards at both entrances.\nThe Friends of Brompton Cemetery organise Open Days, regular tours and other public attractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brompton-cemetery.org|title=The Friends of Brompton Cemetery}}</ref>\n\nThe cemetery has a reputation for being a popular [[Cruising for sex|cruising ground]] for gay men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://qxmagazine.com/pdf/gayhistory-west.pdf|title=Go west, young man|work=QX Magazine International|accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==A connection with Beatrix Potter==\n[[Image:Nutkins 002.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Nutkins gravestone]]\n\n[[Beatrix Potter]], who lived in Old Brompton Road nearby and enjoyed walking around it, may have taken the names of some of her characters from tombstones in the cemetery.

FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.

is a [[digital audio workstation]] developed by the Belgian company [[Image-Line]]. FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software.
