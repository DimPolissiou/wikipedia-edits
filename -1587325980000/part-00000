The original books were also made into an [[OVA]], [[animated cartoon|animated feature-length films]], [[anime]], and comic.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Kaiketsu Zorori characters}}\n\nSet in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji'''''|\u304b\u3044\u3051\u3064\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u305f\u3044\u3058||\"The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer\"}} and has published about two issues per year, totaling 50 issues as of December 2011. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] on January 4, 2010. \n\nZorori was originally a villain for the series {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3||\"Spinach Man\"}} written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when H\u014drens\u014d Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u3086\u3046\u308c\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046||\"Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle\"}} (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, \"Zorori Castle Part 2\" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Y\u014dkai Gakk\u014d no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the H\u014drens\u014d Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.\n\nUsing clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult [[kanji]] or any [[furigana]], instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school \"children's book\", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).\n\nAt the time of publication, '''{{nihongo|''The Zorori League''|\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0|Zororiigu}}''' and '''{{nihongo|''Stupid Monster''|\u30dc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Bokeetto Monsutaa}}''' (a play on [[Pok\u00e9mon]]) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.\n\nFurthermore, the Spanish word for fox is \"zorro\", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble [[Zorro]].\n\n==List of volumes==\nThe first Zorori book was released in November 1987 and has seen two releases per year ever since. The first 39 volumes have been used as source material for the anime, while volumes 40 and beyond are book only, due to being printed after the anime's cancellation. \n{{Graphic novel list/header\n |

Out of desperation he eats an entire room filled with garlic, leaving him with a terrible smell.

An officer comes by and tells him the toy plane was stolen and the boars said they took it by mistake. They run from the police and end up on Money's plane, but partway through the flight the plane has engine trouble and crashes into a snowy mountain. Zorori builds a new plane from the remains and they fly off. They are low on gas when a red plane comes out of nowhere and points them to a nearby city. The red plane quickly vanishes and they get Money back home safely. Zorori is left wondering if the pilot was his father.

The original books were also made into an [[OVA]], [[animated cartoon|animated feature-length films]], [[anime]], and comic.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Kaiketsu Zorori characters}}\n\nSet in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji'''''|\u304b\u3044\u3051\u3064\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u305f\u3044\u3058||\"The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer\"}} and has published about two issues per year, totaling 50 issues as of December 2011. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] on January 4, 2010. \n\nZorori was originally a villain for the series {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3||\"Spinach Man\"}} written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when H\u014drens\u014d Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u3086\u3046\u308c\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046||\"Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle\"}} (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, \"Zorori Castle Part 2\" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Y\u014dkai Gakk\u014d no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the H\u014drens\u014d Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.\n\nUsing clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult [[kanji]] or any [[furigana]], instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school \"children's book\", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).\n\nAt the time of publication, '''{{nihongo|''The Zorori League''|\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0|Zororiigu}}''' and '''{{nihongo|''Stupid Monster''|\u30dc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Bokeetto Monsutaa}}''' (a play on [[Pok\u00e9mon]]) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.\n\nFurthermore, the Spanish word for fox is \"zorro\", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble [[Zorro]].\n\n==List of volumes==\nThe first Zorori book was released in November 1987 and has seen two releases per year ever since. The first 39 volumes have been used as source material for the anime, while volumes 40 and beyond are book only, due to being printed after the anime's cancellation. \n{{Graphic novel list/header\n |

Out of desperation he eats an entire room filled with garlic, leaving him with a terrible smell.

An officer comes by and tells him the toy plane was stolen and the boars said they took it by mistake. They run from the police and end up on Money's plane, but partway through the flight the plane has engine trouble and crashes into a snowy mountain. Zorori builds a new plane from the remains and they fly off. They are low on gas when a red plane comes out of nowhere and points them to a nearby city. The red plane quickly vanishes and they get Money back home safely. Zorori is left wondering if the pilot was his father.

The station is owned by [[Indiana University]] Student Broadcasting.\n\n==Operation==\nWIUX is completely operated by student volunteers currently enrolled at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]. There are no paid employees or faculty supervisors.\n\n==History==\n* 1963 - WQAD, a [[carrier current]] AM radio station was founded in Wright Quadrangle at Indiana University, with a frequency of 730&nbsp;kHz. The studios were originally in Todd House (through the odd entryway on the south side of Todd) and later in Elliott House (in the basement storage area, off the lounge area). WQAD beamed its programming to Wright Quadrangle, Teter Quadrangle, Read Center, Forest Quadrangle and what was then known as the Graduate Residence Center or GRC for the first time on 730 AM via carrier current throughout Wright Quad on January 5, 1963. The station was started by physics major Bill Weaverling, chemistry major Steve Peterson, and education major Jerry Pugh.  As a note, at the time of WQAD, Wright Quadrangle housed only men.\n* 1964 - WFQR Radio, also a carrier current AM radio station, was founded in Foster Quadrangle; the call letters stood for \"Foster Quadrangle Radio.\"  Its programming was beamed to the dormitories along Fee Lane, including Foster, McNutt and Briscoe Quadrangles.\n* 1965 - WFQR Radio changed its call letters to WIN, and continued to operate from Foster Quadrangle.\n* 1966 - Phil Murphy formed the Indiana University Radio Network (IURN) to combine sales for both student stations.  At times during the 1966-67 school year, each station originated a \"network feed\" which was sent to the carrier current transmitters of all wired student housing.  At other times for this final school year, WIN and WQAD maintained separate programming.\n* September 1967 - The two stations merge to form WIUS Radio, still strictly a carrier current operation.  It was supposed to be at 620&nbsp;kHz in all student housing, but until the end of carrier current operations, some transmitters continued to operate at 730&nbsp;kHz.  The original WIUS studios were located at 617 E. 8th St., today the site of the [[Mathers Museum of World Cultures]].  The building, a two-story brick house, once belonged to a Bloomington mayor and to legendary Indiana University swimming coach James \"Doc\" Counsilman.  All IU undergraduate dormitories are wired, and an ambitious plan to wire graduate housing and IU fraternities and sororities is unveiled; little of this plan is ever accomplished.\n* October 10, 1972 - On the first day of National Fire Prevention Week, a pre-dawn fire destroyed the original WIUS studios.  The fire was arson, set in at least two locations, the sales office at the front of the building and the administrative offices in the rear; the person or persons responsible have never been arrested.  For one week, WIUS programming aired from a spare studio of the Indiana University Radio and Television Service.  WIUS then relocated until Spring Break of 1973 to the old Elliott House WQAD studios, using salvaged and borrowed equipment, records that survived the fire and records from student DJ collections.\n* March 1973 - WIUS moves over spring break from Elliott House into a house at 815 E. 8th St., two blocks from the previous WIUS house.\n[[Image:WQAX Logo 1970.png|right|thumb|300px|WQAX Logo from 1970s]]\n* September 1973 - The IU Student Broadcast Corporation, a not-for-profit student corporation, creates a new radio station, WQAX, partly out of frustrated efforts to get WIUS onto the off-campus cable TV system; the attitude of one IU administrator towards the idea was quoted at the time as \"Students shouldn't be talking to townspeople.\"  Many of the first WQAX programmers were former WIUS members, and the two stations maintained a friendly rivalry as WIUS finally gained access to its own cable FM frequency.\n* Spring 1974 -  In addition to carrier current, WIUS begins to air its programming on the local Bloomington, Ind., cable TV system, then owned by Monroe Cablevision, at 95.1 mHz.  Broadcasts to IU dormitories and a select number of fraternities and sororities (notably [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Evans Scholars]] and the houses surrounding them) remained carrier current, although after 1977 the carrier current system was allowed to deteriorate and reception was often spotty or absent in certain dormitories.  It wasn't until the late 1980s that the IU dormitories would be wired for cable; as soon as they were, WIUS became exclusively cable-accessible.\n* 1973 to 1993 - WQAX, identified on-air as \"Quacks,\" was a college/community access radio station at 100.3&nbsp;MHz (non-broadcast) on the local cable TV system in Bloomington, Ind.  The station was free-form and volunteer-driven. It offered Indiana University students, wanna-be DJs, music maniacs, and local eccentrics a way to learn about radio. And it added, for a defined period of time, a yet-to-be duplicated brand of insanity to the local landscape.  Originally operating from an office in the Indiana Memorial Union, supplied by the IU Student Association, which assisted in its founding as an alternative to the then-tightly formatted contemporary hit rock WIUS programming, WQAX studios moved several times during its 20-year life.\n* 1985 - After several years of sometimes sporadic broadcasts and funding so bad that portions of the WIUS House were rented out as student apartments, a group of students dedicated to IU radio formed a committee to search out money for WIUS\u2014and with the university's help they provided funding to help improve the station. This funding lasted until the end of the decade.\n* 1993 - WQAX was forced to close for want of money (or, some have maintained, taken an extended hiatus). Most of its music library and equipment were dispersed. Its members, who over the years numbered in the hundreds, likewise scattered.\n\n[[Image:WIUX Contour Map.gif|right|thumb|300px|WIUX Contour Map [FCC file: FL1104780]]\n\n* 1994 - WIUS was allowed a portion of the student activity fee for each of the following two school years. This funding allowed WIUS to further its evolution, and it added open-air AM broadcasts beginning October 3, from a low-power transmitter, identical to those used for roadside traffic reports in any cities, atop the Indiana University Library, broadcasting to an approximately three-mile radius at 1570&nbsp;kHz, while maintaining its cable FM presence.  This transmitter will remain in place until January 2006.\n* 1998 - WIUS stayed with the information technology boom by adding a RealAudio server to their existing website. This served as a new way for alumni and parents, as well as other people outside of the Bloomington area to listen to WIUS.  The amount of increased interest allowed WIUS to make a partnership with Nibblebox.com to help broaden the server and increase the number of users to the RealAudio link.\n* 2004 \u2013 An application for a student-operated FM radio license is submitted to the FCC.  The FCC delays granting a low-power FM license to WIUS because of another application in the Bloomington area.\n* March 2005 - After settling the debate in court, the FCC grants the permit to WIUS and assigns the operating frequency of 100.3&nbsp;MHz, identical to the former WQAX cable access station.  The move to an FCC licensed broadcast FM station, however means that the station will need to change its call letters.  Since 1981, [[WIUS]]-FM has operated as the FCC-licensed, student-operated FM station at Western Illinois University.  The selection of '''WIUX''' as the new call sign (usage of the \"X\") is a small tribute to the former WQAX, its Indiana student staff (now alumni), and the Bloomington area that it served.\n* January 2006 - WIUX is born and signs on (over the air) at 100.3 FM, operated and programmed by IU students,\n[[Image:WIUX logo.png|right|thumb|200px|Early WIUX logo]]\n* June 2007 - WIUX moves to 99.1 FM after the FCC awarded the 100.3 FM frequency to [[WYGB]] in Columbus, Ind.\n* July 2014 - WIUX relocates to a temporary location at 715-717 E. 8th Street, just a block away from its previous house. The move comes as Indiana University makes plans to build a new fraternity house on 8th Street between Woodlawn Avenue and Park Avenue. \n* July 2017 - WIUX moves from its house into Franklin Hall, home of the new IU media school.\n\n==FCC/Right to broadcast controversy==\nOn October 31, 2006, WIUX announced on its website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiux.org/new/dj-letter/|title=WIUX|website=Wiux.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] was granting the 100.3 mHz frequency to a Class A FM radio station in [[Edinburgh, Indiana]], taking over the frequency WIUX had been granted only the previous year.  Because the Indiana University student-based station operates as a Low Power station, the FCC maintains that it has the right to move the station or remove it from the air. Indiana University filed a petition against the move. The Dean of Students and Vice President of Student Affairs at Indiana University, [[Richard McKaig]], states in the official petition (available through the WIUX website): \"The Indiana frequency did not appear on the Commission\u2019s internet site or on a public notice until after the comment reply date of June 13, 2006 deadline. As a result, we did not have a fair chance to file public comments.\" On November 6, both Indiana senators, Evan Bayh (Dem) and Richard Lugar (Rep), wrote petitions of support for WIUX to the FCC.\n\nOn June 4, 2007 WIUX moved from 100.3 FM to 99.1 FM.\n\n==Radio format==\nWIUX is a [[variety (radio)|variety]] [[radio format]] [[college radio]] station. It features music of different genres, news, sports, and talk programming. Students broadcast live play-by-play of Indiana Hoosiers football, men's and women's basketball, and men's and women's soccer.\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2016 and 2020, WIUX won \"Best college radio station in America\" in the [[Intercollegiate Broadcasting System]] Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://files.constantcontact.com/f484924b001/59853eb5-2796-410e-8130-880004a2088d.pdf|title=IBS College Radio Audio Finalists 2020|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  \nIn 2009, WIUX was nominated for the [[mtvU]] Woodie Award for best college radio station in America.\n\n==Culture Shock==\nCulture Shock is a free yearly festival traditionally held in Dunn Meadow or 3rd St. Park by WIUX.

The move comes as Indiana University makes plans to build a new fraternity house on 8th Street between Woodlawn Avenue and Park Avenue. \n* July 2017 - WIUX moves from its house into Franklin Hall, home of the new IU media school.\n\n==FCC/Right to broadcast controversy==\nOn October 31, 2006, WIUX announced on its website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiux.org/new/dj-letter/|title=WIUX|website=Wiux.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] was granting the 100.3 mHz frequency to a Class A FM radio station in [[Edinburgh, Indiana]], taking over the frequency WIUX had been granted only the previous year.  Because the Indiana University student-based station operates as a Low Power station, the FCC maintains that it has the right to move the station or remove it from the air. Indiana University filed a petition against the move. The Dean of Students and Vice President of Student Affairs at Indiana University, [[Richard McKaig]], states in the official petition (available through the WIUX website): \"The Indiana frequency did not appear on the Commission\u2019s internet site or on a public notice until after the comment reply date of June 13, 2006 deadline. As a result, we did not have a fair chance to file public comments.\" On November 6, both Indiana senators, Evan Bayh (Dem) and Richard Lugar (Rep), wrote petitions of support for WIUX to the FCC.\n\nOn June 4, 2007 WIUX moved from 100.3 FM to 99.1 FM.\n\n==Radio format==\nWIUX is a [[variety (radio)|variety]] [[radio format]] [[college radio]] station. It features music of different genres, news, sports, and talk programming. Students broadcast live play-by-play of Indiana Hoosiers football, men's and women's basketball, and men's and women's soccer.\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2016 and 2020, WIUX won \"Best college radio station in America\" in the [[Intercollegiate Broadcasting System]] Awards.  \nIn 2009, WIUX was nominated for the [[mtvU]] Woodie Award for best college radio station in America.\n\n==Culture Shock==\nCulture Shock is a free yearly festival traditionally held in Dunn Meadow or 3rd St. Park by WIUX. It typically happens in the beginning of April. Culture Shock was founded in 1986 by Jim Kerns and John Polak.

The show took place on July 5, 2000 in [[Tokyo|Tokyo, Japan]]. It was only the second show to take place outside Mexico and the first show to take place in Japan. The Main event featured an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Eight-man \"At\u00f3micos\" tag team match]] which saw AAA regulars team up with various Japanese wrestlers. The team of [[Octag\u00f3n]], [[Jushin Thunder Liger]], [[Latin Lover (wrestler)|Latin Lover]], and [[El Alebrije (wrestler)|El Alebrije]] took on [[Cibern\u00e9tico]], [[Nobuhiko Oshima|Shiima Nobunaga]], [[Abismo Negro]], and [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]].\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nIn early 1992 [[Antonio Pe\u00f1a]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]], later simply known as \"AAA\" or Triple A.
