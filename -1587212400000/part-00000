British fleets had achieved dominance in European waters over the French following heavy defeats of French fleets in 1759. To maintain this control, British battle squadrons were stationed off French ports, as well as ports in neutral but French-supporting [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] which sheltered French warships. In 1761, two French ships, the 64-gun [[ship of the line]] ''Achille'' and 32-gun [[frigate]] ''Bouffone'' were [[blockade]]d in the principal Spanish naval base of C\u00e1diz, on the Southern Atlantic coast of Spain.\n\n''Achille'' had departed the French Atlantic base of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in March, fighting though the blockade of that port, and was then trapped in C\u00e1diz by a British squadron detached from the Mediterranean Fleet based at [[Gibraltar]] comprising ships of the line [[HMS Thunderer (1760)|HMS ''Thunderer'']] and [[HMS Modeste (1759)|HMS ''Modeste'']], frigate HMS ''Thetis'' and [[sloop]] HMS ''Favourite'', under the command of Captain Charles Proby on ''Thunderer''. When the French ship attempted to leave Proby gave chase, eventually catching them and bringing them to battle. ''Thunderer'' suffered heavy losses when a cannon exploded, but Proby was able to bring his ship alongside ''Achille'' and capture the ship in a [[naval boarding|boarding action]] while ''Thetis'' and ''Modeste'' captured ''Bouffone''.\n\n==Action==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1759 the [[French Navy]] suffered heavy losses in the defeats at the [[Battle of Lagos]] and the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]], which gave the [[Royal Navy]] superiority in the Atlantic.<ref name=\"WLC232\">Clowes, p.232</ref> To retain this advantage, the Royal Navy stationed squadrons off the principal French naval bases in a strategy of close [[blockade]]; French ships periodically attempted to break through this blockade to operate against British commerce. On 9 March 1761, the squadron off the port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in [[Brittany]], led by Commodore [[Matthew Buckle]], sighted a French [[ships of the line]] and a [[frigate]] sailing from the port. Buckle ordered the 60-gun British ship [[HMS Rippon (1758)|HMS ''Rippon'']] under Captain Edward Jekyll to pursue the French, Jekyll chasing the enemy ships into the [[Bay of Biscay]].

The wind was strong and the seas rough, neither ship able to easily use their lower gun deck without water sloshing in through the gunports. During the exchange of fire, one of the guns on ''Rippon'' suddenly exploded, causing heavy casualties among the gun crews. Jekyll was forced to order most of the forward gunports closed in consequence, but fire from ''Rippon'' was able to knock away the foreyard and foretop mast on ''Achille''. This caused ''Rippon'' to pull ahead of ''Achille'' and Jekyll brought his ship into the wind in readiness for an attack by the French ship. ''Achille'' however passed by the stern of ''Rippon'' missing the opportunity to [[raking fire|rake]] the British ship.
