Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Tom Waits]], [[David Byrne]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Gavin Bryars]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Marina Abramovi\u0107]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Darryl Pinckney]], [[Richard Gallo (performance artist)|Richard Gallo]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. In 1991 Wilson established [[The Watermill Center]], \"a laboratory for performance\" on the East End of [[Long Island]], New York. He has received more commissions for new works in Europe than in the United States since the late 20th century, regularly working with opera and theatre companies, as well as cultural festivals.\n\n==Early life and education==\nWilson was born in [[Waco, Texas]], the son of Loree Velma (n\u00e9e Hamilton) and D.M. Wilson, a lawyer.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Robert-Wilson.html \"Robert Wilson\"], ''Film Reference''</ref> After attending local schools, he studied business administration at the [[University of Texas]] from 1959 to 1962.\n\nHe moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1963 in order to change fields. He received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in architecture from the [[Pratt Institute]] in 1966. During this period, he also attended lectures by [[Sibyl Moholy-Nagy]] (widow of [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]]), and studied painting with artist [[George McNeil (artist)|George McNeil]].

With this company, he directed his first major works, beginning with 1969's ''The King of Spain'' and ''The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud''. He began to work in opera in the early 1970s, creating ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' with composer [[Philip Glass]]. This work brought the two artists worldwide renown. Following ''Einstein'', Wilson worked increasingly with major European theaters and opera houses.<ref name=paula/> For the New York debut of his first opera, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] allowed Wilson to rent the house on a Sunday, when they did not have a production, but would not produce the work.

His plans for the rectangular park feature a central square divided into nine equally sized fields separated by bushes. Each field will be installed with objects related to the home. For example, one unit will consist of a small fireplace surrounded by stones that serve as seating. The park will be lit by large, lightbox-style lamps build into the ground and by smaller ones modelled on ordinary floor lamps.<ref>Clemens Bomsdorf (June 28, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Helsinki-to-get-new-art-park/24045 Helsinki to get new art park] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref>\n\n==Style==\n\n===Language===\nLanguage is one of the most important elements of theatre and Robert Wilson feels at home with commanding it in many different ways. Wilson's impact on this part of theatre alone is immense. Arthur Holmberg, professor of theatre at [[Brandeis University]], says that \"In theatre, no one has dramatized the crisis of language with as much ferocious genius as Robert Wilson\".<ref name=ho>Holmberg, Arthur (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAjTK98rIwkC ''The Theatre Of Robert Wilson''], Cambridge: Cambridge UP {{ISBN|978-0-52136-492-8}}</ref>{{rp|41}} Wilson makes it evident in his work that what's and why's of language are terribly important and cannot be overlooked. [[Tom Waits]], acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson's unique relationship with words:\n\n<blockquote>Words for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you're barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.<ref name=ho />{{rp|43}}</blockquote>\n\nWilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of [[Gertrude Stein]] and listening to recordings of her speaking with \"changing [his] way of thinking forever.\"<ref>\"Director's Notes\" in a program for Stein's ''Four Saints in Three Acts'', quoted in Sarah Bay-Cheng (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FFSTAgAAQBAJ ''Mama Dada: Gertrude Stein's Avant-Garde Theater''], p. 135, New York: Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-20350-302-7}}</ref> Wilson directed three of Stein's works in the 1990s: ''[[Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights]]'' (1992), ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' (1996), and ''Saints and Singing'' (1998).\n\nWilson considers language and, down to its very ingredients, words, as a sort of \"a social artifact\".<ref name=ho/>{{rp|44}} Not only does language change with time but it changes with person, with culture. Using his experience of working with mentally handicapped children and enlisting the collaboration of [[Christopher Knowles]], a renowned autistic poet, has allowed Wilson to attack language from many views. Wilson embraces this by often \"juxtaposing levels of diction \u2013 Miltonic opulence and contemporary ling, crib poetry and pre-verbal screams\" in an attempt to show his audience how elusive language really is and how ever-changing it can be.<ref name=ho/>{{rp|44}} Visually showing words is another method Wilson uses to show the beauty of language. Often his set designs, program covers, and posters are graffiti'd with words. This allows the audience to look at the \"language itself\" rather than \"the objects and meanings it refers to.\".<ref name=ho/>{{rp|45}}\n\nThe lack of language becomes essential to Wilson's work as well. In the same way an artist uses positive and negative space, Wilson uses noise and silence. In working on a production of ''[[King Lear]]'', Wilson inadvertently describes his necessity of silence:\n\n<blockquote>The way actors are trained here is wrong. All they think about is interpreting a text. They worry about how to speak words and know nothing about their bodies. You see that by the way they walk. They don't understand the weight of a gesture in space. A good actor can command an audience by moving one finger.<ref name=ho />{{rp|49}}</blockquote>\n\nThis emphasis on silence is fully explored in some of his works. ''Deafman Glance'' is a play without words, and his adaptation of [[Heiner M\u00fcller]]'s play ''{{Interlanguage link|Quartett (play)|de|3=Quartett (Heiner M\u00fcller)|lt=Quartet}}'' contained a fifteen-minute wordless prologue. Holmberg describes these works stating, \n\n<blockquote>Language does many things and does them well. But we tend to shut our eyes to what language does not do well. Despite the arrogance of words \u2013 they rule traditional theatre with an iron fist \u2013 not all experience can be translated into a linguistic code.<ref name=ho />{{rp|50}}</blockquote>\n\nCelebrated twentieth century playwright [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] said that Wilson \"surpassed [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]\" because \"[Wilson's] silence is a silence that speaks\".<ref name=ho/>{{rp|52}} This silence onstage may be unnerving to audience members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson's means of answering his own question: \"Why is it no one looks? Why is it no one knows how to look? Why does no one see anything on stage?\".<ref name=ho/>{{rp|52}}\n\nAnother technique Wilson uses is that of what words can mean to a particular character. His piece, ''I was sitting on my patio this guy appeared I thought I was hallucinating'', features only two characters, both of whom deliver the same stream-of-consciousness monologue. In the play's first production one character was \"aloof, cold, [and] precise\" while the other \"brought screwball comedy\u2026 warmth and color\u2026 playful[ness]\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|61}} The different emphases and deliveries brought to the monologue two different meanings; \"audiences found it hard to believe they heard the same monologue twice\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|61}} Rather than tell his audience what words are supposed to mean, he opens them up for interpretation, presenting the idea that \"meanings are not tethered to words like horses to hitching posts\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|61}}\n\n===Movement===\nMovement is another key element in Wilson's work. As a dancer, he sees the importance of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight their movement bears. When speaking of his \"play without words\" rendition of [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', Wilson says:\n\n<blockquote>I do movement before we work on the text. Later we'll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it's strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. What you hear and what you see are two different layers. When you put them together, you create another texture.<ref name=ho />{{rp|136}}</blockquote>\n\nWith such an emphasis on movement, Wilson even tailors his auditions around the necessity of it. In his auditions, \"Wilson often does an elaborate movement sequence\" and \"asks the actor to repeat it\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|136}} [[Thomas Derrah]], an actor in ''[[the CIVIL warS]]'', found the audition process to be baffling: \"When I went in, [Wilson] asked me to walk across the room on a count of 31, sit down on a count of 7, put my hand to my forehead on a count of 59. I was mystified by the whole process\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|137}} To further cement the importance of movement in Wilson's works, [[Seth Goldstein]], another actor in ''the CIVIL warS'', stated \"every movement from the moment I walked onto the platform until I left was choreographed to the second. During the scene at table all I did was count movements. All I thought about was timing\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|137}}\n\nWhen it comes time to add the text in with movement, there is still much work to be done. Wilson pays close attention to the text and still makes sure there is enough \"space around a text\" in order for the audience to soak it up.<ref name=ho/>{{rp|139}} At this point, the actors know their movements and the time in which they are executed, allowing Wilson to tack the actions onto specific pieces of text. His overall goal is to have the rhythm of the text differ from that of the movement so his audience can see them as two completely different pieces, seeing each as what it is. When in the text/movement stage, Wilson often interrupts the rehearsal, saying things like \"Something is wrong. We have to check your scripts to see if you put the numbers in the right place\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|139}} He goes on to explain the importance of this:\n\n<blockquote>I know it's hell to separate text and movement and maintain two different rhythms. It takes time to train yourself to keep tongue and body working against each other. But things happen with the body that have nothing to do with what we say. It's more interesting if the mind and the body are in two different places, occupying different zones of reality.<ref name=ho />{{rp|139}}</blockquote>\n\nThese rhythms keep the mind on its toes, consciously and subconsciously taking in the meanings behind the movement and how it is matching up with the language.\n\nSimilar to Wilson's use of the lack of language in his works, he also sees the importance that a lack of movement can have. In his production of ''[[Medea]]'', Wilson arranged a scene in which the lead singer stood still during her entire song while many others moved around her. Wilson recalls that \"she complained that if I didn't give her any movements, no one would notice her. I told her if she knew how to stand, everyone would watch her. I told her to stand like a marble statue of a goddess who had been standing in the same spot for a thousand years\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|147}} Allowing an actor to have such stage presence without ever saying a word is very provocative, which is precisely what Wilson means to accomplish with any sense of movement he puts on the stage.\n\n===Lighting===\nWilson believes that, \"The most important part of theatre\" is light.<ref name=ho/>{{rp|121}} He is concerned with how images are defined onstage, and this is related to the light of an object or tableau. He feels that the lighting design can really bring the production to life. The set designer for Wilson's ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down|the CIVIL warS]]'', Tom Kamm, describes his philosophy: \"a set for Wilson is a canvas for the light to hit like paint\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|121}} He explains, \"If you know how to light, you can make shit look like gold. I paint, I build, I compose with light. Light is a magic wand\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|121}}\n\nWilson is \"the only major director to get billing as a lighting designer\" and is recognized by some as \"the greatest light artist of our time\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|122}} He designs with light to be flowing rather than an off-and-on pattern, thus making his lighting \"like a musical score\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|123}} Wilson's lighting designs feature \"dense, palpable textures\" and allow \"people and objects to leap out from the background\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|123}} In his design for ''Quartett'', Wilson used four hundred light cues in a span of only ninety minutes.<ref name=ho />{{rp|122}}\n\nHe is a perfectionist, persisting to achieve every aspect of his vision. A fifteen-minute monologue in ''Quartett'' took two days for him to light while a single hand gesture took nearly three hours.<ref name=ho />{{rp|126}} This attention to detail expresses his conviction that, \"light is the most important actor on stage\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|128}}\n\n===Props===\nWilson's interest in design extends to the props in his productions, which he designs and sometimes participates in constructing. Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each as a work of art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order \"to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships\" on stage.<ref name=ho />{{rp|128}} Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is \"renowned for sending them back again and again and again until they satisfy him\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|128}} He is so strict in his attention to detail that when Jeff Muscovin, his technical director for ''Quartett'', suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:\n\n<blockquote>No, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won't sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They'll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. Just make sure you get strong wood.

In 1991 Wilson established [[The Watermill Center]], \"a laboratory for performance\" on the East End of [[Long Island]], New York. He has received more commissions for new works in Europe than in the United States since the late 20th century, regularly working with opera and theatre companies, as well as cultural festivals.\n\n==Early life and education==\nWilson was born in [[Waco, Texas]], the son of Loree Velma (n\u00e9e Hamilton) and D.M.

He received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in architecture from the [[Pratt Institute]] in 1966. During this period, he also attended lectures by [[Sibyl Moholy-Nagy]] (widow of [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]]), and studied painting with artist [[George McNeil (artist)|George McNeil]].

With this company, he directed his first major works, beginning with 1969's ''The King of Spain'' and ''The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud''. He began to work in opera in the early 1970s, creating ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' with composer [[Philip Glass]]. This work brought the two artists worldwide renown.

For example, one unit will consist of a small fireplace surrounded by stones that serve as seating. The park will be lit by large, lightbox-style lamps build into the ground and by smaller ones modelled on ordinary floor lamps.<ref>Clemens Bomsdorf (June 28, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Helsinki-to-get-new-art-park/24045 Helsinki to get new art park] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref>\n\n==Style==\n\n===Language===\nLanguage is one of the most important elements of theatre and Robert Wilson feels at home with commanding it in many different ways. Wilson's impact on this part of theatre alone is immense. Arthur Holmberg, professor of theatre at [[Brandeis University]], says that \"In theatre, no one has dramatized the crisis of language with as much ferocious genius as Robert Wilson\".<ref name=ho>Holmberg, Arthur (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAjTK98rIwkC ''The Theatre Of Robert Wilson''], Cambridge: Cambridge UP {{ISBN|978-0-52136-492-8}}</ref>{{rp|41}} Wilson makes it evident in his work that what's and why's of language are terribly important and cannot be overlooked. [[Tom Waits]], acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson's unique relationship with words:\n\n<blockquote>Words for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you're barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.<ref name=ho />{{rp|43}}</blockquote>\n\nWilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of [[Gertrude Stein]] and listening to recordings of her speaking with \"changing [his] way of thinking forever.\"<ref>\"Director's Notes\" in a program for Stein's ''Four Saints in Three Acts'', quoted in Sarah Bay-Cheng (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FFSTAgAAQBAJ ''Mama Dada: Gertrude Stein's Avant-Garde Theater''], p. 135, New York: Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-20350-302-7}}</ref> Wilson directed three of Stein's works in the 1990s: ''[[Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights]]'' (1992), ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' (1996), and ''Saints and Singing'' (1998).\n\nWilson considers language and, down to its very ingredients, words, as a sort of \"a social artifact\".<ref name=ho/>{{rp|44}} Not only does language change with time but it changes with person, with culture. Using his experience of working with mentally handicapped children and enlisting the collaboration of [[Christopher Knowles]], a renowned autistic poet, has allowed Wilson to attack language from many views. Wilson embraces this by often \"juxtaposing levels of diction \u2013 Miltonic opulence and contemporary ling, crib poetry and pre-verbal screams\" in an attempt to show his audience how elusive language really is and how ever-changing it can be.<ref name=ho/>{{rp|44}} Visually showing words is another method Wilson uses to show the beauty of language. Often his set designs, program covers, and posters are graffiti'd with words. This allows the audience to look at the \"language itself\" rather than \"the objects and meanings it refers to.\".<ref name=ho/>{{rp|45}}\n\nThe lack of language becomes essential to Wilson's work as well. In the same way an artist uses positive and negative space, Wilson uses noise and silence. In working on a production of ''[[King Lear]]'', Wilson inadvertently describes his necessity of silence:\n\n<blockquote>The way actors are trained here is wrong. All they think about is interpreting a text. They worry about how to speak words and know nothing about their bodies. You see that by the way they walk. They don't understand the weight of a gesture in space. A good actor can command an audience by moving one finger.<ref name=ho />{{rp|49}}</blockquote>\n\nThis emphasis on silence is fully explored in some of his works. ''Deafman Glance'' is a play without words, and his adaptation of [[Heiner M\u00fcller]]'s play ''{{Interlanguage link|Quartett (play)|de|3=Quartett (Heiner M\u00fcller)|lt=Quartet}}'' contained a fifteen-minute wordless prologue. Holmberg describes these works stating, \n\n<blockquote>Language does many things and does them well. But we tend to shut our eyes to what language does not do well. Despite the arrogance of words \u2013 they rule traditional theatre with an iron fist \u2013 not all experience can be translated into a linguistic code.<ref name=ho />{{rp|50}}</blockquote>\n\nCelebrated twentieth century playwright [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] said that Wilson \"surpassed [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]\" because \"[Wilson's] silence is a silence that speaks\".<ref name=ho/>{{rp|52}} This silence onstage may be unnerving to audience members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson's means of answering his own question: \"Why is it no one looks? Why is it no one knows how to look? Why does no one see anything on stage?\".<ref name=ho/>{{rp|52}}\n\nAnother technique Wilson uses is that of what words can mean to a particular character. His piece, ''I was sitting on my patio this guy appeared I thought I was hallucinating'', features only two characters, both of whom deliver the same stream-of-consciousness monologue. In the play's first production one character was \"aloof, cold, [and] precise\" while the other \"brought screwball comedy\u2026 warmth and color\u2026 playful[ness]\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|61}} The different emphases and deliveries brought to the monologue two different meanings; \"audiences found it hard to believe they heard the same monologue twice\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|61}} Rather than tell his audience what words are supposed to mean, he opens them up for interpretation, presenting the idea that \"meanings are not tethered to words like horses to hitching posts\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|61}}\n\n===Movement===\nMovement is another key element in Wilson's work. As a dancer, he sees the importance of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight their movement bears. When speaking of his \"play without words\" rendition of [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', Wilson says:\n\n<blockquote>I do movement before we work on the text. Later we'll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it's strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. What you hear and what you see are two different layers. When you put them together, you create another texture.<ref name=ho />{{rp|136}}</blockquote>\n\nWith such an emphasis on movement, Wilson even tailors his auditions around the necessity of it. In his auditions, \"Wilson often does an elaborate movement sequence\" and \"asks the actor to repeat it\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|136}} [[Thomas Derrah]], an actor in ''[[the CIVIL warS]]'', found the audition process to be baffling: \"When I went in, [Wilson] asked me to walk across the room on a count of 31, sit down on a count of 7, put my hand to my forehead on a count of 59. I was mystified by the whole process\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|137}} To further cement the importance of movement in Wilson's works, [[Seth Goldstein]], another actor in ''the CIVIL warS'', stated \"every movement from the moment I walked onto the platform until I left was choreographed to the second. During the scene at table all I did was count movements. All I thought about was timing\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|137}}\n\nWhen it comes time to add the text in with movement, there is still much work to be done. Wilson pays close attention to the text and still makes sure there is enough \"space around a text\" in order for the audience to soak it up.<ref name=ho/>{{rp|139}} At this point, the actors know their movements and the time in which they are executed, allowing Wilson to tack the actions onto specific pieces of text. His overall goal is to have the rhythm of the text differ from that of the movement so his audience can see them as two completely different pieces, seeing each as what it is. When in the text/movement stage, Wilson often interrupts the rehearsal, saying things like \"Something is wrong. We have to check your scripts to see if you put the numbers in the right place\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|139}} He goes on to explain the importance of this:\n\n<blockquote>I know it's hell to separate text and movement and maintain two different rhythms. It takes time to train yourself to keep tongue and body working against each other. But things happen with the body that have nothing to do with what we say. It's more interesting if the mind and the body are in two different places, occupying different zones of reality.<ref name=ho />{{rp|139}}</blockquote>\n\nThese rhythms keep the mind on its toes, consciously and subconsciously taking in the meanings behind the movement and how it is matching up with the language.\n\nSimilar to Wilson's use of the lack of language in his works, he also sees the importance that a lack of movement can have. In his production of ''[[Medea]]'', Wilson arranged a scene in which the lead singer stood still during her entire song while many others moved around her. Wilson recalls that \"she complained that if I didn't give her any movements, no one would notice her. I told her if she knew how to stand, everyone would watch her. I told her to stand like a marble statue of a goddess who had been standing in the same spot for a thousand years\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|147}} Allowing an actor to have such stage presence without ever saying a word is very provocative, which is precisely what Wilson means to accomplish with any sense of movement he puts on the stage.\n\n===Lighting===\nWilson believes that, \"The most important part of theatre\" is light.<ref name=ho/>{{rp|121}} He is concerned with how images are defined onstage, and this is related to the light of an object or tableau. He feels that the lighting design can really bring the production to life. The set designer for Wilson's ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down|the CIVIL warS]]'', Tom Kamm, describes his philosophy: \"a set for Wilson is a canvas for the light to hit like paint\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|121}} He explains, \"If you know how to light, you can make shit look like gold. I paint, I build, I compose with light. Light is a magic wand\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|121}}\n\nWilson is \"the only major director to get billing as a lighting designer\" and is recognized by some as \"the greatest light artist of our time\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|122}} He designs with light to be flowing rather than an off-and-on pattern, thus making his lighting \"like a musical score\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|123}} Wilson's lighting designs feature \"dense, palpable textures\" and allow \"people and objects to leap out from the background\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|123}} In his design for ''Quartett'', Wilson used four hundred light cues in a span of only ninety minutes.<ref name=ho />{{rp|122}}\n\nHe is a perfectionist, persisting to achieve every aspect of his vision. A fifteen-minute monologue in ''Quartett'' took two days for him to light while a single hand gesture took nearly three hours.<ref name=ho />{{rp|126}} This attention to detail expresses his conviction that, \"light is the most important actor on stage\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|128}}\n\n===Props===\nWilson's interest in design extends to the props in his productions, which he designs and sometimes participates in constructing. Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each as a work of art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order \"to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships\" on stage.<ref name=ho />{{rp|128}} Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is \"renowned for sending them back again and again and again until they satisfy him\".<ref name=ho />{{rp|128}} He is so strict in his attention to detail that when Jeff Muscovin, his technical director for ''Quartett'', suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:\n\n<blockquote>No, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won't sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They'll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. Just make sure you get strong wood. And no knots.<ref name=ho />{{rp|129}}</blockquote>\n\nSuch attention to detail and perfectionism usually resulted in an expensive collection of props. \"Curators regard them as sculptures\",<ref name=ho />{{rp|129}} and the props have been sold for prices ranging from \"$4,500 to $80,000\".<ref>Gussow, Mel (1998) ''Theatre On The Edge'', New York: Applause {{ISBN|978-1-55783-311-2}}</ref>{{rp|113}}\n\n==Personal life==\nWilson is [[gay]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/movies/22gold.html | work=The New York Times | title=Austere, Enigmatic Innovator.

He also used single stanzas in other cantatas, and the first stanza in his [[St Matthew Passion structure#31|St Matthew Passion]] as movement 31, as the reply of Jesus after his prayer in [[Gethsemane]].<ref name=\"Terry\" /><ref name=\"BCW\" /> In translations of the scene, it was rendered as \"O Father, let Thy will be done\".<ref name=\"Terry\" />\n\nComposers wrote settings for different scoring, for example [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] in ''[[Geistliche Chormusik]]'' (No. 24), [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] in cantata TWV 1:1529, [[Max Reger]] in [[Reger works#135|Op. 135]]a No. 27, {{ill|Hermann Bendix|de}}, [[G\u00fcnter Raphael]] and {{ill|Erwin Amend|de}}.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"Terry\">{{cite book\n| last = Terry\n| first = Charles Sanford\n| authorlink = Charles Sanford Terry\n| url = https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/bach-bachs-chorals-vol-1-the-hymns-and-hymn-melodies-of-the-passions-and-oratorios\n| title = No. 31.: O Father, let thy will be done (Was mein Gott will)\n| work = Johann Sebastian Bach, Bach\u2019s Chorals, vol. 1 The Hymns and Hymn Melodies of the \u201cPassions\u201d and Oratorios\n| publisher = oll.libertyfund.org\n| year = 1915\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Winterfeld\">{{cite book\n| last = Winterfeld\n| first = Carl von\n| authorlink = \n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aOcsAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA71\n| title = Der evangelische Kirchengesang und sein Verh\u00e4ltni\u00df zur Kunst des Tonsatzes\n| location = [[Leipzig]]\n| publisher = oll.libertyfund.org\n| year = 1943\n| page = 71\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BCW\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bach-cantatas.com/CM/Was-mein-Gott-will-das-gscheh-allzeit.htm\n| title = Chorale Melodies used in Bach's Vocal Works / Was mein Gott will, das g\u2019scheh allzeit\n| publisher = Bach Cantatas Website\n| year = 2009\n| accessdate = 5 April 2020\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hymnary\">{{cite web\n| url = https://hymnary.org/text/was_mein_gott_will_das_gscheh_allzeit\n| title = mein Gott will, das g\u2019scheh allzeit\n| publisher = hymnary.org\n| accessdate = 5 April 2020\n}}</ref>\n<!--\n<ref name=\"Kelly\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hymnary.org/text/i_into_gods_own_heart_and_mind\n| title = I into God's own heart and mind\n| publisher = hymnary.org\n| accessdate = 11 February 2017\n}}</ref>-->\n\n}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* [[Philipp Wackernagel]]: ''1240.

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]].

Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates.

Most of the coast consists of [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] that extend far inland. The largest [[harbor|natural harbor]] is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many [[coral reef]]s and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the [[Al Batinah Region|Al B\u0101\u0163inah]] coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]], the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] of Oman separated by the UAE.\n\nSouth and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling [[dune|sand dunes]] merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia.

[[Lake Zakher]] is a [[Man-made lake|human-made lake]] near the border with Oman.\n\nPrior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Al-Hajar al-Gharbi]] Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n[[File:1501200713074 Acacia tortilis.jpg|thumb|[[Acacia]] trees growing in desert suburbs near [[Fujairah]]]]\nThe oases grow [[Phoenix dactylifera|date palms]], [[acacia]] and [[eucalyptus]] trees.

This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

Khawr al Udayd was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, [[Percy Cox]], confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] ('Zayed the Great') that Khawr al Udayd belonged to his sheikhdom.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Keepers of the Golden Shore: A History of the United Arab Emirates |date=15 February 2016|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn= 9781780235806|pages=49\u201350 |url=http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780235806 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===British era and discovery of oil===\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[pearl hunting|pearling industry]] thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[Second World War]], when the newly-independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History & Traditions: Pearls & pearling |work=UAEinteract |accessdate=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |archivedate=6 February 2016  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven [[sheikhs]] of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office.

BP joined with [[Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles]] (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA).

This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962.

Nowadays the UAE is one of the world's richest countries, with GDP per capita almost 80% higher than OECD average.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs impressive as economic growth has been in the UAE, the total population has increased from just around 550,000 in 1975 to close to 10 million in 2018. This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.
