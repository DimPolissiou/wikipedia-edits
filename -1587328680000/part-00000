The show's length was approximately five months, finished on April 16, 2012. The prize has been increased to [[Argentine peso|AR$]]1,000,000 ([[USD]]235,000) which will be reduced according to how many times a housemate is nominated. The show is hosted by Jorge Rial, who has hosted the show since 2007, until January 13, 2012 when he left the show. Rial was replaced by Mariano Peluffo, who hosted Gran Hermano spinoff shows.\n\nAfter surviving 164 Days (a record in the Americas), Rodrigo Fernandez became the winner, at age 19 became the youngest person to ever win the Argentinian series. All four finalists (Rodrigo, Walquiria, Jorge & Alex) on finale night became the ''Big Brother'' contestants in the continent with the most survived days in a single series.\n\nThis series beat the record length (lasting 164 Days, the previous one lasted 141 Days) set during the previous season and became the longest series ever produced of any ''Big Brother'' show in the Americas. Also, this was the last series to ever air in [[Telefe]].\n\n==The House==\n\nThe season 7 House is the same as the season 6 but it has been redecorated and added a new style. This season has another house called ''La casa de al lado'' (''The House Next Door''), where 4 potential housemates will live there until they pass to the main house, decision made by the public votes by [[SMS]].\n\n==Housemates==\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"navy\" |<span style=\"color:white\">'''Official Housemates'''</span>\n|-\n!

The show's length was approximately five months, finished on April 16, 2012. The prize has been increased to [[Argentine peso|AR$]]1,000,000 ([[USD]]235,000) which will be reduced according to how many times a housemate is nominated. The show is hosted by Jorge Rial, who has hosted the show since 2007, until January 13, 2012 when he left the show. Rial was replaced by Mariano Peluffo, who hosted Gran Hermano spinoff shows.\n\nAfter surviving 164 Days (a record in the Americas), Rodrigo Fernandez became the winner, at age 19 became the youngest person to ever win the Argentinian series. All four finalists (Rodrigo, Walquiria, Jorge & Alex) on finale night became the ''Big Brother'' contestants in the continent with the most survived days in a single series.\n\nThis series beat the record length (lasting 164 Days, the previous one lasted 141 Days) set during the previous season and became the longest series ever produced of any ''Big Brother'' show in the Americas. Also, this was the last series to ever air in [[Telefe]].\n\n==The House==\n\nThe season 7 House is the same as the season 6 but it has been redecorated and added a new style. This season has another house called ''La casa de al lado'' (''The House Next Door''), where 4 potential housemates will live there until they pass to the main house, decision made by the public votes by [[SMS]].\n\n==Housemates==\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"navy\" |<span style=\"color:white\">'''Official Housemates'''</span>\n|-\n!

The plot of the novel takes place in 18th-century Sarajevo under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, and reflects Selimovi\u0107's own torment of the execution of his brother; the story speaks of the futility of one man's resistance against a repressive system, and the change that takes place within that man after he becomes a part of that very system. Some critics have likened this novel to [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Trial]]''. It has been translated into many languages, including [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Rano djelo Me\u0161e Selimovi\u0107a|author=Mirko Skaki\u0107|publisher=Novi glas|publication-place=Banja Luka|pages=92\u201395}}</ref> Each chapter of the novel opens with a [[Qur'an]] citation, the first being: \"[[Basmala|In the name of God, the most compassionate, the most merciful]].\"<ref name=\"Deretic\"/>\n\nThe next novel, ''Tvr\u0111ava'' (The Fortress, 1970), placed still further in the past, is slightly more optimistic, and fulfilled with faith in love, unlike the lonely contemplations and fear in ''Death and the Dervish''. ''The Fortress'' and ''Death and the Dervish'' are the only novels of Selimovi\u0107 that have thus far been translated into English.

His subsequent work, ''Ti\u0161ine'' (Silences) was published eleven years later in 1961. The following books ''Tu\u0111a zemlja'' (''Foreign land'', 1962) and ''Magla i mjese\u010dina'' (''Mist and Moonlight'', 1965) did not receive widespread recognition either.<ref name=\"Deretic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/knjizevnost/jderetic_knjiz/jderetic-knjiz_12_c.html|title=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u045a\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438|author=Jovan Dereti\u0107|publisher=Project Rastko|language=Serbo-Croatian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328161543/http://www.rastko.org.rs/knjizevnost/jderetic_knjiz/jderetic-knjiz_12_c.html|archivedate=28 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHowever, his novel ''[[Death and the Dervish]]'' (''Dervi\u0161 i smrt'', 1966) was widely received as a masterpiece. The plot of the novel takes place in 18th-century Sarajevo under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, and reflects Selimovi\u0107's own torment of the execution of his brother; the story speaks of the futility of one man's resistance against a repressive system, and the change that takes place within that man after he becomes a part of that very system. Some critics have likened this novel to [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Trial]]''. It has been translated into many languages, including [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Rano djelo Me\u0161e Selimovi\u0107a|author=Mirko Skaki\u0107|publisher=Novi glas|publication-place=Banja Luka|pages=92\u201395}}</ref> Each chapter of the novel opens with a [[Qur'an]] citation, the first being: \"[[Basmala|In the name of God, the most compassionate, the most merciful]].\"<ref name=\"Deretic\"/>\n\nThe next novel, ''Tvr\u0111ava'' (The Fortress, 1970), placed still further in the past, is slightly more optimistic, and fulfilled with faith in love, unlike the lonely contemplations and fear in ''Death and the Dervish''. ''The Fortress'' and ''Death and the Dervish'' are the only novels of Selimovi\u0107 that have thus far been translated into English.

While the French wanted to colonize the islands between [[Trinidad]] and [[Bermuda]], the Dutch found ''San Mart\u00edn'' a convenient halfway point between their colonies in [[New Amsterdam]] (present day [[New York City|New York]]) and [[Dutch Brazil|New Holland]]. Meanwhile, the Amerindian population began to decline precipitously, dying from introduced diseases to which they had no immunity.\n\nThe Dutch built a fort ([[Fort Amsterdam (Sint Maarten)|Fort Amsterdam]]) on the island in 1631; Jan Claeszen Van Campen became its first [[List of Sint Maarten governors|governor]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]] began mining [[salt]] on the island. Tensions between the Netherlands and Spain were already high due to the ongoing [[Eighty Years' War]], and in 1633 the Spanish [[Capture of Saint Martin (1633)|captured St Martin]] and drove off the Dutch colonists. At Point Blanche, they built what is now Old Spanish Fort to secure the territory.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Dutch under [[Peter Stuyvesant]] attempted to [[Attack on Saint Martin|wrest back control]] in 1644, but were repulsed.<ref>''Caribbean: The Lesser Antilles'' Karl Luntta</ref> However, in 1648 the Eighty Years' War ended and the Spanish, no longer seeing any strategic or economic value in the island, simply abandoned it.\n\nWith Saint Martin free again, both the Dutch and the French jumped at the chance to re-establish their settlements.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Dutch colonists came from [[Sint Eustatius|St. Eustatius]], while the French came from [[St. Kitts]]. After some initial conflict, both sides realized that neither would yield easily. Preferring to avoid an all-out war, they signed the [[Treaty of Concordia]] in 1648, which divided the island in two.<ref>{{citation|page=13 |title=Concordia Treaty, 23rd March 1648|journal=Heritage |volume=6 |date=15 March 2010 |last=Henocq |first=Christophe |url=https://issuu.com/xtofsxm/docs/heritage_6/15 |accessdate=2018-09-17}}</ref> During the treaty's negotiation, the French had a fleet of [[navy|naval]] ships off shore, which they used as a threat to bargain more land for themselves.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In spite of the treaty, relations between the two sides were not always cordial. Between 1648 and 1816, conflicts changed the border sixteen times. The entire island came under effective French control from 1795 when Netherlands became a [[puppet state]] under the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] until 1815. In the end, the French came out ahead with {{convert|53|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}; 61%) against {{convert|34|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}; 39%) on the Dutch side.\n\n===18th-19th centuries===\nTo work the new cotton, tobacco and sugar plantations the French and Dutch began importing large numbers of African slaves, who soon came to outnumber the Europeans.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The slave population quickly grew larger than that of the land owners. Subjected to cruel treatment, slaves staged rebellions, and their overwhelming numbers made it impossible to ignore their concerns. In 1848, the French [[Abolitionism#Second abolition (1848) and subsequent events|abolished slavery]] in their colonies including the French side of St. Martin. Slaves on the Dutch side of the island protested and threatened to flee to the French side to seek asylum. The local Dutch authorities then freed the colonies' slaves. While this decree was respected locally, it was not until 1863 when the Dutch abolished slavery in all of their island colonies that the slaves became legally free.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lampe|first1=Armando|title=Mission Or Submission?: Moravian and Catholic Missionaries in the Dutch Caribbean During the 19th Century|date=2001|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=9783525559635|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eElMNrbP00C&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Dr. Claude Wathey St. Maarten.JPG|thumb|Statue of Claude Wathey in [[Philipsburg, Sint Maarten|Philipsburg]]]]\nAfter the abolition of slavery, plantation culture declined and the island's economy suffered.

To the north across the [[Anguilla Channel]] lies the British Oversea Territory of [[Anguilla]], to the south-east of the island lies the French island of [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]] and further south are the Dutch islands of [[Saba]] and [[Saint Eustatius]].\n\nSint Maarten is 34 km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The terrain is generally hilly, with the highest peak being [[Mount Flagstaff]] at 383m.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The area to west around the airport is flatter, and contains the Dutch section of the [[Simpson Bay Lagoon]]. The [[Great Salt Pond, Sint Maarten|Great Salt Pond]] lies to north of Philipsburg. Several small islands lie of the coast, notably [[Cow and Calf]], [[Hen and Chicks]], [[Molly Beday]], [[Pelikan Key]], [[Guana Key of Pelican]] and [[Little Key, Sint Maarten|Sint Maarten]] which lies in the Simpson Bay Lagoon.\n\n== Government and politics ==\n[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of the European Union in the world with overseas countries and territories and outermost regions]]\n{{main|Politics of Sint Maarten}}\n\nSint Maarten is a constituent country of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and as such the [[Monarch of the Netherlands]] is head of state, represented locally by a [[Governor of Sint Maarten|Governor]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Following the dissolution of the [[Netherlands Antilles]], the [[Constitution of Sint Maarten]] was unanimously adopted by the island council of Sint Maarten on 21 July 2010. Elections for a new island council [[Sint Maarten general election, 2010|were held on 17 September 2010]], since the number of seats was increased from 11 to 15. The newly elected island council became the [[Estates of Sint Maarten]] on 10 October.<ref>RNW.nl - [http://www.rnw.nl/caribiana/article/eilandsraad-sint-maarten-unaniem-achter-staatsregeling Eilandsraad Sint Maarten unaniem achter staatsregeling]</ref> Sint Maarten is largely autonomous in internal affairs, with the Netherlands responsible for foreign diplomacy and defence.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Environmental Laws===\nThe beach policy (as of 1994)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sintmaartengov.org/government/VROMI/Pages/Ministry-Policies-and-Reports.aspx|title=Ministry Policies and Reports|website=www.sintmaartengov.org|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> views the beach from the perspective of being an ecosystem service for recreational activities. This is because the economy on Sint Maarten is tourism driven and many tourists come to the island to enjoy the 37 beaches on the island. The policy has three main points:  the beach must be usable for everyone, developments that negatively affect recreative use will be prevented, and beaches should be protected against human influences that could impair their recreation function. The policy's main purpose is to protect the recreational value of the beach. The laws fail to consider the protection and ecological value of this habitat in regard to protecting nesting [[Sea turtle|seas turtles,]] preserving the beach line, or preserving the plants that live in and along the beach line. \n\nThe hillside policy, as of 1998<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sintmaartengov.org/government/VROMI/Pages/Ministry-Policies-and-Reports.aspx|title=Ministry Policies and Reports|website=www.sintmaartengov.org|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref>, is mainly concerned with residential development. On the hillside, only residential development is permitted, certain hillsides with important \u201cvisual impact\u201d are protected and conserved for their general landscape. A natural park is projected for the following hills: Cole Bay Hill, Sentry Hill, St. Peters Hill, Concordia Hill, Marigot Hill, Waymouth Hill and Williams Hill. The policy stated that the main objective was to conserve and maintain the green hillside and restore any natural habitats if needed. However, as of 2020, the establishment of these natural parks has to happen.\n\n\n\n===Corruption===\nIn 1978, the government of the [[Netherlands Antilles]] installed a Research Committee on the [[Windward Islands]] ({{lang-nl|Commissie van Onderzoek Bovenwindse Eilanden}}) to investigate claims of corruption in the island government. Even though the report issued by this commission was damaging for the island's government, measures were not put into place to curb corruption, arguably because the government of the Netherlands Antilles depended on the support of Wathey's Democratic Party in the [[Estates of the Netherlands Antilles]]. In August 1990, the public prosecutor of the Netherlands Antilles started an investigation into the alleged ties between the island government of Sint Maarten and the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and in 1991 the [[Court of Audit]] of the Netherlands Antilles issued a report which concluded that the island government of Sint Maarten was ailing.<ref>Oostindie and Klinkers 2001:188-189</ref>\n\nIn the government and parliament of the Netherlands, the call for measures became louder and louder. With Dutch pressure, the government of the Netherlands Antilles installed the [[Miguel Pourier|Pourier]] Commission tasked with investigating the state of affairs of the island government of Sint Maarten in December 1991. Its report concluded that the island was in a severe financial crisis, that rules of democratic decision-making were continuously broken, and that the island government constituted an [[oligarchy]]. In short, the island government failed completely according to the report. After long negotiations, the [[Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom government]] enacted a General Measure of Kingdom Administration ({{lang-nl|Algemene Maatregel van Rijksbestuur}}) in early 1993, placing Sint Maarten under direct supervision of the Kingdom. Although originally meant for one year, the Order-in-Council for the Kingdom was eventually extended until 1 March 1996.<ref>Oostindie and Klinkers 2001:189-191</ref>\n\nThough much has changed since, allegations of criminal activities continue to plague Sint Maarten. In 2004, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles asked the Scientific Research and Documentation Centre ({{lang-nl|Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek- en Documentatiecentrum}} (WODC)) of the Dutch Ministry of Justice to conduct research into organized crime in Sint Maarten. The report concluded that [[money laundering]] and cocaine trade are widespread on Sint Maarten. It also alleged that money from the island was used to finance [[Hamas]], its associate [[Holy Land Foundation]], and the [[Taliban]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref>NRC.nl - [http://www.nrc.nl/nieuwsthema/antillen/article1847339.ece/Sint_Maarten_vrijhaven_voor_criminele_gelden Sint Maarten vrijhaven voor criminele gelden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224151909/http://www.nrc.nl/nieuwsthema/antillen/article1847339.ece/Sint_Maarten_vrijhaven_voor_criminele_gelden |date=2008-12-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, former Commissioner Louie Laveist was convicted, and sentenced to an 18-month prison sentence, by the Sint Maarten Court-of-First-Instance, on account of forgery, fraud, and bribery.<ref>NRC.nl - [http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article2227000.ece/Gedeputeerde_Sint_Maarten_veroordeeld_voor_corruptie Gedeputeerde Sint Maarten veroordeeld voor corruptie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430145752/http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article2227000.ece/Gedeputeerde_Sint_Maarten_veroordeeld_voor_corruptie |date=2009-04-30 }}</ref> He was later acquitted of forgery and of fraud by the [[Common Court of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba]], but not of bribery.<ref>The Daily Herald - [http://www.thedailyherald.com/islands/1-news/424-louie-laveist-partially-vindicated-on-appeal.html Louie Laveist partially vindicated on appeal]</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Plant Species===\nSint Maarten is home to many distinctive plants such as [[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis|hibiscus]], yellow sage (seen on the flag), [[Delonix regia|flamboyant trees]], mahogany, and cacti.

Meanwhile, the Amerindian population began to decline precipitously, dying from introduced diseases to which they had no immunity.\n\nThe Dutch built a fort ([[Fort Amsterdam (Sint Maarten)|Fort Amsterdam]]) on the island in 1631; Jan Claeszen Van Campen became its first [[List of Sint Maarten governors|governor]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]] began mining [[salt]] on the island. Tensions between the Netherlands and Spain were already high due to the ongoing [[Eighty Years' War]], and in 1633 the Spanish [[Capture of Saint Martin (1633)|captured St Martin]] and drove off the Dutch colonists. At Point Blanche, they built what is now Old Spanish Fort to secure the territory.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Dutch under [[Peter Stuyvesant]] attempted to [[Attack on Saint Martin|wrest back control]] in 1644, but were repulsed.<ref>''Caribbean: The Lesser Antilles'' Karl Luntta</ref> However, in 1648 the Eighty Years' War ended and the Spanish, no longer seeing any strategic or economic value in the island, simply abandoned it.\n\nWith Saint Martin free again, both the Dutch and the French jumped at the chance to re-establish their settlements.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Dutch colonists came from [[Sint Eustatius|St. Eustatius]], while the French came from [[St. Kitts]]. After some initial conflict, both sides realized that neither would yield easily. Preferring to avoid an all-out war, they signed the [[Treaty of Concordia]] in 1648, which divided the island in two.<ref>{{citation|page=13 |title=Concordia Treaty, 23rd March 1648|journal=Heritage |volume=6 |date=15 March 2010 |last=Henocq |first=Christophe |url=https://issuu.com/xtofsxm/docs/heritage_6/15 |accessdate=2018-09-17}}</ref> During the treaty's negotiation, the French had a fleet of [[navy|naval]] ships off shore, which they used as a threat to bargain more land for themselves.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In spite of the treaty, relations between the two sides were not always cordial. Between 1648 and 1816, conflicts changed the border sixteen times. The entire island came under effective French control from 1795 when Netherlands became a [[puppet state]] under the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] until 1815.

Subjected to cruel treatment, slaves staged rebellions, and their overwhelming numbers made it impossible to ignore their concerns. In 1848, the French [[Abolitionism#Second abolition (1848) and subsequent events|abolished slavery]] in their colonies including the French side of St. Martin. Slaves on the Dutch side of the island protested and threatened to flee to the French side to seek asylum. The local Dutch authorities then freed the colonies' slaves. While this decree was respected locally, it was not until 1863 when the Dutch abolished slavery in all of their island colonies that the slaves became legally free.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lampe|first1=Armando|title=Mission Or Submission?: Moravian and Catholic Missionaries in the Dutch Caribbean During the 19th Century|date=2001|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=9783525559635|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eElMNrbP00C&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Dr. Claude Wathey St. Maarten.JPG|thumb|Statue of Claude Wathey in [[Philipsburg, Sint Maarten|Philipsburg]]]]\nAfter the abolition of slavery, plantation culture declined and the island's economy suffered.

Even though the report issued by this commission was damaging for the island's government, measures were not put into place to curb corruption, arguably because the government of the Netherlands Antilles depended on the support of Wathey's Democratic Party in the [[Estates of the Netherlands Antilles]]. In August 1990, the public prosecutor of the Netherlands Antilles started an investigation into the alleged ties between the island government of Sint Maarten and the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and in 1991 the [[Court of Audit]] of the Netherlands Antilles issued a report which concluded that the island government of Sint Maarten was ailing.<ref>Oostindie and Klinkers 2001:188-189</ref>\n\nIn the government and parliament of the Netherlands, the call for measures became louder and louder. With Dutch pressure, the government of the Netherlands Antilles installed the [[Miguel Pourier|Pourier]] Commission tasked with investigating the state of affairs of the island government of Sint Maarten in December 1991. Its report concluded that the island was in a severe financial crisis, that rules of democratic decision-making were continuously broken, and that the island government constituted an [[oligarchy]]. In short, the island government failed completely according to the report. After long negotiations, the [[Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom government]] enacted a General Measure of Kingdom Administration ({{lang-nl|Algemene Maatregel van Rijksbestuur}}) in early 1993, placing Sint Maarten under direct supervision of the Kingdom. Although originally meant for one year, the Order-in-Council for the Kingdom was eventually extended until 1 March 1996.<ref>Oostindie and Klinkers 2001:189-191</ref>\n\nThough much has changed since, allegations of criminal activities continue to plague Sint Maarten. In 2004, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles asked the Scientific Research and Documentation Centre ({{lang-nl|Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek- en Documentatiecentrum}} (WODC)) of the Dutch Ministry of Justice to conduct research into organized crime in Sint Maarten. The report concluded that [[money laundering]] and cocaine trade are widespread on Sint Maarten.
