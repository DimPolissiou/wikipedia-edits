SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, and influenced by other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, and influenced by other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.
