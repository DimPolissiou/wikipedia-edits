It was the first album to feature bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]], who replaced original bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]]. An album tentatively titled ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'' was originally intended to be the band's sixth full-length release following ''[[Saturday Night Wrist]]'' (2006), but was not released due to Cheng entering a coma after a serious car accident that occurred in November 2008, eventually resulting in his death in 2013.

It was the first album to feature bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]], who replaced original bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]]. An album tentatively titled ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'' was originally intended to be the band's sixth full-length release following ''[[Saturday Night Wrist]]'' (2006), but was not released due to Cheng entering a coma after a serious car accident that occurred in November 2008, eventually resulting in his death in 2013. The band continued on with Vega as his replacement, and the release of ''Eros'' was put on hold in favor of ''Diamond Eyes'' in June 2009.\n\n''Diamond Eyes'' was a critical and commercial success, peaking within the top twenty of the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] and several other international charts; it was the band's highest charting album on the ''Billboard'' 200 since their [[Deftones (album)|2003 eponymous fourth album]]. Four [[single (music)|single]]s were released from ''Diamond Eyes'': [[Diamond Eyes (song)|the title track]], \"[[Rocket Skates]]\", \"Sextape\", and \"[[You've Seen the Butcher]]\".\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Topic=this topic|Chi Cheng (musician)#Automobile crash and coma|Eros (Deftones album)}}\nDeftones started writing material for the successor to 2006's ''Saturday Night Wrist'' in early 2007. The band was dissatisfied with the lengthy writing and recording process of ''Saturday Night Wrist'', and wanted to release a quick follow-up record in the same manner as earlier albums such as 1995's ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' and 1997's ''[[Around the Fur]]'', which were recorded without the digital audio program [[Pro Tools]]. Instead, those albums were recorded as just a band \"in the room with just our instruments, no other distractions\", according to frontman [[Chino Moreno]].<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Graff| first = Gary| title = Deftones Get Busy On New CD, Moreno Revives Team Sleep| magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date = May 23, 2007| url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051965/deftones-get-busy-on-new-cd-moreno-revives-team-sleep| accessdate = February 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe band recorded and completed their [[Terry Date]]-produced album, tentatively titled ''Eros'', in 2008, and it was expected to be released in early 2009.<ref>{{cite news| title = Deftones: Performance Footage Of New Song Posted Online| work = [[Blabbermouth]]| date = September 20, 2008| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=105215| accessdate = February 5, 2010| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081221165809/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=105215| archivedate = December 21, 2008}}</ref> However, bassist Chi Cheng was seriously injured in an automobile accident in November 2008, leaving him in a coma and putting the release of ''Eros'' on hold.

I do very little singing about myself on this record. I love songs where I can totally take myself out of being human.

abbreviated and referred to as the '''''PDS''''', is a pop culture and news series created by American [[YouTube]] personality, [[Philip DeFranco]], and his main claim to fame. The show has gone through several schedule changes through its lifetime, but as of 2019, airs weekly, Monday through Thursday. The first video with ''The Philip DeFranco Show'' included in its intro was uploaded on June 21, 2007. As DeFranco became increasingly popular, he signed with [[Revision3]], which would eventually acquire all of DeFranco's assets, including the ''PDS''. ''The Philip DeFranco Show'' has been sponsored by [[Netflix]], [[Ting (cell phone company)|Ting]], and [[State Farm]]. The show has been nominated for and has won several awards that focus on internet culture and web series. As of 2017 Philip DeFranco purchased his assets back from [[Group Nine Media|Group Nine]] (the company that replaced [[Discovery Digital Networks]]) and the Philip DeFranco show is now a part of the Philip DeFranco Network and produced by Rogue Rocket, DeFranco's production company.\n\n==Format==\nThe show is recorded by DeFranco in his production office in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]].<ref name=BTSLATimes/> The ''PDS'' is then edited by James Girardier so that the episode is presented in a fast paced vlog format, complemented with use of frequent jump cuts throughout.<ref name=BTSLATimes/><ref name=LATimes/><ref>{{cite news|last=Jaworski|first=Michelle|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/philip-defranco-shark-week-interview/|title=YouTube's Philip DeFranco braves dangerous new waters for Shark Week|work=The Daily Dot|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref> The topics discussed in the show vary, but usually cover pop culture and news.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Humphrey|first=Michael|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2012/07/27/youtube-primetime-philip-defrancos-people-first-plan-has-sourcefed-booming/|title=YouTube PrimeTime: Philip DeFranco's 'People First' Plan Has SourceFed Booming|magazine=Forbes|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref> Episodes usually have a 10-minute duration in which Defranco lists both arguments of a story and then states his opinion.<ref name=LATimes/> During the show's early existence, in 2007, DeFranco stated that he usually searches websites such as [[Technorati]] to find topics to discuss.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ratner|first=Andrew|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-09-23/news/0709220310_1_youtube-video-bloggers|title=For 1 college video blogger, it's a really strange trip|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 23, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> Episodes of the series include recurring segments, such as the \"Douchebag of the Day\" segment and \"Today in Awesome.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Rayne|url=http://www.mindcryme.com/2009/08/21/sxephil-a-little-news-a-little-sarcasm-and-your-douchebag-of-the-day/|title=sxePhil: A Little News, A Little Sarcasm, and Your Douchebag of the Day|publisher=Mind Cryme|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome of the older episodes have been noted to include racy thumbnails, such as ''Big Boobs and You''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sarno|first=David|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/14/entertainment/ca-webscout14|title=The bait is sexy; be prepared for a switch|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 14, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> As of June 2013, the video now holds a thumbnail of DeFranco speaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=big+boobs+and+you&oq=big+boobs+and+you&gs_l=youtube.3...1873918.1876215.0.1876296.17.17.0.0.0.0.203.1898.5j10j1.16.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.8xWrx1Hzeeo|title=''big boobs and you'' search query|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The video was chosen as one of DeFranco's top five YouTube moments by ''New Media Rockstars''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Klima|first=Jeff|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/01/phil-defranco-to-retire-the-top-5-phil-defranco-moments-on-youtube/|title=PHIL DEFRANCO TO RETIRE?

Additional missions include assistance in safeguarding internal security, conducting [[emergency management|disaster relief]] operations and participating in international [[peacekeeping]] operations. It celebrates the anniversary of the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] (1824) on December 9.\n\n==History==\nMilitary traditions in Peruvian territory go back to [[prehispanic]] times, ranging from small armed bands to the large armies assembled by the [[Inca Empire]]. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]], small garrisons were kept at strategic locations but no standing army existed until the [[Bourbon reforms]] of the 18th century. The main purpose of this force was the defense of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroyalty]] from [[pirate]]s and [[Privateer|corsairs]] as well as internal [[rebellion]]s.\n\n===Independence===\nThe ''Ej\u00e9rcito del Per\u00fa'' was officially established on August 18, 1821 when the government of general [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] established the ''Legi\u00f3n Peruana de la Guardia'' (Peruvian Guard Legion), although some militia units had been formed before. Peruvian troops were key participants in the final campaign against Spanish rule in South America, under the leadership of general [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], which ended victoriously in the battles of [[Battle of Jun\u00edn|Jun\u00edn]] and [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] in 1824.\n\n===19th century===\n[[Image:Batalla de Arica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Arica]], July 7, 1880.<br />Painting by [[Juan Lepiani]]]]\nAfter the [[Peruvian War of Independence|War of Independence]] the strong position of the Army and the lack of solid political institutions meant that every [[List of Presidents of Peru|Peruvian president]] until 1872 held some military rank. The ''Ej\u00e9rcito del Per\u00fa'' also had a major role in the definition of national borders by participating in several wars against neighbor countries. This included a conflict against Gran Colombia (1828-1829) where naval victories were obtained and the blockade of [[Guayaquil]] but had setbacks in Tarqui, after that an armistice is signed where it is indicated that it remains in statu quo, the Great Colombia dissolves months later product of the war with Peru, the wars of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation (1836-1839), two military invasions to Bolivia and the subsequent expulsion of Bolivian troops from Peruvian soil (1828 and 1841) and a successful occupation of [[Ecuador]] (1858-1860). Starting in 1842, increased state revenues from [[guano]]. Exports allowed the expansion and modernization of the Army, as well as the consolidation of its political power. These improvements were an important factor in the defeat of a Spanish naval expedition at the [[Battle of Callao]] (1866). However, continuous overspending and a growing public debt led to a chronic fiscal crisis in the 1870s which severely affected defense budgets. The consequent lack of military preparedness combined with bad leadership were major causes of Peru's defeat against [[Chile]] in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883). The reconstruction of the Army started slowly after the war due to a general lack of funds. A major turning point in this process was the arrival in 1896 of a French Military Mission contracted by president [[Nicol\u00e1s de Pi\u00e9rola]]. By 1900 the peacetime strength of the army was evaluated at six infantry battalions (nearly 2,000 soldiers), two regiments and four squadrons and cavalry (between six and seven hundred soldiers), and one artillery regiment (just over 500 soldiers) for a total of 3,075 personnel.<ref>Keltie, J.S., ed. ''The Stateman's Year Book: Statistical and Historical Annual of the States of the World for the Year 1900.'' New York: MacMillan, 1900. p 887. (Retrieved via Google Books 3/4/11.)</ref> A military school was reportedly operating in the [[Chorrillos District]] of Lima and French officers were continuing to assist in the army's reorganization.{{sfn|Keltie|1900|p=887}}\n\n===20th century===\n<!--  Commented out: [[Image:1941 Peru victory.JPG|right|thumb|Monument commemorating the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian war|war of 1941]].]] -->\nDuring the early years of the 20th century the Peruvian Army underwent a series of reforms under the guidance of the French Military Mission which operated in the periods 1896\u20131914, 1919\u20131924 and 1932\u20131939. Changes included the streamlining of the [[General Staff]], the establishment of the ''Escuela Superior de Guerra'' ([[Military academy|War College]]) in 1904, the creation of four military regions (North, Center, South and Orient) in 1905 and a general professionalization of the military career. Improvements such as these were fundamental for the good performance of the Army in the border skirmishes with [[Colombia]] (Colombian troops are expelled from the territory of La Pedrera in 1911 and the Peruvian Colombian war in 1933) and a victorious [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War|war against Ecuador (1941)]].\n\nEven though the Peruvian Army was not involved in [[World War II]], this conflict had a significant effect in its development, mainly through the replacement of French military influence by that of the [[United States]]. A US military mission started operations in 1945 followed by an influx of surplus American military equipment delivered as [[military aid]] or sold at a very low cost.\n\nWashington also established itself as the leader of continental defense through the creation of the [[Inter-American Defense Board]] in 1942 and the signing of the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] in 1947. A parallel development was the founding in 1950 of the ''[[Centro de Altos Estudios Militares]]'' (CAEM, Center of High Military Studies) for the formation of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] in the major problems of the nation beyond those related to its military defense.\n\nThe Peruvian Army was the main protagonist of the ''Gobierno Revolucionario de las Fuerzas Armadas'' (Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces), an institutionalized [[Militarism|military government]] that ruled the country between 1968 and 1980. During this period, defense expenditures underwent exponential growth allowing a rapid expansion of the [[Armed Forces]] and an unprecedented level of weapon acquisitions. In the early 1970s, US influence over the Army was replaced by a massive influx of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] training and equipment, including [[T-55]] tanks, the [[BM-21 Grad]], AK series rifles and the BTR series APCs plus a new Soviet-styled national military strategy of regaining the lost southern provinces which were now part of Chile. Political power returned to the civilians in the 1980s, but the rise of the [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[insurgency|insurgent group]] ''Sendero Luminoso'' ([[Shining Path]]) prompted the deployment of several Army units in a [[counter-insurgency]] role. [[Human rights]] violations associated with this intervention and a sharp decrease in the defense budget due to a general economic crisis caused serious problems for the Army [[morale]] and readiness as well as a strain on [[civil-military relations]].\n\nIn 1981 during the government of [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry|Bela\u00fande Terry]], the [[Paquisha War|Paquisha war]] broke out where 3 infiltrated bases from Ecuador were detected in Peruvian territory on the source of the Comaina River, ending with the eviction and bombardment of Ecuadorian bases.\n\nThe presidency of [[Alberto Fujimori]] (1990\u20132000) saw the Army regain protagonism in the public scene, but its increased political power led to some cases of [[political corruption|corruption]]. The [[internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] ceased for the most part after the capture in 1992 of [[Abimael Guzm\u00e1n]], leader of the terrorist group [[Shining Path]], but a brief [[Cenepa War|border war with Ecuador]] broke out in 1995. During this period, women were incorporated into the Army first as [[conscription|conscripts]] in 1993 and then as [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] in 1997. Army commandos had an important participation in operation [[Chav\u00edn de Huantar (military)|''Chav\u00edn de Huantar'']] which put an end to the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]]. In 1999, one year after the signing of a peace treaty with Ecuador [[conscription]] was abolished and replaced by a voluntary [[military service]] for both genders.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Peruvian Infantry Cruz de Hueso 2008.JPG|thumb|Peruvian Infantry disembarking from Infantry Fighting Vehicles in the Cruz de Hueso Exercise, 2007]]\nThe downfall of the [[Alberto Fujimori]] regime left the Peruvian Army in a difficult state, with some of its senior officers compromised in scandals of [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[human rights]] violations. Several reforms were undertaken during the presidencies of [[Valent\u00edn Paniagua]] (2000\u20132001) and [[Alejandro Toledo]] (2001\u20132006), among them the prosecution of criminal cases related to the military, the reorganization of the military rank system and an increased civilian supervision through a revamped [[Ministry of Defense (Peru)|Ministry of Defense]]. The outcome of this and other initiatives is a major factor of order, major preparation, new equipment and development of the ''Ej\u00e9rcito del Per\u00fa''. G-3 America (G3 and Associates International Corporation) facilitated the incorporation of new technology to eliminate or reduce terrorism. They have been working tenaciously in getting the right equipment for the Armed Forces while working with the US State Department and US companies to accomplish it.\n\nThe Ollanta Humalla administration has also had the Army engaged in training members of Peru's indigenous peoples for the duties of national defense as well as, through the BECA 18 program, helping to reduce poverty while teaching the youth of the values of national service. His term also saw the revival of the Army's modernization process with the arrival of the Type 81 MRL, pushing its BM-21s into retirement.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Organization==\n[[Image:CaballeriaCadetesEscuelaMilitar.jpg|right|thumb|Cavalry Regiment of the [[Chorrillos Military School]].]]\nThe current [[Commanding General]] of the Peruvian Army is General [[Ricardo Moncada Oblitas]].

Additional missions include assistance in safeguarding internal security, conducting [[emergency management|disaster relief]] operations and participating in international [[peacekeeping]] operations. It celebrates the anniversary of the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] (1824) on December 9.\n\n==History==\nMilitary traditions in Peruvian territory go back to [[prehispanic]] times, ranging from small armed bands to the large armies assembled by the [[Inca Empire]]. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]], small garrisons were kept at strategic locations but no standing army existed until the [[Bourbon reforms]] of the 18th century. The main purpose of this force was the defense of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroyalty]] from [[pirate]]s and [[Privateer|corsairs]] as well as internal [[rebellion]]s.\n\n===Independence===\nThe ''Ej\u00e9rcito del Per\u00fa'' was officially established on August 18, 1821 when the government of general [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] established the ''Legi\u00f3n Peruana de la Guardia'' (Peruvian Guard Legion), although some militia units had been formed before. Peruvian troops were key participants in the final campaign against Spanish rule in South America, under the leadership of general [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], which ended victoriously in the battles of [[Battle of Jun\u00edn|Jun\u00edn]] and [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] in 1824.\n\n===19th century===\n[[Image:Batalla de Arica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Arica]], July 7, 1880.<br />Painting by [[Juan Lepiani]]]]\nAfter the [[Peruvian War of Independence|War of Independence]] the strong position of the Army and the lack of solid political institutions meant that every [[List of Presidents of Peru|Peruvian president]] until 1872 held some military rank. The ''Ej\u00e9rcito del Per\u00fa'' also had a major role in the definition of national borders by participating in several wars against neighbor countries. This included a conflict against Gran Colombia (1828-1829) where naval victories were obtained and the blockade of [[Guayaquil]] but had setbacks in Tarqui, after that an armistice is signed where it is indicated that it remains in statu quo, the Great Colombia dissolves months later product of the war with Peru, the wars of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation (1836-1839), two military invasions to Bolivia and the subsequent expulsion of Bolivian troops from Peruvian soil (1828 and 1841) and a successful occupation of [[Ecuador]] (1858-1860). Starting in 1842, increased state revenues from [[guano]]. Exports allowed the expansion and modernization of the Army, as well as the consolidation of its political power. These improvements were an important factor in the defeat of a Spanish naval expedition at the [[Battle of Callao]] (1866). However, continuous overspending and a growing public debt led to a chronic fiscal crisis in the 1870s which severely affected defense budgets. The consequent lack of military preparedness combined with bad leadership were major causes of Peru's defeat against [[Chile]] in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883). The reconstruction of the Army started slowly after the war due to a general lack of funds. A major turning point in this process was the arrival in 1896 of a French Military Mission contracted by president [[Nicol\u00e1s de Pi\u00e9rola]]. By 1900 the peacetime strength of the army was evaluated at six infantry battalions (nearly 2,000 soldiers), two regiments and four squadrons and cavalry (between six and seven hundred soldiers), and one artillery regiment (just over 500 soldiers) for a total of 3,075 personnel.<ref>Keltie, J.S., ed.

(Retrieved via Google Books 3/4/11.)</ref> A military school was reportedly operating in the [[Chorrillos District]] of Lima and French officers were continuing to assist in the army's reorganization.{{sfn|Keltie|1900|p=887}}\n\n===20th century===\n<!--  Commented out: [[Image:1941 Peru victory.JPG|right|thumb|Monument commemorating the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian war|war of 1941]].]] -->\nDuring the early years of the 20th century the Peruvian Army underwent a series of reforms under the guidance of the French Military Mission which operated in the periods 1896\u20131914, 1919\u20131924 and 1932\u20131939. Changes included the streamlining of the [[General Staff]], the establishment of the ''Escuela Superior de Guerra'' ([[Military academy|War College]]) in 1904, the creation of four military regions (North, Center, South and Orient) in 1905 and a general professionalization of the military career. Improvements such as these were fundamental for the good performance of the Army in the border skirmishes with [[Colombia]] (Colombian troops are expelled from the territory of La Pedrera in 1911 and the Peruvian Colombian war in 1933) and a victorious [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War|war against Ecuador (1941)]].\n\nEven though the Peruvian Army was not involved in [[World War II]], this conflict had a significant effect in its development, mainly through the replacement of French military influence by that of the [[United States]]. A US military mission started operations in 1945 followed by an influx of surplus American military equipment delivered as [[military aid]] or sold at a very low cost.\n\nWashington also established itself as the leader of continental defense through the creation of the [[Inter-American Defense Board]] in 1942 and the signing of the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] in 1947. A parallel development was the founding in 1950 of the ''[[Centro de Altos Estudios Militares]]'' (CAEM, Center of High Military Studies) for the formation of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] in the major problems of the nation beyond those related to its military defense.\n\nThe Peruvian Army was the main protagonist of the ''Gobierno Revolucionario de las Fuerzas Armadas'' (Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces), an institutionalized [[Militarism|military government]] that ruled the country between 1968 and 1980. During this period, defense expenditures underwent exponential growth allowing a rapid expansion of the [[Armed Forces]] and an unprecedented level of weapon acquisitions. In the early 1970s, US influence over the Army was replaced by a massive influx of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] training and equipment, including [[T-55]] tanks, the [[BM-21 Grad]], AK series rifles and the BTR series APCs plus a new Soviet-styled national military strategy of regaining the lost southern provinces which were now part of Chile. Political power returned to the civilians in the 1980s, but the rise of the [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[insurgency|insurgent group]] ''Sendero Luminoso'' ([[Shining Path]]) prompted the deployment of several Army units in a [[counter-insurgency]] role. [[Human rights]] violations associated with this intervention and a sharp decrease in the defense budget due to a general economic crisis caused serious problems for the Army [[morale]] and readiness as well as a strain on [[civil-military relations]].\n\nIn 1981 during the government of [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry|Bela\u00fande Terry]], the [[Paquisha War|Paquisha war]] broke out where 3 infiltrated bases from Ecuador were detected in Peruvian territory on the source of the Comaina River, ending with the eviction and bombardment of Ecuadorian bases.\n\nThe presidency of [[Alberto Fujimori]] (1990\u20132000) saw the Army regain protagonism in the public scene, but its increased political power led to some cases of [[political corruption|corruption]]. The [[internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] ceased for the most part after the capture in 1992 of [[Abimael Guzm\u00e1n]], leader of the terrorist group [[Shining Path]], but a brief [[Cenepa War|border war with Ecuador]] broke out in 1995. During this period, women were incorporated into the Army first as [[conscription|conscripts]] in 1993 and then as [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] in 1997. Army commandos had an important participation in operation [[Chav\u00edn de Huantar (military)|''Chav\u00edn de Huantar'']] which put an end to the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]]. In 1999, one year after the signing of a peace treaty with Ecuador [[conscription]] was abolished and replaced by a voluntary [[military service]] for both genders.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Peruvian Infantry Cruz de Hueso 2008.JPG|thumb|Peruvian Infantry disembarking from Infantry Fighting Vehicles in the Cruz de Hueso Exercise, 2007]]\nThe downfall of the [[Alberto Fujimori]] regime left the Peruvian Army in a difficult state, with some of its senior officers compromised in scandals of [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[human rights]] violations. Several reforms were undertaken during the presidencies of [[Valent\u00edn Paniagua]] (2000\u20132001) and [[Alejandro Toledo]] (2001\u20132006), among them the prosecution of criminal cases related to the military, the reorganization of the military rank system and an increased civilian supervision through a revamped [[Ministry of Defense (Peru)|Ministry of Defense]]. The outcome of this and other initiatives is a major factor of order, major preparation, new equipment and development of the ''Ej\u00e9rcito del Per\u00fa''. G-3 America (G3 and Associates International Corporation) facilitated the incorporation of new technology to eliminate or reduce terrorism. They have been working tenaciously in getting the right equipment for the Armed Forces while working with the US State Department and US companies to accomplish it.\n\nThe Ollanta Humalla administration has also had the Army engaged in training members of Peru's indigenous peoples for the duties of national defense as well as, through the BECA 18 program, helping to reduce poverty while teaching the youth of the values of national service. His term also saw the revival of the Army's modernization process with the arrival of the Type 81 MRL, pushing its BM-21s into retirement.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Organization==\n[[Image:CaballeriaCadetesEscuelaMilitar.jpg|right|thumb|Cavalry Regiment of the [[Chorrillos Military School]].]]\nThe current [[Commanding General]] of the Peruvian Army is General [[Ricardo Moncada Oblitas]].
