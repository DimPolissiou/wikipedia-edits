The video features Onfroy and a large group of people at a get-together taking place in the woods after dark, lit by the light of a full moon. Onfroy is seen sitting by himself listening to headphones and observing the party, as well as walking through the crowd of people who are all dressed in black attire. He laughs as he watches people dance, and also exchanges stares with a mysterious curly-haired girl who is shown several times during the video (based on her appearance she has been theorized to represent Geneva Ayala, Onfroy's ex-girlfriend). Having been released after the rapper's passing, the video ends with the phrases \"ENERGY NEVER DIES\", \"HE IS AMONGST US\" and \"LONG LIVE JAH\" in tribute to Onfroy. A similar phrase, \"LONG LIVE PRINCE X\", was also featured at the end of his \"SAD!\" music video.\n\n==Credits and personnel==\n* [[XXXTentacion]] \u2013 vocals, songwriting, composition\n* John Cunningham \u2013 songwriting, composition, production, mixing\n* Robert Soukiasyan \u2013 mixing, recording, studio personnel\n* Dave Kutch \u2013 mastering, studio personnel\n* Kevin Peterson \u2013 mastering assistant\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The video features Onfroy and a large group of people at a get-together taking place in the woods after dark, lit by the light of a full moon. Onfroy is seen sitting by himself listening to headphones and observing the party, as well as walking through the crowd of people who are all dressed in black attire. He laughs as he watches people dance, and also exchanges stares with a mysterious curly-haired girl who is shown several times during the video (based on her appearance she has been theorized to represent Geneva Ayala, Onfroy's ex-girlfriend). Having been released after the rapper's passing, the video ends with the phrases \"ENERGY NEVER DIES\", \"HE IS AMONGST US\" and \"LONG LIVE JAH\" in tribute to Onfroy. A similar phrase, \"LONG LIVE PRINCE X\", was also featured at the end of his \"SAD!\" music video.\n\n==Credits and personnel==\n* [[XXXTentacion]] \u2013 vocals, songwriting, composition\n* John Cunningham \u2013 songwriting, composition, production, mixing\n* Robert Soukiasyan \u2013 mixing, recording, studio personnel\n* Dave Kutch \u2013 mastering, studio personnel\n* Kevin Peterson \u2013 mastering assistant\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.<ref name=\"OoB\" />\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref name=\"Maine1\" /> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref name=\"Dyer\" />  31 men died in Confederate prisons.<ref name=\"OoB\" />  Total fatalities for the regiment were 370.<ref name=\"Houghton\" /><ref name=\"Maine1\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://www.civilwarhome.com/gettysburgorderofbattle%28union%29.htm Civilwarhome - Gettysburg Union order of battle]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110603055742/http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/gettysburg/gettysburg-history-articles/order-of-battle-aop-gettysburg.html Civil War Trust - Gettysburg Union order of battle]\n* {{cite book|author=Coates, Earl J., and Thomas S.

The genome is composed of a number of chromosomes\u2014complexes of tightly coiled [[DNA]] that contain [[DNA sequence|genetic information]] vital for proper cell function. Because each resultant daughter cell should be [[clone (genetics)|genetically identical]] to the parent cell, the parent cell must make a copy of each chromosome before mitosis. This occurs during the [[S phase]] of interphase.<ref name=Blow2005/> [[DNA replication|Chromosome duplication]] results in two identical ''[[sister chromatids]]'' bound together by [[cohesin]] proteins at the ''[[centromere]]''.\n\nWhen mitosis begins, the chromosomes condense and become visible. In some eukaryotes, for example animals, the [[nuclear envelope]], which segregates the DNA from the cytoplasm, disintegrates into small vesicles. The [[nucleolus]], which makes ribosomes in the cell, also disappears. [[Microtubule]]s project from opposite ends of the cell, attach to the centromeres, and align the chromosomes centrally within the cell. The microtubules then contract to pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart.<ref name=Zhou2002/> Sister chromatids at this point are called ''daughter chromosomes''. As the cell elongates, corresponding daughter chromosomes are pulled toward opposite ends of the cell and condense maximally in late anaphase. A new nuclear envelope forms around the separated daughter chromosomes, which decondense to form interphase nuclei.\n\nDuring mitotic progression, typically after the anaphase onset, the cell may undergo cytokinesis. In [[animal cell]]s, a [[cleavage furrow|cell membrane pinches inward]] between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells. In [[plant cell]]s, a [[cell plate]] forms between the two nuclei. Cytokinesis does not always occur; coenocytic (a type of multinucleate condition) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis.\n\n{{wide image|Mitosis Stages.svg|1100px|Diagram of the mitotic phases}}\n\n===Interphase===\n<!-- that graph and the following paragraph must have full labels not just single letters -->\n{{main|Interphase}}\nThe mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the [[cell cycle]]. It alternates with the much longer ''[[interphase]]'', where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division. Interphase is divided into three phases: [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> (first gap)]], [[S phase|S (synthesis)]], and [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> (second gap)]]. During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the [[S phase]]. Thus, a cell grows (G<sub>1</sub>), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G<sub>2</sub>), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle.<ref name=Blow2005/> All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by [[cyclins]], [[cyclin-dependent kinases]], and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow one another in strict order and there are \"[[Cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]\" that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to another<ref>{{cite web |last1=Biology Online |title= Mitosis |url=https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/mitosis |website=Biology Online}}</ref>. Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub> phase]] to stop dividing. This can occur when cells become overcrowded ([[density-dependent inhibition]]) or when they [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to carry out specific functions for the organism, as is the case for [[Cardiac muscle cell|human heart muscle cells]] and [[neurons]]. Some G<sub>0</sub> cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle.\n\nDNA double-strand breaks can be [[DNA repair|repaired]] during interphase by two principal processes.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 28781144 | doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2017.07.011 | volume=803-805 | title=Regulation of repair pathway choice at two-ended DNA double-strand breaks | year=2017 | journal=Mutat Res | pages=51\u201355  | last1 = Shibata | first1 = A}}</ref>  The first process, [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ), can join the two broken ends of DNA in the [[G1 phase|G1]], [[S phase|S]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] phases of interphase.  The second process, [[homologous recombination]]al repair (HRR), is more accurate than NHEJ in repairing double-strand breaks.  HRR is active during the S and G2 phases of interphase when [[DNA replication]] is either partially accomplished or after it is completed, since HRR requires two adjacent [[chromatids|homologs]].\n\n===Mitosis===\n\n====Preprophase (plant cells)====\n{{main|Preprophase}}\nIn plant cells only, prophase is preceded by a pre-prophase stage. In highly [[vacuole|vacuolated]] plant cells, the nucleus has to migrate into the center of the cell before mitosis can begin. This is achieved through the formation of a [[phragmosome]], a transverse sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the cell along the future plane of cell division. In addition to phragmosome formation, preprophase is characterized by the formation of a ring of microtubules and [[actin]] filaments (called [[preprophase band]]) underneath the plasma membrane around the equatorial plane of the future mitotic [[spindle apparatus|spindle]]. This band marks the position where the cell will eventually divide. The cells of higher plants (such as the [[flowering plant]]s) lack [[centrioles]]; instead, microtubules form a spindle on the surface of the nucleus and are then organized into a spindle by the chromosomes themselves, after the nuclear envelope breaks down.<ref name=Lloyd/> The preprophase band disappears during nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation in prometaphase.<ref name = \"Raven_2005\">{{cite book |last1= Raven |first1= P.

At telophase, the polar microtubules continue to lengthen, elongating the cell even more. If the nuclear envelope has broken down, a new nuclear envelope forms using the membrane vesicles of the parent cell's old nuclear envelope. The new envelope forms around each set of separated daughter chromosomes (though the membrane does not enclose the centrosomes) and the nucleolus reappears. Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclear membrane, begin to \"relax\" or decondense. Mitosis is complete. Each daughter nucleus has an identical set of chromosomes. Cell division may or may not occur at this time depending on the organism.\n\n===Cytokinesis===\n[[File:Unk.cilliate.jpg|thumb|right|Cilliate undergoing cytokinesis, with the [[cleavage furrow]] being clearly visible]]\n{{main|Cytokinesis}}\nCytokinesis is not a phase of mitosis but rather a separate process, necessary for completing cell division. In animal cells, a [[cleavage furrow]] (pinch) containing a contractile ring develops where the metaphase plate used to be, pinching off the separated nuclei.<ref name=Glotzer2005/> In both animal and plant cells, cell division is also driven by vesicles derived from the [[Golgi apparatus]], which move along microtubules to the middle of the cell.<ref name=Albertson2005/> In plants, this structure coalesces into a cell plate at the center of the [[phragmoplast]] and develops into a cell wall, separating the two nuclei. The phragmoplast is a microtubule structure typical for higher plants, whereas some green algae use a [[phycoplast]] microtubule array during cytokinesis.<ref name = \"Raven_2005\"/>{{rp|64\u20137, 328\u20139}} Each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its parent cell. The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M-phase.\n\nThere are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei. The most notable occurrence of this is among the [[fungus|fungi]], [[slime mold]]s, and coenocytic algae, but the phenomenon is found in various other organisms. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] embryonic development.<ref name=Lilly2005/>\n\n== Function ==\nMitosis \"[[function (biology)|function]]\" or significance relies on the maintenance of the chromosomal set; each cell formed receives chromosomes that are alike in composition and equal in number to the chromosomes of the parent cell.\n\nMitosis occurs in the following circumstances:\n*Development and growth: The number of cells within an organism increases by mitosis. This is the basis of the development of a multicellular body from a single cell, i.e., [[zygote]] and also the basis of the growth of a [[multicellular]] body.\n*Cell replacement: In some parts of the body, e.g. skin and digestive tract, cells are constantly sloughed off and replaced by new ones. New cells are formed by mitosis and so are exact copies of the cells being replaced. In like manner, [[red blood cells]] have a short lifespan (only about 4 months) and new RBCs are formed by mitosis.\n*Regeneration: Some organisms can regenerate body parts. The production of new cells in such instances is achieved by mitosis. For example, [[starfish]] regenerate lost arms through mitosis.\n*Asexual reproduction: Some organisms produce genetically similar offspring through [[asexual reproduction]]. For example, the [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] reproduces asexually by budding. The cells at the surface of hydra undergo mitosis and form a mass called a bud. Mitosis continues in the cells of the bud and this grows into a new individual. The same division happens during asexual reproduction or [[vegetative propagation]] in plants.\n\n==Variations==\n=== Forms of mitosis ===\nThe mitosis process in the cells of eukaryotic organisms follow a similar pattern, but with variations in three main details. \"Closed\" and \"open\" mitosis can be distinguished on the basis of [[nuclear envelope]] remaining intact or breaking down. An intermediate form with partial degradation of the nuclear envelope is called \"semiopen\" mitosis. With respesct to the symmetry of the [[spindle apparatus]] during metaphase, an approximately axially symmetric (centered) shape is called as \"orthomitosis\", distinguished from the eccentric spindles of \"pleuromitosis\", in which mitotic apparatus has bilateral symmetry. Finally, a third criterion is the location of the [[central spindle]] in case of closed pleuromitosis: \"extranuclear\" (spindle located in the cytoplasm) or \"intranuclear\" (in the nucleus).<ref name= \"Raikov1994\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Mitosis classification closed intranuclear pleuromitoses.svg|closed <br> intranuclear <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification closed extranuclear pleuromitoses.svg|closed <br> extranuclear <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification closed orthomitoses.svg|closed <br> orthomitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification semiopen pleuromitoses.svg|semiopen <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification semiopen orthomitoses.svg|semiopen <br> orthomitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification open orthomitoses.svg|open <br> orthomitosis\n</gallery>\n\nNuclear division takes place only in cells of organisms of the [[eukaryotic]] domain, as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] have no nucleus.

The genome is composed of a number of chromosomes\u2014complexes of tightly coiled [[DNA]] that contain [[DNA sequence|genetic information]] vital for proper cell function. Because each resultant daughter cell should be [[clone (genetics)|genetically identical]] to the parent cell, the parent cell must make a copy of each chromosome before mitosis. This occurs during the [[S phase]] of interphase.<ref name=Blow2005/> [[DNA replication|Chromosome duplication]] results in two identical ''[[sister chromatids]]'' bound together by [[cohesin]] proteins at the ''[[centromere]]''.\n\nWhen mitosis begins, the chromosomes condense and become visible. In some eukaryotes, for example animals, the [[nuclear envelope]], which segregates the DNA from the cytoplasm, disintegrates into small vesicles. The [[nucleolus]], which makes ribosomes in the cell, also disappears. [[Microtubule]]s project from opposite ends of the cell, attach to the centromeres, and align the chromosomes centrally within the cell. The microtubules then contract to pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart.<ref name=Zhou2002/> Sister chromatids at this point are called ''daughter chromosomes''. As the cell elongates, corresponding daughter chromosomes are pulled toward opposite ends of the cell and condense maximally in late anaphase. A new nuclear envelope forms around the separated daughter chromosomes, which decondense to form interphase nuclei.\n\nDuring mitotic progression, typically after the anaphase onset, the cell may undergo cytokinesis. In [[animal cell]]s, a [[cleavage furrow|cell membrane pinches inward]] between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells. In [[plant cell]]s, a [[cell plate]] forms between the two nuclei. Cytokinesis does not always occur; coenocytic (a type of multinucleate condition) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis.\n\n{{wide image|Mitosis Stages.svg|1100px|Diagram of the mitotic phases}}\n\n===Interphase===\n<!-- that graph and the following paragraph must have full labels not just single letters -->\n{{main|Interphase}}\nThe mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the [[cell cycle]]. It alternates with the much longer ''[[interphase]]'', where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division. Interphase is divided into three phases: [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> (first gap)]], [[S phase|S (synthesis)]], and [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> (second gap)]]. During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the [[S phase]]. Thus, a cell grows (G<sub>1</sub>), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G<sub>2</sub>), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle.<ref name=Blow2005/> All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by [[cyclins]], [[cyclin-dependent kinases]], and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow one another in strict order and there are \"[[Cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]\" that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to another<ref>{{cite web |last1=Biology Online |title= Mitosis |url=https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/mitosis |website=Biology Online}}</ref>. Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub> phase]] to stop dividing. This can occur when cells become overcrowded ([[density-dependent inhibition]]) or when they [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to carry out specific functions for the organism, as is the case for [[Cardiac muscle cell|human heart muscle cells]] and [[neurons]]. Some G<sub>0</sub> cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle.\n\nDNA double-strand breaks can be [[DNA repair|repaired]] during interphase by two principal processes.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 28781144 | doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2017.07.011 | volume=803-805 | title=Regulation of repair pathway choice at two-ended DNA double-strand breaks | year=2017 | journal=Mutat Res | pages=51\u201355  | last1 = Shibata | first1 = A}}</ref>  The first process, [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ), can join the two broken ends of DNA in the [[G1 phase|G1]], [[S phase|S]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] phases of interphase.  The second process, [[homologous recombination]]al repair (HRR), is more accurate than NHEJ in repairing double-strand breaks.  HRR is active during the S and G2 phases of interphase when [[DNA replication]] is either partially accomplished or after it is completed, since HRR requires two adjacent [[chromatids|homologs]].\n\n===Mitosis===\n\n====Preprophase (plant cells)====\n{{main|Preprophase}}\nIn plant cells only, prophase is preceded by a pre-prophase stage. In highly [[vacuole|vacuolated]] plant cells, the nucleus has to migrate into the center of the cell before mitosis can begin. This is achieved through the formation of a [[phragmosome]], a transverse sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the cell along the future plane of cell division. In addition to phragmosome formation, preprophase is characterized by the formation of a ring of microtubules and [[actin]] filaments (called [[preprophase band]]) underneath the plasma membrane around the equatorial plane of the future mitotic [[spindle apparatus|spindle]]. This band marks the position where the cell will eventually divide. The cells of higher plants (such as the [[flowering plant]]s) lack [[centrioles]]; instead, microtubules form a spindle on the surface of the nucleus and are then organized into a spindle by the chromosomes themselves, after the nuclear envelope breaks down.<ref name=Lloyd/> The preprophase band disappears during nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation in prometaphase.<ref name = \"Raven_2005\">{{cite book |last1= Raven |first1= P.

In this stage, chromosomes are long, thin and thread-like. Each chromosome has two chromatids. The two chromatids are joined at the centromere.\n\n[[Gene transcription]] ceases during prophase and does not resume until late anaphase to early G<sub>1</sub> phase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prasanth KV, Sacco-Bubulya PA, Prasanth SG, Spector DL | title = Sequential entry of components of the gene expression machinery into daughter nuclei | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1043\u201357 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12631722 | pmc = 151578 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E02-10-0669 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadauke S, Blobel GA | title = Mitotic bookmarking by transcription factors | journal = Epigenetics & Chromatin | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23547918 | pmc = 3621617 | doi = 10.1186/1756-8935-6-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prescott DM, Bender MA | title = Synthesis of RNA and protein during mitosis in mammalian tissue culture cells | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 260\u20138 | date = March 1962 | pmid = 14488623 | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(62)90176-3 }}</ref> The [[nucleolus]] also disappears during early prophase.<ref>{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Mark O.

This motor activity, coupled with polymerisation and depolymerisation of microtubules, provides the pulling force necessary to later separate the chromosome's two chromatids.<ref name=Maiato2004/>\n\n====Metaphase====\n[[File:Mitosis-fluorescent.jpg|thumb|right|A cell in late [[metaphase]]. All chromosomes (blue) but one have arrived at the metaphase plate.]] \n{{main|Metaphase}}\nAfter the microtubules have located and attached to the kinetochores in prometaphase, the two centrosomes begin pulling the chromosomes towards opposite ends of the cell. The resulting tension causes the chromosomes to align along the ''metaphase plate'' or ''equatorial plane'', an imaginary line that is centrally located between the two centrosomes (at approximately the midline of the cell).<ref name=Winey1995/> To ensure equitable distribution of chromosomes at the end of mitosis, the ''[[spindle checkpoint|metaphase checkpoint]]'' guarantees that kinetochores are properly attached to the mitotic spindle and that the chromosomes are aligned along the metaphase plate.<ref name=Chan2003/> If the cell successfully passes through the metaphase checkpoint, it proceeds to anaphase.\n\n====Anaphase====\n{{main|Anaphase}}\nDuring ''anaphase A'', the [[cohesin]]s that bind sister chromatids together are cleaved, forming two identical daughter chromosomes.<ref name=\"FitzHarris\"/> Shortening of the kinetochore microtubules pulls the newly formed daughter chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell.

At telophase, the polar microtubules continue to lengthen, elongating the cell even more. If the nuclear envelope has broken down, a new nuclear envelope forms using the membrane vesicles of the parent cell's old nuclear envelope. The new envelope forms around each set of separated daughter chromosomes (though the membrane does not enclose the centrosomes) and the nucleolus reappears. Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclear membrane, begin to \"relax\" or decondense. Mitosis is complete. Each daughter nucleus has an identical set of chromosomes. Cell division may or may not occur at this time depending on the organism.\n\n===Cytokinesis===\n[[File:Unk.cilliate.jpg|thumb|right|Cilliate undergoing cytokinesis, with the [[cleavage furrow]] being clearly visible]]\n{{main|Cytokinesis}}\nCytokinesis is not a phase of mitosis but rather a separate process, necessary for completing cell division. In animal cells, a [[cleavage furrow]] (pinch) containing a contractile ring develops where the metaphase plate used to be, pinching off the separated nuclei.<ref name=Glotzer2005/> In both animal and plant cells, cell division is also driven by vesicles derived from the [[Golgi apparatus]], which move along microtubules to the middle of the cell.<ref name=Albertson2005/> In plants, this structure coalesces into a cell plate at the center of the [[phragmoplast]] and develops into a cell wall, separating the two nuclei. The phragmoplast is a microtubule structure typical for higher plants, whereas some green algae use a [[phycoplast]] microtubule array during cytokinesis.<ref name = \"Raven_2005\"/>{{rp|64\u20137, 328\u20139}} Each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its parent cell. The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M-phase.\n\nThere are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei. The most notable occurrence of this is among the [[fungus|fungi]], [[slime mold]]s, and coenocytic algae, but the phenomenon is found in various other organisms. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] embryonic development.<ref name=Lilly2005/>\n\n== Function ==\nMitosis \"[[function (biology)|function]]\" or significance relies on the maintenance of the chromosomal set; each cell formed receives chromosomes that are alike in composition and equal in number to the chromosomes of the parent cell.\n\nMitosis occurs in the following circumstances:\n*Development and growth: The number of cells within an organism increases by mitosis. This is the basis of the development of a multicellular body from a single cell, i.e., [[zygote]] and also the basis of the growth of a [[multicellular]] body.\n*Cell replacement: In some parts of the body, e.g. skin and digestive tract, cells are constantly sloughed off and replaced by new ones. New cells are formed by mitosis and so are exact copies of the cells being replaced. In like manner, [[red blood cells]] have a short lifespan (only about 4 months) and new RBCs are formed by mitosis.\n*Regeneration: Some organisms can regenerate body parts. The production of new cells in such instances is achieved by mitosis. For example, [[starfish]] regenerate lost arms through mitosis.\n*Asexual reproduction: Some organisms produce genetically similar offspring through [[asexual reproduction]]. For example, the [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] reproduces asexually by budding. The cells at the surface of hydra undergo mitosis and form a mass called a bud. Mitosis continues in the cells of the bud and this grows into a new individual. The same division happens during asexual reproduction or [[vegetative propagation]] in plants.\n\n==Variations==\n=== Forms of mitosis ===\nThe mitosis process in the cells of eukaryotic organisms follow a similar pattern, but with variations in three main details. \"Closed\" and \"open\" mitosis can be distinguished on the basis of [[nuclear envelope]] remaining intact or breaking down. An intermediate form with partial degradation of the nuclear envelope is called \"semiopen\" mitosis. With respesct to the symmetry of the [[spindle apparatus]] during metaphase, an approximately axially symmetric (centered) shape is called as \"orthomitosis\", distinguished from the eccentric spindles of \"pleuromitosis\", in which mitotic apparatus has bilateral symmetry. Finally, a third criterion is the location of the [[central spindle]] in case of closed pleuromitosis: \"extranuclear\" (spindle located in the cytoplasm) or \"intranuclear\" (in the nucleus).<ref name= \"Raikov1994\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Mitosis classification closed intranuclear pleuromitoses.svg|closed <br> intranuclear <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification closed extranuclear pleuromitoses.svg|closed <br> extranuclear <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification closed orthomitoses.svg|closed <br> orthomitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification semiopen pleuromitoses.svg|semiopen <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification semiopen orthomitoses.svg|semiopen <br> orthomitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification open orthomitoses.svg|open <br> orthomitosis\n</gallery>\n\nNuclear division takes place only in cells of organisms of the [[eukaryotic]] domain, as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] have no nucleus.

He had a brother, Edward Sheffield Cassan and a sister, Flora Kathleen Sheffield Cassan, who became an actress known as [[Flora Sheffield]].\n\nHis father was born in Ireland and his mother in England. They were married in London in 1892. Matthew died when Reginald was nine. In 1913 Reginald Sheffield (billed as Eric Desmond) appeared in ''[[David Copperfield (1913 film)|David Copperfield]]''. In 1914, Alice Sheffield and her children [[immigration|emigrated]] to the United States where they lived in [[Queens]], New York. Reginald acted on the stage and in films. While his sister, Flora, was an actress, brother Edward worked as an accountant in a bank and later became a theatrical agent.\n\nSheffield's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performances credited as Reggie Sheffield include ''[[Evidence]]'' (1914), in which his mother, Alice Sheffield, also appeared, ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1916), ''If'' (1917), ''The Betrothal'' (1918) and ''Helena's Boys'' (1924). His performances credited as Reginald Sheffield include ''Youth'' (1920), ''The Way Things Happen'' (1924), ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'' (1925), playing Sandy Tyrell, ''Slaves All'' (1926), ''Soldiers and Women'' (1929), playing Lieutenant Mason and ''Dear Old England'' (1930).\n\nReginald Sheffield was married in 1927 to Louise Van Loon (b. 21 January 1905 \u2013 d. 14 April 1987), a New York-born, [[Vassar College]] graduate with a liberal arts education. The couple had three children:\n* Mary Alice Sheffield Cassan (born 1928)\n* Jon Matthew Sheffield Cassan (11 April 1931 \u2013 15 October 2010) (aka actor [[Johnny Sheffield]]) \n* William Hart Sheffield Cassan (15 July 1935 \u2013 12 December 2010) (actor Billy Sheffield)<ref>[http://www.memorialsolutions.com/sitemaker/sites/Gerber1/memsol.cgi?user_id=289977 In Memoriam William Hart Sheffield, M.D.]</ref>\n\nAs film production became more and more located in [[Southern California]], Sheffield and his wife travelled back and forth between New York City and Los Angeles. After several years they moved permanently to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].\n\nBeing a trained stage actor, Sheffield easily made the transition from [[silent film]]s to [[Sound film|talkies]]. He was a working actor who became memorable in numerous character and supporting roles and appeared with some of the greatest film stars of the day, including [[Constance Bennett]], [[William Powell]], [[George Arliss]], [[Loretta Young]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Cary Grant]] and [[Joan Fontaine]].\n\nIn 1954, he began starring as Professor Mayberry in the television series ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]''. And after his son, [[Johnny Sheffield]], appeared in his last jungle film in 1955, Reginald created, produced and directed a pilot for a television series, ''Bantu, the Zebra Boy'', but a sponsor was not found and the show was never produced as a weekly series.\n\nSheffield acted in both versions of [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''The Buccaneer'' in ([[The Buccaneer (1938 film)|1938]]) and ([[The Buccaneer (1958 film)|1958]]), the latter being his last screen appearance.\n\n==Death==\nSheffield died 8 December 1957 at his home in [[Pacific Palisades, California]], aged 56.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dickens Actor Dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6213386/the_kansas_city_times/|work=The Kansas City Times|agency=Associated Press|date=9 December 1957|location=Missouri, Kansas City|page=23|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 12 August 2016}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n*''[[David Copperfield (1913 film)|David Copperfield]]'' (1913) (Hepworth Manufacturing Company) ....

He had a brother, Edward Sheffield Cassan and a sister, Flora Kathleen Sheffield Cassan, who became an actress known as Flora Sheffield.\n\nHis father was born in Ireland and his mother in England. They were married in London in 1892. Matthew died when Reginald was nine. In 1913 Reginald Sheffield (billed as Eric Desmond) appeared in ''[[David Copperfield (1913 film)|David Copperfield]]''. In 1914, Alice Sheffield and her children [[immigration|emigrated]] to the United States where they lived in [[Queens]], New York. Reginald acted on the stage and in films. While his sister, Flora, was an actress, brother Edward worked as an accountant in a bank and later became a theatrical agent.\n\nSheffield's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performances credited as Reggie Sheffield include ''[[Evidence]]'' (1914), in which his mother, Alice Sheffield, also appeared, ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1916), ''If'' (1917), ''The Betrothal'' (1918) and ''Helena's Boys'' (1924). His performances credited as Reginald Sheffield include ''Youth'' (1920), ''The Way Things Happen'' (1924), ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'' (1925), playing Sandy Tyrell, ''Slaves All'' (1926), ''Soldiers and Women'' (1929), playing Lieutenant Mason and ''Dear Old England'' (1930).\n\nReginald Sheffield was married in 1927 to Louise Van Loon (b. 21 January 1905 \u2013 d. 14 April 1987), a New York-born, [[Vassar College]] graduate with a liberal arts education. The couple had three children:\n* Mary Alice Sheffield Cassan (born 1928)\n* Jon Matthew Sheffield Cassan (11 April 1931 \u2013 15 October 2010) (aka actor [[Johnny Sheffield]]) \n* William Hart Sheffield Cassan (15 July 1935 \u2013 12 December 2010) (actor Billy Sheffield)<ref>[http://www.memorialsolutions.com/sitemaker/sites/Gerber1/memsol.cgi?user_id=289977 In Memoriam William Hart Sheffield, M.D.]</ref>\n\nAs film production became more and more located in [[Southern California]], Sheffield and his wife travelled back and forth between New York City and Los Angeles. After several years they moved permanently to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].\n\nBeing a trained stage actor, Sheffield easily made the transition from [[silent film]]s to [[Sound film|talkies]]. He was a working actor who became memorable in numerous character and supporting roles and appeared with some of the greatest film stars of the day, including [[Constance Bennett]], [[William Powell]], [[George Arliss]], [[Loretta Young]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Cary Grant]] and [[Joan Fontaine]].\n\nIn 1954, he began starring as Professor Mayberry in the television series ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]''. And after his son, [[Johnny Sheffield]], appeared in his last jungle film in 1955, Reginald created, produced and directed a pilot for a television series, ''Bantu, the Zebra Boy'', but a sponsor was not found and the show was never produced as a weekly series.\n\nSheffield acted in both versions of [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''The Buccaneer'' in ([[The Buccaneer (1938 film)|1938]]) and ([[The Buccaneer (1958 film)|1958]]), the latter being his last screen appearance.\n\n==Death==\nSheffield died 8 December 1957 at his home in [[Pacific Palisades, California]], aged 56.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dickens Actor Dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6213386/the_kansas_city_times/|work=The Kansas City Times|agency=Associated Press|date=9 December 1957|location=Missouri, Kansas City|page=23|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 12 August 2016}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n*''[[David Copperfield (1913 film)|David Copperfield]]'' (1913) (Hepworth Manufacturing Company) ....

Until March 5, 2013 the Weather Prediction Center was known as the '''Hydrometeorological Prediction Center''' (HPC). The Weather Prediction Center serves as a center for quantitative [[precipitation]] forecasting, medium range [[Weather forecasting|forecasting]] (three to eight days), and the interpretation of [[numerical weather prediction]] [[Computer simulation|computer models]].\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center issues storm summaries on storm systems bringing significant rainfall and snowfall to portions of the [[United States]]. They also forecast precipitation amounts for the lower 48 United States for systems expected to impact the country over the next seven days. Advisories are also issued for [[tropical cyclone]]s which have moved inland, weakened to tropical depression strength, and are no longer the responsibility of the [[National Hurricane Center]]. The Weather Prediction Center also acts as the backup office to the [[National Hurricane Center]] in the event of a complete communications failure.\n\nLong range climatological forecasts are produced by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), a branch of the National Weather Service.\u00a0 These include 8-14 day outlooks, monthly outlooks, and seasonal outlooks.\n\n==History==\nFrom the early days of organized weather collection in the United States, a central facility was used to gather and disseminate data.  Originally, this task occupied a single room within the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|United States Army Signal Service]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Reports were collected via [[telegraph]] and general forecasts were made for the country.\n\nWhile WPC's roots lie deep in the past, the organization can be most directly traced to the formation of the Analysis Center by Circular Letter 39-42, signed by Weather Bureau Director Francis W.

This unit co-located with the WBAN analysis center to form the National Weather Analysis Center, which was located in [[Suitland, Maryland]]. When the two units merged, the name changed to the National Meteorological Center (NMC) in January 1958.

These products are sent to the [[National Weather Service]] forecast offices and are available on the Internet for public use.  Heavy snow forecast products, in association with the short-range public forecast products (described below), serve as a coordinating mechanism for the national winter storm watch and warning program.<ref name=\"AboutWPC\">Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.

NESDIS meteorologists prepare estimates of rainfall and current trends based on satellite data, and this information is used by the Day 1 QPF forecaster to help create individual 6-hourly forecasts that cover the next 12 hours.   With access to WSR-88D/Doppler radar data, satellite estimates, and NCEP model forecast data as well as current weather observations and WPC analyses, the forecaster has the latest data for use in preparation of short-range precipitation forecasts. Meteorological reasoning discussions are regularly written and issued with the forecast packages to explain and support the forecast.<ref name=\"AboutWPC\"/>\n\n===Winter weather forecasts===\nThe WPC Winter Weather Desk issues heavy snow and icing forecast products, which support the NWS winter weather watch/warning/outlook program.  These forecasts are for the contiguous United States (CONUS) and issued from September 15 to May 15 each cold season. Graphical forecasts are issued twice daily at 0900 UTC and 2100 UTC (4AM/PM EST respectively), although updates may be warranted by rapidly changing conditions.\n\nThe Winter Weather Desk issues probabilistic heavy snow and icing guidance products for the next three days.  The forecasts represent the probability that freezing rain or combined snow/sleet accumulations will meet specific criteria within a 24-hour period. These products are issued in probabilistic form to better represent the forecast uncertainty associated with a particular event. The Winter Weather Desk produces a heavy snow and icing discussion that provides the meteorological reasoning for the 24-hour probabilistic heavy snow and icing guidance graphics. This text message is used by internal and external clients including NWS field offices, [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]], the [[White House]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], and the general meteorological community (private sector and the media).<ref name=\"AboutWPC\"/>\n\n===Graphical short term forecasts===\nThe short range forecasters are responsible for preparing forecasts for the time period of 6 through 60 hours.

Until March 5, 2013 the Weather Prediction Center was known as the '''Hydrometeorological Prediction Center''' (HPC). The Weather Prediction Center serves as a center for quantitative [[precipitation]] forecasting, medium range [[Weather forecasting|forecasting]] (three to eight days), and the interpretation of [[numerical weather prediction]] [[Computer simulation|computer models]].\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center issues storm summaries on storm systems bringing significant rainfall and snowfall to portions of the [[United States]]. They also forecast precipitation amounts for the lower 48 United States for systems expected to impact the country over the next seven days. Advisories are also issued for [[tropical cyclone]]s which have moved inland, weakened to tropical depression strength, and are no longer the responsibility of the [[National Hurricane Center]]. The Weather Prediction Center also acts as the backup office to the [[National Hurricane Center]] in the event of a complete communications failure.\n\n==History==\nFrom the early days of organized weather collection in the United States, a central facility was used to gather and disseminate data.  Originally, this task occupied a single room within the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|United States Army Signal Service]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Reports were collected via [[telegraph]] and general forecasts were made for the country.\n\nWhile WPC's roots lie deep in the past, the organization can be most directly traced to the formation of the Analysis Center by Circular Letter 39-42, signed by Weather Bureau Director Francis W.

Graphical forecasts are issued twice daily at 0900 UTC and 2100 UTC (4AM/PM EST respectively), although updates may be warranted by rapidly changing conditions.\n\nThe Winter Weather Desk issues probabilistic heavy snow and icing guidance products for the next three days.  The forecasts represent the probability that freezing rain or combined snow/sleet accumulations will meet specific criteria within a 24-hour period. These products are issued in probabilistic form to better represent the forecast uncertainty associated with a particular event.

[[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] are most respected and viewed as very prominent and greatest rulers in [[Andhra Pradesh]] [[History of Andhra Pradesh|history]] as they were the reason for the origin of [[Telugu New Year]], [[Ugadi]] from this region. Their language was [[Prakrit]] of [[Brahmi script|Brahmi Script]], which served as the base for the [[script]] of [[Telugu language|Telugu Language]]. They issued many [[Gautamiputra Satakarni|coins]] with this [[Prakrit]] language which can be found in many insciptions in this region today. They even started the [[Shaka Calendar|Satavahana Calendar]], The first Indian National Calendar from this region. They even respected and practised [[Buddhism]] and partly responsible for the prevalence of [[Buddhism]] in the region.   \n\nThe city was also once the [[Holy place|holy site]] of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The city used to have a biggest [[Stupa|Buddhist Stupa]] known as [[Amaravati Stupa|Mahachaitya]] (also known as [[Amaravati Stupa]]) which was ruined over the time. It was also the [[Centre|center]] of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Culture of Buddhism|learning]] and [[Buddhist art|art]] where many [[Bhikkhu|buddhist followers]] from many [[Southeast Asia|South East Asian]] countries used to visit and practice the [[Culture of Buddhism|buddhist culture]] here in this place. It can be seen from the [[Amaravati Stupa]], many [[Inscriptions|Buddhist inscriptions]], [[Sculpture|sculptures]] and [[Dhyana Buddha statue|Gautam Buddha Statue]] in the city. Many other ancient [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati Buddhist Marbels]] and Buddhist [[remains]] from the region were unfortunately destroyed over the time and some of them were exported to Chennai Museum and [[British Museum]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]] which can be seen there today. The sculptures on the [[Amaravati Marbles|Limestone Marbels]] depict many [[Buddhist art]], [[Epigraphy|incriptions]] and [[Amaravati Stupa|buddhist stupas]] serving as an eye feast.

[[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] are most respected and viewed as very prominent and greatest rulers in [[Andhra Pradesh]] [[History of Andhra Pradesh|history]] as they were the reason for the origin of [[Telugu New Year]], [[Ugadi]] from this region. Their language was [[Prakrit]] of [[Brahmi script|Brahmi Script]], which served as the base for the [[script]] of [[Telugu language|Telugu Language]]. They issued many [[Gautamiputra Satakarni|coins]] with this [[Prakrit]] language which can be found in many insciptions in this region today. They even started the [[Shaka Calendar|Satavahana Calendar]], The first Indian National Calendar from this region. They even respected and practised [[Buddhism]] and partly responsible for the prevalence of [[Buddhism]] in the region.   \n\nThe city was also once the [[Holy place|holy site]] of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The city used to have a biggest [[Stupa|Buddhist Stupa]] known as [[Amaravati Stupa|Mahachaitya]] (also known as [[Amaravati Stupa]]) which was detroyed over the time. It was also the center of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Culture of Buddhism|learning]] and [[Buddhist art|art]] where many [[Bhikkhu|buddhist followers]] from many [[Southeast Asia|South East Asian]] countries used to visit and practice the [[Culture of Buddhism|buddhist culture]] here in this place. It can be seen from the [[Amaravati Stupa]], many [[Inscriptions|Buddhist inscriptions]], [[Sculpture|sculptures]] and [[Dhyana Buddha statue|Gautam Buddha Statue]] in the city. Many other ancient [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati Buddhist Marbels]] and Buddhist [[remains]] from the region were unfortunately destroyed over the time and some of them were exported to Chennai Museum and [[British Museum]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]] which can be seen there today. The sculptures on the [[Amaravati Marbles|Limestone Marbels]] depict many [[Buddhist art]], [[Epigraphy|incriptions]] and [[Amaravati Stupa|buddhist stupas]] serving as an eye feast.
