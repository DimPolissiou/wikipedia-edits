The series prominently shows the bravery of the volunteers at the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]], part of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898. It was released on DVD in 2006. The series originally aired on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] with a four-hour running time, including commercials, over two consecutive nights during July 1997.<ref name=tvtango>{{cite news |url=http://www.tvtango.com/miniseries/rough_riders |title=Rough Riders |website=TV Tango |date=<!--undated--> |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1898 the US government decided to intervene on the side of the Cuban rebels in their struggle against Spanish rule. Assistant Navy Secretary Theodore Roosevelt decides to experience the war first hand by promoting and joining a volunteer cavalry regiment.\n\nThe regiment, later known as the Rough Riders, brings together volunteers from all corners of the nation and all walks of life. They include a stagecoach robber, Henry Nash, and patrician men.\n\nWhen Roosevelt and his men finally land on Cuba, they face ambush, intense enemy fire, and a desperate, outnumbered charge up a defended hill.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Berenger]] \u2013 Lt.

Berenger pitched the idea of a mini series on the Rough Riders to Turner, giving him an outline, and Turner agreed to finance a four-hour mini series for TNT.\n\n\"I see him as a `force of nature',\" said Berenger, \"a kind of sweet, endearing, enthusiastic and honest man who probably wouldn't make it in politics today. Yet this incident in our history -- largely created by William Randolph Hearst and other yellow press barons -- took him to the White House.\"<ref name=\"tom\">{{cite news|title=TOM BERENGER ACQUIRES FEIST AS TEDDY R|first=Eirik|last=Knutzen|newspaper= Morning Call|date=20 July 1997|page= T.03}}</ref>\n\nBerenger originally intended to play [[Colonel Leonard Wood]], with [[Stephen Lang]] to play Roosevelt. Berenger said the mini series \"needs a couple other names.'.. It'll be as much fun as `Gettysburg' was to do ... a bunch of guys playing a famous military unit... The casting director of `Gettysburg' told me she had 6,000 actors' submissions for that production. There were a couple of big names who wanted to do it so badly they said, `Just give me a couple of lines and a uniform - that's all I want.'\"<ref>{{cite news|title='SPECIAL' PLANS FOR BARBARA WALTERS' OSCAR NIGHT|newspaper=Daily News|date=22 Mar 1996|page= L.4}}</ref> \n \n[[Hugh Wilson (director)|Hugh Wilson]] wrote the first draft and planned to direct.

Assistant Navy Secretary Theodore Roosevelt decides to experience the war first hand by promoting and joining a volunteer cavalry regiment.\n\nThe regiment, later known as the Rough Riders, brings together volunteers from all corners of the nation and all walks of life. They include a stagecoach robber, Henry Nash, and patrician men.\n\nWhen Roosevelt and his men finally land on Cuba, they face ambush, intense enemy fire, and a desperate, outnumbered charge up a defended hill.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Berenger]] \u2013 Lt.

In 1920, people called World War I \"The Great War.\" No one could have possibly imagined in 1920 that there would be a Second World War a generation later. Nash was never a millionaire businessman; he was a schoolteacher and his last salary, in 1902 in Manila, was for $1,200 per year. Henry Nash never had a son who went to Harvard. In fact, he never married and never had any children.\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical===\nA reviewer for [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] said \"it's not straight history, the name-dropping's something fierce, and fictional characters are mixed liberally with imaginary takes of legendary figures; the first two hours of the four-hour opus are colorful, the second disturbingly corny. \"Rough Riders\" is a rough, sometimes silly, take on extraordinary American history.\"<ref name=var-1997jul17>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/rough-riders-1200450519/ |title=Review: 'Rough Riders' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=17 July 1997 |first=Tony |last=Scott}}</ref>\n\nA reviewer for the [[Los Angeles Times]] wrote that \"it rarely manages to surface above a seemingly endless array of skirmishes, firefights, ambushes, infantry charges, hand-to-hand combat, carnage and killing.\"<ref name=lat-1997jul19>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/19/entertainment/ca-14151 |title='Riders' Characters Prove Roughly Drawn |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=19 July 1997 |first=Don |last=Heckman}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Baltimore Sun'' said the film \"overstays its welcome by at least a third... so oozes with testosterone that your TV screen may start sprouting facial hair....

The first enclosed shopping mall in [[Toronto]] was the Toronto Arcade in [[Downtown Toronto|the downtown core]]. The first shopping mall of the enclosed, automobile-centred design type was [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], opened in 1964. For shopping malls [[Area code 905|surrounding the city of Toronto]], please see the template at the bottom of this article.\n\n==Major shopping centres==\nThese shopping centres each have over a hundred stores and are anchored by multiple department stores. They are also the five largest malls in Toronto. Each provides thousands of automobile parking spaces. With the exception of [[Sherway Gardens]], all of these malls have direct pedestrian connections with the [[Toronto subway]] system, though Sherway Gardens has bus connections through the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]'s [[Toronto Transit Commission bus system|bus network]] and [[MiWay]] of [[Mississauga]]. Yorkdale is Toronto's first major shopping centre and was the world's largest when it was first opened. The Toronto Eaton Centre is the most visited shopping mall in North America, given its downtown location and direct access to two subway stations. These five malls were completed within a 13-year span. A sixth major mall, East Harbour, is planned for Toronto's east end by the interchange of [[Don Valley Parkway]] and Gardiner Expressway/[[Lake Shore Boulevard|Lake Shore Boulevard East]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eastharbour.ca|title=East Harbour {{!}} Toronto, Ontario, Canada|website=eastharbour.ca|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n[[File:Eatoncentrertorontohall.JPG|right|thumb|With over {{convert|159979|sqm|sqft}} of retail space, [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] is the second largest shopping centre in Toronto, and the [[List of largest shopping malls in Canada|fifth largest in Canada]].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

These shopping centres typically provide a surrounding free parking lot. Most of these are located in the former suburbs of Toronto, where land was available for parking. There are only three shopping malls of this type within [[Old Toronto|Toronto's pre-1998 city limits]]: Galleria Shopping Centre (at Dufferin Street and Dupont Street), Dufferin Mall (on Dufferin Street south of Bloor Street and north of College Street), and Gerrard Square (on Gerrard Street East east of Pape Avenue).

The first enclosed shopping mall in [[Toronto]] was the Toronto Arcade in [[Downtown Toronto|the downtown core]]. The first shopping mall of the enclosed, automobile-centred design type was [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], opened in 1964. For shopping malls [[Area code 905|surrounding the city of Toronto]], please see the template at the bottom of this article.\n\n==Major shopping centres==\nThese shopping centres each have over a hundred stores and are anchored by multiple department stores. They are also the five largest malls in Toronto. Each provides thousands of automobile parking spaces. With the exception of [[Sherway Gardens]], all of these malls have direct pedestrian connections with the [[Toronto subway]] system, though Sherway Gardens has bus connections through the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]'s [[Toronto Transit Commission bus system|bus network]] and [[MiWay]] of [[Mississauga]]. Yorkdale is Toronto's first major shopping centre and was the world's largest when it was first opened. The Toronto Eaton Centre is the most visited shopping mall in North America, given its downtown location and direct access to two subway stations. These five malls were completed within a 13-year span.

The district had a population that was 65% African American, the highest percentage of any congressional district in the nation. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} It includes the home of former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].\n\nThe 1st is a [[majority-minority]] district, and has been since at least the 1920s. In 1929, it became the first district in the 20th century to send an [[African American]] to Congress. Since redistricting by the state legislature after the 2010 census, it is 51.3% African American, 40.6% white, and 9.8% Hispanic in population. The district is represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Bobby Rush]], who was re-elected in 2018, and has been elected continuously in the 1st district since 1992.\n\n==2011 redistricting==\nIn 2011, following the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the state legislature redistricted.

Historical populations reflected waves of immigration into the area: previous majority populations were ethnic Irish, German, and east European. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the Irish were the first to establish their physical and political control of the area within the city's South Side.\n\nThe current 1st district has a [[minority-majority]] population: 51.3% of the residents are [[African American (U.S. Census)|African-American]].<ref name=Barone2014/> <!-- has the highest percentage (65.5) of [[African American (U.S. Census)|African-American]] residents among congressional districts in the nation.{{cn|date=February 2014}} --> It has been represented in Congress by African Americans since 1929. Tens of thousands of African Americans moved to Chicago from the rural South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. They were confined by discrimination to the South Side of Chicago and gradually replaced ethnic whites who moved out to suburbs. At one point during the 1980s, more than 90% of the district's residents were black. <ref name=CQ1980s>{{cite book |last=Gottron |first=Martha V.

The district has not sent a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the U.S. House of Representatives since [[United States House elections, 1934|1935]]. After the [[civil rights movement]] gained support from national Democratic Party for major legislation to restore constitutional rights, including the franchise in the South, most African Americans shifted to support the Democratic Party. Democratic congressional candidates routinely receive over 80% of the vote here. The Democratic trend runs right through to the national level; since the 1950s, Democratic presidential candidates have usually carry the district with well over 70 percent of the vote, and have done no worse than 64 percent/\n\n===Geography===\nBased in Chicago, the district includes the neighborhoods of [[Auburn Gresham, Chicago|Auburn Gresham]], [[Burnside, Chicago|Burnside]], [[Chatham, Chicago|Chatham]] and [[Greater Grand Crossing, Chicago|Greater Grand Crossing]]; almost all of [[West Englewood, Chicago|West Englewood]]; the portion of [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]] south of 57th Street; the portion of [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] west of [[Stony Island Avenue]] (i.e. excluding [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]); the southern half of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] (home of President [[Barack Obama]]); the eastern portion of [[Ashburn, Chicago|Ashburn]]; parts of [[Avalon Park, Chicago|Avalon Park]], [[Calumet Heights, Chicago|Calumet Heights]], [[Chicago Lawn, Chicago|Chicago Lawn]], [[Douglas, Chicago|Douglas]], [[Grand Boulevard, Chicago|Grand Boulevard]], [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], [[Morgan Park, Chicago|Morgan Park]], [[New City, Chicago|New City]], [[Oakland, Chicago|Oakland]], [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]], [[South Shore, Chicago|South Shore]], [[Washington Heights, Chicago|Washington Heights]] and [[Washington Park, Chicago (neighborhood)|Washington Park]]; the portion of [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]] southeast of 97th Street and Prospect Avenue; the portion of [[West Pullman, Chicago|West Pullman]] southwest of 119th Street and Racine Avenue; and approximately two square blocks at the northwest corner of [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago]].\n\nThe district's area south of [[95th Street (Chicago)|95th Street]] is almost entirely west of [[Interstate 57]]. The district includes the municipalities of [[Crestwood, Illinois|Crestwood]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], [[Midlothian, Illinois|Midlothian]], [[Posen, Illinois|Posen]] and [[Robbins, Illinois|Robbins]], nearly all of [[Alsip, Illinois|Alsip]], [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] and [[Oak Forest, Illinois|Oak Forest]], parts of [[Calumet Park, Illinois|Calumet Park]], [[Dixmoor, Illinois|Dixmoor]], [[Markham, Illinois|Markham]], [[Orland Hills, Illinois|Orland Hills]], [[Orland Park, Illinois|Orland Park]], [[Palos Heights, Illinois|Palos Heights]], [[Tinley Park, Illinois|Tinley Park]] and [[Worth, Illinois|Worth]], and some small sections of [[Country Club Hills, Illinois|Country Club Hills]] and [[Riverdale, Illinois|Riverdale]].\n\n===Demographics===\nIn the twentieth century after the Great Migration from the South and concentration of blacks on the South Side due to ''de facto'' residential segregation, the district became the nation's first with a black-majority population. Since the 1920s, it has included the central area of Chicago's South Side African-American community. Over 85% of the district's residents were black during the period from the 1950s through the 1980s, but redistricting since that time \u2013 which redrew the district lines with the goal of maintaining three Chicago districts with black populations exceeding 60% \u2013 has reduced the percentage of black residents in the district to 70% in the 1990s. The current figure is 65%. Outward migration has caused the South Side's population to decrease over the years, and the district was expanded geographically to the southwest to gain residents, particularly as the state's congressional delegation has been reduced in numbers due to population changes and reapportionment. The district, which covered only nine square miles in the 1950s, is now more than ten times that size. Nearly half its current area was added for the 2000s.\n\nThe district's population dropped by 27% in the 1950s,<ref>{{cite book |title=Congressional District Data Book: Districts of the 87th Congress |year=1961 |publisher=U.S. Bureau of the Census |location=Washington, D.C. |page=16 }}</ref> and by 20% in both the 1970s and 1980s, due to outward migration for suburbanization and because of people leaving the area due to loss of jobs.<ref name=CQ1980s/><ref>{{cite book |title=Congressional Districts in the 1990s: A Portrait of America |year=1993 |publisher=Congressional Quarterly |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-87187-722-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/congressionaldis0000unse_i0y7/page/235 235] |url=https://archive.org/details/congressionaldis0000unse_i0y7/page/235 }}</ref> In redistricting after the [[United States Census, 1990|1990 U.S. Census]], the district was extended into the suburbs for the first time in 90 years.

The district's expansion into the suburbs in the 1990s has incorporated a population that has voted Republican more often; Republican support has passed the 10% mark, and [[George W.

His was the best showing by a Republican presidential candidate in the district in over 40 years.\n\nThe district has since the early 1970s elected representatives who dissented from the city's Democratic establishment. [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William L. Dawson]], U.S. Representative from 1943 to 1970, maintained the district's loyalty to Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]. His successor [[Ralph Metcalfe]] initially continued that stance but publicly broke with Daley over an incident of police brutality in 1972, establishing a rift that persists. When Metcalfe died less than one month before the election in [[United States House elections, 1978|1978]], Democratic party officials named loyalist [[Bennett M. Stewart]] to take his place on the ballot, and Republicans replaced their candidate with [[Sammy Rayner|A.A. \"Sammy\" Rayner]], a former Democratic alderman.

The district had a population that was 65% African American, the highest percentage of any congressional district in the nation. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} It includes the home of former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].\n\nThe 1st is a [[majority-minority]] district, and has been since at least the 1920s.

Since redistricting by the state legislature after the 2010 census, it is 51.3% African American, 40.6% white, and 9.8% Hispanic in population. The district is represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Bobby Rush]], who was re-elected in 2018, and has been elected continuously in the 1st district since 1992.\n\n==2011 redistricting==\nIn 2011, following the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the state legislature redistricted.

(1986), pp. 53\u201354.</ref> Since that time, the district has included all or part of Cook County; since 1883 the population of the district has been primarily residing on [[Chicago's South Side]]. Historical populations reflected waves of immigration into the area: previous majority populations were ethnic Irish, German, and east European. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the Irish were the first to establish their physical and political control of the area within the city's South Side.\n\nThe current 1st district has a [[minority-majority]] population: 51.3% of the residents are [[African American (U.S. Census)|African-American]].<ref name=Barone2014/> <!-- has the highest percentage (65.5) of [[African American (U.S. Census)|African-American]] residents among congressional districts in the nation.{{cn|date=February 2014}} --> It has been represented in Congress by African Americans since 1929. Tens of thousands of African Americans moved to Chicago from the rural South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. They were confined by discrimination to the South Side of Chicago and gradually replaced ethnic whites who moved out to suburbs. At one point during the 1980s, more than 90% of the district's residents were black. <ref name=CQ1980s>{{cite book |last=Gottron |first=Martha V.

The district has not sent a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the U.S. House of Representatives since [[United States House elections, 1934|1935]]. After the [[civil rights movement]] gained support from national Democratic Party for major legislation to restore constitutional rights, including the franchise in the South, most African Americans shifted to support the Democratic Party. Democratic congressional candidates routinely receive over 80% of the vote here. The Democratic trend runs right through to the national level; since the 1950s, Democratic presidential candidates have usually carry the district with well over 70 percent of the vote, and have done no worse than 64 percent/\n\n===Geography===\nBased in Chicago, the district includes the neighborhoods of [[Auburn Gresham, Chicago|Auburn Gresham]], [[Burnside, Chicago|Burnside]], [[Chatham, Chicago|Chatham]] and [[Greater Grand Crossing, Chicago|Greater Grand Crossing]]; almost all of [[West Englewood, Chicago|West Englewood]]; the portion of [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]] south of 57th Street; the portion of [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] west of [[Stony Island Avenue]] (i.e. excluding [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]); the southern half of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] (home of President [[Barack Obama]]); the eastern portion of [[Ashburn, Chicago|Ashburn]]; parts of [[Avalon Park, Chicago|Avalon Park]], [[Calumet Heights, Chicago|Calumet Heights]], [[Chicago Lawn, Chicago|Chicago Lawn]], [[Douglas, Chicago|Douglas]], [[Grand Boulevard, Chicago|Grand Boulevard]], [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], [[Morgan Park, Chicago|Morgan Park]], [[New City, Chicago|New City]], [[Oakland, Chicago|Oakland]], [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]], [[South Shore, Chicago|South Shore]], [[Washington Heights, Chicago|Washington Heights]] and [[Washington Park, Chicago (neighborhood)|Washington Park]]; the portion of [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]] southeast of 97th Street and Prospect Avenue; the portion of [[West Pullman, Chicago|West Pullman]] southwest of 119th Street and Racine Avenue; and approximately two square blocks at the northwest corner of [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago]].\n\nThe district's area south of [[95th Street (Chicago)|95th Street]] is almost entirely west of [[Interstate 57]]. The district includes the municipalities of [[Crestwood, Illinois|Crestwood]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], [[Midlothian, Illinois|Midlothian]], [[Posen, Illinois|Posen]] and [[Robbins, Illinois|Robbins]], nearly all of [[Alsip, Illinois|Alsip]], [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] and [[Oak Forest, Illinois|Oak Forest]], parts of [[Calumet Park, Illinois|Calumet Park]], [[Dixmoor, Illinois|Dixmoor]], [[Markham, Illinois|Markham]], [[Orland Hills, Illinois|Orland Hills]], [[Orland Park, Illinois|Orland Park]], [[Palos Heights, Illinois|Palos Heights]], [[Tinley Park, Illinois|Tinley Park]] and [[Worth, Illinois|Worth]], and some small sections of [[Country Club Hills, Illinois|Country Club Hills]] and [[Riverdale, Illinois|Riverdale]].\n\n===Demographics===\nIn the twentieth century after the Great Migration from the South and concentration of blacks on the South Side due to ''de facto'' residential segregation, the district became the nation's first with a black-majority population. Since the 1920s, it has included the central area of Chicago's South Side African-American community. Over 85% of the district's residents were black during the period from the 1950s through the 1980s, but redistricting since that time \u2013 which redrew the district lines with the goal of maintaining three Chicago districts with black populations exceeding 60% \u2013 has reduced the percentage of black residents in the district to 70% in the 1990s. The current figure is 65%. Outward migration has caused the South Side's population to decrease over the years, and the district was expanded geographically to the southwest to gain residents, particularly as the state's congressional delegation has been reduced in numbers due to population changes and reapportionment. The district, which covered only nine square miles in the 1950s, is now more than ten times that size. Nearly half its current area was added for the 2000s.\n\nThe district's population dropped by 27% in the 1950s,<ref>{{cite book |title=Congressional District Data Book: Districts of the 87th Congress |year=1961 |publisher=U.S. Bureau of the Census |location=Washington, D.C. |page=16 }}</ref> and by 20% in both the 1970s and 1980s, due to outward migration for suburbanization and because of people leaving the area due to loss of jobs.<ref name=CQ1980s/><ref>{{cite book |title=Congressional Districts in the 1990s: A Portrait of America |year=1993 |publisher=Congressional Quarterly |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-87187-722-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/congressionaldis0000unse_i0y7/page/235 235] |url=https://archive.org/details/congressionaldis0000unse_i0y7/page/235 }}</ref> In redistricting after the [[United States Census, 1990|1990 U.S. Census]], the district was extended into the suburbs for the first time in 90 years.

He was [[List of Speakers of the Illinois House of Representatives|Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives]], [[Attorney General of Illinois]], an Associate Justice of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]], [[Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires]] to [[Republic of the New Granada|New Granada]], and [[United States Senator]] from [[Illinois]].\n\nSemple was born in [[Green County, Kentucky]] and was raised and educated in [[Clinton County, Kentucky|Clinton County]]. He served in the Kentucky Militia during the [[War of 1812]] and then moved to Missouri, where he was active in the militia and owned and operated several businesses. He later studied law in Missouri and Kentucky, attained admission to the bar, and moved to [[Edwardsville, Illinois]] to start a practice. He became active in politics as a Democrat, but was opposed to slavery, and he served in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] from 1828 to 1832. He continued his militia service after moving to Illinois, and took part in the [[Black Hawk War]]. After service as [[Illinois Attorney General]] from 1832 to 1834, Semple returned to the Illinois House, where he served as Speaker from 1834 to 1837.\n\nFrom 1838 to 1842, Semple served as US [[Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires]] in [[Republic of the New Granada|New Granada]]. Upon returning to Illinois, he was appointed an Associate Justice of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]], but he served only a few months because later that year he was selected to fill a vacancy in the US Senate, where he served from 1843 to 1847.\n\nAfter leaving politics, Semple practiced law, was active in several business ventures, and attempted to market an invention called the prairie car, a forerunner of the modern automobile. He died in [[Elsah, Illinois]], a town he founded, and was buried at [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].\n\n==Early life==\nJames Semple was born in [[Green County, Kentucky]] on January 5, 1798, the son of John Walker Semple and Lucy (Robertson) Semple.{{sfn|Biography: General James Semple|pages=62\u201374}} Semple's grandfather Robert Semple served in the Virginia legislature, and his father served in the legislature of Kentucky.{{sfn|Biography: General James Semple|pages=62\u201374}} James Semple was raised on his father's [[Clinton County, Kentucky|Clinton County]] homestead, which John Sample named \"76\".{{sfn|Biography: General James Semple|pages=62\u201374}} He received his early education from his mother, a talented woman educated enough to argue cases in court when no lawyers were available, and was tutored by his uncle Isaac Robertson, who was a graduate of [[Princeton University|Princeton College]].{{sfn|Biography: General James Semple|pages=62\u201374}}\n\n==Start of career==\nIn 1814, the sixteen-year-old Semple volunteered for the [[Kentucky Army National Guard|Kentucky Militia]] during the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Biography: General James Semple|pages=62\u201374}}  He served until the end war, and in 1817 received a commission as an ensign in Kentucky's 81st Militia Regiment.{{sfn|Biography: General James Semple|pages=62\u201374}}\n\nIn 1818, Semple moved to [[Edwardsville, Illinois]], but he remained for only nine months before returning to Kentucky.  In 1819, he moved to [[Chariton, Missouri]], where he operated a tannery and became active in other business ventures.{{sfn|Biography: General James Semple|pages=62\u201374}} In addition, he joined the Missouri Militia's 21st Infantry Regiment, which he later commanded with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].  Soon after arriving in Chariton, Semple was elected a state Loan Commissioner.{{sfn|Biography: General James Semple|pages=62\u201374}} In response to the [[Panic of 1819]], Missouri's government authorized the issuing of paper money that could be loaned to farmers so that they wouldn't lose their land during the economic downturn.{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of American Recessions and Depressions''|page=718}} Loan Office Banks throughout the state were supervised by commissioners who loaned the money, ensured it was repaid, and instituted foreclosure proceedings and auctions for

He served in the Kentucky Militia during the [[War of 1812]] and then moved to Missouri, where he was active in the militia and owned and operated several businesses. He later studied law in Missouri and Kentucky, attained admission to the bar, and moved to [[Edwardsville, Illinois]] to start a practice. He became active in politics as a Democrat, but was opposed to slavery, and he served in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] from 1828 to 1832. He continued his militia service after moving to Illinois, and took part in the [[Black Hawk War]]. After service as [[Illinois Attorney General]] from 1832 to 1834, Semple returned to the Illinois House, where he served as Speaker from 1834 to 1837.\n\nFrom 1838 to 1842, Semple served as US [[Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires]] in [[Republic of the New Granada|New Granada]]. Upon returning to Illinois, he was appointed an Associate Justice of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]], but he served only a few months because later that year he was selected to fill a vacancy in the US Senate, where he served from 1843 to 1847.\n\nAfter leaving politics, Semple practiced law, was active in several business ventures, and attempted to market an invention called the prairie car, a forerunner of the modern automobile.

Whiteside fought the British in the [[War of 1812]] and Native Americans through the [[Blackhawk War]] (including in the [[Illinois Territory]] before statehood and later in the [[Wisconsin Territory]]).<ref>[http://illinois1812warsociety.org/samuel.html Samuel Whiteside]</ref>\n\n==Early and family life==\nSamuel Whiteside was born on April 12, 1783, in [[Rutherford County, North Carolina]] to the former Judith Tolley and her husband John D. Whiteside. His paternal grandfather, William Whiteside Sr., was a patriot who signed the [[Tryon Resolves]] during the  [[American Revolutionary War]], and whose sons Davis, James, John D., William B., Thomas, Samuel, and Adam Whiteside all fought the British at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] in 1780.

Before crossing the [[Mississippi River]], they settled near [[Columbia, Illinois|Columbia]], [[Monroe County, Illinois]] on the abandoned Flannery Fort site protecting the important early [[Kaskaskia]] to [[Cahokia]] Trail.

Whiteside was a militia captain and lived at the fort, which was called Whiteside Station until he died in 1815 (shortly before Illinois became a state). He had survived his son Thomas (who died at the fort in 1795, possibly during the Indian raid that Samuel survived and which shaped his later military career).<ref>http://illinois1812warsociety.org/samuel.html</ref>\n\nHis son John (Samuel's father) moved his family to Bellefountaine (now [[Waterloo, Illinois]]), also on the Kaskaskia/Cahokia trail in [[Monroe County, Illinois]]; his nephew another John D.

One of them was William Bolin Whiteside (1777-1833), who owned at least two slaves, became a militia captain for that area for decades and was elected the first sheriff of Madison County after statehood (and served until a scandal in 1822).<ref>https://madison-historical.siue.edu/encyclopedia/william-bolin-whiteside-1777-1833/</ref> Meanwhile, this Samuel Whiteside and his brother Joel purchased land in what became [[Maryville, Illinois]] (in Madison County about 17 miles from St. Louis) in 1802.<ref>http://illinois1812warsociety.org/samuel.html</ref> Some Whiteside relatives would cross the Mississippi River and [[Whiteside, Missouri]] would be named after early landowner William Whiteside. Other Whitesides (including this Samuel's children) moved inland to [[Niantic, Illinois|Niantic]], [[Macon County, Illinois]].\nMeanwhile, Samuel Whiteside in 1804 married Virginia-born Nancy Miller (1789-1851). Their children included: Michael Whiteside (1805-1881), Judith Whiteside Waddell (1806-1876), Nancy Whiteside (b. 1808), Sarah Whiteside (b. 1810), Joel Whiteside (1811-1882), William Modrel Whiteside (1812-1864), Thomas Whiteside (b.1815), Samuel Ray Whiteside (1820-1866), Elizabeth Ann (Eliza) Whiteside Henderson (1812-1910), John Perry Whiteside (1822-) and Mary Ann Whiteside (b. 1830).<ref>http://illinois1812warsociety.org/samuel.html</ref> The family did not own slaves in the 1820 Federal census, nor the 1830 Federal census. In the 1850 census, Samuel Whiteside farmed in Madison County near his younger sons Samuel Ray and John Perry Whiteside and their families; the census found no slaves in the county.<ref>1850 U.S.Federal Census for Township 3 North R8 West, Madison County, Illinois, family 99 (p. 11 of 21); ancestry.com indicates the county has no slave schedules for that census</ref>\n\n==Indian fighter, legislator and farmer==\nIn 1811, during [[Tecumseh's War]], Whiteside (tho not yet 20 years old) received command of a company, in the newly formed 17th Illinois Infantry. The following year, during the [[War of 1812]], Captain Samuel Whiteside commanded a company of mounted infantry in the Illinois militia from August to November 1812. This company was drawn from [[St. Clair County, Illinois|St. Clair County]], which adjoined Columbia, Illinois to the north and comprised most of the modern State. Whiteside had enlisted as an ensign (January 2, 1810) in the Illinois militia and received promotions to captain (August 22, 1812), major (February 26, 1817), colonel (May 22, 1817) and brigadier general (1819).<ref>http://illinois1812warsociety.org/samuel.html</ref> Once during the War of 1812, captain Whiteside saved boats of fellow soldiers who tried to cross the Mississippi to attack St. Louis, but were endangered during a retreat by shifting winds as well as the great river's current.<ref>http://illinois1812warsociety.org/samuel.html</ref>\n\nIn August 1813 Whiteside received a captain's commission in the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] and led a [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]] unit. In 1814, a woman and six children near [[Alton, Illinois]] were killed by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Captain Whiteside and his men pursued the killers, and killed one of them found hiding in a tree. Whiteside was discharged from the Army on July 30, 1814, but was among the witnesses to treaties with the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] and [[Osage Nation|Osage]] in 1815.<ref>Louis Houck, History of Missouri (Chicago, RR Donnelly & Sons), Vol. 2 Ch. 22 (1908) p. 398</ref>\n\nFollowing Illinois' statehood in 1818, Whiteside served on the commission to select a new site for the Illinois State Capital, selecting [[Vandalia, Illinois]] at the confluence of the [[Kaskaskia River|Kaskaskia]] and Mississippi Rivers and the end of the [[National Road]]; it would remain the state capital until Abraham Lincoln and other legislators secured a move inland to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] in 1839. Meanwhile, voters elected Whiteside as a delegate in the first [[Illinois General Assembly]]; he served from 1819 to 1821 and did not seek re-election. Instead, he returned to farming and leading the Madison County militia.\n\nIn 1827, after drunk boatman abducted and raped several [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago) women near what became [[Prairie Du Chien, Wisconsin]] (then [[Wisconsin Territory]]) and their menfolk rescued them in a skirmish in which both Native Americans and whites died, Whiteside and his militiamen, along with Generals [[Lewis Cass]] and [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]] and Col.

Whiteside in turn commissioned 23-year-old [[Abraham Lincoln]] as a militia captain (and Lincoln would serve a month until this phase of the war ended); future governor [[Thomas Ford (politician)|Thomas Ford]] also served under Whiteside. In late April, U.S. Army General Henry Atkinson at [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]] sent Reynolds, Whiteside and their militia up the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] and the [[Sauk Trail]], planning to join forces at [[Prophetstown, Illinois]], home of [[Wabokieshiek]] (White Cloud), one of Black Hawk's chief advisors and who had created the settlement after Black Hawk had been barred from his native village [[Saukenuk]] at the confluence of the Mississippi and Rock Rivers. On May 10, 1832, Whiteside gave the order to burn the abandoned Prophetstown, and proceeded upriver to secure [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon's ferry]], a relatively new settlement and post office where the Peoria/Galena wagon road crossed the Rock River. Although Whiteside initially remained at Dixon waiting for the regular army, at Governor Reynolds' urging, he sent a scout company under Major [[Isaiah Stillman]] to seek out Black Hawk's British Band. Stillman's men imprisoned some of Black Hawk's emissaries, but fled after the British Band attacked; General Whiteside led the small group which buried the 11 dead militiamen after what became known as the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]].<ref>\"Battle of Stillman's Run\" in William B.

A farmer and backwoodsman, Whiteside briefly served in the [[Illinois General Assembly]] after statehood and led the Illinois militia for decades, rising to the rank of general but also enlisting as an ordinary soldier when militia calls declined at the end of wars. Whiteside fought the British in the [[War of 1812]] and Native Americans through the [[Blackhawk War]] (including in the [[Illinois Territory]] before statehood and later in the [[Wisconsin Territory]]).<ref>[http://illinois1812warsociety.org/samuel.html Samuel Whiteside]</ref>\n\n==Early and family life==\nSamuel Whiteside was born on April 12, 1783, in [[Rutherford County, North Carolina]] to the former Judith Tolley and her husband John D. Whiteside. His paternal grandfather, William Whiteside Sr., was a patriot who signed the [[Tryon Resolves]] during the  [[American Revolutionary War]], and whose sons Davis, James, John D., William B., Thomas, Samuel, and Adam Whiteside all fought the British at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] in 1780.
