Initially the term was used to denote the [[tribal chief|chieftain]] of a [[Slavic tribe]]. Later, with the development of feudal statehood, it became the title of a ruler of a state, and among East Slavs ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e}} (''kniazhestvo''), {{lang-uk|\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0456\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e}} (''knyazivstvo'') traditionally translated as [[duchy]] or [[principality]]), for example, of [[Kievan Rus']]. In medieval Latin sources the title was rendered as either ''[[King|rex]]'' or ''[[dux]]''. In [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] changed his title to knyaz after his conversion to Christianity, but his son [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon]] took the higher title of [[tsar]] soon in 913. In Kievan Rus', as the degree of centralization grew, the ruler acquired the title ''[[Velikii Knyaz]]'' (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c) (translated as [[Grand Prince]] or [[Grand Duke]], see [[Grand duke#Russian grand dukes|Russian Grand Dukes]]). He ruled a ''Velyke Knyazivstvo'' (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437i\u0432c\u0442\u0432\u043e) ([[Grand Duchy]]), while a ruler of its vassal constituent (''udel'', ''udelnoe knyazivstvo'' or ''[[volost]]'') was called ''udelny knyaz'' or simply ''knyaz''.\n\nWhen Kievan Rus' became fragmented in the 13th century, the title Kniaz continued to be used in [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] states, including [[Kiev]], [[Chernihiv]], [[Novgorod]], [[Pereiaslav]], [[Vladimir-Suzdal']], [[Muscovy]], [[Tver]], [[Halych-Volynia]], and in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>[http://www.speakrus.ru/starina/03.htm#\u0412\u0415\u041b\u0418\u041a\u0418\u0419%20\u041a\u041d\u042f\u0417\u042c \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c // \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439. \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044b (speakrus.ru) ]</ref>\n\n== Russia ==\n[[File:Kneaze Alexey Michailovitz.jpg|thumb|Kneaze Alexey Michailovitz, 1664 ([[Tsar]] [[Alexis I of Russia]]).]]\nAs the [[Tsardom of Russia]] gained dominion over much of former Kievan Rus', ''Velikii Kniaz'' (\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0301\u0437\u044c) (Great Kniaz) [[Ivan IV of Russia]] in 1547 was crowned as [[Tsar]]. From the mid-18th century onwards, the title Velikii Kniaz was revived to refer to (male-line) sons and grandsons of Russian Emperors. See [[Tsar#Titles for Tsar's family|titles for Tsar's family]] for details.\n\n''Kniaz'' ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0301\u0437\u044c}}, {{IPA-ru|\u02c8kn\u02b2\u00e6s\u02b2|IPA}}) continued as a hereditary title of [[Russian nobility]] patrilineally descended from [[Rurik]] (e.g., [[Belozersky (surname)|Belozersky]], [[Belosselsky-Belozersky family|Belosselsky-Belozersky]], [[Repnin]], [[Gorchakov]]) or [[Gediminas]] (e.g., [[Galitzine]], [[Troubetzkoy]]). Members of [[Rurikid]] or [[Gedyminid]] families were called princes when they ruled tiny quasi-sovereign medieval principalities. After their demesnes were absorbed by Muscovy, they settled at the Moscow court and were authorised to continue with their princely titles.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, the title was occasionally granted by the Tsar, for the first time by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] to his associate [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]], and then by [[Catherine the Great]] to her lover [[Grigory Potemkin]]. After 1801, with the incorporation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] into the [[Russian Empire]], various titles of numerous local nobles were controversially rendered in [[Russian language|Russian]] as \"kniazes\". Similarly, many petty Tatar nobles asserted their right to style themselves \"kniazes\" because they descended from [[Genghis Khan]].\n\nSee also \"[[Velikiy Knyaz]]\" article for more details.\n\nFinally, within the [[Russian Empire]] of 1809-1917, [[Finland]] was officially called ''[[Grand Duchy|Grand Principality]] of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]]'' ([[Finnish language|fi]] ''Suomen suuriruhtinaskunta'', [[Swedish language|sv]] ''Storfurstend\u00f6met Finland'', [[Russian language|ru]] ''Velikoye Knyazhestvo Finlyandskoye'').\n\n== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==\nAs noted above, the title ''knyaz'' or ''kniaz'' became a hereditary noble title in the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Following [[Union of Lublin|the union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], ''knia\u017a'' became a recognised title in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. By the 1630s - apart from the title ''pan'', which indicated membership of the large ''[[szlachta]]'' noble class \u2013 ''knia\u017a'' was the only hereditary title that was officially recognised and officially used in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Notable holders of the title ''knia\u017a'' include [[Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki]].\n\n==South Slavic countries==\n\nIn the 19th century, the Serbian term ''knez'' (\u043a\u043d\u0435\u0437) and the Bulgarian term ''knyaz'' (\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437) were revived to denote semi-independent rulers of those countries, such as [[Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia|Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] and [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Alexander of Battenberg]]. In parts of Serbia and western Bulgaria, ''knez'' was the informal title of the elder or mayor of a village or [[zadruga]] until around the 19th century.  Those are officially called ''\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043a'' (gradona\u010delnik) (Serbia) and ''\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043a'' (gradonachalnik) or ''\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442'' (kmet) (Bulgaria).\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n*Prior to Battenberg, the title ''knyaz'' was born by [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] during the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] (9th-10th century). At the height of his power, Simeon adopted the title of ''[[tsar]]'' (\"emperor\"), as did the Bulgarian rulers after the country became officially independent in 1908.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n*As of Bulgaria's independence in 1908, Knyaz [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] became Tsar Ferdinand, and the words ''knyaz'' and ''knyaginya'' began to be used instead for the tsar's children&nbsp;\u2013 the heir to the throne, for example, held the title ''Knyaz Tarnovski'' ([[Prince of Turnovo]]\").{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Bosnia===\nIn [[medieval Bosnia]] ''knez'' was title held by several of most powerful magnates (in Bosnia ''vlastelin'') of the era, sometime along with an office title given to person through service to the monarch, such as [[Grand Duke of Bosnia]], which was office of the supreme military commander of the realm.

Initially the term was used to denote the [[tribal chief|chieftain]] of a [[Slavic tribe]]. Later, with the development of feudal statehood, it became the title of a ruler of a state, and among East Slavs ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e}} (''kniazhestvo''), {{lang-uk|\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0456\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e}} (''knyazivstvo'') traditionally translated as [[duchy]] or [[principality]]), for example, of [[Kievan Rus']]. In medieval Latin sources the title was rendered as either ''[[King|rex]]'' or ''[[dux]]''. In [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] changed his title to knyaz after his conversion to Christianity, but his son [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon]] took the higher title of [[tsar]] soon in 913. In Kievan Rus', as the degree of centralization grew, the ruler acquired the title ''[[Velikii Knyaz]]'' (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c) (translated as [[Grand Prince]] or [[Grand Duke]], see [[Grand duke#Russian grand dukes|Russian Grand Dukes]]). He ruled a ''Velyke Knyazivstvo'' (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437i\u0432c\u0442\u0432\u043e) ([[Grand Duchy]]), while a ruler of its vassal constituent (''udel'', ''udelnoe knyazivstvo'' or ''[[volost]]'') was called ''udelny knyaz'' or simply ''knyaz''.\n\nWhen Kievan Rus' became fragmented in the 13th century, the title Kniaz continued to be used in [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] states, including [[Kiev]], [[Chernihiv]], [[Novgorod]], [[Pereiaslav]], [[Vladimir-Suzdal']], [[Muscovy]], [[Tver]], [[Halych-Volynia]], and in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>[http://www.speakrus.ru/starina/03.htm#\u0412\u0415\u041b\u0418\u041a\u0418\u0419%20\u041a\u041d\u042f\u0417\u042c \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c // \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439. \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044b (speakrus.ru) ]</ref>\n\n== Russia ==\n[[File:Kneaze Alexey Michailovitz.jpg|thumb|Kneaze Alexey Michailovitz, 1664 ([[Tsar]] [[Alexis I of Russia]]).]]\nAs the [[Tsardom of Russia]] gained dominion over much of former Kievan Rus', ''Velikii Kniaz'' (\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0301\u0437\u044c) (Great Kniaz) [[Ivan IV of Russia]] in 1547 was crowned as [[Tsar]]. From the mid-18th century onwards, the title Velikii Kniaz was revived to refer to (male-line) sons and grandsons of Russian Emperors. See [[Tsar#Titles for Tsar's family|titles for Tsar's family]] for details.\n\n''Kniaz'' ({{lang-ru|\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0301\u0437\u044c}}, {{IPA-ru|\u02c8kn\u02b2\u00e6s\u02b2|IPA}}) continued as a hereditary title of [[Russian nobility]] patrilineally descended from [[Rurik]] (e.g., [[Belozersky (surname)|Belozersky]], [[Belosselsky-Belozersky family|Belosselsky-Belozersky]], [[Repnin]], [[Gorchakov]]) or [[Gediminas]] (e.g., [[Galitzine]], [[Troubetzkoy]]). Members of [[Rurikid]] or [[Gedyminid]] families were called princes when they ruled tiny quasi-sovereign medieval principalities. After their demesnes were absorbed by Muscovy, they settled at the Moscow court and were authorised to continue with their princely titles.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, the title was occasionally granted by the Tsar, for the first time by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] to his associate [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]], and then by [[Catherine the Great]] to her lover [[Grigory Potemkin]]. After 1801, with the incorporation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] into the [[Russian Empire]], various titles of numerous local nobles were controversially rendered in [[Russian language|Russian]] as \"kniazes\". Similarly, many petty Tatar nobles asserted their right to style themselves \"kniazes\" because they descended from [[Genghis Khan]].\n\nSee also \"[[Velikiy Knyaz]]\" article for more details.\n\nFinally, within the [[Russian Empire]] of 1809-1917, [[Finland]] was officially called ''[[Grand Duchy|Grand Principality]] of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]]'' ([[Finnish language|fi]] ''Suomen suuriruhtinaskunta'', [[Swedish language|sv]] ''Storfurstend\u00f6met Finland'', [[Russian language|ru]] ''Velikoye Knyazhestvo Finlyandskoye'').\n\n== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==\nAs noted above, the title ''knyaz'' or ''kniaz'' became a hereditary noble title in the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Following [[Union of Lublin|the union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], ''knia\u017a'' became a recognised title in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. By the 1630s - apart from the title ''pan'', which indicated membership of the large ''[[szlachta]]'' noble class - ''knia\u017a'' was the only hereditary title that was officially recognised and officially used in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Notable holders of the title ''knia\u017a'' include [[Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki]].\n\n==South Slavic countries==\n\nIn the 19th century, the Serbian term ''knez'' (\u043a\u043d\u0435\u0437) and the Bulgarian term ''knyaz'' (\u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437) were revived to denote semi-independent rulers of those countries, such as [[Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia|Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] and [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Alexander of Battenberg]]. In parts of Serbia and western Bulgaria, ''knez'' was the informal title of the elder or mayor of a village or [[zadruga]] until around the 19th century.  Those are officially called ''\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043a'' (gradona\u010delnik) (Serbia) and ''\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043a'' (gradonachalnik) or ''\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442'' (kmet) (Bulgaria).\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n*Prior to Battenberg, the title ''knyaz'' was born by [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] during the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] (9th-10th century). At the height of his power, Simeon adopted the title of ''[[tsar]]'' (\"emperor\"), as did the Bulgarian rulers after the country became officially independent in 1908.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n*As of Bulgaria's independence in 1908, Knyaz [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] became Tsar Ferdinand, and the words ''knyaz'' and ''knyaginya'' began to be used instead for the tsar's children&nbsp;\u2013 the heir to the throne, for example, held the title ''Knyaz Tarnovski'' ([[Prince of Turnovo]]\").{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Bosnia===\nIn [[medieval Bosnia]] ''knez'' was title held by several of most powerful magnates (in Bosnia ''vlastelin'') of the era, sometime along with an office title given to person through service to the monarch, such as [[Grand Duke of Bosnia]], which was office of the supreme military commander of the realm. Other noble titles included the ''[[count]]'', the ''[[duke]]'' and the ''[[prince]]''.

It's believed that Holden Crater was formed by an impact during the [[Noachian]] or [[Hesperian]] periods.<ref name=\"Grant, J. 2008\">Grant, J. et al. 2008.

It is believed the lake waters originated from the crater walls/or groundwater.  Water from the crater walls may have come from precipitation when the Martian climate was different.  The upper unit formed when water that was ponded to the south in [[Uzboi Vallis]] broke through Holden's rim.<ref name=\"Grant, J. 2008\"/>   It is believed that great amount of water went through the rim; one flow was caused by  a body of water larger than Earth's [[Lake Huron]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003077_1530|title=HiRISE &#124; A Closer Look at Holden Crater (PSP_003077_1530)|website=hirise.lpl.arizona.edu}}</ref><ref>Grant, J. et al.  2010.

To transport such huge rocks takes a great deal of water.\n\nHolden is an old crater, containing numerous smaller craters, many of which are filled with sediment. The crater's central mountain is also obscured by sediment.\nHolden Crater was a proposed landing site for NASA's [[Mars Science Laboratory]], until [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] was deemed a better landing site.  Just to the north east of Holden Crater is [[Eberswalde Crater]] which contains a large delta.  The lower beds of Holden are thought by some to maybe similar to materials in Eberswalde Crater.<ref>Malin, M., K. Edgett.  2003.  Evidence for persistent flow and aqueous sedimentation on Mars.

It is named after American astronomer [[Edward Singleton Holden]].<ref>{{gpn|2540|Holden}}</ref>  It is part of the [[Uzboi-Landon-Morava (ULM)]] system.\n\n==Description==\nLike [[Gusev (crater on Mars)|Gusev]], it is notable for an outlet channel, [[Uzboi Vallis]], that runs into it, and for many features that seem to have been created by flowing water.  It's believed that Holden Crater was formed by an impact during the [[Noachian]] or [[Hesperian]] periods.<ref name=\"Grant, J. 2008\">Grant, J. et al. 2008.

Large alluvial fans on Mars.  Journal of Geophysical Research: 110, E04005.</ref>   The crater is of great interest to scientists because it has some of the best-exposed lake deposits.

Milliken (eds.)  2012.  Sedimentary Geology of Mars.  SEPM</ref> \n\nClays only form in the presence of water. There are two unit of sediments in the crater.  The lower unit formed in a large lake.  It is believed the lake waters originated from the crater walls/or groundwater.  Water from the crater walls may have come from precipitation when the Martian climate was different.  The upper unit formed when water that was ponded to the south in [[Uzboi Vallis]] broke through Holden's rim.<ref name=\"Grant, J. 2008\"/>   It is believed that great amount of water went through the rim; one flow was caused by  a body of water larger than Earth's [[Lake Huron]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003077_1530|title=HiRISE &#124; A Closer Look at Holden Crater (PSP_003077_1530)|website=hirise.lpl.arizona.edu}}</ref><ref>Grant, J. et al.  2010.  A lake in Uzboi Vallis and implications for late Noachian-Early Hesperian climate on Mars.  Icarus:  212, 110-122</ref>   Some of the evidence for such a large flow of water is the presence of boulders tens of meters in size sticking above the surface.  To transport such huge rocks takes a great deal of water.\n\nHolden is an old crater, containing numerous smaller craters, many of which are filled with sediment. The crater's central mountain is also obscured by sediment.\nHolden Crater was a proposed landing site for NASA's [[Mars Science Laboratory]], until [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] was deemed a better landing site.  Just to the north east of Holden Crater is [[Eberswalde Crater]] which contains a large delta.  The lower beds of Holden are thought by some to maybe similar to materials in Eberswalde Crater.<ref>Malin, M., K. Edgett.  2003.  Evidence for persistent flow and aqueous sedimentation on Mars.

{"title_page": "Camping", "text_new": "{{short description|Outdoor recreational activity}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Original research|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Night Campaign.jpg|thumb|Camping in the [[Bandarban district]] of [[Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]].]]\n[[File:After dinner, the boats headed to the nearbye shore with the hardy group that planned (and paid extra for) to spend the night in tents on shore not far from Brown station. (25882566932).jpg|thumb|Camping in Antarctica]]\n\n'''Camping''' is an [[outdoor activity]] involving overnight stays away from home in a shelter, such as a [[tent]] or a [[recreational vehicle]]. Typically participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment. To be regarded as \"camping\" a minimum of one night is spent outdoors, distinguishing it from day-tripping, picnicking, and other similarly short-term recreational activities. Camping can be enjoyed through all four seasons.\n\nLuxury may be an element, as in early 20th century African [[safari]]s, but including accommodations in fully equipped fixed structures such as high-end [[sporting camp]]s under the banner of \"camping\" blurs the line.\n\nCamping as a [[recreation]]al activity became popular among elites in the early 20th century. With time, it grew more democratic, and varied. Modern campers frequent [[protected area|publicly owned natural resources]] such as [[national park|national]] and [[state park]]s, [[wilderness area]]s, and commercial campgrounds. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations around the world, such as [[Scouting]], which use it to teach both self-reliance and teamwork.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Unidentified group of men camping.jpg|thumb|Camping in [[Ontario]], circa 1907]]\n\nCamping describes a range of activities and approaches to outdoor accommodation. [[Survivalist]] campers set off with as little as possible to get by, whereas [[recreational vehicle]] travelers arrive equipped with their own electricity, heat, and patio furniture. Camping may be combined with [[hiking]], as in [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and is often enjoyed in conjunction with other outdoor activities such as [[canoeing]], [[climbing]], [[fishing]], and [[hunting]]. [[Fastpacking]] involves both [[running]] and camping.\n\nThere is no universally held definition of what is and what is not camping. Just as with [[motel]]s which serve both recreational and business guests, the same campground may serve recreational campers, migrant workers, and homeless at the same time. Fundamentally, it reflects a combination of ''intent'' and the nature of activities involved.  A children's [[summer camp]] with dining hall meals and bunkhouse accommodations may have \"camp\" in its name but fails to reflect the spirit and form of \"camping\" as it is broadly understood. Similarly, a [[homelessness|homeless]] person's lifestyle may involve many common camping activities, such as sleeping out and preparing meals over a fire, but fails to reflect the elective nature and pursuit of spirit rejuvenation that are integral aspect of camping.  Likewise, cultures with itinerant lifestyles or lack of permanent dwellings cannot be said to be \"camping\", it is just their way of life.\n\n==History==\n{{Globalize|article|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=October 2013}}\n[[File:Thomas Hiram Holding.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hiram Holding]] outside his camping tent.]]\nThe history of recreational camping is often traced back to [[Thomas Hiram Holding]], a British travelling tailor, but it was actually first popularised in the UK on the [[river Thames]]. By the 1880s large numbers of visitors took part in the pastime, which was connected to the late Victorian craze for pleasure boating. The early camping equipment was very heavy, so it was convenient to transport it by boat or to use craft that converted into tents.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wenham |first=S. M. |url=http://www.oxoniensia.org |title=The River Thames and the Popularisation of Camping, 1860\u20131980 |date=2015 |work=[[Oxoniensia]] LXXX}}</ref> Although [[Thomas Hiram Holding]] is often seen as the father of modern camping in the UK, he was responsible for popularising a different type of camping in the early twentieth century. He experienced the activity in the wild from his youth, when he had spent much time with his parents traveling across the American prairies. Later he embarked on a cycling and camping tour with some friends across [[Ireland]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wills |first=Dixe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/16/campsites-outdoors-dixe-wills |title=Camping? It should be about the simple life |date=16 April 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=24 July 2011}}</ref> His book on his Ireland experience, ''Cycle and Camp in Connemara'' led to the formation of the first camping group in 1901, the Association of Cycle Campers, later to become the [[Camping and Caravanning Club]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269179/Thomas-Hiram-Holding |title=Thomas Hiram Holding |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |access-date=24 July 2011}}</ref> He wrote ''The Campers Handbook'' in 1908, so that he could share his enthusiasm for the great outdoors with the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp103685/thomas-hiram-holding |title=Thomas Hiram Holding |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery, London]] |access-date=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nPossibly the first commercial camping ground in the world was [[Cunningham's Camp Escalator|Cunningham's camp]], near [[Douglas, Isle of Man]], which opened in 1894. In 1906 the Association of Cycle Campers opened its first own camping site, in [[Weybridge]]. By that time the organization had several hundred members. In 1910 the Association was merged into the National Camping Club. Although WW1 was responsible for a certain hiatus in camping activity, the association received a new lease of life after the war when [[Sir Robert Baden-Powell]] (founder of the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts movement]]) became its president.\n\nIn the US, camping may be traced to [[William Henry Harrison Murray]] 1869 publication of ''Camp-Life in the Adirondacks'' resulting in a flood of visitors to the Adirondacks that summer.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Young |first=Terence |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/religious-roots-of-americas-love-for-camping-180965280/ |title=The Minister Who Invented Camping in America Read more |date=17 October 2017 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe International Federation of Camping Clubs (Federation Internationale de Camping et de Caravanning) was founded in 1932 with national clubs from all over the world affiliating with it. By the 1960s camping had become an established family holiday standard and today camp sites are ubiquitous across [[Europe]] and [[North America]].\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:Mt. Forbes bivy site; by North Glacier.jpg|thumb|Camping as part of mountaineering]]\nDifferent types camping may be named after their form of transportation, such as with [[Canoe camping]], car camping, \n[[Recreational vehicle|RVing]], and [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], which can involve [[Ultralight backpacking|ultralight]] gear. \n\nCamping is also labeled by lifestyle: [[Glamping]] (glamorous camping) combines camping with the luxury and amenities of a home or hotel,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2011/08/Go-glamping-in-the-Ohio-Wilds/49819754/1 |title='Glamping' brings creature comforts to outdoors |date=2011-08-04 |work=USA Today |access-date=2015-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206162540/http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2011/08/Go-glamping-in-the-Ohio-Wilds/49819754/1 |archive-date=December 6, 2013}}</ref> and has its roots are in the early 1900s European and American [[safari]]s in Africa. [[Workamping]] allows campers to trade their labor variously for discounts on campsite fees, campground utilities, and even some degree of pay. [[Migrant_worker|Migrant]] camps are formed not for recreation, but as a temporary housing arrangement. Campgrounds for [[custom harvesting|custom harvesters]] in the United States may include room to park combines and other large farm equipment.\n\nAnother way of describing camping is by the manner of arrangement: reservation camping vs. drop camping. Campgrounds may require campers to check in with an employee or campground host prior to setting up camp, or they may allow \"drop camping,\" where this is not required. Drop-in campsites may be free or a drop-box may be provided to accept payments on the [[Honor_system#Tourism|honor system]]. Although drop camping is often specifically allowed by law, it may also exist in a legal [[Loophole|grey area]], such as at California's [[Slab City]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EOERtAEACAAJ Slab City: Dispatches from the Last Free Place] by Charlie Hailey, MIT Press, 2018</ref> Social media-oriented towards drop camping provides information on recent police enforcement, campsite quality, cost, and length-of-stay requirements.\n\n==Campgrounds and commercial campsites==\n[[File:Trailer Camping Marmora KOA May 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Tent trailer]] camping provides comfort in a towable package]]\n\nCampers span a broad range of age, ability, and ruggedness, and [[campsite]]s are designed in many ways as well. Many campgrounds have sites with facilities such as fire rings, barbecue grills, utilities, shared bathrooms and laundry, as well as access to nearby recreational facilities, but not all campsites have similar levels of development. Campsites can range from a patch of dirt, to a level, paved pad with sewer and electricity. (For more information on facilities, see the campsite and [[RV park]] articles.)\n\nOther vehicles used for camping include motorcycles, touring bicycles, boats, canoes, [[pack animal]]s, and even [[bush planes]]; although [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] on foot is a popular alternative.\n[[File:Camping-car de type bus.JPG|thumb|A large [[recreational vehicle]] provides many amenities when camping.]]\nTent camping sites often cost less than campsites with full amenities, and most allow direct access by car. Some \"walk-in\" sites lie a short walk away from the nearest road, but do not require full backpacking equipment. Those who seek a rugged experience in the outdoors prefer to camp with only tents, or with no shelter at all (\"under the stars\").\n\n==By country==\n\n===United States===\nFrom 2012 to 2013, over 40 million Americans \u2013 14% of the United States population \u2013 went camping with a net loss{{clarify|date=March 2020}} of only 423,955 participants. According to an infographic produced by Red Rover Camping and based on data from the 2014 American Camper Report published by the Coleman Company, Inc. and the Outdoor Foundation, camping in the United States is gaining popularity after a fall of 4.2 million participants from 2011 to 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.outdoorfoundation.org/pdf/research.camping.2014.pdf |title=2014 American Camper Report |publisher=The Coleman Company, Inc. and the Outdoor Foundation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405060353/http://www.outdoorfoundation.org/pdf/research.camping.2014.pdf |archive-date=5 April 2015 |access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nAccording to data provided by the Great British Tourism Survey conducted by Visit England, almost 4.5 million camping and caravanning holidays were taken by British residents during the first half of 2015, for an average of 3.7 nights.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.visitengland.com/sites/default/files/gbts_june_2015_detailed_report_final_1.pdf |title=Great Britain Tourism Survey |date=June 2015 |publisher=VisitEngland |access-date=21 October 2015}}</ref> As in the United States, camping is gaining popularity, with an 8% increase in trips compared to the same period in 2014.\n\n===France===\nData collected by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale De L'H\u00f4tellerie De Plein Air (FNHPA) shows that around 113 million nights were taken at French campsites in 2015, which was up by 3.9% on the same period in 2014.

(25882566932).jpg|thumb|Camping in Antarctica]]\n\n'''Camping''' is an [[outdoor activity]] involving overnight stays away from home in a shelter, such as a [[tent]] or a [[recreational vehicle]]. Typically participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment. To be regarded as \"camping\" a minimum of one night is spent outdoors, distinguishing it from day-tripping, picnicking, and other similarly short-term recreational activities. Camping can be enjoyed through all four seasons.\n\nLuxury may be an element, as in early 20th century African [[safari]]s, but including accommodations in fully equipped fixed structures such as high-end [[sporting camp]]s under the banner of \"camping\" blurs the line.\n\nCamping as a [[recreation]]al activity became popular among elites in the early 20th century. With time, it grew more democratic, and varied. Modern campers frequent [[protected area|publicly owned natural resources]] such as [[national park|national]] and [[state park]]s, [[wilderness area]]s, and commercial campgrounds. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations around the world, such as [[Scouting]], which use it to teach both self-reliance and teamwork.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Unidentified group of men camping.jpg|thumb|Camping in [[Ontario]], circa 1907]]\n\nCamping describes a range of activities and approaches to outdoor accommodation. [[Survivalist]] campers set off with as little as possible to get by, whereas [[recreational vehicle]] travelers arrive equipped with their own electricity, heat, and patio furniture. Camping may be combined with [[hiking]], as in [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and is often enjoyed in conjunction with other outdoor activities such as [[canoeing]], [[climbing]], [[fishing]], and [[hunting]]. [[Fastpacking]] involves both [[running]] and camping.\n\nThere is no universally held definition of what is and what is not camping. Just as with [[motel]]s which serve both recreational and business guests, the same campground may serve recreational campers, migrant workers, and homeless at the same time. Fundamentally, it reflects a combination of ''intent'' and the nature of activities involved.  A children's [[summer camp]] with dining hall meals and bunkhouse accommodations may have \"camp\" in its name but fails to reflect the spirit and form of \"camping\" as it is broadly understood. Similarly, a [[homelessness|homeless]] person's lifestyle may involve many common camping activities, such as sleeping out and preparing meals over a fire, but fails to reflect the elective nature and pursuit of spirit rejuvenation that are integral aspect of camping.  Likewise, cultures with itinerant lifestyles or lack of permanent dwellings cannot be said to be \"camping\", it is just their way of life.\n\n==History==\n{{Globalize|article|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=October 2013}}\n[[File:Thomas Hiram Holding.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hiram Holding]] outside his camping tent.]]\nThe history of recreational camping is often traced back to [[Thomas Hiram Holding]], a British travelling tailor, but it was actually first popularised in the UK on the [[river Thames]]. By the 1880s large numbers of visitors took part in the pastime, which was connected to the late Victorian craze for pleasure boating. The early camping equipment was very heavy, so it was convenient to transport it by boat or to use craft that converted into tents.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wenham |first=S. M. |url=http://www.oxoniensia.org |title=The River Thames and the Popularisation of Camping, 1860\u20131980 |date=2015 |work=[[Oxoniensia]] LXXX}}</ref> Although [[Thomas Hiram Holding]] is often seen as the father of modern camping in the UK, he was responsible for popularising a different type of camping in the early twentieth century. He experienced the activity in the wild from his youth, when he had spent much time with his parents traveling across the American prairies. Later he embarked on a cycling and camping tour with some friends across [[Ireland]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wills |first=Dixe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/16/campsites-outdoors-dixe-wills |title=Camping?

In 1906 the Association of Cycle Campers opened its first own camping site, in [[Weybridge]]. By that time the organization had several hundred members. In 1910 the Association was merged into the National Camping Club. Although WW1 was responsible for a certain hiatus in camping activity, the association received a new lease of life after the war when [[Sir Robert Baden-Powell]] (founder of the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts movement]]) became its president.\n\nIn the US, camping may be traced to [[William Henry Harrison Murray]] 1869 publication of ''Camp-Life in the Adirondacks'' resulting in a flood of visitors to the Adirondacks that summer.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Young |first=Terence |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/religious-roots-of-americas-love-for-camping-180965280/ |title=The Minister Who Invented Camping in America Read more |date=17 October 2017 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe International Federation of Camping Clubs (Federation Internationale de Camping et de Caravanning) was founded in 1932 with national clubs from all over the world affiliating with it. By the 1960s camping had become an established family holiday standard and today camp sites are ubiquitous across [[Europe]] and [[North America]].\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:Mt. Forbes bivy site; by North Glacier.jpg|thumb|Camping as part of mountaineering]]\nDifferent types camping may be named after their form of transportation, such as with [[Canoe camping]], car camping, \n[[Recreational vehicle|RVing]], and [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], which can involve [[Ultralight backpacking|ultralight]] gear. \n\nCamping is also labeled by lifestyle: [[Glamping]] (glamorous camping) combines camping with the luxury and amenities of a home or hotel,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2011/08/Go-glamping-in-the-Ohio-Wilds/49819754/1 |title='Glamping' brings creature comforts to outdoors |date=2011-08-04 |work=USA Today |access-date=2015-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206162540/http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2011/08/Go-glamping-in-the-Ohio-Wilds/49819754/1 |archive-date=December 6, 2013}}</ref> and has its roots are in the early 1900s European and American [[safari]]s in Africa. [[Workamping]] allows campers to trade their labor variously for discounts on campsite fees, campground utilities, and even some degree of pay. [[Migrant_worker|Migrant]] camps are formed not for recreation, but as a temporary housing arrangement. Campgrounds for [[custom harvesting|custom harvesters]] in the United States may include room to park combines and other large farm equipment.\n\nAnother way of describing camping is by the manner of arrangement: reservation camping vs. drop camping. Campgrounds may require campers to check in with an employee or campground host prior to setting up camp, or they may allow \"drop camping,\" where this is not required. Drop-in campsites may be free or a drop-box may be provided to accept payments on the [[Honor_system#Tourism|honor system]]. Although drop camping is often specifically allowed by law, it may also exist in a legal [[Loophole|grey area]], such as at California's [[Slab City]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EOERtAEACAAJ Slab City: Dispatches from the Last Free Place] by Charlie Hailey, MIT Press, 2018</ref> Social media-oriented towards drop camping provides information on recent police enforcement, campsite quality, cost, and length-of-stay requirements.\n\n==Campgrounds and commercial campsites==\n[[File:Trailer Camping Marmora KOA May 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Tent trailer]] camping provides comfort in a towable package]]\n\nCampers span a broad range of age, ability, and ruggedness, and [[campsite]]s are designed in many ways as well. Many campgrounds have sites with facilities such as fire rings, barbecue grills, utilities, shared bathrooms and laundry, as well as access to nearby recreational facilities, but not all campsites have similar levels of development. Campsites can range from a patch of dirt, to a level, paved pad with sewer and electricity. (For more information on facilities, see the campsite and [[RV park]] articles.)\n\nOther vehicles used for camping include motorcycles, touring bicycles, boats, canoes, [[pack animal]]s, and even [[bush planes]]; although [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] on foot is a popular alternative.\n[[File:Camping-car de type bus.JPG|thumb|A large [[recreational vehicle]] provides many amenities when camping.]]\nTent camping sites often cost less than campsites with full amenities, and most allow direct access by car. Some \"walk-in\" sites lie a short walk away from the nearest road, but do not require full backpacking equipment. Those who seek a rugged experience in the outdoors prefer to camp with only tents, or with no shelter at all (\"under the stars\").\n\n==By country==\n\n===United States===\nFrom 2012 to 2013, over 40 million Americans \u2013 14% of the United States population \u2013 went camping with a net loss{{clarify|date=March 2020}} of only 423,955 participants.

In his [[1996 Formula One season|debut season]], Villeneuve challenged teammate Hill for the title, winning four races and taking the fight to the final round in [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], where Villeneuve retired and Hill won the race and the title. Villeneuve, however, did win the following year's title, this time challenging [[Michael Schumacher]] and once again taking it to the final round in [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]], where Schumacher retired after [[Michael Schumacher#Championship-deciding collisions|the two collided]]. 1997 would be the last year in which Villeneuve would win a championship level race and finish the season in the top three. For [[1998 Formula One season|1998]], Villeneuve's Williams team had to fare with less competitive [[Mecachrome]] engines, and Villeneuve moved to the newly formed [[British American Racing]] team in [[1999 Formula One season|1999]]. He stayed there for the next four seasons but, following poor results he was replaced by former [[BRDC British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula Three Champion]] [[Takuma Sato]]. Villeneuve also drove for [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] at the end of [[2004 Formula One season|2004]], and [[Sauber]] in the [[2005 Formula One season|2005 season]] and eleven races of the [[2006 Formula One season|2006 season]] before suffering an injury in [[2006 German Grand Prix|Germany]]. Villeneuve was replaced by [[Robert Kubica]] and soon BMW and Villeneuve parted company.\n\nOutside Formula One, Villeneuve has taken on several new careers: in sportscar racing, racing for [[Peugeot]] in the [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|2007]] and [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans|2008]] [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], jumping to NASCAR in August 2007 and racing as an invited driver in the Argentinian [[TRV6|Top Race V6]] series and the Australian-based [[V8 Supercars|International V8 Supercars Championship]]. As a musician, he has released an album titled ''Private Paradise''.\n\nVilleneuve was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in 1998.\n\nVilleneuve remains the last racing driver to have won [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One]] and [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART IndyCar]] double driver titles to date.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n==Personal and early life==\nVilleneuve was born in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], Quebec, to aspiring [[Formula One]] driver [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and his wife Joann and raised in [[Monaco]].<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\">Collings and Edworthy, pg 272</ref> He has a sister Melanie and a [[Siblings#Half sibling|half sister]] Jessica.

Villeneuve's course lasted three days and in that time he demonstrated a great amount of concentration for a boy of his age.<ref name=\"JV World Bio Page 1\" /> At the end of his course, the young Canadian received his diploma and chief instructor Gilbert Pednault declared Villeneuve as the best student he'd ever seen.<ref name=\"JV World Bio Page 1\" /> During the summer of 1987, Villeneuve attended a racing school set up by former instructor [[Richard Spenard]].

Daniel Desmarais acted as Jacques' facilitator during his season in Japan. \n\nVilleneuve soon received an invitation from [[Craig Pollock]] to compete as a one-off in the [[Circuit Trois-Rivi\u00e8res|Trois Rivi\u00e8res]] [[Formula Atlantic]] race, Villeneuve finished the race third and Pollock was impressed by Villeneuve, leading him to arrange for him to race in the North American [[Toyota Atlantic]] series for the upcoming season.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\nDuring the 1993 season, Villeneuve took seven [[pole positions]] and five race victories from the 15 races.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" /> However, a few crucial driving errors cost him the series title and so finished his debut season third in the standings.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\n===CART IndyCar World Series===\n[[File:Villeneuve 500.jpg|thumb|Villeneuve's [[1995 Indianapolis 500]]-winning car.]]\nHis Forsythe-Green team took Villeneuve up a level into the [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] championship in 1994. In his first year, Villeneuve came second at [[1994 Indianapolis 500|that year's Indianapolis 500]] and won his first race at [[Road America]], the circuit where his uncle had become the first Canadian to win a CART race nine years before. Villeneuve finished the season in sixth position; 131 points behind champion [[Al Unser Jr.]] and also taking the [[Champ Car|Rookie of the Year]] award.\n\nVilleneuve started the 1995 campaign strongly, winning the first race on the streets of Miami. Along with the win in Miami came three other victories, the most significant of which came at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] for the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]]. Despite a mid-race two lap penalty, Villeneuve fought his way back up through the field. Running second with less than 10 laps to go, Villeneuve claimed the lead from fellow Canadian [[Scott Goodyear]] after Goodyear was penalized for having passed the pace-car before the restart. With Goodyear out of the picture Villeneuve went on to win the race by two seconds over Brazilian [[Christian Fittipaldi]].\n\nHis performances, as well as his family name, brought him to the attention of [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]], Managerial Director of the [[WilliamsF1|Williams Grand Prix team]]. Williams signed him to his [[Formula One]] team for [[1996 Formula One season|1996]] and Villeneuve began testing the Williams F1 car in 1995 after the IndyCar season. Villeneuve was the last CART IndyCar World Series champion before the 1996 CART/IRL split created two rival series: The [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) and the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve wins series title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o90jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9ywEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3486,648292&dq=jacques+villeneuve&hl=en|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=September 11, 1995|page=78}}</ref>\n\n===Formula One===\n\n====Williams====\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1996.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] Formula One team at the 1996 [[Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1996\n\nVilleneuve signed a two-year contract with Williams with an option year available.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" /> Villeneuve impressed during his debut race in [[1996 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], taking pole position and almost won the race. But due to an oil leak, Villeneuve was forced to slow down and allow teammate [[Damon Hill]] to pass and take victory at the opening round of the Championship. The Canadian, however, did manage to hold onto second place. It would be another 11 years before another driver finished on the podium on his debut, which was [[Lewis Hamilton]] at the [[2007 Australian Grand Prix]].\n\nFour rounds into the season, Villeneuve won his first Formula One race at the [[1996 European Grand Prix|N\u00fcrburgring]]. Villeneuve won a further three races and managed to take the title fight to the final round at [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]]. The Canadian and teammate [[Damon Hill]] were the only drivers who could win the title, but with a gap of nine points between the two prior to the final race, his chances of winning the title were slim. In the end, Hill won the race, and the championship, while Villeneuve retired on lap 37 after his right-rear wheel came off.\n\nHaving won 4 races in his debut season, Villeneuve took the [[List of Formula One driver records|record]] for most wins for a rookie. He also became the rookie in Formula One history to finish second in the championship. Both records were later equaled by [[Lewis Hamilton]] in {{F1|2007}}.\n\n;1997\n\n[[Damon Hill]] was dropped by Williams for the {{F1|1997}} season, making Villeneuve the team's lead driver. [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was brought in to replace Hill. Villeneuve once again challenged for the title, but instead of Hill, the Canadian found himself battling with then double World Champion [[Michael Schumacher]].\n\n[[David Coulthard]] took the opening race win in Australia but Villeneuve took the next two wins in Brazil and Argentina. Five more victories came that season at the Spanish, British, Hungarian, Austrian and Luxembourg Grand Prix, as well as ten pole positions. His main rival, [[Michael Schumacher|Michael Schumacher,]] had five wins of his own to set up a showdown at the final race of the season.\n\nIn Suzuka, the penultimate race of the season, Villeneuve started on pole but was relegated to the back of the grid after ignoring yellow flags during Saturday practice. An appeal by Williams saw his position reinstated. Villeneuve finished 5th but was disqualified from the race leaving Schumacher leading the Drivers' Championship by one point.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve Awaits Ruling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/14/sports/plus-auto-racing-villeneuve-awaits-ruling.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 14, 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe title went down to the final round in [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]]. Villeneuve came out as the Drivers World Champion in only his second season. But the race was remembered for a highly controversial collision between himself and title rival [[Michael Schumacher]]. As Villeneuve passed Schumacher at the ''Dry Sac'' corner on the 48th lap, the German turned into the Canadian's car; leaving Villeneuve with a damaged sidepod. Villeneuve recovered however and took third place while Schumacher retired. The FIA deemed Schumachers actions deliberate and thus disqualified him from the Championship.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/1997/drivers.html|title=1997 Driver Standings|work=Formula1.com|accessdate=April 16, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1998 Italy.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for Williams at the [[1998 Italian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1998\nVilleneuve's career went into sharp decline following his World Championship title. Remaining with Williams in {{f1|1998}} (and becoming the first Williams driver since [[Keke Rosberg]] in {{f1|1982}} to stay with the team for his title defense), he struggled with an underpowered [[Mecachrome]] engine which were basically rebadged [[Renault F1|Renault]] V10 engines from the previous season that despite some development had been overtaken in power by both Ferrari and the [[Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines|Mercedes-Benz]] powered [[McLaren]]s. He failed to win a single race (like Hill the previous season), although he did finish on the podium twice in [[1998 German Grand Prix|Germany]] and [[1998 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. Villeneuve finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship with 21 points, 79 points behind Champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] in the McLaren-Mercedes.\n\n====British American Racing====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1999 Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for BAR in the team's first season, at the [[1999 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1999\nIn [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], Villeneuve joined the newly founded [[British American Racing]] (BAR) team, co-founded and partly owned by Villeneuve's personal manager, [[Craig Pollock]], and by [[Adrian Reynard]]. Joining him as his teammate was Brazilian [[Ricardo Zonta]]. There was a lot of media hype about the new squad, but despite the high expectations, BAR had a poor season, retiring from the first eleven races of the season and not scoring a single Championship point. At times the car showed a promising pace, with Villeneuve running in third place at Barcelona, but often technical problems ruined his chances. Villeneuve suffered a high speed crash during practice at the {{F1 GP|1999|Belgian}} at the Eau Rouge corner, from which he emerged unharmed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Motor racing: Villeneuve plays down his brush with disaster|first=David|last=Tremayne|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-villeneuve-plays-down-his-brush-with-disaster-1118201.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=August 29, 1999}}</ref>\n\n;2000\n\nDespite the lack of a competitive car in 1999, Villeneuve remained loyal to Pollock's team, as did Zonta. The [[Supertec]] engines of the previous season were replaced by [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] engines, and the new BAR-Honda package proved to be more competitive, with Villeneuve finishing in the points on seven different occasions and almost securing a podium finish at the [[2000 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]].\n\n;2001\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2001 Canada 2.jpg|thumb|left|Villeneuve driving for BAR at the [[2001 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nZonta left BAR in [[2001 Formula One season|2001]] to join [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] as a test driver. Zonta was replaced by experienced [[France|Frenchman]] [[Olivier Panis]]. Villeneuve was involved in a crash at the [[2001 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], the first race of the season, when he hit the back of [[Ralf Schumacher]]'s Williams. A track marshal was killed when a stray tyre hit him in the chest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve's Crash Debris Kills Track Official : Schumacher Captures Australian Grand Prix|first=Brad|last=Spurgeon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/05/sports/05iht-prix.2.t_0.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 5, 2001}}</ref> Villeneuve scored five points less than the previous season, but finished on the podium twice in [[2001 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and [[2001 German Grand Prix|Germany]].

The BAR 004 proved to be a much less competitive car than the teams' previous two, with neither Villeneuve or Panis scoring points consistently with only seven points scored between them, Villeneuve scoring four points to Panis's three.\n\n;2003\n\n[[File:Villeneuve BAR USGP 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for BAR at the [[2003 United States Grand Prix]]. Villeneuve retired from the race ten laps from the finish with an engine problem.]]\n\nWith one year left to run on his contract Villeneuve turned down a lucrative offer to spend a season racing in CART before returning to BAR for 2004 and 2005, a deal which Villeneuve claimed was spoken about but never actually produced for him to sign. Instead, he decided that he would see out his present deal in the hope of landing a role at another Grand Prix team the following year. Villeneuve was joined by [[Jenson Button]] from [[Renault F1|Renault]] in [[2003 Formula One season|2003]] as Panis was offered a position at [[Toyota F1|Toyota]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve rejects CART return|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2220045.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=August 27, 2002}}</ref> Button would prove to become the second of Villeneuve's teammates to outscore him in the Drivers' Championship as, unlike Villeneuve, Button was able to score consistently with the BAR 005, finishing in the points every two races on average.\n\nVilleneuve was criticized by the media for being outpaced by his inexperienced teammate and before the final round in [[2003 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]; he was replaced by former [[British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula 3]] Champion [[Takuma Sato]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sato replaces Villeneuve|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3167332.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=October 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n====Renault====\nWith no contract for 2004, Villeneuve was forced to take a sabbatical, but maintained that he wanted to return to the sport. He continued training and made a special appearance at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] driving his late father's Ferrari. In September, Villeneuve returned to Formula One, driving the final three Grands Prix of the season for the French [[Renault F1|Renault]] team. [[Jarno Trulli]] had fallen out of favour and team boss [[Flavio Briatore]] felt Villeneuve would be worth a gamble.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renault hand Villeneuve an F1 lifeline|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/sports/2004/sep/15f1.htm|publisher=rediff sports|accessdate=September 15, 2004}}</ref> Although vowing to help Renault achieve second place in the Constructors' Championship, ahead of his former team BAR, Villeneuve failed to score a single point, unable to finish any of his races on the lead lap; Renault settled for third in the final standings. Villeneuve admitted that the enforced lay-off had cost him vital seat time. With the cars so much faster than in 2003, he found it difficult to adapt, and with an up-and-coming [[Fernando Alonso]] as teammate his task was made all the more difficult. Just before his 3-race Renault comeback, Villeneuve signed a two-year contract to drive for [[Sauber]], starting in [[2005 Formula One season|2005]].<ref>[http://xserve2.com/ns/ns13501.html GrandPrix.com&nbsp;\u2013 Sauber announces Villeneuve deal&nbsp;\u2013 15 Sept. 2004]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Sauber====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2005 Canada 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Villeneuve driving for [[Sauber]] at the [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n;2005\nHis Sauber debut at the [[2005 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] saw him start on the grid in fourth position, although he would finish the race nine places down the order in thirteenth and a lap down. For the opening three races he was the slowest driver on [[Michelin]] tyres, and rumors began to spread that he would soon be replaced. The rumors proved unfounded, and at [[2005 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] he scored his first points for the team with a fourth place. The pressure was soon back on him when he forced teammate [[Felipe Massa]] off the track when attempting to overtake the Brazilian in [[2005 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], ruining both their races.\nTowards the end of the season, his pace improved and he scored more points at Belgium, where he finished sixth, moving ahead of Massa in the championship tables, although Massa repassed him after finishing 6th in the season finale in China. In terms of speed, the two teammates were fairly evenly matched by the end of the year. Massa was later drafted into [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to support Michael Schumacher's 2006 campaign.\n\nAfter much uncertainty, in late 2005 BMW confirmed that Villeneuve would race for BMW Sauber in 2006. GP2 frontrunner [[Heikki Kovalainen]] and [[Indy Racing League|Indycar]] champion [[Dan Wheldon]] had both been linked with the seat, but BMW opted to honour Villeneuve's contract; to cut the contract would possibly have been an expensive exercise that would have cost them around [[United States dollar|$]]2 million, and Villeneuve was popular with the sponsors and team personnel.\n\n;2006\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve Canada 2006.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Villeneuve at the [[2006 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nSeveral changes were made at Sauber during the off season. First, the Swiss team were bought by [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]] and renamed BMW Sauber. The German manufacturer wished to start their own works team following a six-year partnership with Villeneuve's former employers Williams. In addition, Massa left Sauber for the vacant role left by [[Rubens Barrichello]] at [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Nick Heidfeld]] was brought in to replace him. Villeneuve scored seven points during the first twelve rounds of the season. But at the [[2006 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], Villeneuve had allegedly sustained an injury in a crash on lap 31.<ref name=\"Kubica replaces Villeneuve\">{{cite news | title=Kubica replaces Villeneuve | publisher=GrandPrix.com | date= August 1, 2006 | url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17241.html | accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Villeneuve Germany2006.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Villeneuve walks away from his crashed [[BMW Sauber F1.06|F1.06]] at the [[2006 German Grand Prix]], his last F1 race.]]\n\nAfter replacing Villeneuve in [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], test driver [[Robert Kubica]] drove to a solid seventh place, despite the chaotic wet conditions, but was later disqualified because his car was too light.

Villeneuve won the [[1995 PPG Indy Car World Series|1995]] [[Champ Car|CART]] Championship, the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|1995]] [[Indianapolis 500]] and the [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] [[Formula One]] World Championship, making him only the third driver after [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] to achieve such a feat. {{As of|2019}}, no other Canadian has won the Indianapolis 500 or the Formula One Drivers' title.\n\nFollowing two successful years in [[Champ Car|CART]], Villeneuve moved into [[Formula One]] with the front-running [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] team, alongside [[Damon Hill]]. In his [[1996 Formula One season|debut season]], Villeneuve challenged teammate Hill for the title, winning four races and taking the fight to the final round in [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], where Villeneuve retired and Hill won the race and the title. Villeneuve, however, did win the following year's title, this time challenging [[Michael Schumacher]] and once again taking it to the final round in [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]], where Schumacher retired after [[Michael Schumacher#Championship-deciding collisions|the two collided]]. 1997 would be the last year in which Villeneuve would win a championship level race and finish the season in the top three. For [[1998 Formula One season|1998]], Villeneuve's Williams team had to fare with less competitive [[Mecachrome]] engines, and Villeneuve moved to the newly formed [[British American Racing]] team in [[1999 Formula One season|1999]]. He stayed there for the next four seasons but, following poor results he was replaced by former [[BRDC British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula Three Champion]] [[Takuma Sato]]. Villeneuve also drove for [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] at the end of [[2004 Formula One season|2004]], and [[Sauber]] in the [[2005 Formula One season|2005 season]] and eleven races of the [[2006 Formula One season|2006 season]] before suffering an injury in [[2006 German Grand Prix|Germany]]. Villeneuve was replaced by [[Robert Kubica]] and soon BMW and Villeneuve parted company.\n\nOutside Formula One, Villeneuve has taken on several new careers: in sportscar racing, racing for [[Peugeot]] in the [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|2007]] and [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans|2008]] [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], jumping to NASCAR in August 2007 and racing as an invited driver in the Argentinian [[TRV6|Top Race V6]] series and the Australian-based [[V8 Supercars|International V8 Supercars Championship]]. As a musician, he has released an album titled ''Private Paradise''.\n\nVilleneuve was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in 1998.\n\nVilleneuve remains the last racing driver to have won [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One]] and [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART IndyCar]] double driver titles to date.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n==Personal and early life==\nVilleneuve was born in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], Quebec, to aspiring [[Formula One]] driver [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and his wife Joann and raised in [[Monaco]].<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\">Collings and Edworthy, pg 272</ref> He has a sister Melanie and a [[Siblings#Half sibling|half sister]] Jessica.

When Villeneuve was eleven years old, his father was killed during the qualifying session for the [[1982 Belgian Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit Zolder|Zolder]] following a collision with [[Jochen Mass]].\n\nVilleneuve was engaged to Australian singer [[Dannii Minogue]] in the late 1990s and was once engaged to American ballerina Ellen Green. He married his Parisienne girlfriend Johanna Martinez on May 29, 2006, at a civil ceremony in Switzerland. After the ceremony, it was announced the Villeneuves were expecting a baby in November.

Daniel Desmarais acted as Jacques' facilitator during his season in Japan. \n\nVilleneuve soon received an invitation from [[Craig Pollock]] to compete as a one-off in the [[Circuit Trois-Rivi\u00e8res|Trois Rivi\u00e8res]] [[Formula Atlantic]] race, Villeneuve finished the race third and Pollock was impressed by Villeneuve, leading him to arrange for him to race in the North American [[Toyota Atlantic]] series for the upcoming season.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\nDuring the 1993 season, Villeneuve took seven [[pole positions]] and five race victories from the 15 races.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" /> However, a few crucial driving errors cost him the series title and so finished his debut season third in the standings.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\n===CART IndyCar World Series===\n[[File:Villeneuve 500.jpg|thumb|Villeneuve's [[1995 Indianapolis 500]]-winning car.]]\nHis Forsythe-Green team took Villeneuve up a level into the [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] championship in 1994. In his first year, Villeneuve came second at [[1994 Indianapolis 500|that year's Indianapolis 500]] and won his first race at [[Road America]], the circuit where his uncle had become the first Canadian to win a CART race nine years before. Villeneuve finished the season in sixth position; 131 points behind champion [[Al Unser Jr.]] and also taking the [[Champ Car|Rookie of the Year]] award.\n\nVilleneuve started the 1995 campaign strongly, winning the first race on the streets of Miami. Along with the win in Miami came three other victories, the most significant of which came at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] for the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]]. Despite a mid-race two lap penalty, Villeneuve fought his way back up through the field. Running second with less than 10 laps to go, Villeneuve claimed the lead from fellow Canadian [[Scott Goodyear]] after Goodyear was penalized for having passed the pace-car before the restart. With Goodyear out of the picture Villeneuve went on to win the race by two seconds over Brazilian [[Christian Fittipaldi]].\n\nHis performances, as well as his family name, brought him to the attention of [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]], Managerial Director of the [[WilliamsF1|Williams Grand Prix team]]. Williams signed him to his [[Formula One]] team for [[1996 Formula One season|1996]] and Villeneuve began testing the Williams F1 car in 1995 after the IndyCar season. Villeneuve was the last CART IndyCar World Series champion before the 1996 CART/IRL split created two rival series: The [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) and the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve wins series title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o90jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9ywEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3486,648292&dq=jacques+villeneuve&hl=en|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=September 11, 1995|page=78}}</ref>\n\n===Formula One===\n\n====Williams====\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1996.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] Formula One team at the 1996 [[Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1996\n\nVilleneuve signed a two-year contract with Williams with an option year available.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" /> Villeneuve impressed during his debut race in [[1996 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], taking pole position and almost won the race. But due to an oil leak, Villeneuve was forced to slow down and allow teammate [[Damon Hill]] to pass and take victory at the opening round of the Championship. The Canadian, however, did manage to hold onto second place. It would be another 11 years before another driver finished on the podium on his debut, which was [[Lewis Hamilton]] at the [[2007 Australian Grand Prix]].\n\nFour rounds into the season, Villeneuve won his first Formula One race at the [[1996 European Grand Prix|N\u00fcrburgring]]. Villeneuve won a further three races and managed to take the title fight to the final round at [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]]. The Canadian and teammate [[Damon Hill]] were the only drivers who could win the title, but with a gap of nine points between the two prior to the final race, his chances of winning the title were slim. In the end, Hill won the race, and the championship, while Villeneuve retired on lap 37 after his right-rear wheel came off.\n\nHaving won 4 races in his debut season, Villeneuve took the [[List of Formula One driver records|record]] for most wins for a rookie. He also became the rookie in Formula One history to finish second in the championship. Both records were later equaled by [[Lewis Hamilton]] in {{F1|2007}}.\n\n;1997\n\n[[Damon Hill]] was dropped by Williams for the {{F1|1997}} season, making Villeneuve the team's lead driver. [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was brought in to replace Hill. Villeneuve once again challenged for the title, but instead of Hill, the Canadian found himself battling with then double World Champion [[Michael Schumacher]].\n\n[[David Coulthard]] took the opening race win in Australia but Villeneuve took the next two wins in Brazil and Argentina. Five more victories came that season at the Spanish, British, Hungarian, Austrian and Luxembourg Grand Prix, as well as ten pole positions. His main rival, [[Michael Schumacher|Michael Schumacher,]] had five wins of his own to set up a showdown at the final race of the season.\n\nIn Suzuka, the penultimate race of the season, Villeneuve started on pole but was relegated to the back of the grid after ignoring yellow flags during Saturday practice. An appeal by Williams saw his position reinstated. Villeneuve finished 5th but was disqualified from the race leaving Schumacher leading the Drivers' Championship by one point.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve Awaits Ruling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/14/sports/plus-auto-racing-villeneuve-awaits-ruling.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 14, 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe title went down to the final round in [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]]. Villeneuve came out as the Drivers World Champion in only his second season. But the race was remembered for a highly controversial collision between himself and title rival [[Michael Schumacher]]. As Villeneuve passed Schumacher at the ''Dry Sac'' corner on the 48th lap, the German turned into the Canadian's car; leaving Villeneuve with a damaged sidepod. Villeneuve recovered however and took third place while Schumacher retired. The FIA deemed Schumachers actions deliberate and thus disqualified him from the Championship.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/1997/drivers.html|title=1997 Driver Standings|work=Formula1.com|accessdate=April 16, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1998 Italy.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for Williams at the [[1998 Italian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1998\nVilleneuve's career went into sharp decline following his World Championship title. Remaining with Williams in {{f1|1998}} (and becoming the first Williams driver since [[Keke Rosberg]] in {{f1|1982}} to stay with the team for his title defense), he struggled with an underpowered [[Mecachrome]] engine which were basically rebadged [[Renault F1|Renault]] V10 engines from the previous season that despite some development had been overtaken in power by both Ferrari and the [[Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines|Mercedes-Benz]] powered [[McLaren]]s. He failed to win a single race (like Hill the previous season), although he did finish on the podium twice in [[1998 German Grand Prix|Germany]] and [[1998 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. Villeneuve finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship with 21 points, 79 points behind Champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] in the McLaren-Mercedes.\n\n====British American Racing====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1999 Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for BAR in the team's first season, at the [[1999 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1999\nIn [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], Villeneuve joined the newly founded [[British American Racing]] (BAR) team, co-founded and partly owned by Villeneuve's personal manager, [[Craig Pollock]], and by [[Adrian Reynard]]. Joining him as his teammate was Brazilian [[Ricardo Zonta]]. There was a lot of media hype about the new squad, but despite the high expectations, BAR had a poor season, retiring from the first eleven races of the season and not scoring a single Championship point. At times the car showed a promising pace, with Villeneuve running in third place at Barcelona, but often technical problems ruined his chances. Villeneuve suffered a high speed crash during practice at the {{F1 GP|1999|Belgian}} at the Eau Rouge corner, from which he emerged unharmed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Motor racing: Villeneuve plays down his brush with disaster|first=David|last=Tremayne|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-villeneuve-plays-down-his-brush-with-disaster-1118201.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=August 29, 1999}}</ref>\n\n;2000\n\nDespite the lack of a competitive car in 1999, Villeneuve remained loyal to Pollock's team, as did Zonta. The [[Supertec]] engines of the previous season were replaced by [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] engines, and the new BAR-Honda package proved to be more competitive, with Villeneuve finishing in the points on seven different occasions and almost securing a podium finish at the [[2000 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]].\n\n;2001\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2001 Canada 2.jpg|thumb|left|Villeneuve driving for BAR at the [[2001 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nZonta left BAR in [[2001 Formula One season|2001]] to join [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] as a test driver. Zonta was replaced by experienced [[France|Frenchman]] [[Olivier Panis]]. Villeneuve was involved in a crash at the [[2001 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], the first race of the season, when he hit the back of [[Ralf Schumacher]]'s Williams. A track marshal was killed when a stray tyre hit him in the chest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve's Crash Debris Kills Track Official : Schumacher Captures Australian Grand Prix|first=Brad|last=Spurgeon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/05/sports/05iht-prix.2.t_0.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 5, 2001}}</ref> Villeneuve scored five points less than the previous season, but finished on the podium twice in [[2001 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and [[2001 German Grand Prix|Germany]]. The latter was the final podium finish of his Grand Prix career.\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2002.jpg|right|thumb|Villeneuve in 2002.]]\n\n;2002\n\nPollock was removed from his post as team manager in 2002 and was replaced by [[Prodrive]] boss [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]]. Along with Pollock, Richards removed Technical Director [[Malcolm Oastler]] and fifty members of staff at BAR.<ref name=\"F1 Rejects Sec 12\">[[F1 Rejects]], Paragraph 24</ref> Richards soon began to debate over Villeneuve's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]15 million annual salary.<ref name=\"F1 Rejects Sec 12\" /> From this point on, Villeneuve felt less comfortable at the team. The BAR 004 proved to be a much less competitive car than the teams' previous two, with neither Villeneuve or Panis scoring points consistently with only seven points scored between them, Villeneuve scoring four points to Panis's three.\n\n;2003\n\n[[File:Villeneuve BAR USGP 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for BAR at the [[2003 United States Grand Prix]]. Villeneuve retired from the race ten laps from the finish with an engine problem.]]\n\nWith one year left to run on his contract Villeneuve turned down a lucrative offer to spend a season racing in CART before returning to BAR for 2004 and 2005, a deal which Villeneuve claimed was spoken about but never actually produced for him to sign. Instead, he decided that he would see out his present deal in the hope of landing a role at another Grand Prix team the following year. Villeneuve was joined by [[Jenson Button]] from [[Renault F1|Renault]] in [[2003 Formula One season|2003]] as Panis was offered a position at [[Toyota F1|Toyota]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve rejects CART return|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2220045.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=August 27, 2002}}</ref> Button would prove to become the second of Villeneuve's teammates to outscore him in the Drivers' Championship as, unlike Villeneuve, Button was able to score consistently with the BAR 005, finishing in the points every two races on average.\n\nVilleneuve was criticized by the media for being outpaced by his inexperienced teammate and before the final round in [[2003 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]; he was replaced by former [[British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula 3]] Champion [[Takuma Sato]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sato replaces Villeneuve|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3167332.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=October 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n====Renault====\nWith no contract for 2004, Villeneuve was forced to take a sabbatical, but maintained that he wanted to return to the sport. He continued training and made a special appearance at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] driving his late father's Ferrari. In September, Villeneuve returned to Formula One, driving the final three Grands Prix of the season for the French [[Renault F1|Renault]] team. [[Jarno Trulli]] had fallen out of favour and team boss [[Flavio Briatore]] felt Villeneuve would be worth a gamble.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renault hand Villeneuve an F1 lifeline|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/sports/2004/sep/15f1.htm|publisher=rediff sports|accessdate=September 15, 2004}}</ref> Although vowing to help Renault achieve second place in the Constructors' Championship, ahead of his former team BAR, Villeneuve failed to score a single point, unable to finish any of his races on the lead lap; Renault settled for third in the final standings. Villeneuve admitted that the enforced lay-off had cost him vital seat time. With the cars so much faster than in 2003, he found it difficult to adapt, and with an up-and-coming [[Fernando Alonso]] as teammate his task was made all the more difficult. Just before his 3-race Renault comeback, Villeneuve signed a two-year contract to drive for [[Sauber]], starting in [[2005 Formula One season|2005]].<ref>[http://xserve2.com/ns/ns13501.html GrandPrix.com&nbsp;\u2013 Sauber announces Villeneuve deal&nbsp;\u2013 15 Sept. 2004]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Sauber====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2005 Canada 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Villeneuve driving for [[Sauber]] at the [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n;2005\nHis Sauber debut at the [[2005 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] saw him start on the grid in fourth position, although he would finish the race nine places down the order in thirteenth and a lap down. For the opening three races he was the slowest driver on [[Michelin]] tyres, and rumors began to spread that he would soon be replaced. The rumors proved unfounded, and at [[2005 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] he scored his first points for the team with a fourth place. The pressure was soon back on him when he forced teammate [[Felipe Massa]] off the track when attempting to overtake the Brazilian in [[2005 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], ruining both their races.\nTowards the end of the season, his pace improved and he scored more points at Belgium, where he finished sixth, moving ahead of Massa in the championship tables, although Massa repassed him after finishing 6th in the season finale in China. In terms of speed, the two teammates were fairly evenly matched by the end of the year. Massa was later drafted into [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to support Michael Schumacher's 2006 campaign.\n\nAfter much uncertainty, in late 2005 BMW confirmed that Villeneuve would race for BMW Sauber in 2006. GP2 frontrunner [[Heikki Kovalainen]] and [[Indy Racing League|Indycar]] champion [[Dan Wheldon]] had both been linked with the seat, but BMW opted to honour Villeneuve's contract; to cut the contract would possibly have been an expensive exercise that would have cost them around [[United States dollar|$]]2 million, and Villeneuve was popular with the sponsors and team personnel.\n\n;2006\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve Canada 2006.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Villeneuve at the [[2006 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nSeveral changes were made at Sauber during the off season. First, the Swiss team were bought by [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]] and renamed BMW Sauber. The German manufacturer wished to start their own works team following a six-year partnership with Villeneuve's former employers Williams. In addition, Massa left Sauber for the vacant role left by [[Rubens Barrichello]] at [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Nick Heidfeld]] was brought in to replace him. Villeneuve scored seven points during the first twelve rounds of the season. But at the [[2006 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], Villeneuve had allegedly sustained an injury in a crash on lap 31.<ref name=\"Kubica replaces Villeneuve\">{{cite news | title=Kubica replaces Villeneuve | publisher=GrandPrix.com | date= August 1, 2006 | url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17241.html | accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Villeneuve Germany2006.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Villeneuve walks away from his crashed [[BMW Sauber F1.06|F1.06]] at the [[2006 German Grand Prix]], his last F1 race.]]\n\nAfter replacing Villeneuve in [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], test driver [[Robert Kubica]] drove to a solid seventh place, despite the chaotic wet conditions, but was later disqualified because his car was too light.

The report went on to suggest that Villeneuve Racing had satisfied the entry criteria set by the FIA and had joined two other outfits on a shortlist of teams under consideration for the grid entry.

Villeneuve set the fastest time of the three drivers in qualifying to put the car into fourth place on the starting grid. The car ran second for much of the race before pitting with engine problems at 12:39 pm.

These games may take years to be built from the ground up or can be completed in a matter of days or even hours depending on complexity, participants, and design goal.\n\nDriven by [[digital distribution]], the concept of independent video game development has spawned an \"indie\" movement.<ref name=forbes1>{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/2008/11/20/games-indie-developers-tech-ebiz-cx_mji_1120indiegames.html | title = Indie Game Developers Rise Up | work=Forbes | date=20 November 2008}}</ref> The increase in popularity of independent games has allowed increased distribution on popular gaming platforms such as the [[PlayStation Network]], [[Nintendo eShop]], [[Xbox Live]] and [[Steam (software)|Steam]].\n\n==History==\nThe origins of indie video games may be traced back to the 1970s, when there was virtually no established [[video game industry]].

Sean Murray of Hello Games believes that because they are still a small team and the game is highly experimental that they consider themselves indie.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-03/04/no-mans-sky-sean-murray-interview | title = No Man's Sky director: 'everything is to the wire, we work all night' | first = Matt | last = Kamen | date = 2016-03-04 | accessdate = 2016-03-04 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref>\n\nGames that are not as large as most triple-A games, but are developed by larger independent studios with or without publisher backing and that can apply triple-A design principles and polish due to the experience of the team, have sometimes been called \"triple-I\" games, reflecting the middle ground between these extremes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RyanClark/20150908/253087/The_5_Myths_of_the_Indiepocalypse.php | title = The 5 Myths of the Indiepocalypse | first = Ryan | last= Clark | date = September 8, 2015 | accessdate = December 14, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.pcworld.com/article/3184388/gaming/how-itchio-became-an-indie-pc-game-havenand-steams-antithesis.html | title = How Itch.io became an indie PC game haven\u2014and Steam's antithesis | first = Jared | last=  Newman | date = March 31, 2017 | accessdate = December 14, 2017 | work = [[PC World]] }}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nDuring the 1980s, the common medium was [[cassette tape]], which was the default software format for systems such as the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]]. This eventually gave way to [[floppy disk]] and then to [[CD-ROM]] in the 1990s.\n\nRecently independent games have been released for big budget consoles like [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Wii]]. Many games that are being released for these consoles are ports of popular flash games and/or just plainly developed independent games that have received notice.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Often indie games are completely programmer driven, due to lack of publisher funding for artwork.\n\nOn November 19, 2008, Microsoft launched ''Xbox LIVE Community Games'', later renamed as ''[[Xbox Live Indie Games]]'', which allowed independent developers to create games for the [[Xbox 360]] using [[Microsoft XNA|XNA]] development tools and sell them in an area of the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].\n\nIn May 2010, several independent developers organized the [[Humble Indie Bundle]], which raised over $1.25 million in revenue (of which about $400,000 went to charity)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfire.com/humble/ |title=Humble Indie Bundle Page and Stats |publisher=Wolfire.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30}}</ref> and showed the value that community involvement and cross-platform development can have for independent developers.\n\nThe majority of the distribution of PC and Mac games comes via [[Web portal|portals]] of [[digital distribution|digital distributors]] such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[GOG.com]], [[Desura]] and several others.\n\nWith the advent of [[smartphones]] such as the [[iPhone]] and the relative ease of producing these titles many independent game developers solely develop games for various smart phone operating systems such as the [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] and the newer [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. This has also seen games being [[ported]] across to take advantage of this new revenue stream such as the successful game [[Minecraft]].<ref name=minecraft>{{cite web |url=http://www.ziphone.org/2011/02/official-ios-version-of-indie-game.html |title=Official iOS Version of Indie Game Minecraft to Hit iTunes App Store Later This Year &#124; Unlock iPhone 4, unlock iPhone 3GS, jailbreak iPhone \u2013 how to with |publisher=Ziphone.org |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2011-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424130606/http://www.ziphone.org/2011/02/official-ios-version-of-indie-game.html |archive-date=2011-04-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThere are also independent games distribution websites, such as [[IndieCity]], springing up to cater exclusively for indie games, rather than including them alongside the mainstream games which are the main focus of most distribution [[Web portal|portals]] (see: [[Desura]], [[gog.com]], [[Humble Store]], [[Steam (software)|Steam]]). Before the launch of the PlayStation 4 Sony made it a priority to focus on getting independent developers to create new games for the PlayStation 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-10-03-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-4-indies-and-the-xbox-one|title=Shuhei Yoshida: PlayStation 4, indies, and the Xbox One|website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref>\n\n==Licensing and platform access==\n[[Personal computer]] platforms (with [[Operating system|OSes]] such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[OS X|macOS]]) are traditionally more accessible (\"[[open platform]]\") to independent game developers than video game consoles (\"closed platform\").<ref name=\"eisenmann2008-2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/09-030.pdf |title=Opening Platforms: How, When and Why? |authors=Thomas R.

The console maker also takes a percentage of the game's net profit, in addition to yearly developer fees.\n\nThere is also movement from some manufacturers to lower the threshold for indies; for instance, development for Xbox Live Indie Games only requires a $99/year Creators Club membership and Microsoft takes 30% of sales.
