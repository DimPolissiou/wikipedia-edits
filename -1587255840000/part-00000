It remained an open-top furnace and did not have the ability to use the off-gases\u2014mainly carbon monoxide\u2014as a fuel for boilers or to heat the blast. It was thus more costly to operate than it should have been. The furnace only had one stove and so was not capable of applying the hot-blast continuously. It produced relatively expensive iron; in 1865 the landed cost of imported pig-iron was \u00a35 per ton, while that made at the works cost \u00a35 17s 6d.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nThere were problems with the operation of the blast furnace itself. Soon after operation commenced, deposits\u2014referred to as 'scaffolding'\u2014began to build up inside the furnace and these gradually increased in thickness, restricting the space inside the furnace.<ref name=\":26\" /> The rate of production declined accordingly, falling to just 26 tons per week at the end.<ref name=\":26\" />\n\nThe coal would not coke and so it was being charged directly into the blast furnace. The coal was referred to as 'anthracite', perhaps because it was hard to ignite and would not form coke, or perhaps because anthracite coal had been used in other hot-blast blast furnaces without coking.

He said that he would inherit \u00a3400,000 or \u00a3500,000 from his uncle, upon reaching the age of 40, and that his mother had 'considerable property'. Lambert claimed that his ironworks venture was backed by [[Baron Hirsch]]\u2014one of the five wealthiest individuals in Europe at the time of his death in April 1896\u2014and that he had brought \u00a32,000 of Hirsch's money to Australia in a belt.

It remained an open-top furnace and did not have the ability to use the off-gases\u2014mainly carbon monoxide\u2014as a fuel for boilers or to heat the blast. It was thus more costly to operate than it should have been. The furnace only had one stove and so was not capable of applying the hot-blast continuously. It produced relatively expensive iron; in 1865 the landed cost of imported pig-iron was \u00a35 per ton, while that made at the works cost \u00a35 17s 6d.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nThere were problems with the operation of the blast furnace itself. Soon after operation commenced, deposits\u2014referred to as 'scaffolding'\u2014began to build up inside the furnace and these gradually increased in thickness, restricting the space inside the furnace.<ref name=\":26\" /> The rate of production declined accordingly, falling to just 26 tons per week at the end.<ref name=\":26\" />\n\nThe coal would not coke and so it was being charged directly into the blast furnace. The coal was referred to as 'anthracite', perhaps because it was hard to ignite and would not form coke, or perhaps because anthracite coal had been used in other hot-blast blast furnaces without coking. True [[Anthracite|anthracite coal]] is virtually unknown on New South Wales coalfields, and it appears that the term was being used erroneously.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article135709262|title=Fitzroy Iron|date=14 December 1889|work=Illawarra Mercury (Wollongong, NSW : 1856 - 1950)|access-date=9 May 2019|pages=4}}</ref> It is more likely that the coal was high-ash, poor quality coal that exacerbated the problems with the blast furnace's operation.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13114036|title=A Visit to the Fitzroy Iron Mines|date=1865-06-07|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=27 June 2019|pages=2}}</ref><ref name=\":26\" /> As early as June 1865, the coal quality was being criticised.<ref name=\":62\" /> It is reported that Hampshire needed to add charcoal or wood, with the coal, to keep the furnace working.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article112413762|title=The Bowral Free Press.|date=1887-11-02|work=Bowral Free Press and Berrima District Intelligencer (NSW : 1884 - 1901)|access-date=2020-01-26|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nLimestone used for flux could be found at [[Marulan]] but, without a rail connection, it had to be carried in drays.

There had been no significant amount of pig-iron smelted from ore in N.S.W. since 1882, and this tariff was an incentive to resume local production of pig-iron.

It is a branch of the '''Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County (PLSJ)''', which services a large area in southeast Ohio \u2013 otherwise known as the [[Ohio Valley]].  Besides the Schiappa Library, PLSJ has branches all over [[Jefferson County, Ohio]] located in [[Toronto, Ohio|Toronto]], [[Brilliant, Ohio|Brilliant]], [[Tiltonsville, Ohio|Tiltonsville]], [[Dillonvale, Jefferson County, Ohio|Dillonvale]] and [[Adena, Ohio|Adena]] with the Main Library located in Steubenville.  The Schiappa branch is located at the west end of Steubenville on the [[Fort Steuben Mall]] property.  It not only serves as an additional library for the city of Steubenville, but also as a library for the neighboring village of [[Wintersville, Ohio]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Schiappa Branch Library opened its doors on February 2, 1987 in the west end of Steubenville, Ohio at 4141 Mall Drive, where it still sits on property donated by the Siciliano family.  This plot of land was one of many looked at in the time leading up to a final decision, but it was this area's location being adjacent to a large [[shopping center]] attracting people from all over the Ohio Valley that made it so desirable.  Huberta Siciliano made it clear that if she donated the land to the library, she would like the facility to be named after her parents: Albert and Mary A. Schiappa.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\">Lash, John.  ''The history of the Schiappa Branch Library in Steubenville, Ohio''.  May 2005.</ref>\n\nOne concern with the property that the Schiappa Library now sits upon was that the land was a former [[strip-mining]] area.  This caused many to note that the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] would be in danger of cracking and heaving once the [[pyrites]] swelled with moisture.  To resolve this, the library was built upon 110 [[concrete]] [[pylon (disambiguation)|pylons]], drilled to solid rock, which is between 4 and 14 feet deep at the site.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\">Hall, Alan.

To remedy this, returned books were shelved quickly and the State Regional Library sent over boxes of books to make the shelves more full temporarily.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\"/>   Over the years, the collection of books has grown exponentially to include [[VHS|videotapes]], [[DVDs]], [[CDs]], [[audiobook]]s, [[periodicals]], and [[graphic novels]].\n\n==Renovations==\n\nBy 1990, the collection at Schiappa Branch Library had grown so large that talk of expanding the building had begun.  A larger children's area was needed, more [[Reference#Libraries|reference]] shelving would be required, and the collection in Schiappa's Ohio History and [[Genealogy]] room was beginning to take up more space than the shelves could fit.  There was also talk of adding a conference room, a children's activity room, and offices for the branch manager.  The project went forward in 1992 and the library was renovated with all of the above changes while the building itself stayed open to the public.  An extra wing was added for the children's area and activity room, a conference room and three study rooms were built, offices for the branch manager and extra workspaces were added behind the [[library circulation|Circulation]] desk, and the Reference and Genealogy departments were given their own closed in space for quiet studying and for keeping reference materials from leaving the room.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\"/>\n\nBeginning in 2007, plans were drawn up for another renovation project.

He hoped to inspire a revolution against the federal government, and defended the bombing as a legitimate tactic against what he saw as a tyrannical government.<ref name=\"mcveigh_dead\"/> He was arrested shortly after the bombing and indicted on 160 state offenses and 11 federal offenses, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction.

His [[Capital punishment in the United States|execution]] was carried out in a considerably shorter time than most inmates awaiting the death penalty, as most convicts on death row in the United States spend an average of 15 years there. [[Terry Nichols]] and [[Michael and Lori Fortier|Michael Fortier]] were also convicted as conspirators in the plot. Nichols was sentenced to eight life terms for the deaths of eight federal agents, and to 161 life terms without parole by the state of Oklahoma for the deaths of the others.

Thousands more took hours, days, weeks or months to die).\n\nIf Saddam is such a demon, and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation, why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of \"mass destruction\" \u2014 like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above?\n\nThe truth is, the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction.}}\n\nThe essay, which marked the first time that McVeigh publicly discussed the Oklahoma City bombing, continued:\n\n{{quote|Hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children? In Oklahoma City, it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day-care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building. Yet, when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes \"a shield.\" Think about it.\n\nWhen considering morality and \"mens rea\" [criminal intent], in light of these facts, I ask: Who are the true barbarians? ...\n\nI find it ironic, to say the least, that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed \"The Spirit of Oklahoma.\" This leads me to a final, and unspoken, moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhen a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people, this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise. What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake.\n\nUnfortunately, the morality of killing is not so superficial. The truth is, the use of a truck, a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself.\n\nThese are weapons of mass destruction \u2014 and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons.\n\nWhether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City ...}}\n\nMcVeigh included photocopies of a famous Vietnam War-era picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs, and of nuclear devastation in Japan.

The handwritten essay, submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine ''Media Bypass'', was distributed worldwide by the [[Associated Press]] on May 29, 1998. This was written in the midst of the 1998 [[Iraq disarmament timeline 1990\u20132003|Iraq disarmament crisis]] and a few months before [[Bombing of Iraq (1998)|Operation Desert Fox]].\n\n{{quote|The administration has said that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq]] has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons (\"[[weapons of mass destruction]]\") \u2014 mainly because they have used them in the past.\n\nWell, if that's the standard by which these matters are decided, then the U.S. is the nation that set the precedent. The U.S. has stockpiled these same weapons (and more) for over 40 years. The U.S. claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its \"[[Cold War]]\" with the Soviet Union. Why, then, it is invalid for Iraq to claim the same reason (deterrence) with respect to Iraq's (real) war with, and the continued threat of, its neighbor Iran?\n\nThe administration claims that Iraq has used these weapons in the past. We've all seen the pictures that show a Kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons. But, have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from Hiroshima or Nagasaki?\n\nI suggest that one study the histories of [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and other \"regional conflicts\" that the U.S. has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of \"weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nRemember [[Firebombing of Dresden|Dresden]]? How about [[Operation Linebacker II|Hanoi]]? [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Tripoli]]? [[Gulf War|Baghdad]]? What about the big ones \u2014 [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]? (At these two locations, the U.S. killed at least 150,000 non-combatants \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 in the blink of an eye. Thousands more took hours, days, weeks or months to die).\n\nIf Saddam is such a demon, and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation, why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of \"mass destruction\" \u2014 like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above?\n\nThe truth is, the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction.}}\n\nThe essay, which marked the first time that McVeigh publicly discussed the Oklahoma City bombing, continued:\n\n{{quote|Hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children? In Oklahoma City, it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day-care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building. Yet, when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes \"a shield.\" Think about it.\n\nWhen considering morality and \"mens rea\" [criminal intent], in light of these facts, I ask: Who are the true barbarians? ...\n\nI find it ironic, to say the least, that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed \"The Spirit of Oklahoma.\" This leads me to a final, and unspoken, moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhen a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people, this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise. What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake.\n\nUnfortunately, the morality of killing is not so superficial. The truth is, the use of a truck, a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself.\n\nThese are weapons of mass destruction \u2014 and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons.\n\nWhether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City ...}}\n\nMcVeigh included photocopies of a famous Vietnam War-era picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs, and of nuclear devastation in Japan.

The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only [[Interchange station|transfer point]] in the MAX system where riders can board any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project\u2014Portland's first light rail line. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. The Red Line began serving the stations in September 2001, initially connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. In 2003, the Red Line extended westward to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The Yellow Line also served the stations from 2004 to 2009, connecting downtown to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]]; TriMet rerouted this line to serve the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block bound by Southwest Morrison and Yamhill streets to the north and south, and 6th Avenue and Broadway to the east and west had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage.

[[Portland, Oregon]], United States, served by [[TriMet]] as part of its [[MAX Light Rail]] system. The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only [[Interchange station|transfer point]] in the MAX system where riders can board any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project\u2014Portland's first light rail line. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. The Red Line began serving the stations in September 2001, initially connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. In 2003, the Red Line extended westward to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The Yellow Line also served the stations from 2004 to 2009, connecting downtown to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]]; TriMet rerouted this line to serve the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block bound by Southwest Morrison and Yamhill streets to the north and south, and 6th Avenue and Broadway to the east and west had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage.

Upon becoming emperor he made his brother [[Valens]] his co-emperor, giving him rule of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|eastern provinces]] while Valentinian retained the [[Western Roman Empire|west]].\n\nDuring his reign, Valentinian fought successfully against the [[Alamanni]], [[Quadi]], and [[Sarmatians]]. Most notable was his victory over the Alamanni in 367 at the [[Battle of Solicinium]]. His brilliant general [[Count Theodosius]] defeated a revolt in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] and the [[Great Conspiracy]], a coordinated assault on [[Roman Britain]] by [[Picts]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], and [[Saxons]]. Valentinian was also the last emperor to conduct campaigns across both the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. Valentinian rebuilt and improved the fortifications along the frontiers, even building fortresses in enemy territory.\n\nDue to the successful nature of his reign and the rapid decline of the empire after his death, he is often considered to be the \"last great western emperor\". He founded the [[Valentinian Dynasty]], with his sons [[Gratian]] and [[Valentinian II]] succeeding him in the western half of the empire.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Solidus de Valentinien MAN.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Solidus of emperor Valentinian I.]]\nValentinian was born in 321<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.6.6</ref> at [[Cibalae]] in southern [[Pannonia]] (now [[Vinkovci]] in [[Croatia]]) into an [[Illyro-Romans|Illyro-Roman]] family.<ref name=\"Lenski2002\">{{cite book|last=Lenski|first=Noel Emmanuel|title=Failure of empire: Valens and the Roman state in the fourth century A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvXo39xOV8kC&pg=PA56|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23332-4|page=56}}</ref> Valentinian and his younger brother [[Valens]] were the sons of [[Gratian the Elder|Gratianus Major]], a prominent commander during the reigns of emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and [[Constans I]].<ref name=tomlinp2>{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=2}}</ref> He and his brother grew up on the family estate where they were educated in a variety of subjects, including painting and sculpting.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus''. 45.5</ref>\n\nGratian the Elder was promoted to ''[[Comes]] Africae'' in the late 320s or early 330s, and the young Valentinian accompanied his father to Africa.<ref name=tomlinp4>{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=4}}</ref> However, Gratian was soon accused of embezzlement and was forced to retire.<ref name=tomlinp4 /> Valentinian joined the army in the late 330s and later probably acquired the position of ''[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|protector domesticus]]''.<ref name=tomlinp4 /> Gratian was later recalled during the early 340s and was made ''comes'' of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]].<ref name=tomlinp4 /> After holding this post, Gratianus retired to the family estate in Cibalae.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.7.3</ref>\n\nIn 350, Constans I was assassinated by agents of the [[usurper]] [[Magnentius]], a commander in [[Gaul]] proclaimed emperor by his soldiers.{{cn|date=August 2018}} [[Constantius II]], older brother of Constans and emperor in the East, promptly set forth towards Magnentius with a large army.<ref name=\"Zosimus, New History II.60\">Zosimus, ''New History'' II.60</ref> The following year the two emperors met in Pannonia.

The army still found itself beleaguered by Persian attacks, forcing Jovian to accept humiliating peace terms.<ref name=tomlinp16>{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=16}}</ref> Jovian's authority within the empire was still insecure, so he sent a notary [[Procopius (notary)|Procopius]] and the tribune [[Memoridus]] west to announce his accession.<ref name=tomlinp16 /> During Jovian's reign Valentinian was promoted to tribune of a ''Scutarii'' (elite infantry) regiment, and was dispatched to Ancyra. Jovian's rule would be short \u2013 only eight months \u2013 and before he could even consolidate his position in [[Constantinople]] he died en route between [[Ancyra]] and [[Nicaea]]. His death was attributed to either assassination by poisoning or accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. Jovian is remembered mostly for restoring Christianity to its previous favored status under Constantine and his sons.\n\nThe army marched to Nicaea, and a meeting of civil and military officials was convened to choose a new emperor. The purple was offered to [[Sallustius]], who had refused it once before on Julian's death. The prefect declined, and did so again on behalf of his son when the offer was extended to him.<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', (The Modern Library, 1932), ch. XXV., pp. 845, 846</ref> Two different names were proposed: [[Aequitius]], a tribune of the first Scutarii, and Januarius, a relative of Jovian's in charge of military supplies in Illyricum.

As he prepared to make his accession speech the soldiers threatened to riot, apparently uncertain as to where his loyalties lay. Valentinian reassured them that the army was his greatest priority. According to [[Ammianus]] the soldiers were astounded by Valentinian\u2019s bold demeanor and his willingness to assume the imperial authority. To further prevent a succession crisis he agreed to pick a co-Augustus. His decision to elect a fellow-emperor could also be construed as a move to appease any opposition among the civilian officials in the eastern portion of the Empire. By agreeing to appoint a co-ruler, he assured the eastern officials that someone with imperial authority would remain in the east to protect their interests.\n\nValentinian selected his brother Valens as co-Augustus at Constantinople on 28 March 364. This was done over the objections of [[Dagalaifus (Roman Consul, 366)|Dagalaifus]], the ''[[magister equitum]]''. Ammianus makes it clear that Valens was subordinate to his brother. The remainder of 364 was spent delegating administrative duties and military commands. According to the 5th century historian [[Zosimus]], who as a [[Pagan]] was inclined to revile the restorer of [[Christianity]], all the ministers and officials appointed by Julian were summarily dismissed in disgrace; modern authorities have qualified the assertion.<ref>Gibbon, p. 849 note</ref> It is certain that some reshuffling of commands occurred along with the division of the provinces, but the changes were strictly based on merit. The [[Sophists]] and philosophers who had proliferated in the court of the apostate, drawing large salaries for delusive services, were cashiered.<ref>Gibbon, ch. XXIII., pp. 771-73; ch.

Valentinian gained control of [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Italy]], [[Prefecture of Gaul|Gaul]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|Africa]], and [[Prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. Valens resided in [[Constantinople]], while Valentinian\u2019s court was at [[Mediolanum]].\n\n===Campaigns in Gaul and Germania===\n[[File:Colosso-de-barletta.jpg|thumb|upright|The emperor depicted in the [[Colossus of Barletta]] could very well be Valentinian I.<ref>Cunliffe B. W. (1994) ''Rome and Her Empire'', Constable, p. 317</ref>]]\n\nIn 365 the [[Alamanni]] crossed the Rhine and invaded Gaul. Simultaneously, [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] \u2013 the last scion of the [[Constantinian dynasty]] \u2013 began his revolt against Valens in the east. According to Ammianus, Valentinian received news of both the Alamanni and Procopius' revolt on 1 November while on his way to [[Paris]]. He initially sent Dagalaifus to fight the Alamanni<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.9</ref> while he himself made preparations to march east and help Valens. After receiving counsel from his court and deputations from the leading Gallic cities begging him to stay and protect Gaul, he decided to remain in Gaul and fight the Alamanni.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.12</ref><ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.13</ref>\nValentinian advanced to [[Durocortorum]] and sent two generals, Charietto and Severianus, against the invaders.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.1.2</ref> Both generals were promptly defeated and killed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.1.4</ref> In 366, Dagalaifus was sent against the Alamanni but he was also ineffective.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.2.1</ref> Late in the campaigning season Dagalaifus was replaced by Jovinus, a general from the court of Valentinian. After several victories along the [[Meuse river]] Jovinus pushed the Alamanni out of Gaul and was awarded the consulate the following year for his efforts.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.2.10</ref>\n\nIn early 367 Valentinian was distracted from launching a punitive expedition against the Alamanni due to crises in Britain and northern Gaul. The Alamanni promptly re-crossed the Rhine and plundered [[Moguntiacum]]. Valentinian succeeded in arranging the assassination of [[Vithicabius]], an Alamannic leader, but Valentinian was more determined to bring the Alamanni under Roman hegemony. Valentinian spent the entire winter of 367 gathering a massive army for a spring offensive. He summoned the ''Comes Italiae'' Sebastianus, with the Italian and Illyrian legions, to join Jovinus and Severus, the ''[[magister peditum]]''. In the spring of 368 Valentinian, his eight-year-old son Gratian and the army crossed the Rhine and [[Main (river)|Main]] rivers into Alamannic territory. They did not encounter any resistance initially \u2013 burning any dwellings or food stores they found along the way. Finally, Valentinian fought the Alamanni in the [[Battle of Solicinium]]; the Romans were victorious<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.15</ref> but suffered heavy casualties.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.16</ref> A temporary peace was reached and Valentinian returned to [[Trier]] for the winter.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.17</ref> During 369, Valentinian ordered new defensive works to be constructed and old structures refurbished along the length of the Rhine\u2019s west bank.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.1</ref> Boldly, he ordered the construction of a fortress across the Rhine in the mountains near modern [[Heidelberg]].<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.2</ref> The Alamanni sent envoys to protest, but they were dismissed. The Alamanni attacked the fortress while it was still under construction and destroyed it.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.8</ref>\n\nIn 370 the [[Saxons]] renewed their attacks on northern Gaul. Nannienus, the ''comes'' in charge of the troops in northern Gaul, urged Severus to come to his aid. After several modest successes, a truce was called and the Saxons handed over to the Romans young men fit for duty in the Roman military \u2013 in exchange for free passage back to their homeland. The Romans ambushed them and destroyed the entire invading force.<ref>Rike, R.L., ''Apex Omnium: Religion in the Res Gestae of Ammianus'' (1987), pg. 91; Jones, Martindale and Morris, ''The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire'' Vol. I (1971), pgs. 615-616</ref>\n\nValentinian meanwhile tried to persuade the [[Burgundians]] \u2013 bitter enemies of the Alamanni \u2013 to attack [[Macrian]], a powerful Alamannic chieftain. If the Alamanni tried to flee, Valentinian would be waiting for them with his army. Negotiations with the Burgundians broke down when Valentinian, in his usual high-handed manner, refused to meet with the Burgundian envoys and personally assure them of Roman support. Nevertheless, rumors of a Roman alliance with the Burgundians did have the effect of scattering the Alamanni through fear of an imminent attack from their enemies. This event allowed the ''[[magister equitum]]'' [[Count Theodosius|Theodosius]] to attack the Alamanni through Raetia \u2013 taking many Alamannic prisoners. These captured Alamanni were settled in the [[Po river]] valley in Italy, where they were still settled at the time Ammianus wrote his history.\n\nValentinian campaigned unsuccessfully for four more years to defeat Macrian who in 372 barely escaped capture by Theodosius. Meanwhile, Valentinian continued to recruit heavily from Alamanni friendly to Rome. He sent the Alamannic king Fraomarius, as a Tribune, to Britain in 372-373 with an army in order to replenish troops there and made the noblemen Bitheridius and [[Hortarius]] commanders in his army although Hortarius was soon executed for conspiring with Macrian. Valentinian\u2019s Alamannic campaigns, however, were hampered by troubles first in Africa, and later on the Danube river. In 374 Valentinian was forced to make peace with Macrian because the Emperor's presence was needed to counter an invasion of Illyricum by the Quadi and Sarmatians.\n\n===The Great Conspiracy===\nIn 367, Valentinian received reports from Britain that a combined force of [[Picts]], [[Attacotti]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] had killed the ''[[Comes litoris Saxonici]]'' [[Nectaridus]] and ''[[Dux Britanniarum]]'' [[Fullofaudes]]. At the same time, Frankish and Saxon forces were raiding the coastal areas of northern Gaul. The empire was in the midst of the [[Great Conspiracy]] \u2013 and was in danger of losing control of Britain altogether. Valentinian set out for Britain, sending ''Comes domesticorum'' Severus ahead of him to investigate. Severus was not able to correct the situation and returned to Gaul, meeting Valentinian at [[Samarobriva]]. Valentinian then sent Jovinus to Britain and promoted Severus to magister peditum. It was at this time that Valentinian fell ill and a battle for succession broke out between Severus, a representative of the army, and Rusticus Julianus, ''magister memoriae'' and a representative of the Gallic nobility. Valentinian soon recovered however and appointed his son Gratian as his co-Augustus in the west. Ammianus remarks that such an action was unprecedented. Jovinus quickly returned saying that he needed more men to take care of the situation. In 368 Valentinian appointed Theodosius as the new ''[[Comes Britanniarum]]'' with instructions to return Britain to Roman rule. Meanwhile, Severus and Jovinus were to accompany the emperor on his campaign against the Alamanni.\n\nTheodosius arrived in 368 with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], [[Heruli]], Jovii and Victores legions. Landing at [[Rutupi\u00e6]], he proceeded to [[Londinium]] restoring order to southern Britain. Later, he rallied the remaining garrison which was originally stationed in Britain; it was apparent the units had lost their cohesiveness when Fullofaudes and Nectaridus had been defeated. Theodosius sent for [[Civilis (vicarius)|Civilis]] to be installed as the new [[vicarius]] of the [[diocese]] and [[Dulcitius]] as an additional general.\nIn 369, Theodosius set about reconquering the areas north of [[London]]; putting down the revolt of [[Valentinus (rebel)|Valentinus]], the brother-in-law of a [[vicarius]], [[Maximinus (praetorian prefect)|Maximinus]]. Subsequently, Theodosius restored the rest of Britain to the empire and rebuilt many fortifications \u2013 renaming northern Britain '[[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]]'. After his return in 369, Valentinian promoted Theodosius to ''magister equitum'' in place of Jovinus.\n\n===Revolt in Africa and crises on the Danube===\n[[File:Missorio di valentiniano I, argento, 364-75 ca., dall'arve, 02.JPG|thumb|right|Silver missorium (heavily worn) believed to depict Valentinian I. The armoured and haloed emperor is flanked by infantry soldiers, he holds a [[labarum]] in one hand and an orb surmounted by a figure of Victory in the other, ca. 364-375]]\nIn 372, the rebellion of [[Firmus (4th century usurper)|Firmus]] broke out in the still-devastated African provinces. This rebellion was driven by the corruption of the ''comes'' Romanus. Romanus took sides in the murderous disputes among the legitimate and illegitimate children of Nubel, a Moorish prince and leading Roman client in Africa. Resentment of Romanus' peculations and his failure to defend the province from desert nomads caused some of the provincials to revolt. Valentinian                   sent in Theodosius to restore imperial control. Over the following two years Theodosius uncovered Romanus' crimes, arrested him and his supporters, and defeated Firmus.\n\nIn 373, hostilities erupted with the [[Quadi]], a group of Germanic-speaking people living on the upper Danube. Like the Alamanni, the Quadi were outraged that Valentinian was building fortifications in their territory. They complained and sent deputations to the ''magister armorum per Illyricum'' Aequitius, who promised to refer the matter to Valentinian. However, the increasingly influential minister Maximinus, now praetorian prefect of Gaul, blamed Aequitius to Valentinian for the trouble, and managed to have him promote his son Marcellianus to finish the project.<ref>Gibbon, p. 894</ref> The protests of Quadic leaders continued to delay the project, and to put an end to their clamor Marcellianus murdered the Quadic king [[Gabinius (king)|Gabinius]] at a banquet ostensibly arranged for peaceful negotiations. This roused the Quadi to war, along with their allies the Sarmatians. During the fall, they crossed the Danube and began ravaging the province of [[Pannonia Valeria]]. The marauders could not penetrate the fortified cities, but they heavily damaged the unprotected countryside. Two legions were sent in but failed to coordinate and were routed by the Sarmatians. Meanwhile, another group of Sarmatians invaded [[Moesia]], but were driven back by the son of Theodosius, ''Dux Moesiae'' and later emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]].\n\nValentinian did not receive news of these crises until late 374. The following spring he set out from Trier and arrived at [[Carnuntum]], which was deserted. There he was met by Sarmatian envoys who begged forgiveness for their actions. Valentinian replied that he would investigate what had happened and act accordingly. Valentinian ignored Marcellianus\u2019 treacherous actions and decided to punish the Quadi. He was accompanied by Sebastianus and [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]], and spent the summer months preparing for the campaign. In the fall he crossed the Danube at [[Aquincum]] into Quadi territory.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.5.13</ref> After pillaging Quadi lands without opposition, he retired to [[Sabaria|Savaria]] to winter quarters.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.5.14</ref>\n\n====Death====\nWithout waiting for the spring he decided to continue campaigning and moved from Savaria to [[Szony|Brigetio]]. Once he arrived on 17 November, he received a deputation from the Quadi. In return for supplying fresh recruits to the Roman army, the Quadi were to be allowed to leave in peace. However, before the envoys left they were granted an audience with Valentinian. The envoys insisted that the conflict was caused by the building of Roman forts in their lands; furthermore individual bands of Quadi were not necessarily bound to the rule of the chiefs who had made treaties with the Romans \u2013 and thus might attack the Romans at any time. The attitude of the envoys so enraged Valentinian that he suffered a burst blood vessel in the skull while angrily yelling at them, provoking his death<ref>{{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Edited in Seven Volumes with Introduction, Notes, Appendices, and Index|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108050739|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgtcg0nMg_IC&pg=PA66}}</ref> on November 17, 375.\n\n== Reputation ==\n[[A.H.M. Jones]] writes that although Valentinian I was \"less of a boor\" than his chief rival for election to the imperial throne, \"he was of a violent and brutal temper, and not only uncultivated himself, but hostile to cultivated persons\". According to [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]], \"he hated the well-dressed and educated and wealthy and well-born\". He was, however, an able soldier and a conscientious administrator, and took an interest in the welfare of the humbler classes, from which his father had risen. Unfortunately his good intentions were often frustrated by a bad choice of ministers, and \"an obstinate belief in their merits despite all evidence to the contrary.\"<ref>A.H.M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284\u2013602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 139.</ref> He was a founder of schools, and provided medical attendance for the poor of [[Rome]], by appointing a physician for each of the fourteen districts of the city.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Valentinian I.|volume=27|page=851}}</ref> He also reissued an edict of [[Constantine I]] making infanticide a capital offence.<ref>Gibbon, ch. XIV., p. 375; ch. XXV., p. 859</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the benevolence of these more generous edicts, Valentinian was remarkable for cruelty and barbarism in his private affairs.\nHe often had servants and attendants executed on trifling charges, and was reportedly accustomed to keep two bears, known as ''Micca Aurea'' (''golden camel''), and ''Innocence'', in an iron cage which was transported wherever he went, whom he employed to execute the sentence, which he often delivered, of capital punishment. At length ''Innocence'', when she was considered to have faithfully discharged her office, was released with the emperor's good wishes into her native wilds.<ref>[[Charles Kingsley]], ''The Roman And The Teuton, A Series Of Lectures delivered before the University of Cambridge'', (Macmillan And Co., 1889, London), lecture II, ''The Dying Empire''</ref>\n\nValentinian was a [[Christians|Christian]] but permitted liberal religious freedom to all his subjects, proscribing only some forms of rituals such as particular types of sacrifices, and banning the practice of magic. Again, Valentinian steadily set his face against the increasing wealth and worldliness of the clergy. He issued a pointed edict via [[Pope Damasus I]], forbidding the grant of bequests to Christian clergy-men; and another forcing members of the sacerdotal order to discharge the public duties owed on account of their property, or else relinquish it.<ref>Gibbon, ch. XXV., p. 864; ch. XX., p. 662, editor's note</ref><ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]] gives an interesting account in his Historia Ecclesiastica of Valentinian's marriages, that has inspired some to call this emperor [[Polygamy in Christianity|polygamous]]. According to the text: the empress [[Justina (empress)|Justina]] \"became known to [[Marina Severa]], wife of the emperor Valentinian, and had frequent dialogue with the empress, until their intimacy at length grew to such an extent that they were accustomed to bathe together. When Severa saw Justina in the bath she was greatly struck with the beauty of the virgin, and spoke of her to the emperor; saying that the daughter of Justus was so lovely a creature, and possessed of such symmetry of form, that she herself, though a woman, was altogether charmed with her. The emperor, treasuring this description by his wife in his own mind, considered with himself how he could espouse Justina, without repudiating Severa, as she had borne him Gratian, whom he had created Augustus a little while before. He accordingly framed a law, and caused it to be published throughout all the cities, by which any man was permitted to have two lawful wives. The law was promulgated and he married Justina, by whom he had Valentinian the younger.\" (Book IV, chapt. 31.)<ref>Translated by A.C. Zenos. From Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series, Vol. 2. Edited by Philip Schaff and Henry Wace. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1890.)</ref>\n\nThis story is only known from Socrates and no trace of any edict by any emperor allowing polygamy exists. Valentinian I may have divorced Severa according to Roman Law, which allowed for divorce (see [[Women in Ancient Rome]]).<ref>Frier, Bruce W. and McGinn, Thomas A.J.: A Casebook on Roman Family Law (American Philological Association) OUP USA 2003. Part D, The End of Marriage</ref> However, since divorce was not acknowledged by Christians,<ref>Matthew 19, 4\u20136.</ref> Socrates contemptuously describes him as a bigamist. It is also possible that Socrates attempted to accuse Justina, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], of fornication, a common aspersion against other cults. According to [[John Malalas]], the [[Chronicon Paschale]], and [[John of Nikiu]], the empress Severa was banished by Valentinian I for conducting an illegal transaction, before he consorted with Justina. Barnes believes this story to be an attempt to justify the divorce of Valentinian I without accusing the emperor.<ref>Timothy Barnes, \"Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality\" (1998), p. 123\u2013125</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Byzantine Empire}}\n*[[List of Byzantine emperors]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n===Primary sources===\n*Ammianus Marcellinus.

Upon becoming emperor he made his brother [[Valens]] his co-emperor, giving him rule of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|eastern provinces]] while Valentinian retained the [[Western Roman Empire|west]].\n\nDuring his reign, Valentinian fought successfully against the [[Alamanni]], [[Quadi]], and [[Sarmatians]]. Most notable was his victory over the Alamanni in 367 at the [[Battle of Solicinium]]. His brilliant general [[Count Theodosius]] defeated a revolt in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] and the [[Great Conspiracy]], a coordinated assault on [[Roman Britain]] by [[Picts]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], and [[Saxons]]. Valentinian was also the last emperor to conduct campaigns across both the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. Valentinian rebuilt and improved the fortifications along the frontiers, even building fortresses in enemy territory.\n\nDue to the successful nature of his reign and the rapid decline of the empire after his death, he is often considered to be the \"last great western emperor\". He founded the [[Valentinian Dynasty]], with his sons [[Gratian]] and [[Valentinian II]] succeeding him in the western half of the empire.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Solidus de Valentinien MAN.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Solidus of emperor Valentinian I.]]\nValentinian was born in 321<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.6.6</ref> at [[Cibalae]] in southern [[Pannonia]] (now [[Vinkovci]] in [[Croatia]]) into an [[Illyro-Romans|Illyro-Roman]] family.<ref name=\"Lenski2002\">{{cite book|last=Lenski|first=Noel Emmanuel|title=Failure of empire: Valens and the Roman state in the fourth century A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvXo39xOV8kC&pg=PA56|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23332-4|page=56}}</ref> Valentinian and his younger brother [[Valens]] were the sons of [[Gratian the Elder|Gratianus Major]], a prominent commander during the reigns of emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and [[Constans I]].<ref name=tomlinp2>{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=2}}</ref> He and his brother grew up on the family estate where they were educated in a variety of subjects, including painting and sculpting.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus''. 45.5</ref>\n\nGratian the Elder was promoted to ''[[Comes]] Africae'' in the late 320s or early 330s, and the young Valentinian accompanied his father to Africa.<ref name=tomlinp4>{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=4}}</ref> However, Gratian was soon accused of embezzlement and was forced to retire.<ref name=tomlinp4 /> Valentinian joined the army in the late 330s and later probably acquired the position of ''[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|protector domesticus]]''.<ref name=tomlinp4 /> Gratian was later recalled during the early 340s and was made ''comes'' of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]].<ref name=tomlinp4 /> After holding this post, Gratianus retired to the family estate in Cibalae.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.7.3</ref>\n\nIn 350, Constans I was assassinated by agents of the [[usurper]] [[Magnentius]], a commander in [[Gaul]] proclaimed emperor by his soldiers.{{cn|date=August 2018}} [[Constantius II]], older brother of Constans and emperor in the East, promptly set forth towards Magnentius with a large army.<ref name=\"Zosimus, New History II.60\">Zosimus, ''New History'' II.60</ref> The following year the two emperors met in Pannonia.

The army still found itself beleaguered by Persian attacks, forcing Jovian to accept humiliating peace terms.<ref name=tomlinp16>{{cite book |author=Tomlin, R. |title=The Emperor Valentinian I |year=1973 |page=16}}</ref> Jovian's authority within the empire was still insecure, so he sent a notary [[Procopius (notary)|Procopius]] and the tribune [[Memoridus]] west to announce his accession.<ref name=tomlinp16 /> During Jovian's reign Valentinian was promoted to tribune of a ''Scutarii'' (elite infantry) regiment, and was dispatched to Ancyra. Jovian's rule would be short \u2013 only eight months \u2013 and before he could even consolidate his position in [[Constantinople]] he died en route between [[Ancyra]] and [[Nicaea]]. His death was attributed to either assassination by poisoning or accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. Jovian is remembered mostly for restoring Christianity to its previous favored status under Constantine and his sons.\n\nThe army marched to Nicaea, and a meeting of civil and military officials was convened to choose a new emperor. The purple was offered to [[Sallustius]], who had refused it once before on Julian's death. The prefect declined, and did so again on behalf of his son when the offer was extended to him.<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', (The Modern Library, 1932), ch. XXV., pp. 845, 846</ref> Two different names were proposed: [[Aequitius]], a tribune of the first Scutarii, and Januarius, a relative of Jovian's in charge of military supplies in Illyricum.

As he prepared to make his accession speech the soldiers threatened to riot, apparently uncertain as to where his loyalties lay. Valentinian reassured them that the army was his greatest priority. According to Ammianus the soldiers were astounded by Valentinian\u2019s bold demeanor and his willingness to assume the imperial authority. To further prevent a succession crisis he agreed to pick a co-Augustus. His decision to elect a fellow-emperor could also be construed as a move to appease any opposition among the civilian officials in the eastern portion of the Empire. By agreeing to appoint a co-ruler, he assured the eastern officials that someone with imperial authority would remain in the east to protect their interests.\n\nValentinian selected his brother Valens as co-Augustus at Constantinople on 28 March 364. This was done over the objections of [[Dagalaifus (Roman Consul, 366)|Dagalaifus]], the ''[[magister equitum]]''. Ammianus makes it clear that Valens was subordinate to his brother. The remainder of 364 was spent delegating administrative duties and military commands. According to the 5th century historian [[Zosimus]], who as a [[Pagan]] was inclined to revile the restorer of [[Christianity]], all the ministers and officials appointed by Julian were summarily dismissed in disgrace; modern authorities have qualified the assertion.<ref>Gibbon, p. 849 note</ref> It is certain that some reshuffling of commands occurred along with the division of the provinces, but the changes were strictly based on merit. The [[Sophists]] and philosophers who had proliferated in the court of the apostate, drawing large salaries for delusive services, were cashiered.<ref>Gibbon, ch. XXIII., pp. 771-73; ch. XXV., p. 849</ref>  Valentinian retained the services of Dagalaifus and promoted Aequitius to ''Comes Illyricum''. Valens was given the [[Prefecture of Oriens]], governed by [[prefect]] [[Salutius]]. Valentinian gained control of [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Italy]], [[Prefecture of Gaul|Gaul]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|Africa]], and [[Prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. Valens resided in [[Constantinople]], while Valentinian\u2019s court was at [[Mediolanum]].\n\n===Campaigns in Gaul and Germania===\n[[File:Colosso-de-barletta.jpg|thumb|upright|The emperor depicted in the [[Colossus of Barletta]] could very well be Valentinian I.<ref>Cunliffe B. W. (1994) ''Rome and Her Empire'', Constable, p. 317</ref>]]\n\nIn 365 the [[Alamanni]] crossed the Rhine and invaded Gaul. Simultaneously, [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] \u2013 the last scion of the [[Constantinian dynasty]] \u2013 began his revolt against Valens in the east. According to Ammianus, Valentinian received news of both the Alamanni and Procopius' revolt on 1 November while on his way to [[Paris]]. He initially sent Dagalaifus to fight the Alamanni<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.9</ref> while he himself made preparations to march east and help Valens. After receiving counsel from his court and deputations from the leading Gallic cities begging him to stay and protect Gaul, he decided to remain in Gaul and fight the Alamanni.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.12</ref><ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVI.5.13</ref>\nValentinian advanced to [[Durocortorum]] and sent two generals, Charietto and Severianus, against the invaders.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.1.2</ref> Both generals were promptly defeated and killed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.1.4</ref> In 366, Dagalaifus was sent against the Alamanni but he was also ineffective.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.2.1</ref> Late in the campaigning season Dagalaifus was replaced by Jovinus, a general from the court of Valentinian. After several victories along the [[Meuse river]] Jovinus pushed the Alamanni out of Gaul and was awarded the consulate the following year for his efforts.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.2.10</ref>\n\nIn early 367 Valentinian was distracted from launching a punitive expedition against the Alamanni due to crises in Britain and northern Gaul. The Alamanni promptly re-crossed the Rhine and plundered [[Moguntiacum]]. Valentinian succeeded in arranging the assassination of [[Vithicabius]], an Alamannic leader, but Valentinian was more determined to bring the Alamanni under Roman hegemony. Valentinian spent the entire winter of 367 gathering a massive army for a spring offensive. He summoned the ''Comes Italiae'' Sebastianus, with the Italian and Illyrian legions, to join Jovinus and Severus, the ''[[magister peditum]]''. In the spring of 368 Valentinian, his eight-year-old son Gratian and the army crossed the Rhine and [[Main (river)|Main]] rivers into Alamannic territory. They did not encounter any resistance initially \u2013 burning any dwellings or food stores they found along the way. Finally, Valentinian fought the Alamanni in the [[Battle of Solicinium]]; the Romans were victorious<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.15</ref> but suffered heavy casualties.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.16</ref> A temporary peace was reached and Valentinian returned to [[Trier]] for the winter.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVII.10.17</ref> During 369, Valentinian ordered new defensive works to be constructed and old structures refurbished along the length of the Rhine\u2019s west bank.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.1</ref> Boldly, he ordered the construction of a fortress across the Rhine in the mountains near modern [[Heidelberg]].<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.2</ref> The Alamanni sent envoys to protest, but they were dismissed. The Alamanni attacked the fortress while it was still under construction and destroyed it.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXVIII.2.8</ref>\n\nIn 370 the [[Saxons]] renewed their attacks on northern Gaul. Nannienus, the ''comes'' in charge of the troops in northern Gaul, urged Severus to come to his aid. After several modest successes, a truce was called and the Saxons handed over to the Romans young men fit for duty in the Roman military \u2013 in exchange for free passage back to their homeland. The Romans ambushed them and destroyed the entire invading force.<ref>Rike, R.L., ''Apex Omnium: Religion in the Res Gestae of Ammianus'' (1987), pg. 91; Jones, Martindale and Morris, ''The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire'' Vol. I (1971), pgs. 615-616</ref>\n\nValentinian meanwhile tried to persuade the [[Burgundians]] \u2013 bitter enemies of the Alamanni \u2013 to attack [[Macrian]], a powerful Alamannic chieftain. If the Alamanni tried to flee, Valentinian would be waiting for them with his army. Negotiations with the Burgundians broke down when Valentinian, in his usual high-handed manner, refused to meet with the Burgundian envoys and personally assure them of Roman support. Nevertheless, rumors of a Roman alliance with the Burgundians did have the effect of scattering the Alamanni through fear of an imminent attack from their enemies. This event allowed the ''[[magister equitum]]'' [[Count Theodosius|Theodosius]] to attack the Alamanni through Raetia \u2013 taking many Alamannic prisoners. These captured Alamanni were settled in the [[Po river]] valley in Italy, where they were still settled at the time Ammianus wrote his history.\n\nValentinian campaigned unsuccessfully for four more years to defeat Macrian who in 372 barely escaped capture by Theodosius. Meanwhile, Valentinian continued to recruit heavily from Alamanni friendly to Rome. He sent the Alamannic king Fraomarius, as a Tribune, to Britain in 372-373 with an army in order to replenish troops there and made the noblemen Bitheridius and [[Hortarius]] commanders in his army although Hortarius was soon executed for conspiring with Macrian. Valentinian\u2019s Alamannic campaigns, however, were hampered by troubles first in Africa, and later on the Danube river. In 374 Valentinian was forced to make peace with Macrian because the Emperor's presence was needed to counter an invasion of Illyricum by the Quadi and Sarmatians.\n\n===The Great Conspiracy===\nIn 367, Valentinian received reports from Britain that a combined force of [[Picts]], [[Attacotti]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] had killed the ''[[Comes litoris Saxonici]]'' [[Nectaridus]] and ''[[Dux Britanniarum]]'' [[Fullofaudes]]. At the same time, Frankish and Saxon forces were raiding the coastal areas of northern Gaul. The empire was in the midst of the [[Great Conspiracy]] \u2013 and was in danger of losing control of Britain altogether. Valentinian set out for Britain, sending ''Comes domesticorum'' Severus ahead of him to investigate. Severus was not able to correct the situation and returned to Gaul, meeting Valentinian at [[Samarobriva]]. Valentinian then sent Jovinus to Britain and promoted Severus to magister peditum. It was at this time that Valentinian fell ill and a battle for succession broke out between Severus, a representative of the army, and Rusticus Julianus, ''magister memoriae'' and a representative of the Gallic nobility. Valentinian soon recovered however and appointed his son Gratian as his co-Augustus in the west. Ammianus remarks that such an action was unprecedented. Jovinus quickly returned saying that he needed more men to take care of the situation. In 368 Valentinian appointed Theodosius as the new ''[[Comes Britanniarum]]'' with instructions to return Britain to Roman rule. Meanwhile, Severus and Jovinus were to accompany the emperor on his campaign against the Alamanni.\n\nTheodosius arrived in 368 with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], [[Heruli]], Jovii and Victores legions. Landing at [[Rutupi\u00e6]], he proceeded to [[Londinium]] restoring order to southern Britain. Later, he rallied the remaining garrison which was originally stationed in Britain; it was apparent the units had lost their cohesiveness when Fullofaudes and Nectaridus had been defeated. Theodosius sent for [[Civilis (vicarius)|Civilis]] to be installed as the new [[vicarius]] of the [[diocese]] and [[Dulcitius]] as an additional general.\nIn 369, Theodosius set about reconquering the areas north of [[London]]; putting down the revolt of [[Valentinus (rebel)|Valentinus]], the brother-in-law of a [[vicarius]], [[Maximinus (praetorian prefect)|Maximinus]]. Subsequently, Theodosius restored the rest of Britain to the empire and rebuilt many fortifications \u2013 renaming northern Britain '[[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]]'. After his return in 369, Valentinian promoted Theodosius to ''magister equitum'' in place of Jovinus.\n\n===Revolt in Africa and crises on the Danube===\n[[File:Missorio di valentiniano I, argento, 364-75 ca., dall'arve, 02.JPG|thumb|right|Silver missorium (heavily worn) believed to depict Valentinian I. The armoured and haloed emperor is flanked by infantry soldiers, he holds a [[labarum]] in one hand and an orb surmounted by a figure of Victory in the other, ca. 364-375]]\nIn 372, the rebellion of [[Firmus (4th century usurper)|Firmus]] broke out in the still-devastated African provinces. This rebellion was driven by the corruption of the ''comes'' Romanus. Romanus took sides in the murderous disputes among the legitimate and illegitimate children of Nubel, a Moorish prince and leading Roman client in Africa. Resentment of Romanus' peculations and his failure to defend the province from desert nomads caused some of the provincials to revolt. Valentinian                   sent in Theodosius to restore imperial control. Over the following two years Theodosius uncovered Romanus' crimes, arrested him and his supporters, and defeated Firmus.\n\nIn 373, hostilities erupted with the [[Quadi]], a group of Germanic-speaking people living on the upper Danube. Like the Alamanni, the Quadi were outraged that Valentinian was building fortifications in their territory. They complained and sent deputations to the ''magister armorum per Illyricum'' Aequitius, who promised to refer the matter to Valentinian. However, the increasingly influential minister Maximinus, now praetorian prefect of Gaul, blamed Aequitius to Valentinian for the trouble, and managed to have him promote his son Marcellianus to finish the project.<ref>Gibbon, p. 894</ref> The protests of Quadic leaders continued to delay the project, and to put an end to their clamor Marcellianus murdered the Quadic king [[Gabinius (king)|Gabinius]] at a banquet ostensibly arranged for peaceful negotiations. This roused the Quadi to war, along with their allies the Sarmatians. During the fall, they crossed the Danube and began ravaging the province of [[Pannonia Valeria]]. The marauders could not penetrate the fortified cities, but they heavily damaged the unprotected countryside. Two legions were sent in but failed to coordinate and were routed by the Sarmatians. Meanwhile, another group of Sarmatians invaded [[Moesia]], but were driven back by the son of Theodosius, ''Dux Moesiae'' and later emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]].\n\nValentinian did not receive news of these crises until late 374. The following spring he set out from Trier and arrived at [[Carnuntum]], which was deserted. There he was met by Sarmatian envoys who begged forgiveness for their actions. Valentinian replied that he would investigate what had happened and act accordingly. Valentinian ignored Marcellianus\u2019 treacherous actions and decided to punish the Quadi. He was accompanied by Sebastianus and [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]], and spent the summer months preparing for the campaign. In the fall he crossed the Danube at [[Aquincum]] into Quadi territory.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.5.13</ref> After pillaging Quadi lands without opposition, he retired to [[Sabaria|Savaria]] to winter quarters.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XXX.5.14</ref>\n\n====Death====\nWithout waiting for the spring he decided to continue campaigning and moved from Savaria to [[Szony|Brigetio]]. Once he arrived on 17 November, he received a deputation from the Quadi. In return for supplying fresh recruits to the Roman army, the Quadi were to be allowed to leave in peace. However, before the envoys left they were granted an audience with Valentinian. The envoys insisted that the conflict was caused by the building of Roman forts in their lands; furthermore individual bands of Quadi were not necessarily bound to the rule of the chiefs who had made treaties with the Romans \u2013 and thus might attack the Romans at any time. The attitude of the envoys so enraged Valentinian that he suffered a burst blood vessel in the skull while angrily yelling at them, provoking his death<ref>{{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Edited in Seven Volumes with Introduction, Notes, Appendices, and Index|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108050739|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgtcg0nMg_IC&pg=PA66}}</ref> on November 17, 375.\n\n== Reputation ==\n[[A.H.M. Jones]] writes that although Valentinian I was \"less of a boor\" than his chief rival for election to the imperial throne, \"he was of a violent and brutal temper, and not only uncultivated himself, but hostile to cultivated persons\". According to [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]], \"he hated the well-dressed and educated and wealthy and well-born\". He was, however, an able soldier and a conscientious administrator, and took an interest in the welfare of the humbler classes, from which his father had risen. Unfortunately his good intentions were often frustrated by a bad choice of ministers, and \"an obstinate belief in their merits despite all evidence to the contrary.\"<ref>A.H.M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284\u2013602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 139.</ref> He was a founder of schools, and provided medical attendance for the poor of [[Rome]], by appointing a physician for each of the fourteen districts of the city.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Valentinian I.|volume=27|page=851}}</ref> He also reissued an edict of [[Constantine I]] making infanticide a capital offence.<ref>Gibbon, ch. XIV., p. 375; ch. XXV., p. 859</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the benevolence of these more generous edicts, Valentinian was remarkable for cruelty and barbarism in his private affairs.\nHe often had servants and attendants executed on trifling charges, and was reportedly accustomed to keep two bears, known as ''Micca Aurea'' (''golden camel''), and ''Innocence'', in an iron cage which was transported wherever he went, whom he employed to execute the sentence, which he often delivered, of capital punishment. At length ''Innocence'', when she was considered to have faithfully discharged her office, was released with the emperor's good wishes into her native wilds.<ref>[[Charles Kingsley]], ''The Roman And The Teuton, A Series Of Lectures delivered before the University of Cambridge'', (Macmillan And Co., 1889, London), lecture II, ''The Dying Empire''</ref>\n\nValentinian was a [[Christians|Christian]] but permitted liberal religious freedom to all his subjects, proscribing only some forms of rituals such as particular types of sacrifices, and banning the practice of magic. Again, Valentinian steadily set his face against the increasing wealth and worldliness of the clergy. He issued a pointed edict via [[Pope Damasus I]], forbidding the grant of bequests to Christian clergy-men; and another forcing members of the sacerdotal order to discharge the public duties owed on account of their property, or else relinquish it.<ref>Gibbon, ch. XXV., p. 864; ch. XX., p. 662, editor's note</ref><ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]] gives an interesting account in his Historia Ecclesiastica of Valentinian's marriages, that has inspired some to call this emperor [[Polygamy in Christianity|polygamous]]. According to the text: the empress [[Justina (empress)|Justina]] \"became known to [[Marina Severa]], wife of the emperor Valentinian, and had frequent dialogue with the empress, until their intimacy at length grew to such an extent that they were accustomed to bathe together. When Severa saw Justina in the bath she was greatly struck with the beauty of the virgin, and spoke of her to the emperor; saying that the daughter of Justus was so lovely a creature, and possessed of such symmetry of form, that she herself, though a woman, was altogether charmed with her. The emperor, treasuring this description by his wife in his own mind, considered with himself how he could espouse Justina, without repudiating Severa, as she had borne him Gratian, whom he had created Augustus a little while before. He accordingly framed a law, and caused it to be published throughout all the cities, by which any man was permitted to have two lawful wives. The law was promulgated and he married Justina, by whom he had Valentinian the younger.\" (Book IV, chapt. 31.)<ref>Translated by A.C. Zenos. From Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series, Vol. 2. Edited by Philip Schaff and Henry Wace. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1890.)</ref>\n\nThis story is only known from Socrates and no trace of any edict by any emperor allowing polygamy exists. Valentinian I may have divorced Severa according to Roman Law, which allowed for divorce (see [[Women in Ancient Rome]]).<ref>Frier, Bruce W. and McGinn, Thomas A.J.: A Casebook on Roman Family Law (American Philological Association) OUP USA 2003. Part D, The End of Marriage</ref> However, since divorce was not acknowledged by Christians,<ref>Matthew 19, 4\u20136.</ref> Socrates contemptuously describes him as a bigamist. It is also possible that Socrates attempted to accuse Justina, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], of fornication, a common aspersion against other cults. According to [[John Malalas]], the [[Chronicon Paschale]], and [[John of Nikiu]], the empress Severa was banished by Valentinian I for conducting an illegal transaction, before he consorted with Justina. Barnes believes this story to be an attempt to justify the divorce of Valentinian I without accusing the emperor.<ref>Timothy Barnes, \"Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality\" (1998), p. 123\u2013125</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Byzantine Empire}}\n*[[List of Byzantine emperors]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n===Primary sources===\n*Ammianus Marcellinus.
