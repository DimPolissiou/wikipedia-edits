They were built by two shipbuilders, the Austrian [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] and the Hungarian [[Ganz & Danubius]], with six ships built each. They served through the [[First World War]], with one of the ships, ''Tb 11'', defecting to Italy in 1917.

For example, ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999) is a prequel to ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) but is only a ''predecessor'' prequel of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) because of the release order. Likewise, 1984's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' is a prequel to 1981's ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark|Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark]],'' in that it is set in 1935, one year before the first film.\n\n===Complications===\nSometimes \"prequel\" describes followups where it is not always possible to apply a label defined solely in terms of [[intertextuality]].<ref name=Jess-Cooke/> In the case of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', the narrative combines elements of a prequel with those of a more generalized sequel by having two intercut narrative strands, one continuing from the first film (the mafia family story under the leadership of [[Michael Corleone]]), and one, completely separate, detailing events that precede it (the story of his father [[Vito Corleone]] in his youth). In this sense the film can be regarded as both a \"prequel and a sequel\" (i.e., both a prior and a continuing story), and is often referred to in this manner.<ref name=Jess-Cooke>{{cite book|last=Jess-Cooke|first=Carolyn|authorlink=Carolyn Jess-Cooke|year=2009|title=Film Sequels: Theory and Practice from Hollywood to Bollywood|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=9780748626038|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sw0mjBBbybUC&pg=PA6 6]}}</ref>\n\nIn the original ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' series, even though the latter three films depict world events chronologically prior to those of the first two films, the narrative itself is continuous for the main characters, as three apes from the first two films go back in time.

Likewise, 1984's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' is a prequel to 1981's ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark|Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark]],'' in that it is set in 1935, one year before the first film.\n\n===Complications===\nSometimes \"prequel\" describes followups where it is not always possible to apply a label defined solely in terms of [[intertextuality]].<ref name=Jess-Cooke/> In the case of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', the narrative combines elements of a prequel with those of a more generalized sequel by having two intercut narrative strands, one continuing from the first film ([[the mafia]] family story under the leadership of [[Michael Corleone]]), and one, completely separate, detailing events that precede it (the story of his father [[Vito Corleone]] in his youth). In this sense the film can be regarded as both a \"prequel and a sequel\" (i.e., both a prior and a continuing story), and is often referred to in this manner.<ref name=Jess-Cooke>{{cite book|last=Jess-Cooke|first=Carolyn|authorlink=Carolyn Jess-Cooke|year=2009|title=Film Sequels: Theory and Practice from Hollywood to Bollywood|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=9780748626038|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sw0mjBBbybUC&pg=PA6 6]}}</ref>\n\nIn the original ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' series, even though the latter three films depict world events chronologically prior to those of the first two films, the narrative itself is continuous for the main characters, as three apes from the first two films go back in time. The later installments ''[[Escape from the Planet of the Apes]]'' served as both a sequel and prequel to the first film.<ref name=dirks>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sci-fifilms5.html|title=Science Fiction Films Part 5|first=Tim|last=Dirks|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] Filmsite|quote=A sequel and prequel to the first film}}</ref><ref name=britt>{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/whos-your-caesar-re-watching-conquest-of-the-planet-of-the-apes|title=Who's Your Caesar?

He also participated in several muliti man matches before returning to WCW.<ref name=\"Brian Pillman: Matches, 2\"/>\n\nAt the end of 1995, Pillman developed his \"Loose Cannon\" [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], cultivating a reputation for unpredictable behavior. During this period of time, Pillman changed his once Hollywood Blond and Flyin' Brian clean athletic look for an edgy, out of control image. Even his allies in the Horsemen, especially Anderson, were wary of his behavior and tried in vain to keep him in check. Almost all of the time Pillman could be seen wearing leather vests, sunglasses, jewelry and graphic T-shirts with skulls, monsters and sayings on them. Pillman frequently blurred fact and fiction with his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work|worked]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Shoot|shoots]]. In a match with Eddie Guerrero on the January 23, 1996 episode of ''[[Clash of the Champions XXXII]]'', Pillman grabbed commentator [[Bobby Heenan]] by the collar, causing Heenan (who had a history of neck problems) to blurt out \"What the fuck are you doing?\" live on the air.<ref>{{cite book|title=Titan Shattered: Wrestling with Confidence and Paranoia|last=Dixon|first=James|page=103 pp|year=2015|publisher=History of Wrestling|isbn=978-1326355814}}</ref>\n\nPillman outed [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] as [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Booker|booker]] during the February 1996 [[SuperBrawl VI]] [[pay-per-view]] in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|I Respect You Strap match]] where the loser announces that they respect the other wrestler, much like an [[\"I Quit\" match]]. Pillman lost to Sullivan, after Pillman grabbed the microphone and said to Sullivan \"I respect you, booker man.\" The words \"booker man\" were cut from the commercial tape. The next day after SuperBrawl VI, Pillman was fired by WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]]. In Bischoff's autobiography he said that Pillman was fired so that he could go and develop the \"loose cannon\" gimmick in ECW then return to WCW with more [[Glossary of professional wrestling#Legit|legitimate]] [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]]. Bischoff claims it was a plan he and Pillman came up with together. It would later backfire on Bischoff as Pillman did not return.<ref>{{cite book|title=Between the Ropes: Wrestling's Greatest Triumphs and Failures|last1=Fritz|first1=Brian|last2=Murray|first2=Christopher|page=88|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-55022-726-0}}</ref>\n\n===Return to ECW (1996)===\nImmediately following his departure from WCW, Pillman returned to ECW and appeared at the promotion's annual [[Internet]] [[Fan convention|convention]], [[CyberSlam (1996)|ECW CyberSlam]], on February 17, 1996. During an interview conducted in the ring by [[Joey Styles]], Pillman insulted Bischoff, calling him a commentator, a \"[[gofer]]\", and a \"piece of shit\". He turned his attention to the ECW audience, derisively calling them \"[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Smart|smart]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Mark|marks]]\". After Styles attempted to end the interview, Pillman threatened to \"yank out (his) [[Human penis|Johnson]]\" and [[Urination|urinate]] in the ring. Pillman was confronted by ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]], booker [[Paul Heyman]], and wrestler [[Shane Douglas]], who had him removed from the ring by security guards. While being dragged from the arena, Pillman attacked a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Plant|plant]] sitting in the audience with a [[fork]] he produced from his boot. Although he did not wrestle for ECW, Pillman made several further appearances with the promotion, engaging in a war of words with Douglas, setting up a proposed feud.\n\nHe gained the backstage ire of [[New Jack]] when he referred to Jack's [[The Gangstas|tag team with]] [[Jamal Mustafa|Mustafa Saed]] as \"Niggas with Attitudes\" when crashing one of their interviews, a reference to the rap group [[N.W.A]].<ref>[http://www.edgeuniversity.net/forum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1148&sid=10fdec7388f74f661956510cebe056af Edge University.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131301/http://www.edgeuniversity.net/forum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1148&sid=10fdec7388f74f661956510cebe056af |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> With his \"Loose Cannon\" persona, Pillman became the talk of all three major promotions, as he was on his way to the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) after he was scheduled to wrestle Shane Douglas in ECW. On April 15, 1996, Pillman was badly injured after falling asleep while driving his [[Hummer H1]] in [[Kentucky]] and driving into a tree trunk, flipping the vehicle. He was in a [[coma]] for a week and suffered a shattered ankle, forcing doctors to fuse it together in a fixed walking position and thus forcing Pillman to abandon his previous high-flying wrestling style for a more grounded style.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Albano|first1=Lou|last2=Sugar|first2=Bert Randolph|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Pro Wrestling|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-0-02-863961-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00alba|year=2000}}</ref>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/WWF===\n====Signing (1996)====\nPillman signed a contract with the WWF on June 10, 1996, with the signing announced in a [[News conference|press conference]]. He was the second wrestler to sign a guaranteed contract with the WWF after Marc Mero, indicative of the period in which [[Vince McMahon]] began to protect the company from abruptly losing talent to WCW, with [[Lex Luger]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Scott Hall]] all previously doing so. Pillman acted as a commentator while recovering from his broken ankle, transitioning to a wrestling role after attacking an unruly fan during an episode of ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun Saturday Night]]'' on June 30, 1996 in Detroit.<ref>{{cite book |author= Shoemaker, David | title=The Squared Circle: Life, Death, and Professional Wrestling | page= ?| publisher= Penguin | year= 2013 | isbn= 978-1592407675}}</ref><ref name=\"Hofstede 1999 208\">{{cite book |last=Hofstede |first=David |date=1999 |title=Slammin': Wrestling's Greatest Heroes and Villains |url=https://archive.org/details/slamminwrestling0000hofs/page/208 |location=Toronto |publisher=ECW Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/slamminwrestling0000hofs/page/208 208] |isbn=1-55022-370-4 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n====Pillman's got a gun (1996)====\n\nOn the November 4 episode of ''Raw'', Pillman took part in the infamous \"Pillman's got a gun\" angle with his [[The Hollywood Blonds#Steve Austin and Brian Pillman|former teammate]] [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. When Pillman initially arrived to the WWF, he aligned himself immediately with his long-time friend and former teammate Austin, serving as his lackey while he recovered. However, Pillman began noticeably favoring Austin's nemesis, Bret Hart, before Austin had enough and brutally attacked him in the ring during an interview on an episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' on October 27, 1996. Austin and Pillman had been feuding for several weeks, and Austin finally decided to take matters into his own hands and visit Pillman, whom he had already injured, at his home in [[Walton, Kentucky]]. WWF interviewer Kevin Kelly sat in Pillman's house with a camera crew and the Pillman family, while Pillman's friends surrounded the house to protect him. Austin was attacked by Pillman's friends as soon as he arrived, but he quickly subdued them. He then proceeded to break into Pillman's home and advance on his nemesis. However, Pillman responded by producing a pistol that he had displayed earlier and pointing it at a hesitant Austin, while Kelly and Pillman's wife Melanie screamed for help.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice|author-link=Patrice Oppliger|title=Wrestling and hypermasculinity|year=2004|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=80|isbn=9780786481361}}</ref> The camera feed was then disrupted, with the scene fading to black.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice|author-link=Patrice Oppliger|title=Wrestling and hypermasculinity|year=2004|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=81|isbn=9780786481361}}</ref> The on-scene director contacted commentator Vince McMahon and reported that he had heard \"a couple explosions\".

He began feuding with his former partner, Steve Austin. In the course of the feud, Austin was given on-screen credit for damaging Pillman's ankle in late October 1996 after placing it in between the seat and backrest of a folded chair and then jumping on the chair (this particular style of attack has since been dubbed \"The Pillmanizer\", in honor of this incident). On July 6 at [[In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede]] in Bret's hometown [[Calgary]], Pillman and The Hart Foundation defeated the American team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, [[Goldust]], [[Ken Shamrock]] and [[The Road Warriors|The Legion of Doom]] in a 10-man tag team match in the main event.\n\nAfter his feud with Austin, he feuded with [[Goldust]] over [[Terri Runnels|Marlena]] until his death.<ref name=Encyclopedia/><ref name=\"Hofstede 1999 208\"/> Pillman defeated Goldust at [[Ground Zero: In Your House|In Your House 17: Ground Zero]].

In September 1995, Pillman formed a team with Arn Anderson and began feuding with Ric Flair. On September 4, 1995, Pillman wrestled the first match on the inaugural episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' by defeating [[Jushin Liger|Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger]] in a [[SuperBrawl II]] rematch. After costing Flair a match to Arn Anderson at [[Fall Brawl (1995)|Fall Brawl]], Flair recruited the help of [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to team up against Pillman and Anderson at [[Halloween Havoc (1995)|Halloween Havoc]]. Pillman and Anderson attacked Flair before the match, forcing Sting to come out alone. When Sting needed a tag the most, Flair came out at the last minute with a bandage on his head, tagged Sting and immediately turned and attacked him removing the fake bandage from his head to show it was all a plan between Pillman, Anderson and Flair from the start.

During this period of time, Pillman changed his once Hollywood Blond and Flyin' Brian clean athletic look for an edgy, out of control image. Even his allies in the Horsemen, especially Anderson, were wary of his behavior and tried in vain to keep him in check. Almost all of the time Pillman could be seen wearing leather vests, sunglasses, jewelry and graphic T-shirts with skulls, monsters and sayings on them. Pillman frequently blurred fact and fiction with his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work|worked]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Shoot|shoots]]. In a match with Eddie Guerrero on the January 23, 1996 episode of ''[[Clash of the Champions XXXII]]'', Pillman grabbed commentator [[Bobby Heenan]] by the collar, causing Heenan (who had a history of neck problems) to blurt out \"What the fuck are you doing?\" live on the air.<ref>{{cite book|title=Titan Shattered: Wrestling with Confidence and Paranoia|last=Dixon|first=James|page=103 pp|year=2015|publisher=History of Wrestling|isbn=978-1326355814}}</ref>\n\nPillman outed [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] as [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Booker|booker]] during the February 1996 [[SuperBrawl VI]] [[pay-per-view]] in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|I Respect You Strap match]] where the loser announces that they respect the other wrestler, much like an [[\"I Quit\" match]]. Pillman lost to Sullivan, after Pillman grabbed the microphone and said to Sullivan \"I respect you, booker man.\" The words \"booker man\" were cut from the commercial tape. The next day after SuperBrawl VI, Pillman was fired by WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]]. In Bischoff's autobiography he said that Pillman was fired so that he could go and develop the \"loose cannon\" gimmick in ECW then return to WCW with more [[Glossary of professional wrestling#Legit|legitimate]] [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]]. Bischoff claims it was a plan he and Pillman came up with together.

He turned his attention to the ECW audience, derisively calling them \"[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Smart|smart]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Mark|marks]]\". After Styles attempted to end the interview, Pillman threatened to \"yank out (his) [[Human penis|Johnson]]\" and [[Urination|urinate]] in the ring. Pillman was confronted by ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]], booker [[Paul Heyman]], and wrestler [[Shane Douglas]], who had him removed from the ring by security guards. While being dragged from the arena, Pillman attacked a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Plant|plant]] sitting in the audience with a [[fork]] he produced from his boot. Although he did not wrestle for ECW, Pillman made several further appearances with the promotion, engaging in a war of words with Douglas, setting up a proposed feud.\n\nHe gained the backstage ire of [[New Jack]] when he referred to Jack's [[The Gangstas|tag team with]] [[Jamal Mustafa|Mustafa Saed]] as \"Niggas with Attitudes\" when crashing one of their interviews, a reference to the rap group [[N.W.A]].<ref>[http://www.edgeuniversity.net/forum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1148&sid=10fdec7388f74f661956510cebe056af Edge University.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131301/http://www.edgeuniversity.net/forum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1148&sid=10fdec7388f74f661956510cebe056af |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> With his \"Loose Cannon\" persona, Pillman became the talk of all three major promotions, as he was on his way to the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) after he was scheduled to wrestle Shane Douglas in ECW.

He was the second wrestler to sign a guaranteed contract with the WWF after Marc Mero, indicative of the period in which [[Vince McMahon]] began to protect the company from abruptly losing talent to WCW, with [[Lex Luger]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Scott Hall]] all previously doing so. Pillman acted as a commentator while recovering from his broken ankle, transitioning to a wrestling role after attacking an unruly fan during an episode of ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun Saturday Night]]'' on June 30, 1996 in Detroit.<ref>{{cite book |author= Shoemaker, David | title=The Squared Circle: Life, Death, and Professional Wrestling | page= ?| publisher= Penguin | year= 2013 | isbn= 978-1592407675}}</ref><ref name=\"Hofstede 1999 208\">{{cite book |last=Hofstede |first=David |date=1999 |title=Slammin': Wrestling's Greatest Heroes and Villains |url=https://archive.org/details/slamminwrestling0000hofs/page/208 |location=Toronto |publisher=ECW Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/slamminwrestling0000hofs/page/208 208] |isbn=1-55022-370-4 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n====Pillman's got a gun (1996)====\n\nOn the November 4 episode of ''Raw'', Pillman took part in the infamous \"Pillman's got a gun\" angle with his [[The Hollywood Blonds#Steve Austin and Brian Pillman|former teammate]] [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. When Pillman initially arrived to the WWF, he aligned himself immediately with his long-time friend and former teammate Austin, serving as his lackey while he recovered. However, Pillman began noticeably favoring Austin's nemesis, Bret Hart, before Austin had enough and brutally attacked him in the ring during an interview on an episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' on October 27, 1996. Austin and Pillman had been feuding for several weeks, and Austin finally decided to take matters into his own hands and visit Pillman, whom he had already injured, at his home in [[Walton, Kentucky]]. WWF interviewer Kevin Kelly sat in Pillman's house with a camera crew and the Pillman family, while Pillman's friends surrounded the house to protect him. Austin was attacked by Pillman's friends as soon as he arrived, but he quickly subdued them. He then proceeded to break into Pillman's home and advance on his nemesis. However, Pillman responded by producing a pistol that he had displayed earlier and pointing it at a hesitant Austin, while Kelly and Pillman's wife Melanie screamed for help.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice|author-link=Patrice Oppliger|title=Wrestling and hypermasculinity|year=2004|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=80|isbn=9780786481361}}</ref> The camera feed was then disrupted, with the scene fading to black.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice|author-link=Patrice Oppliger|title=Wrestling and hypermasculinity|year=2004|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=81|isbn=9780786481361}}</ref> The on-scene director contacted commentator Vince McMahon and reported that he had heard \"a couple explosions\". The transmission was restored shortly before the end of ''Raw'', and viewers witnessed Pillman's friends dragging Austin from the house while Pillman aimed the gun at Austin and announced his intention to \"kill that son of a bitch!\" Pillman also slipped up by saying \"get out of the fucking way!\" on live television, which prevented it from being edited out. The WWF and Pillman eventually apologized for the entire angle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice|author-link=Patrice Oppliger|title=Wrestling and hypermasculinity|year=2004|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=73|isbn=9780786481361}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewrestlingnews.com/articles/blast-from-the-past-the-feud-that-changed-wrestling-for-the-better-austin-pillman/2|title=Blast From The Past: The Feud That Changed Wrestling For The Better, Austin/Pillman|date=January 27, 2016|publisher=ewrestlingnews.com|author=Smith, Craig}}</ref>\n\n====The Hart Foundation (1997)====\nAfter [[WrestleMania 13]], Pillman returned and aligned himself with his real life close friends [[Bret Hart]], [[Owen Hart]], [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]], and [[Jim Neidhart]] as part of the anti-American [[The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]], turning Pillman heel, all of whom he was familiar with from his Stampede Wrestling roots. He began feuding with his former partner, Steve Austin. In the course of the feud, Austin was given on-screen credit for damaging Pillman's ankle in late October 1996 after placing it in between the seat and backrest of a folded chair and then jumping on the chair (this particular style of attack has since been dubbed \"The Pillmanizer\", in honor of this incident). On July 6 at [[In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede]] in Bret's hometown [[Calgary]], Pillman and The Hart Foundation defeated the American team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, [[Goldust]], [[Ken Shamrock]] and [[The Road Warriors|The Legion of Doom]] in a 10-man tag team match in the main event.\n\nAfter his feud with Austin, he feuded with [[Goldust]] over [[Terri Runnels|Marlena]] until his death.<ref name=Encyclopedia/><ref name=\"Hofstede 1999 208\"/> Pillman defeated Goldust at [[Ground Zero: In Your House|In Your House 17: Ground Zero]].

Both Pillman and the Harts have referred to themselves as being as close as siblings.

After the [[Corsican Republic]] was declared in 1755 the Genoese continued to hold several citadels, including Ajaccio, until the [[French conquest of Corsica|French]] took control of the island.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Ajacciens'' or ''Ajacciennes''.<ref>[http://www.habitants.fr/habitants_departement_corse-du-sud_2A.html Inhabitants of Corse-du-Sud] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The most famous of these is [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who was born in Ajaccio in 1769, and whose ancestral home, the [[Maison Bonaparte]], is now a museum.

Therefore, the [[urban area]] of Ajaccio is located in the east of the commune on a narrow coastal strip forming a densely populated arc. The rest of the territory is natural with habitation of little importance and spread thinly. Suburbanization occurs north and east of the main urban area.\n\nThe original urban core, close to the old marshy plain of ''Cannes'' was abandoned in favour of the current city which was built near the ''Punta della Lechia''. It has undergone various improvements, particularly under Napoleon, who originated the two current major structural arteries (the ''Cours Napoleon'' oriented north\u2013south and the ''Cours Grandval'' oriented east\u2013west).\n\nAjaccio experienced a demographic boom in the 1960s, which explains why 85% of dwellings are post-1949.<ref>''The Cities of France'', by Fabri\u00e8s-Verfaillie et Stragiotti, 2000 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> This is reflected in the layout of the city which is marked by very large areas of low-rise buildings and concrete towers, especially on the heights (''Jardins de l'Empereur'') and in the north of the city - e.g. the waterfront, ''Les Cannes'', and ''Les Salines''. A dichotomy appears in the landscape between the old city and the imposing modern buildings. Ajaccio gives the image of a city built on two different levels.\n\n===Climate===\nThe city has a [[Mediterranean climate]] which is ''Csa'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The average annual sunshine is 2726 hours.\n\nThere are important local climatic variations, especially with wind exposure and total precipitation, between the city centre, the airport, and the  ''\u00eeles Sanguinaires''.

Among these, the most prestigious suggests that the city was founded by the Greek legendary hero  ''[[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]'' and named after him. Other more realistic explanations are, for example, that the name could be related to the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] ''agghiacciu'' meaning \"sheep pens\". Another explanation, supported by [[Byzantine]] sources from around the year 600AD called the city ''Agiation'' which suggests a possible Greek origin for the word,<ref>Manuscript variants are ''Agration'' and ''Agiagium'' but the use of a Greek ending does not necessarily indicate anything at all about ethnicity. At this late date geographers used either Greek or Latin forms at will. The word is no more decipherable in Greek than it is in Latin; attempts to connect two or three letters with [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] roots amount to speculation.</ref> ''agath\u00e8'' could mean \"good luck\" or \"good mooring\" (this was also the root of the name of the city of [[Agde]]).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ajaccio Bon Pl JPG.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Statue of Napoleon in the Place Foch]]\n[[File:Ajaccio Grand H\u00f4tel Continental.jpg|Ex Grand H\u00f4tel Continental (now office of the ''Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Corse'')|thumb|250px|right]]\n\n===Antiquity===\nThe city was not mentioned by the Greek geographer [[Ptolemy of Alexandria]] in the 2nd century AD despite the presence of a place called ''Ourkinion'' in the ''Cinarca'' area. It is likely that the city of Ajaccio had its first development at this time. The 2nd century was a period of prosperity in the Mediterranean basin (the [[Pax Romana]]) and there was a need for a proper port at the head of the several valleys that lead to the Gulf able to accommodate large ships. Some important underwater archaeological discoveries recently made of Roman ships tend to confirm this. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFurther excavations conducted recently led to the discovery of important early Christian remains likely to significantly a reevaluation upwards of the size of Ajaccio city in [[Late Antiquity]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]]. The city was in any case already significant enough to be the seat of a [[diocese]], mentioned by [[Pope Gregory the Great]] in 591. The city was then further north than the location chosen later by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] - in the location of the existing quarters of ''Castel Vecchio'' and ''Sainte-Lucie''.\n\nThe earliest certain written record of a settlement at Ajaccio with a name ancestral to its name was the exhortation in Epistle 77 written in 601AD by [[Gregory the great]] to the Defensor Boniface, one of two known rectors of the early Corsican church,<ref>{{cite book|pages=318|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages, 476\u2013752|first=Jeffrey|last=Richards|year=1979|ISBN=0-7100-0098-7|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London}}</ref> to tell him not to leave [[Al\u00e9ria]] and Adjacium without bishops. There is no earlier use of the term and Adjacium is not an attested [[Latin]] word, which probably means that it is a Latinization of a word in some other language. The [[Ravenna Cosmography]] of about 700 AD cites Agiation,<ref>{{cite book|title=Ravennatis Anonymi Cosmographia et Guidonis Geographica|pages=413|author=Anonymous of Ravenna|author2=Guido|author3= [[Gustav Parthey]]|author4= Moritz Pinder|year=1860|location=Berolini|publisher=in aedibvs Friderici Nicolai}} {{in lang|la}}.

There is, however, no evidence at all of a Greek presence on the west coast and the [[Ionians]] at [[Al\u00e9ria]] on the east coast had been expelled by the Etruscans long before Roman domination.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n[[Ptolemy]], who must come the closest to representing indigenous names, lists the Lochra River just south of a feature he calls the \"sandy shore\" on the southwest coast. If the shore is the Campo dell'Oro (Place of Gold) the Lochra would seem to be the combined mouth of the Gravona and Prunelli Rivers, neither one of which sounds like Lochra.\n\nNorth of there was a Roman city, Ourchinion. The western coastline was so distorted, however, that it is impossible to say where Adjacium was; certainly, he would have known its name and location if he had had any first-hand knowledge of the island and if in fact it was there. Ptolemy's Ourchinion is further north than Ajaccio and does not have the same name.

The Castello Vecchio (\"old castle\"), a ruined citadel, was believed to be Roman but turned out to have Gothic features. The hill was planted with vines. The farmers kept turning up artifacts and terracotta funerary urns that seemed to be Roman.\n\nIn the 20th century the hill was covered over with buildings and became a part of downtown Ajaccio. In 2005 construction plans for a lot on the hill offered the opportunity to the Institut national de recherches arch\u00e9ologiques preventatives (Inrap) to excavate. They found the [[baptistry]] of a 6th-century cathedral and large amounts of pottery dated to the 6th and 7th centuries AD; in other words, an early Christian town. A cemetery had been placed over the old church. In it was a single Roman grave covered over with roof tiles bearing short indecipherable inscriptions. The finds of the previous century had included Roman coins. This is the only evidence so far of a Roman city continuous with the early Christian one.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discovery of an Early Christian Baptistery in Ajaccio |url=http://www.inrap.fr/preventive-archaeology/In_the_News/Press_release/p-1346-Discovery_of_an_Early_Christian_Baptistery_in_Ajac.htm |publisher=Inrap |date=9 June 2005 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721001014/http://www.inrap.fr/preventive-archaeology/In_the_News/Press_release/p-1346-Discovery_of_an_Early_Christian_Baptistery_in_Ajac.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===The medieval Genoese period===\nIt has been established that after the 8th century the city, like most other Corsican coastal communities, strongly declined and disappeared almost completely. Nevertheless, a castle and a cathedral were still in place in 1492 which last was not demolished until 1748. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] were eager to assert their dominance in the south of the island and decided to rebuild the city of Ajaccio. Several sites were considered: the ''Pointe de la Parata'' (not chosen because it was too exposed to the wind), the ancient city (finally considered unsafe because of the proximity of the salt ponds), and finally the ''Punta della Lechia'' which was finally selected.\n\nWork began on the town on 21 April 1492 south of the Christian village by the [[Bank of Saint George]] at [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], who sent Cristoforo of Gandini, an architect, to build it. He began with a castle on Capo di Bolo, around which he constructed residences for several hundred people.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the city of Ajaccio|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.ajaccio.fr/Histoire-de-la-ville-d-Ajaccio_a12.html&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=4&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dadjacium%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26as_qdr%3Dall%26pwst%3D1|accessdate=16 May 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:Tour sanguinaires.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Genoese Tower.]]\n\nThe new city was essentially a colony of Genoa. The Corsicans were restricted from the city for some years.\n\nNevertheless, the town grew rapidly and became the administrative capital of the province of ''Au Del\u00e0 Des Monts'' (more or less the current ''[[Corse-du-Sud]]''). [[Bastia]] remained the capital of the entire island.\n\nAlthough at first populated exclusively by the Genoese, the city slowly opened to the Corsicans while the Ajaccians, almost to the French conquest, were legally citizens of the [[Republic of Genoa]] and were happy to distinguish themselves from the insular ''paesani'' who lived mainly in ''Borgu'', a suburb outside the city walls (the current ''rue Fesch'' was the main street).\n\n===The attachment to France===\nAjaccio was occupied from 1553 to 1559 by the French, but it again fell to the Genoese after the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Treaty of Cateau Cambresis]] in the latter year.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ajaccio|volume=1|page=451}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the [[Republic of Genoa]] was strong enough to keep Corsica until 1755, the year [[Pasquale Paoli]] proclaimed the [[Corsican Republic]]. Paoli took most of the island for the republic, but he was unable to force Genoese troops out of the citadels of [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]], [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], Ajaccio, [[Bastia]] and [[Algajola]]. Leaving them there, he went on to build the nation, while the Republic of Genoa was left to ponder prospects and solutions. Their ultimate solution was to [[French conquest of Corsica|sell Corsica to France]] in 1768 and French troops of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] replaced Genoese ones in the citadels, including Ajaccio's.\n\nCorsica was formally annexed to France in 1780.\n\n===Napoleon I===\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (born as Napoleone di Buonaparte) was born at Ajaccio in the same year as the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]], 1769. The Buonaparte family at the time had a modest four-story home in town (now a museum known as [[Maison Bonaparte]]) and a rarely used country home in the hills north of the city (now site of the [[Arboretum des Milelli]]). The father of the family, attorney Carlo di Buonaparte, was secretary to [[Pasquale Paoli]] during the [[Corsican Republic]].\n[[File:2016 Ajaccio - Napoleondenkmal.jpg|thumb|left|Ajaccio, Place De Gaulle - monument Napol\u00e9on]]\n\nAfter the defeat of Paoli, the [[Charles Louis de Marbeuf|Comte de Marbeuf]] began to meet with some leading Corsicans to outline the shape of the future and enlist their assistance. The Comte was among a delegation from Ajaccio in 1769, offered his loyalty and was appointed assessor.\n\nMarbeuf also offered Carlo di Buonaparte an appointment for one of his sons to the [[Brienne-le-Ch\u00e2teau|Military College of Brienne]], but Napoleone did not speak French which was a requirement and he had to be at least ten years of age. There is a dispute concerning Napoleon's age because of this requirement; the emperor is known to have altered the civic records at Ajaccio concerning himself and it is possible that he was born in [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] in 1768 when his father was there on business. In any case Napoleon was sent to a school in Autun to learn basic French, then after a year went to Brienne from 1779\u20131784.<ref>https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/napoleon/napoleon-and-josephine/who-was-napoleon.html</ref><ref>{{cite book|pages=Chapter 1|title=The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte|first=Sabine|last=Baring-Gould|year=2006|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|isbn=0-543-95815-9|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\nAt Brienne Napoleon concentrated on studies. He wrote a boyish history of Corsica. He did not share his father's views but held [[Pasquale Paoli]] in high esteem and was at heart a Corsican nationalist. The top students were encouraged to go into the artillery. After graduation and a brief sojourn at the [[\u00c9cole Militaire|Military School of Paris]] Napoleon applied for a second-lieutenancy in the [[R\u00e9giment de La F\u00e8re (1765)|artillery regiment of La F\u00e8re]] at [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]] and after a time was given the position. Meanwhile, his father died and his mother was cast into poverty in Corsica, still having four children to support. Her only income was Napoleon's meager salary. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe regiment was in [[Auxonne]] when the revolution broke out in the summer of 1789. Napoleon returned on leave to Ajaccio in October, became a [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] and began to work for the revolution. The [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in Paris united Corsica to France and pardoned its exiles. Paoli returned in 1790 after 21 years and kissed the soil on which he stood. He and Napoleon met and toured the battlefield of Paoli's defeat. A national assembly at Orezza created the department of Corsica and Paoli was subsequently elected president. He commanded the national guard raised by Napoleon. After a brief return to his regiment Napoleon was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]] and came home again on leave in 1791. The death of a rich uncle relieved the family's poverty. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Ajaccio citadelle echauguette.jpg|thumbnail|View of the citadel of Ajaccio]]\nAll officers were recalled from leave in 1792, intervention threatened and war with Austria ([[Marie-Antoinette]]'s homeland) began.

His family was prospering; his estate increased.\n\nNapoleon became a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the Corsican National Guard. Paoli sent him off on an expedition to [[Sardinia]], ordered by France, under Paolis's nephew but the nephew had secret orders from Paoli to make sure the expedition failed.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Maddalena, 22/25&nbsp;February 1793|first=Maurizio|last=Cinti|work=Military Subjects: Battles & Campaigns|publisher=The Napoleon Series|date=20 April 1995|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_maddalena.html|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref> Paoli was now a conservative, opposing the execution of the king and supporting an alliance with Great Britain. Returning from Sardinia Napoleon with his family and all his supporters were instrumental in getting Paoli denounced at the [[National Convention]] in Paris in 1793. Napoleon earned the hatred of the Paolists by pretending to support Paoli and then turning against him (payment, one supposes, for Sardinia).\n\nPaoli was [[Trial in absentia|convicted in absentia]], a warrant was issued for his arrest (which could not be served) and Napoleon was dispatched to Corsica as [[Inspector General]] of Artillery to take the citadel of Ajaccio from the royalists who had held it since 1789. The Paolists combining with the royalists defeated the French in two pitched battles and Napoleon and his family went on the run, hiding by day, while the Paolists burned their estate. Napoleon and his mother, Laetitia, were taken out by ship in June 1793, by friends while two of the girls found refuge with other friends. They landed in [[Toulon]] with only Napoleon's pay for their support.\n[[File:2016 Napoleon Totenmaske.jpg|thumb|left|[[Death mask]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]]]\nThe Bonapartes moved to [[Marseille]] but in August Toulon offered itself to the British and received the protection of a fleet under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Admiral Hood]]. The [[Siege of Toulon]] began in September under revolutionary officers mainly untrained in the art of war. Napoleon happened to present socially one evening and during a casual conversation over a misplaced 24-pounder explained the value of artillery. Taken seriously he was allowed to bring up over 100 guns from coastal emplacements but his plan for the taking of Toulon was set aside as one incompetent officer superseded another. By December they decided to try his plan and made him a Colonel. Placing the guns at close range he used them to keep the British fleet away while he battered down the walls of Toulon. As soon as the [[Committee of Public Safety]] heard of the victory Napoleon became a [[Brigadier General]], the start of his meteoric rise to power.\n\nThe Bonapartes were back in Ajaccio in 1797 under the protection of General Napoleon. Soon after Napoleon became First Consul and then emperor, using his office to spread revolution throughout Europe. In 1811 he made Ajaccio the capital of the new Department of Corsica. Despite his subsequent defeat by the Prussians, Russians, and British, his exile and his death, no victorious power reversed that decision or tried to remove Corsica from France. Among the natives, though Corsican nationalism is strong, and feeling often runs high in favour of a union with [[Italy]]; loyalty to France, however, as evidenced by elections, remains stronger.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\nIn the 19th century Ajaccio became a popular winter resort of the high society of the time, especially for the English, in the same way as [[Monaco]], [[Cannes]], and [[Nice]]. An [[Holy Trinity Church, Ajaccio|Anglican Church]] was even built.\n\nThe first prison in France for children was built in Ajaccio in 1855: the Horticultural colony of Saint Anthony. It was a correctional colony for juvenile delinquents (from 8 to 20 years old), established under Article 10 of the Act of 5 August 1850. Nearly 1,200 children from all over France stayed there until 1866, when it was closed. Sixty percent of them perished, the victims of poor sanitation and malaria which infested the unhealthy areas that they were responsible to clean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://site.voila.fr/bagne-enfant-ajaccio|title=Cr\u00e9er un site web gratuit - pages perso Orange|website=site.voila.fr|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary history===\n{{Main|Italian occupation of Corsica}}\n[[File:Mairie Ajaccio.jpg|thumb|Ajaccio: the first French town liberated]]\n\nOn 9 September 1943, the people of Ajaccio rose up against the Nazi occupiers<ref>[http://www.corse.pref.gouv.fr/scripts/display.asp?P=COhist_liberation Pr\u00e9fecture of Corsica: ''The Liberation of Corsica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624175934/http://www.corse.pref.gouv.fr/scripts/display.asp?P=COhist_liberation |date=24 June 2008 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> and became the first French town to be liberated from the domination of the Germans.

Its urban area of nearly 90,000 inhabitants is spread over a large part of the [[Corse-du-Sud]], on either side of the Gulf of Ajaccio and up the valley of the Gravona. Its business is primarily oriented towards the services sector.\n\nThe services sector is by far the main source of employment in the city. Ajaccio is an administrative centre comprising communal, intercommunal, departmental, regional, and prefectural services.\n\nIt is also a shopping centre with the commercial streets of the city centre and the areas of peripheral activities such as that of ''Mezzavia'' (hypermarket ''G\u00e9ant Casino'') and along the ring road (hypermarket Carrefour and E. Leclerc).\n\nTourism is one of the most vital aspects of the economy, split between the seaside tourism of summer, cultural tourism, and fishing. A number of hotels, varying from one star to five star, are present across the commune.\n\nAjaccio is the seat of the ''Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ajaccio and Corsica South''. It manages the ports of Ajaccio, [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]], [[Porto-Vecchio]], [[Propriano]] and the Tino Rossi marina. It also manages [[Ajaccio airport]]<ref>[http://www.ajaccio.aeroport.fr/aeroports/ajaccio2.php CCI of Ajaccio: Airport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126065821/http://www.ajaccio.aeroport.fr/aeroports/ajaccio2.php |date=26 January 2010 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> and [[Figari Sud-Corse Airport|Figari airport]] as well as the convention centre and the ''Centre of Ricanto''.\n\nSecondary industry is underdeveloped, apart from the aeronautical company ''Corsica Aerospace Composites CCA'', the largest company on the island with 135 employees at two sites.<ref>[http://www.cca.fr Corses Composites A\u00e9ronautiques] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The storage sites of [[GDF Suez]] (formerly [[Gaz de France]]) and [[Antar (company)|Antargaz]] in the district of ''Vazzio'' are classified as high risk.\n\n===Energy===\nThe ''Centrale EDF du Vazzio'', a heavy oil power station, provides the south of the island with electricity. The [[Gravona]] Canal delivers water for consumption by the city.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road access===\n[[File:Ajaccio - rue cardinal Fesch.jpg|thumb|Rue du Cardinal Fesch]]\n\nBy road, the city is accessible from National Route NR194 from [[Bastia]] and NR193 via NR196 from [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]].\n\nThese two main axes, as well as the roads leading to suburban villages, connect Ajaccio from the north - the site of Ajaccio forming a dead end blocked by the sea to the south. Only the ''Cours Napoleon'' and the ''Boulevard du Roi Jerome'' cross the city.\n\nAlong with the high [[urban density]], this explains the major traffic and parking problems especially during peak hours and during the summer tourist season. A bypass through several neighbourhoods is nearing completion.\n\n===Communal bus services===\nThe Muvistrada provide services on 21 urban routes, one \"city\" route for local links and 20 suburban lines.

Usually an arrondissement includes cantons and a canton includes one to several communes including the chef-lieu, \"chief place\", from which the canton takes its name. The city of Ajaccio is one commune, but it contains four cantons, Cantons 1\u20134, and a fraction of Canton 5. The latter contains three other communes: [[Bastelicaccia]], [[Alata, Corse-du-Sud|Alata]] and [[Villanova, Corse-du-Sud|Villanova]], making a total of four communes for the five cantons of Ajaccio.<ref name=decret>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028658302|title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2014-229 du 24 f\u00e9vrier 2014 portant d\u00e9limitation des cantons dans le d\u00e9partement de la Corse-du-Sud|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nEach canton contains a certain number of quartiers, \"quarters\". Cantons 1, 2, 3, 4 are located along the Gulf of Ajaccio from west to east, while 5 is a little further up the valleys of the Gravona and the Prunelli Rivers. These political divisions subdivide the population of Ajaccio into units that can be more democratically served but they do not give a true picture of the size of Ajaccio. In general language, \"greater Ajaccio\" includes about 100,000 people with all the medical, educational, utility and transportational facilities of a big city. Up until World War II it was still possible to regard the city as being a settlement of narrow streets localized to a part of the harbour or the Gulf of Ajaccio: such bucolic descriptions do not fit the city of today, and travelogues intended for mountain or coastal recreational areas do not generally apply to Corsica's few big cities.\n\nThe arrondissement contains other cantons that extend generally up the two rivers into central Corsica.\n\n===Twinning===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in France}}\nAjaccio has [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinning]] associations with:<ref>[https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/cncdext/dyn/public/atlas/rechercheAtlasFrance.html National Commission for Decentralised cooperation] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Jena]], Germany, since 2003 \n*{{flagicon|CYP}} [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], since 1989 \n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Palma de Mallorca]], Spain, since 1980\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Dana Point, California]], United States, since 1990\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[La Maddalena]], Italy, since 1991 \n*{{flagicon|MAR}} [[Marrakech]], Morocco, since 2005\n\n==Population==\nThe demographic development of Ajaccio occurred mainly between 1945 and 1975 with a doubling of the population of the city in that period. This is explicable in the 1950s by the rural exodus. From the 1960s, the city saw the coming of \"[[Pied-Noir]]s\" (French Algerians) including immigrants from the [[Maghreb]] and French from mainland France.\n\n{{Historical populations\n|align=left\n|2006|63723\n|2007|64432\n|2008|65153\n|2009|64306\n|2010|65542\n|2011|66809\n|2012|66245\n|2013|67507\n|2014|68587\n|2015|68462\n|2016|69075\n}}\n{{clear-left}}\n\n==Health==\nAjaccio has three hospital sites:\n*the ''Misericordia Hospital'', built in 1950, is located on the heights of the city centre.

After the [[Corsican Republic]] was declared in 1755 the Genoese continued to hold several citadels, including Ajaccio, until the [[French conquest of Corsica|French]] took control of the island.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Ajacciens'' or ''Ajacciennes''.<ref>[http://www.habitants.fr/habitants_departement_corse-du-sud_2A.html Inhabitants of Corse-du-Sud] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The most famous of these is [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who was born in Ajaccio in 1769, and whose ancestral home, the [[Maison Bonaparte]], is now a museum.

The harbour lies to the east of the original citadel below a hill overlooking a peninsula which protects the harbour in the south where the Quai de la Citadelle and the Jett\u00e9e de la Citadelle are. The modern city not only encloses the entire harbour but takes up the better part of the Gulf of Ajaccio and in suburban form extends for some miles up the valley of the [[Gravona River]]. The flow from that river is nearly entirely consumed as the city's water supply.

Therefore, the [[urban area]] of Ajaccio is located in the east of the commune on a narrow coastal strip forming a densely populated arc. The rest of the territory is natural with habitation of little importance and spread thinly. Suburbanization occurs north and east of the main urban area.\n\nThe original urban core, close to the old marshy plain of ''Cannes'' was abandoned in favour of the current city which was built near the ''Punta della Lechia''. It has undergone various improvements, particularly under Napoleon, who originated the two current major structural arteries (the ''Cours Napoleon'' oriented north\u2013south and the ''Cours Grandval'' oriented east\u2013west).\n\nAjaccio experienced a demographic boom in the 1960s, which explains why 85% of dwellings are post-1949.<ref>''The Cities of France'', by Fabri\u00e8s-Verfaillie et Stragiotti, 2000 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> This is reflected in the layout of the city which is marked by very large areas of low-rise buildings and concrete towers, especially on the heights (''Jardins de l'Empereur'') and in the north of the city - e.g. the waterfront, ''Les Cannes'', and ''Les Salines''. A dichotomy appears in the landscape between the old city and the imposing modern buildings. Ajaccio gives the image of a city built on two different levels.\n\n===Climate===\nThe city has a [[Mediterranean climate]] which is ''Csa'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The average annual sunshine is 2726 hours.\n\nThere are important local climatic variations, especially with wind exposure and total precipitation, between the city centre, the airport, and the  ''\u00eeles Sanguinaires''. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|645.6|mm|1|abbr=on}} at the ''Campo dell'Oro'' weather station (as per the chart) and {{convert|523.9|mm|1|abbr=on}} at the ''Parata'': the third-driest place in metropolitan France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meteofrance.com|title=PREVISIONS METEO FRANCE - Site Officiel de M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France - Pr\u00e9visions gratuites \u00e0 15 jours sur la France et \u00e0 10 jours sur le monde|first=Meteo|last=France|website=www.meteofrance.com|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref> The heat and dryness of summer are somewhat tempered by the proximity of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] except when the [[sirocco]] is blowing.

Other more realistic explanations are, for example, that the name could be related to the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] ''agghiacciu'' meaning \"sheep pens\". Another explanation, supported by [[Byzantine]] sources from around the year 600AD called the city ''Agiation'' which suggests a possible Greek origin for the word,<ref>Manuscript variants are ''Agration'' and ''Agiagium'' but the use of a Greek ending does not necessarily indicate anything at all about ethnicity. At this late date geographers used either Greek or Latin forms at will. The word is no more decipherable in Greek than it is in Latin; attempts to connect two or three letters with [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] roots amount to speculation.</ref> ''agath\u00e8'' could mean \"good luck\" or \"good mooring\" (this was also the root of the name of the city of [[Agde]]).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ajaccio Bon Pl JPG.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Statue of Napoleon in the Place Foch]]\n[[File:Ajaccio Grand H\u00f4tel Continental.jpg|Ex Grand H\u00f4tel Continental (now office of the ''Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Corse'')|thumb|250px|right]]\n\n===Antiquity===\nThe city was not mentioned by the Greek geographer [[Ptolemy of Alexandria]] in the 2nd century AD despite the presence of a place called ''Ourkinion'' in the ''Cinarca'' area. It is likely that the city of Ajaccio had its first development at this time. The 2nd century was a period of prosperity in the Mediterranean basin (the [[Pax Romana]]) and there was a need for a proper port at the head of the several valleys that lead to the Gulf able to accommodate large ships. Some important underwater archaeological discoveries recently made of Roman ships tend to confirm this. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFurther excavations conducted recently led to the discovery of important early Christian remains likely to significantly a reevaluation upwards of the size of Ajaccio city in [[Late Antiquity]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]]. The city was in any case already significant enough to be the seat of a [[diocese]], mentioned by [[Pope Gregory the Great]] in 591. The city was then further north than the location chosen later by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] - in the location of the existing quarters of ''Castel Vecchio'' and ''Sainte-Lucie''.\n\nThe earliest certain written record of a settlement at Ajaccio with a name ancestral to its name was the exhortation in Epistle 77 written in 601AD by [[Gregory the great]] to the Defensor Boniface, one of two known rectors of the early Corsican church,<ref>{{cite book|pages=318|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages, 476\u2013752|first=Jeffrey|last=Richards|year=1979|ISBN=0-7100-0098-7|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London}}</ref> to tell him not to leave [[Al\u00e9ria]] and Adjacium without bishops. There is no earlier use of the term and Adjacium is not an attested [[Latin]] word, which probably means that it is a Latinization of a word in some other language. The [[Ravenna Cosmography]] of about 700 AD cites Agiation,<ref>{{cite book|title=Ravennatis Anonymi Cosmographia et Guidonis Geographica|pages=413|author=Anonymous of Ravenna|author2=Guido|author3= [[Gustav Parthey]]|author4= Moritz Pinder|year=1860|location=Berolini|publisher=in aedibvs Friderici Nicolai}} {{in lang|la}}.

There is, however, no evidence at all of a Greek presence on the west coast and the [[Ionians]] at [[Al\u00e9ria]] on the east coast had been expelled by the Etruscans long before Roman domination.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n[[Ptolemy]], who must come the closest to representing indigenous names, lists the Lochra River just south of a feature he calls the \"sandy shore\" on the southwest coast. If the shore is the Campo dell'Oro (Place of Gold) the Lochra would seem to be the combined mouth of the Gravona and Prunelli Rivers, neither one of which sounds like Lochra.\n\nNorth of there was a Roman city, Ourchinion. The western coastline was so distorted, however, that it is impossible to say where Adjacium was; certainly, he would have known its name and location if he had had any first-hand knowledge of the island and if in fact it was there. Ptolemy's Ourchinion is further north than Ajaccio and does not have the same name. It could be [[Torra di Sagone|Sagone]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Pierre |last=Massimi |author2=Jose Tomazi |title=A corsica in la carta geografica di Ptolomey |work=InterRomania |publisher=Centru Culturale, Universita di Corsica |year=2002 |format=pdf |accessdate=18 May 2008 |url=http://www.interromania.com/media/pdf/benigni/ptolomeu.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529095833/http://www.interromania.com/media/pdf/benigni/ptolomeu.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2008 }} {{in lang|co}}.</ref> The lack of correspondence between Ptolemaic and historical names known to be ancient has no defense except in the case of the two Roman colonies, Aleria and Mariana.

The Castello Vecchio (\"old castle\"), a ruined citadel, was believed to be Roman but turned out to have Gothic features. The hill was planted with vines. The farmers kept turning up artifacts and terracotta funerary urns that seemed to be Roman.\n\nIn the 20th century the hill was covered over with buildings and became a part of downtown Ajaccio. In 2005 construction plans for a lot on the hill offered the opportunity to the Institut national de recherches arch\u00e9ologiques preventatives (Inrap) to excavate. They found the [[baptistry]] of a 6th-century cathedral and large amounts of pottery dated to the 6th and 7th centuries AD; in other words, an early Christian town. A cemetery had been placed over the old church. In it was a single Roman grave covered over with roof tiles bearing short indecipherable inscriptions. The finds of the previous century had included Roman coins. This is the only evidence so far of a Roman city continuous with the early Christian one.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discovery of an Early Christian Baptistery in Ajaccio |url=http://www.inrap.fr/preventive-archaeology/In_the_News/Press_release/p-1346-Discovery_of_an_Early_Christian_Baptistery_in_Ajac.htm |publisher=Inrap |date=9 June 2005 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721001014/http://www.inrap.fr/preventive-archaeology/In_the_News/Press_release/p-1346-Discovery_of_an_Early_Christian_Baptistery_in_Ajac.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===The medieval Genoese period===\nIt has been established that after the 8th century the city, like most other Corsican coastal communities, strongly declined and disappeared almost completely. Nevertheless, a castle and a cathedral were still in place in 1492 which last was not demolished until 1748. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] were eager to assert their dominance in the south of the island and decided to rebuild the city of Ajaccio. Several sites were considered: the ''Pointe de la Parata'' (not chosen because it was too exposed to the wind), the ancient city (finally considered unsafe because of the proximity of the salt ponds), and finally the ''Punta della Lechia'' which was finally selected.\n\nWork began on the town on 21 April 1492 south of the Christian village by the [[Bank of Saint George]] at [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], who sent Cristoforo of Gandini, an architect, to build it. He began with a castle on Capo di Bolo, around which he constructed residences for several hundred people.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the city of Ajaccio|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.ajaccio.fr/Histoire-de-la-ville-d-Ajaccio_a12.html&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=4&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dadjacium%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26as_qdr%3Dall%26pwst%3D1|accessdate=16 May 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:Tour sanguinaires.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Genoese Tower.]]\n\nThe new city was essentially a colony of Genoa. The Corsicans were restricted from the city for some years.\n\nNevertheless, the town grew rapidly and became the administrative capital of the province of ''Au Del\u00e0 Des Monts'' (more or less the current ''[[Corse-du-Sud]]''). [[Bastia]] remained the capital of the entire island.\n\nAlthough at first populated exclusively by the Genoese, the city slowly opened to the Corsicans while the Ajaccians, almost to the French conquest, were legally citizens of the [[Republic of Genoa]] and were happy to distinguish themselves from the insular ''paesani'' who lived mainly in ''Borgu'', a suburb outside the city walls (the current ''rue Fesch'' was the main street).\n\n===The attachment to France===\nAjaccio was occupied from 1553 to 1559 by the French, but it again fell to the Genoese after the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Treaty of Cateau Cambresis]] in the latter year.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ajaccio|volume=1|page=451}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the [[Republic of Genoa]] was strong enough to keep Corsica until 1755, the year [[Pasquale Paoli]] proclaimed the [[Corsican Republic]]. Paoli took most of the island for the republic, but he was unable to force Genoese troops out of the citadels of [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]], [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], Ajaccio, [[Bastia]] and [[Algajola]]. Leaving them there, he went on to build the nation, while the Republic of Genoa was left to ponder prospects and solutions. Their ultimate solution was to [[French conquest of Corsica|sell Corsica to France]] in 1768 and French troops of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] replaced Genoese ones in the citadels, including Ajaccio's.\n\nCorsica was formally annexed to France in 1780.\n\n===Napoleon I===\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (born as Napoleone di Buonaparte) was born at Ajaccio in the same year as the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]], 1769. The Buonaparte family at the time had a modest four-story home in town (now a museum known as [[Maison Bonaparte]]) and a rarely used country home in the hills north of the city (now site of the [[Arboretum des Milelli]]). The father of the family, attorney Carlo di Buonaparte, was secretary to [[Pasquale Paoli]] during the [[Corsican Republic]].\n[[File:2016 Ajaccio - Napoleondenkmal.jpg|thumb|left|Ajaccio, Place De Gaulle - monument Napol\u00e9on]]\n\nAfter the defeat of Paoli, the [[Charles Louis de Marbeuf|Comte de Marbeuf]] began to meet with some leading Corsicans to outline the shape of the future and enlist their assistance. The Comte was among a delegation from Ajaccio in 1769, offered his loyalty and was appointed assessor.\n\nMarbeuf also offered Carlo di Buonaparte an appointment for one of his sons to the [[Brienne-le-Ch\u00e2teau|Military College of Brienne]], but Napoleone did not speak French which was a requirement and he had to be at least ten years of age. There is a dispute concerning Napoleon's age because of this requirement; the emperor is known to have altered the civic records at Ajaccio concerning himself and it is possible that he was born in [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] in 1768 when his father was there on business. In any case Napoleon was sent to a school in Autun to learn basic French, then after a year went to Brienne from 1779\u20131784.<ref>https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/napoleon/napoleon-and-josephine/who-was-napoleon.html</ref><ref>{{cite book|pages=Chapter 1|title=The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte|first=Sabine|last=Baring-Gould|year=2006|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|isbn=0-543-95815-9|nopp=true}}</ref>\n\nAt Brienne Napoleon concentrated on studies. He wrote a boyish history of Corsica. He did not share his father's views but held [[Pasquale Paoli]] in high esteem and was at heart a Corsican nationalist. The top students were encouraged to go into the artillery. After graduation and a brief sojourn at the [[\u00c9cole Militaire|Military School of Paris]] Napoleon applied for a second-lieutenancy in the [[R\u00e9giment de La F\u00e8re (1765)|artillery regiment of La F\u00e8re]] at [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]] and after a time was given the position. Meanwhile, his father died and his mother was cast into poverty in Corsica, still having four children to support. Her only income was Napoleon's meager salary. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe regiment was in [[Auxonne]] when the revolution broke out in the summer of 1789. Napoleon returned on leave to Ajaccio in October, became a [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] and began to work for the revolution. The [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in Paris united Corsica to France and pardoned its exiles. Paoli returned in 1790 after 21 years and kissed the soil on which he stood. He and Napoleon met and toured the battlefield of Paoli's defeat. A national assembly at Orezza created the department of Corsica and Paoli was subsequently elected president. He commanded the national guard raised by Napoleon. After a brief return to his regiment Napoleon was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]] and came home again on leave in 1791. The death of a rich uncle relieved the family's poverty. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Ajaccio citadelle echauguette.jpg|thumbnail|View of the citadel of Ajaccio]]\nAll officers were recalled from leave in 1792, intervention threatened and war with Austria ([[Marie-Antoinette]]'s homeland) began. Napoleon returned to Paris for review, was exonerated, then promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] and given leave to escort his sister, a schoolgirl, back to Corsica at state expense. His family was prospering; his estate increased.\n\nNapoleon became a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the Corsican National Guard. Paoli sent him off on an expedition to [[Sardinia]], ordered by France, under Paolis's nephew but the nephew had secret orders from Paoli to make sure the expedition failed.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Maddalena, 22/25&nbsp;February 1793|first=Maurizio|last=Cinti|work=Military Subjects: Battles & Campaigns|publisher=The Napoleon Series|date=20 April 1995|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_maddalena.html|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref> Paoli was now a conservative, opposing the execution of the king and supporting an alliance with Great Britain. Returning from Sardinia Napoleon with his family and all his supporters were instrumental in getting Paoli denounced at the [[National Convention]] in Paris in 1793. Napoleon earned the hatred of the Paolists by pretending to support Paoli and then turning against him (payment, one supposes, for Sardinia).\n\nPaoli was [[Trial in absentia|convicted in absentia]], a warrant was issued for his arrest (which could not be served) and Napoleon was dispatched to Corsica as [[Inspector General]] of Artillery to take the citadel of Ajaccio from the royalists who had held it since 1789. The Paolists combining with the royalists defeated the French in two pitched battles and Napoleon and his family went on the run, hiding by day, while the Paolists burned their estate. Napoleon and his mother, Laetitia, were taken out by ship in June 1793, by friends while two of the girls found refuge with other friends. They landed in [[Toulon]] with only Napoleon's pay for their support.\n[[File:2016 Napoleon Totenmaske.jpg|thumb|left|[[Death mask]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]]]\nThe Bonapartes moved to [[Marseille]] but in August Toulon offered itself to the British and received the protection of a fleet under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Admiral Hood]]. The [[Siege of Toulon]] began in September under revolutionary officers mainly untrained in the art of war. Napoleon happened to present socially one evening and during a casual conversation over a misplaced 24-pounder explained the value of artillery. Taken seriously he was allowed to bring up over 100 guns from coastal emplacements but his plan for the taking of Toulon was set aside as one incompetent officer superseded another. By December they decided to try his plan and made him a Colonel. Placing the guns at close range he used them to keep the British fleet away while he battered down the walls of Toulon. As soon as the [[Committee of Public Safety]] heard of the victory Napoleon became a [[Brigadier General]], the start of his meteoric rise to power.\n\nThe Bonapartes were back in Ajaccio in 1797 under the protection of General Napoleon. Soon after Napoleon became First Consul and then emperor, using his office to spread revolution throughout Europe. In 1811 he made Ajaccio the capital of the new Department of Corsica. Despite his subsequent defeat by the Prussians, Russians, and British, his exile and his death, no victorious power reversed that decision or tried to remove Corsica from France. Among the natives, though Corsican nationalism is strong, and feeling often runs high in favour of a union with [[Italy]]; loyalty to France, however, as evidenced by elections, remains stronger.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\nIn the 19th century Ajaccio became a popular winter resort of the high society of the time, especially for the English, in the same way as [[Monaco]], [[Cannes]], and [[Nice]]. An [[Holy Trinity Church, Ajaccio|Anglican Church]] was even built.\n\nThe first prison in France for children was built in Ajaccio in 1855: the Horticultural colony of Saint Anthony. It was a correctional colony for juvenile delinquents (from 8 to 20 years old), established under Article 10 of the Act of 5 August 1850. Nearly 1,200 children from all over France stayed there until 1866, when it was closed. Sixty percent of them perished, the victims of poor sanitation and malaria which infested the unhealthy areas that they were responsible to clean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://site.voila.fr/bagne-enfant-ajaccio|title=Cr\u00e9er un site web gratuit - pages perso Orange|website=site.voila.fr|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary history===\n{{Main|Italian occupation of Corsica}}\n[[File:Mairie Ajaccio.jpg|thumb|Ajaccio: the first French town liberated]]\n\nOn 9 September 1943, the people of Ajaccio rose up against the Nazi occupiers<ref>[http://www.corse.pref.gouv.fr/scripts/display.asp?P=COhist_liberation Pr\u00e9fecture of Corsica: ''The Liberation of Corsica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624175934/http://www.corse.pref.gouv.fr/scripts/display.asp?P=COhist_liberation |date=24 June 2008 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> and became the first French town to be liberated from the domination of the Germans.

Usually an arrondissement includes cantons and a canton includes one to several communes including the chef-lieu, \"chief place\", from which the canton takes its name. The city of Ajaccio is one commune, but it contains four cantons, Cantons 1\u20134, and a fraction of Canton 5. The latter contains three other communes: [[Bastelicaccia]], [[Alata, Corse-du-Sud|Alata]] and [[Villanova, Corse-du-Sud|Villanova]], making a total of four communes for the five cantons of Ajaccio.<ref name=decret>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028658302|title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2014-229 du 24 f\u00e9vrier 2014 portant d\u00e9limitation des cantons dans le d\u00e9partement de la Corse-du-Sud|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nEach canton contains a certain number of quartiers, \"quarters\". Cantons 1, 2, 3, 4 are located along the Gulf of Ajaccio from west to east, while 5 is a little further up the valleys of the Gravona and the Prunelli Rivers. These political divisions subdivide the population of Ajaccio into units that can be more democratically served but they do not give a true picture of the size of Ajaccio. In general language, \"greater Ajaccio\" includes about 100,000 people with all the medical, educational, utility and transportational facilities of a big city. Up until World War II it was still possible to regard the city as being a settlement of narrow streets localized to a part of the harbour or the Gulf of Ajaccio: such bucolic descriptions do not fit the city of today, and travelogues intended for mountain or coastal recreational areas do not generally apply to Corsica's few big cities.\n\nThe arrondissement contains other cantons that extend generally up the two rivers into central Corsica.\n\n===Twinning===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in France}}\nAjaccio has [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinning]] associations with:<ref>[https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/cncdext/dyn/public/atlas/rechercheAtlasFrance.html National Commission for Decentralised cooperation] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Jena]], Germany, since 2003 \n*{{flagicon|CYP}} [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], since 1989 \n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Palma de Mallorca]], Spain, since 1980\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Dana Point, California]], United States, since 1990\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[La Maddalena]], Italy, since 1991 \n*{{flagicon|MAR}} [[Marrakech]], Morocco, since 2005\n\n==Population==\nThe demographic development of Ajaccio occurred mainly between 1945 and 1975 with a doubling of the population of the city in that period. This is explicable in the 1950s by the rural exodus. From the 1960s, the city saw the coming of \"[[Pied-Noir]]s\" (French Algerians) including immigrants from the [[Maghreb]] and French from mainland France.\n\n{{Historical populations\n|align=left\n|2006|63723\n|2007|64432\n|2008|65153\n|2009|64306\n|2010|65542\n|2011|66809\n|2012|66245\n|2013|67507\n|2014|68587\n|2015|68462\n|2016|69075\n}}\n{{clear-left}}\n\n==Health==\nAjaccio has three hospital sites:\n*the ''Misericordia Hospital'', built in 1950, is located on the heights of the city centre.

Mike is a former [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] police officer who works for [[Gus Fring|Gus]]\u2014and, on occasion, [[Saul Goodman|Saul]]\u2014as a private investigator, head of security, [[Fixer (person)|cleaner]], and [[hitman]]. His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the ''Breaking Bad'' series, but are detailed in ''Better Call Saul''. In 2019, he briefly appeared in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a film directed and written by Vince Gilligan, made by Netflix and a continuation of the original show. In 2019, he became the first character to appear in ''Breaking Bad'', ''Better Call Saul'', and ''El Camino'' and is one of only two characters to have appeared in all three, the other being [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Associates of Saul Goodman#Ed Galbraith|Ed Galbraith]].\n\n==Creation==\nThe writers of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created the character of Mike Ehrmantraut as a substitute for [[Saul Goodman]], when actor [[Bob Odenkirk]] was unavailable for the last of four planned ''Breaking Bad'' episodes of [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|the second season]] because of a commitment to appear in ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.<ref name=\"hiatt20150316\">{{Cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |last2=Hiatt |first2=Brian |date=2015-03-16 |title=Bob Odenkirk on ''Saul'' and ''Mr. Show''{{'s}} Non-Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/bob-odenkirk-on-better-call-saul-and-the-mr-show-non-reunion-96299/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> They cast Jonathan Banks because they admired his work in the 1980s police drama ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''. Banks himself thought he would come on and do the role for the second season finale \"[[ABQ (Breaking Bad)|ABQ]]\", but had been impressed by working alongside [[Aaron Paul]] in that scene, and with the overall direction that [[Vince Gilligan]] had given for the episode once it aired. Banks considered his character close to that of [[Max Von Sydow]]'s Joubert from ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', an assassin that painted figurines on the side.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://tv.avclub.com/jonathan-banks-1798227722 | title = Jonathan Banks | first = Will | last = Harris | date = November 5, 2011 | accessdate = March 5, 2020 | work = [[The A.V.

He subsequently became an officer on the Philadelphia police force. Mike had one son, Matt, who also became a police officer. Matt married Stacey and they had a daughter, Kaylee. In an extended flashback in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode, \"[[Five-O (Better Call Saul)|Five-O]]\", Mike is revealed as a crooked cop who took bribes. Matt was approached by other corrupt officers and asked Mike for advice; Mike advised Matt that not taking the money would label him a [[whistleblower]], and endanger his life and family, so Matt took it. Matt's partner and another officer killed Matt because his hesitation caused them to think he might turn them in. Stacey and Kaylee left Philadelphia for Albuquerque after Matt's funeral. Mike identified the officers who killed Matt and arranged a similar ambush to kill both of them, after which he left for Albuquerque, allowing him to see Stacey and Kaylee.\n\n===''Better Call Saul''===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nMike works as a parking lot attendant at the courthouse. In his off-hours he engages in security and \"muscle\" jobs to help support Stacey and Kaylee. Jimmy frequently deals with Mike when leaving the parking lot, irritated with Mike's demands for payment or the right number of validation stickers.\n\nPhiladelphia officers involved in the investigation of two murdered cops interrogate Mike, who hires Jimmy to represent him. Mike has Jimmy create a diversion, enabling Mike to steal one detective's notepad to learn what they know. He finds that Stacey contacted them after finding money hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. Mike admits to her that he was involved in corruption in Philadelphia, and confesses that he \"broke\" his son Matt by persuading him to go along. Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear he would report them, so Mike retaliated by killing the two of them, then moving to Albuquerque to be near his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Stacey accepts Mike's explanation and consoles him. The detectives have no solid evidence, and leave for Philadelphia without bringing charges. Mike aids Jimmy in proving the Kettlemans staged their own disappearance, then helps Jimmy recover and return the money the Kettlemans embezzled.\n\nOn one of his \"muscle\" jobs, Mike is employed by Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\") to protect him during a drug deal with [[Nacho Varga]]. Mike has no weapon, but remains calm and controlled. When the payment is $20 short, Mike insists that Nacho pay Pryce full. After the deal is complete, Mike explains that he investigated Nacho beforehand and determined he was operating without the knowledge of his bosses in the Salamanca drug cartel, giving him an incentive to ensure that the transaction went smoothly.\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nImpressed by Mike's work for Pryce, Nacho approaches him with a request to kill his boss [[Tuco Salamanca]], Hector's nephew. Nacho fears Tuco may learn about his outside drug deals, and that his erratic behavior will draw unwanted police attention to the Salamanca drug business. Rather than kill Tuco, Mike engineers a public altercation so that Tuco is sentenced to prison for assault. Hector convinces Mike to say that the gun Tuco was carrying was his to reduce Tuco's sentence, but Mike suspects Hector knows the truth.\n\nFearing Hector may exact revenge on Stacey and Kaylee, Mike attempts to disrupt Hector's drug trade by hijacking a Salamanca truck and stealing the $250,000 it carries, but allowing the driver to live. He intended for a \"Good Samaritan\" to free the driver, but learns from Nacho that when someone did stop to help, the truck driver called Hector first, and Hector's crew cleaned up the scene and killed the Good Samaritan.\n\nMike decides to kill Hector and procures a black market sniper rifle. As he prepares to fire at Hector, he is suddenly interrupted by the horn of a car.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike finds his moves have been tracked by [[Gus Fring]], the owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant chain, which is part of the cartel's drug trafficking chain. Gus meets with Mike and explains that he does not want Hector dead until the time is right. He encourages Mike to continue to disrupt Hector's drug trafficking and attempts to pay him, but Mike does not accept the money. He asks for help to launder the $250,000 he stole, and Gus obliges by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive, the parent company of Los Pollos and a participant in its drug activities, to hire Mike as a contracted security consultant and pay him monthly consulting fees. Mike joins Stacey at group therapy sessions to help her overcome Matt's death.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nMike quits work at the parking lot and conducts actual security consulting at Madrigal. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] informs him the consulting contract was supposed to be a paper transaction, but Mike argues that his inspections provide plausible cover if anyone questions the payments. When Lydia complains to Gus, he tacitly approves of Mike's actions. At the group therapy sessions, Mike confronts another attendee over his lies, which causes a temporary rift between Stacey and Mike.\n\nConflict between the Salamancas and Gus's organization lead to Hector Salamanca suffering a stroke, and Gus discreetly pays for his recovery to the point where he recovers his mental faculties and can move his right index finger. Gus initiates plans for a meth lab to be built under an industrial laundry, which is part of his plan to end reliance on cartel cocaine smuggled from Mexico. Mike arranges for structural engineers to secretly visit and assess the site while Gus silently observes. Gus selects Werner Ziegler to oversee construction of the lab, and Mike arranges for living quarters for Werner and his men during the months-long project. Mike takes to Werner, and tries to cover for him to Gus when Werner inadvertently reveals minimal details of the lab's construction to patrons at a local bar. When construction falls behind schedule, a homesick Werner escapes, intending to meet his wife at a nearby spa. Mike catches up to Werner and realizes that he has inadvertently revealed the existence of a construction project to Hector's nephew [[Lalo Salamanca]], who has arrived to take over management of the Salamanca drug business. Gus orders Werner's death, and offers to send someone to do it, but Mike executes Werner himself.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWerner's death forces Gus to halt construction of the lab. Mike pays Werner's men in full for the half-completed job and sends them home. Gus presents a cover story to Lalo and Juan Bolsa, claiming Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, stole cocaine, and fled, after which Mike tracked him down and killed him. The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, and Lalo and Juan accept Gus's explanation and apology, but Lalo remains suspicious. Mike reacts with disgust at Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner and refuses to accept Gus's offer to continue paying him during the construction delay. Mike continues to struggle with Werner's death and drinks to excess. He becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, which leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. \n\nA gang with whom Mike had a previous altercation beats and stabs him. He awakens at a ranch just inside the Mexico border, which has ties to Gus including a fountain dedicated to Max, where his wounds have been treated by [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]]. He attempts to leave, but in his weakened state Dr. Goodman easily catches up. The doctor re-bandages Mike's wounds and recommends that he stay to recuperate. Mike calls Gus to ask what he intends, but Gus hangs up on him. Gus subsequently arrives to speak with Mike in person and asks for his help. Mike refuses to be Gus's \"[[contract killing|button man]]\", killing only to further Gus's vendetta against the Salamancas. Gus tells Mike he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge. After Mike returns to Albuquerque, Gus puts him in charge of dealing with Nacho and his inside information on the Salamancas. Mike secretly points police to Lalo's car and its ties to the murder of the money wire clerk. After Nacho tips him off to Lalo's location, Mike uses a police radio to pretend to be an officer making a check on Lalo's license plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo's location while he is driving and detain him.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him, saying he moved past them by deciding to play the cards he was dealt. Lalo is arrested under an assumed name and remanded. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn Los Pollos Hermanos. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of one of Gus's restaurants then Gus sets an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike gives Jimmy details about the work he did to investigate to Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling Jimmy to win a motion for Lalo be released on bail.\n\nThe Cousins pick up Lalo's bail money in Mexico and deliver it to Jimmy at a remote pickup site. An informant makes a telephone call to report their activities. As Jimmy begins his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen, who take the cash and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked and killed, but one escapes. The shooter is revealed to be Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. Mike puts the cash and Jimmy back in Jimmy's car and they begin the drive to Albuquerque, but begin to walk cross-country after the car breaks down. They camp overnight and resume their trek the next morning. When they see the surviving gunman is still searching for them, Jimmy attracts his attention and draws him closer so Mike can shoot him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed, and the gunman is killed. Mike and Jimmy resume walking and return to Albuquerque, where Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and secures his release. Mike prepares Jimmy with a cover story to conceal the ambush and Mike's involvement. Mike updates Gus and illustrates a tattoo worn by one of the gunmen, which Gus identifies as belonging to a Colombian gang (confirming this after a call with Bolsa). Gus refuses when Mike asks to release Nacho from their arrangement, Nacho having earlier told Mike that Gus was threatening the life of his father in order to keep him in line and coerce him into providing intelligence about the Salamancas. Mike tracks Lalo, who visits Jimmy at his apartment after becoming suspicious about the events in the desert upon finding Jimmy's abandoned car riddled with bullets. Mike calls Jimmy to warn him in advance and has him leave his phone on and out of sight so Mike can overhear the conversation. Lalo, armed with a gun, confronts Jimmy about his cover story, with Mike nearby training a rifle on Lalo; however, he does not need to act ultimately as Lalo eventually leaves the apartment without wounding Jimmy or his wife [[Kim Wexler]] without Jimmy divulging the details of the ambush or Mike's involvement.\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nBy time of ''Breaking Bad'', Mike still works for Gus, and does occasional work for Jimmy, who continues practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] allows [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane]] to die from a heroin overdose, Saul dispatches Mike to clean [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s apartment. Mike removes all traces of the drugs and provides Jesse advice that enables him to avoid incriminating himself when speaking to police after Mike leaves. When Jesse later goes missing Mike tracks him down and drives Walt to the location.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWith Walt and [[Skyler White]] in the middle of a divorce, Saul has Mike spy on Skyler. Mike sees Walt arrive home, followed soon after by Tuco's cousins, who intend to kill Walt in retaliation for Tuco's death. Mike has Gus call off the cousins, since Walt is central to Gus's meth making scheme, and convinces them to target Hank, the DEA agent who shot Tuco. Gus then anonymously warns Hank, who is able to fight back. He survives the attack and kills one cousin, and Mike kills the other in the hospital.\n\nThe cartel disrupts Gus' meth distribution and he has Mike investigate. Mike kills the four cartel operatives sent to harass Duane Chow, one of Gus' chemical suppliers. He later hides in one of the Los Pollos Hermanos trucks during a drug run so he can learn the cartel's tactics and implement countermeasures that protect future drug shipments.\n\nWhile Walt and Jesse have been cooking meth in the underground superlab, Jesse has become more unstable. He learns that two of Gus's local drug dealers were responsible for the death of his friend Combo and Tom\u00e1s, the younger brother of Jesse's girlfriend Andrea. Knowing Jesse intends to kill the dealers, Walt acts first and runs them down with his car, then tells Jesse to flee.  Gus keeps Walt on, but requires that he work with [[Gale Boetticher|Gale]] again. Walt correctly fears that once Gale knows enough to take over, Gus will have Walt and Jesse killed.  Walt tricks Mike into looking for Jesse in the wrong place, giving Walt time to meet Jesse and tell him to find Gale's address. Mike later escorts Walt back to the lab on the pretense of responding to a chemical spill, but Walt knows Mike is supposed to kill him. Intending to kill Jesse too, Mike instructs Walt to call Jesse and persuade him to come to the lab.  Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale so that Gus will have to keep them alive to continue meth production.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nJesse kills Gale. Victor arrives soon after and brings Jesse back to the lab. Mike and Victor keep watch over Jesse and Walt while waiting for Gus. Knowing he was recognized at Gale's house, and hoping to demonstrate that he can still be useful to Gus, Victor begins producing a batch of meth, revealing that he has learned the process by watching Walt and Jesse. Gus arrives, kills Victor in front of Walt and Jesse, then tells them to get back to work. Mike increases security at the lab, including installing video cameras and personally standing watch over Walt and Jesse while they work.\n\nMike informs Gus they may be able to drive Walter and Jesse apart. Gus agrees, and Mike takes Jesse with him on dead-drop retrievals and other tasks. Jesse foils a prearranged attack on Mike, boosting his confidence and increasing his loyalty to Mike and Gus. After another Los Pollos Hermanos truck is robbed and the meth stolen, Jesse aids Mike in retrieving it. His competence convinces Mike and Gus to continue making use of Jesse, and he goes to Mexico with them for a meeting between Gus and the cartel leaders that is intended to end their dispute. Jesse produces a superior batch of meth on his own, and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico to produce it for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse. During a party at [[Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]'s house to celebrate the rapprochement, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of tequila to kill most of the cartel leaders, including taking the first drink himself to alleviate suspicion. Mike is shot helping Gus escape, and Jesse helps both the ill Gus and injured Mike make their way to pre-planned medical treatment. For the doctor Gus has hired, Mike's wounds are secondary to Gus\u2018s illness, and after Gus recovers, Mike remains in Mexico for several weeks while Gus and Jesse return to Albuquerque. While Mike is recovering, Walt engineers Gus\u2018s death, after which he and Jesse destroy the meth lab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike learns of Gus's death, blames Walt, and intends to kill him. As Mike drives back to Albuquerque, he encounters Walt and Jesse, who explain why they killed Gus. They remind him that the security camera footage from the lab can implicate both Mike and them, and ask for his aid in destroying it.  Mike tells them the recordings were stored on Gus's laptop, which is now in police custody.  He aids Walt and Jesse to build and employ an [[electromagnet]] that wipes the laptop's data. This inadvertently leads the police to discover, elsewhere in Gus's possessions, hidden account numbers and access codes for the money Gus deposited offshore to be used to pay the members of his organization for their silence.  They seize the accounts, making it likely that Gus's former employees will reveal Mike, Jesse, and Walt to the police.\n\nMike joins Walt and Jesse in a new organization, with Jesse and Walt producing meth in a mobile lab operated inside the tented homes of a fumigation company's customers.  When Lydia suspects the DEA is tracking the methylamine Madrigal supplies, she provides Mike, Walt and Jesse with information on a train that includes a tanker car of methylamine. They arrange to steal a large quantity without detection, but Todd, an employee of the fumigation company who aids in the robbery, shoots and kills a young boy who witnessed it. Wanting no part of this type of brutality, Mike and Jesse sell their share of the methylamine to Declan, a drug dealer from Phoenix, while Walt produces the meth Declan distributes.  Mike agrees to continue paying Gus's former employees from his share of the methylamine sale in order to ensure their continued silence.\n\nThe DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a \"go bag\" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing.  The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike, intending to flee, asks Saul to retrieve his go bag.  Walt retrieves it instead, and meets with Mike. He demands the names of Mike's associates in exchange, so he can have them killed in prison to protect his identity. Mike refuses, and Walt shoots him with the gun from the go bag.  After following a mortally wounded Mike to the edge of a river, Walt comes to the realization that he could have simply asked Lydia for the names. Walt begins to apologize, but Mike stops him, saying \"let me die in peace.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=\"Breaking Bad\" star Jonathan Banks: \"The bad guy's gotta die\" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/breaking-bad-star-jonathan-banks-bad-guys-gotta-201325777.html |website=Yahoo!

Jesse expresses a desire to make amends for past wrongdoing, but Mike cautions that starting over will make it impossible.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://etcanada.com/video/f73606ac-dd83-11e9-bfeb-5a25fcbd3cd5/jonathan-banks-confirms-el-camino-role/ |title=Jonathan Banks Confirms 'El Camino' Role |website=[[ET Canada]] |date=September 22, 2019 |access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Jonathan Banks 2012 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Banks]] portrays Mike Ehrmantraut in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nThe ''Breaking Bad'' [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]] episode \"[[Say My Name (Breaking Bad)|Say My Name]]\" received critical acclaim, with many critics singling out Jonathan Banks and [[Bryan Cranston]] for particular praise.

Mike is a former [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] police officer who works for [[Gus Fring|Gus]]\u2014and, on occasion, [[Saul Goodman|Saul]]\u2014as a private investigator, head of security, [[Fixer (person)|cleaner]], and [[hitman]]. His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the ''Breaking Bad'' series, but are detailed in ''Better Call Saul''. In 2019, he briefly appeared in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a film directed and written by Vince Gilligan, made by Netflix and a continuation of the original show. In 2019, he became the first character to appear in ''Breaking Bad'', ''Better Call Saul'', and ''El Camino'' and is one of only two characters to have appeared in all three, the other being [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Associates of Saul Goodman#Ed Galbraith|Ed Galbraith]].\n\n==Creation==\nThe writers of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created the character of Mike Ehrmantraut as a substitute for [[Saul Goodman]], when actor [[Bob Odenkirk]] was unavailable for the last of four planned ''Breaking Bad'' episodes of [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|the second season]] because of a commitment to appear in ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.<ref name=\"hiatt20150316\">{{Cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |last2=Hiatt |first2=Brian |date=2015-03-16 |title=Bob Odenkirk on ''Saul'' and ''Mr. Show''{{'s}} Non-Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/bob-odenkirk-on-better-call-saul-and-the-mr-show-non-reunion-96299/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> They cast Jonathan Banks because they admired his work in the 1980s police drama ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''. Banks himself thought he would come on and do the role for the second season finale \"[[ABQ (Breaking Bad)|ABQ]]\", but had been impressed by working alongside [[Aaron Paul]] in that scene, and with the overall direction that [[Vince Gilligan]] had given for the episode once it aired. Banks considered his character close to that of [[Max Von Sydow]]'s Joubert from ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', an assassin that painted figurines on the side.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://tv.avclub.com/jonathan-banks-1798227722 | title = Jonathan Banks | first = Will | last = Harris | date = November 5, 2011 | accessdate = March 5, 2020 | work = [[The A.V.

He subsequently became an officer on the Philadelphia police force. Mike had one son, Matt, who also became a police officer. Matt married Stacey and they had a daughter, Kaylee. In an extended flashback in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode, \"[[Five-O (Better Call Saul)|Five-O]]\", Mike is revealed as a crooked cop who took bribes. Matt was approached by other corrupt officers and asked Mike for advice; Mike advised Matt that not taking the money would label him a [[whistleblower]], and endanger his life and family, so Matt took it. Matt's partner and another officer killed Matt because his hesitation caused them to think he might turn them in. Stacey and Kaylee left Philadelphia for Albuquerque after Matt's funeral. Mike identified the officers who killed Matt and arranged a similar ambush to kill both of them, after which he left for Albuquerque, allowing him to see Stacey and Kaylee.\n\n===''Better Call Saul''===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nMike works as a parking lot attendant at the courthouse. In his off-hours he engages in security and \"muscle\" jobs to help support Stacey and Kaylee. Jimmy frequently deals with Mike when leaving the parking lot, irritated with Mike's demands for payment or the right number of validation stickers.\n\nPhiladelphia officers involved in the investigation of two murdered cops interrogate Mike, who hires Jimmy to represent him. Mike has Jimmy create a diversion, enabling Mike to steal one detective's notepad to learn what they know. He finds that Stacey contacted them after finding money hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. Mike admits to her that he was involved in corruption in Philadelphia, and confesses that he \"broke\" his son Matt by persuading him to go along. Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear he would report them, so Mike retaliated by killing the two of them, then moving to Albuquerque to be near his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Stacey accepts Mike's explanation and consoles him. The detectives have no solid evidence, and leave for Philadelphia without bringing charges. Mike aids Jimmy in proving the Kettlemans staged their own disappearance, then helps Jimmy recover and return the money the Kettlemans embezzled.\n\nOn one of his \"muscle\" jobs, Mike is employed by Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\") to protect him during a drug deal with [[Nacho Varga]]. Mike has no weapon, but remains calm and controlled. When the payment is $20 short, Mike insists that Nacho pay Pryce full. After the deal is complete, Mike explains that he investigated Nacho beforehand and determined he was operating without the knowledge of his bosses in the Salamanca drug cartel, giving him an incentive to ensure that the transaction went smoothly.\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nImpressed by Mike's work for Pryce, Nacho approaches him with a request to kill his boss [[Tuco Salamanca]], Hector's nephew. Nacho fears Tuco may learn about his outside drug deals, and that his erratic behavior will draw unwanted police attention to the Salamanca drug business. Rather than kill Tuco, Mike engineers a public altercation so that Tuco is sentenced to prison for assault. Hector convinces Mike to say that the gun Tuco was carrying was his to reduce Tuco's sentence, but Mike suspects Hector knows the truth.\n\nFearing Hector may exact revenge on Stacey and Kaylee, Mike attempts to disrupt Hector's drug trade by hijacking a Salamanca truck and stealing the $250,000 it carries, but allowing the driver to live. He intended for a \"Good Samaritan\" to free the driver, but learns from Nacho that when someone did stop to help, the truck driver called Hector first, and Hector's crew cleaned up the scene and killed the Good Samaritan.\n\nMike decides to kill Hector and procures a black market sniper rifle. As he prepares to fire at Hector, he is suddenly interrupted by the horn of a car.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike finds his moves have been tracked by [[Gus Fring]], the owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant chain, which is part of the cartel's drug trafficking chain. Gus meets with Mike and explains that he does not want Hector dead until the time is right. He encourages Mike to continue to disrupt Hector's drug trafficking and attempts to pay him, but Mike does not accept the money. He asks for help to launder the $250,000 he stole, and Gus obliges by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive, the parent company of Los Pollos and a participant in its drug activities, to hire Mike as a contracted security consultant and pay him monthly consulting fees. Mike joins Stacey at group therapy sessions to help her overcome Matt's death.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nMike quits work at the parking lot and conducts actual security consulting at Madrigal. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] informs him the consulting contract was supposed to be a paper transaction, but Mike argues that his inspections provide plausible cover if anyone questions the payments. When Lydia complains to Gus, he tacitly approves of Mike's actions. At the group therapy sessions, Mike confronts another attendee over his lies, which causes a temporary rift between Stacey and Mike.\n\nConflict between the Salamancas and Gus's organization lead to Hector Salamanca suffering a stroke, and Gus discreetly pays for his recovery to the point where he recovers his mental faculties and can move his right index finger. Gus initiates plans for a meth lab to be built under an industrial laundry, which is part of his plan to end reliance on cartel cocaine smuggled from Mexico. Mike arranges for structural engineers to secretly visit and assess the site while Gus silently observes. Gus selects Werner Ziegler to oversee construction of the lab, and Mike arranges for living quarters for Werner and his men during the months-long project. Mike takes to Werner, and tries to cover for him to Gus when Werner inadvertently reveals minimal details of the lab's construction to patrons at a local bar. When construction falls behind schedule, a homesick Werner escapes, intending to meet his wife at a nearby spa. Mike catches up to Werner and realizes that he has inadvertently revealed the existence of a construction project to Hector's nephew [[Lalo Salamanca]], who has arrived to take over management of the Salamanca drug business. Gus orders Werner's death, and offers to send someone to do it, but Mike executes Werner himself.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWerner's death forces Gus to halt construction of the lab. Mike pays Werner's men in full for the half-completed job and sends them home. Gus presents a cover story to Lalo and Juan Bolsa, claiming Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, stole cocaine, and fled, after which Mike tracked him down and killed him. The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, and Lalo and Juan accept Gus's explanation and apology, but Lalo remains suspicious. Mike reacts with disgust at Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner and refuses to accept Gus's offer to continue paying him during the construction delay. Mike continues to struggle with Werner's death and drinks to excess. He becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, which leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. \n\nA gang with whom Mike had a previous altercation beats and stabs him. He awakens at a ranch just inside the Mexico border, which has ties to Gus including a fountain dedicated to Max, where his wounds have been treated by [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]]. He attempts to leave, but in his weakened state Dr. Goodman easily catches up. The doctor re-bandages Mike's wounds and recommends that he stay to recuperate. Mike calls Gus to ask what he intends, but Gus hangs up on him. Gus subsequently arrives to speak with Mike in person and asks for his help. Mike refuses to be Gus's \"[[contract killing|button man]]\", killing only to further Gus's vendetta against the Salamancas. Gus tells Mike he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge. After Mike returns to Albuquerque, Gus puts him in charge of dealing with Nacho and his inside information on the Salamancas. Mike secretly points police to Lalo's car and its ties to the murder of the money wire clerk. After Nacho tips him off to Lalo's location, Mike uses a police radio to pretend to be an officer making a check on Lalo's license plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo's location while he is driving and detain him.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him, saying he moved past them by deciding to play the cards he was dealt. Lalo is arrested under an assumed name and remanded. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn Los Pollos Hermanos. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of one of Gus's restaurants then Gus sets an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike gives Jimmy details about the work he did to investigate to Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling Jimmy to win a motion for Lalo be released on bail.\n\nThe Cousins pick up Lalo's bail money in Mexico and deliver it to Jimmy at a remote pickup site. An informant makes a telephone call to report their activities. As Jimmy begins his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen, who take the cash and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked and killed, but one escapes. The shooter is revealed to be Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. Mike puts the cash and Jimmy back in Jimmy's car and they begin the drive to Albuquerque, but begin to walk cross-country after the car breaks down. They camp overnight and resume their trek the next morning. When they see the surviving gunman is still searching for them, Jimmy attracts his attention and draws him closer so Mike can shoot him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed, and the gunman is killed. Mike and Jimmy resume walking.\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nBy time of ''Breaking Bad'', Mike still works for Gus, and does occasional work for Jimmy, who continues practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] allows [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane]] to die from a heroin overdose, Saul dispatches Mike to clean [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s apartment. Mike removes all traces of the drugs and provides Jesse advice that enables him to avoid incriminating himself when speaking to police after Mike leaves. When Jesse later goes missing Mike tracks him down and drives Walt to the location.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWith Walt and [[Skyler White]] in the middle of a divorce, Saul has Mike spy on Skyler. Mike sees Walt arrive home, followed soon after by Tuco's cousins, who intend to kill Walt in retaliation for Tuco's death. Mike has Gus call off the cousins, since Walt is central to Gus's meth making scheme, and convinces them to target Hank, the DEA agent who shot Tuco. Gus then anonymously warns Hank, who is able to fight back. He survives the attack and kills one cousin, and Mike kills the other in the hospital.\n\nThe cartel disrupts Gus' meth distribution and he has Mike investigate. Mike kills the four cartel operatives sent to harass Duane Chow, one of Gus' chemical suppliers. He later hides in one of the Los Pollos Hermanos trucks during a drug run so he can learn the cartel's tactics and implement countermeasures that protect future drug shipments.\n\nWhile Walt and Jesse have been cooking meth in the underground superlab, Jesse has become more unstable. He learns that two of Gus's local drug dealers were responsible for the death of his friend Combo and Tom\u00e1s, the younger brother of Jesse's girlfriend Andrea. Knowing Jesse intends to kill the dealers, Walt acts first and runs them down with his car, then tells Jesse to flee.  Gus keeps Walt on, but requires that he work with [[Gale Boetticher|Gale]] again. Walt correctly fears that once Gale knows enough to take over, Gus will have Walt and Jesse killed.  Walt tricks Mike into looking for Jesse in the wrong place, giving Walt time to meet Jesse and tell him to find Gale's address. Mike later escorts Walt back to the lab on the pretense of responding to a chemical spill, but Walt knows Mike is supposed to kill him. Intending to kill Jesse too, Mike instructs Walt to call Jesse and persuade him to come to the lab.  Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale so that Gus will have to keep them alive to continue meth production.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nJesse kills Gale. Victor arrives soon after and brings Jesse back to the lab. Mike and Victor keep watch over Jesse and Walt while waiting for Gus. Knowing he was recognized at Gale's house, and hoping to demonstrate that he can still be useful to Gus, Victor begins producing a batch of meth, revealing that he has learned the process by watching Walt and Jesse. Gus arrives, kills Victor in front of Walt and Jesse, then tells them to get back to work. Mike increases security at the lab, including installing video cameras and personally standing watch over Walt and Jesse while they work.\n\nMike informs Gus they may be able to drive Walter and Jesse apart. Gus agrees, and Mike takes Jesse with him on dead-drop retrievals and other tasks. Jesse foils a prearranged attack on Mike, boosting his confidence and increasing his loyalty to Mike and Gus. After another Los Pollos Hermanos truck is robbed and the meth stolen, Jesse aids Mike in retrieving it. His competence convinces Mike and Gus to continue making use of Jesse, and he goes to Mexico with them for a meeting between Gus and the cartel leaders that is intended to end their dispute. Jesse produces a superior batch of meth on his own, and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico to produce it for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse. During a party at [[Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]'s house to celebrate the rapprochement, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of tequila to kill most of the cartel leaders, including taking the first drink himself to alleviate suspicion. Mike is shot helping Gus escape, and Jesse helps both the ill Gus and injured Mike make their way to pre-planned medical treatment. For the doctor Gus has hired, Mike's wounds are secondary to Gus\u2018s illness, and after Gus recovers, Mike remains in Mexico for several weeks while Gus and Jesse return to Albuquerque. While Mike is recovering, Walt engineers Gus\u2018s death, after which he and Jesse destroy the meth lab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike learns of Gus's death, blames Walt, and intends to kill him. As Mike drives back to Albuquerque, he encounters Walt and Jesse, who explain why they killed Gus. They remind him that the security camera footage from the lab can implicate both Mike and them, and ask for his aid in destroying it.  Mike tells them the recordings were stored on Gus's laptop, which is now in police custody.  He aids Walt and Jesse to build and employ an [[electromagnet]] that wipes the laptop's data. This inadvertently leads the police to discover, elsewhere in Gus's possessions, hidden account numbers and access codes for the money Gus deposited offshore to be used to pay the members of his organization for their silence.  They seize the accounts, making it likely that Gus's former employees will reveal Mike, Jesse, and Walt to the police.\n\nMike joins Walt and Jesse in a new organization, with Jesse and Walt producing meth in a mobile lab operated inside the tented homes of a fumigation company's customers.  When Lydia suspects the DEA is tracking the methylamine Madrigal supplies, she provides Mike, Walt and Jesse with information on a train that includes a tanker car of methylamine. They arrange to steal a large quantity without detection, but Todd, an employee of the fumigation company who aids in the robbery, shoots and kills a young boy who witnessed it. Wanting no part of this type of brutality, Mike and Jesse sell their share of the methylamine to Declan, a drug dealer from Phoenix, while Walt produces the meth Declan distributes.  Mike agrees to continue paying Gus's former employees from his share of the methylamine sale in order to ensure their continued silence.\n\nThe DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a \"go bag\" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing.  The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike, intending to flee, asks Saul to retrieve his go bag.  Walt retrieves it instead, and meets with Mike. He demands the names of Mike's associates in exchange, so he can have them killed in prison to protect his identity. Mike refuses, and Walt shoots him with the gun from the go bag.  After following a mortally wounded Mike to the edge of a river, Walt comes to the realization that he could have simply asked Lydia for the names. Walt begins to apologize, but Mike stops him, saying \"let me die in peace.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=\"Breaking Bad\" star Jonathan Banks: \"The bad guy's gotta die\" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/breaking-bad-star-jonathan-banks-bad-guys-gotta-201325777.html |website=Yahoo!
