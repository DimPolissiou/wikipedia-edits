A 18-year-old teenager who used to live at an orphanage before the caretakers threw him out. Their words condemning him as \"worthless\" have since left trauma on him and drive his will to fight in order to find a reason to live, slowly gaining confidence as the series progresses. His ability is named {{nihongo|Beast Beneath the Moonlight|\u6708\u4e0b\u7363|Gekkaj\u016b}}, which allows him to turn into a large white tiger with incredible strength, speed, regenerative capabilities and durability, although he has no control over it and retains no memory if he fully transforms (this lack of control is however repressed when he joins the Agency and the ability of the Agency's president causes Atsushi to regain control over the tiger). Later, he learns to change his limbs to that of a tiger to enhance his physical abilities.

A member of the Armed Detective Agency who takes Atsushi under his wing and is known for being a \"suicide maniac\" due to his wish to commit suicide and die comfortably one day, preferably with a beautiful woman. Under his carefree and relaxed demeanor, however, Dazai is extremely cunning, intelligent, skilled and brutal, once having been a feared executive of Port Mafia.

He has a habit of writing and planning everything ahead in his signature notebook, with the front cover labelled \"Ideals\". This notebook is linked to his ability, {{nihongo|Lone Poet|\u72ec\u6b69\u541f\u5ba2|Doppo Ginkaku}}, which allows him to bring into existence any object he writes inside, as long as it isn't larger than the notebook itself.\n\n===Ranpo Edogawa===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Ranpo Edogawa]]|\u6c5f\u6238\u5ddd \u4e71\u6b69|Edogawa Ranpo}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]]<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Vic Mignogna]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/FUNimation/status/947923638086459393|title=We're also excited to share that Rampo Edogawa will be voiced by @vicmignogna! #BungoStrayDogs|last=Funimation|website=@FUNimation|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref><ref name=\"MainDubCast\"/> (seasons 1-2), Landon McDonald (season 3; ''Dead Apple'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/05/14/bungo-stray-dogs-3rd-season-dub-is-coming-to-crunchyroll|title=Bungo Stray Dogs 3rd Season Dub is Coming to Crunchyroll!|last=Author|first=Guest|website=Crunchyroll|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>}}\n:Named after [[Edogawa Ranpo]]. The only Agency member without an ability and a self-proclaimed detective. Although he is one of the oldest in the office, he lacks basic everyday skills, preferring to focus his intelligence on solving cases instead. His prodigious observational and deduction skills are nicknamed {{nihongo|Super Deduction|\u8d85\u63a8\u7406|Ch\u014d suiri}} by him, which are supposedly activated when he puts on his glasses.\n\n===Junichir\u014d Tanizaki===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Junichir\u014d Tanizaki]]|\u8c37\u5d0e \u6f64\u4e00\u90ce|Tanizaki Jun'ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Toyonaga]]<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Spike Spencer]]<ref name=\"MainDubCast\"/>}}\n: Named after [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]]. An 18-year-old assistant at the Agency who mainly focuses on gathering information as his ability, {{nihongo|Light Snow|\u7d30\u96ea|[[Sasameyuki]]}}, allows him to project illusions within a certain area, which is not extremely suited for combat. He cohabits with his younger sister Naomi and treasures her dearly, despite finding some of her antics annoying.\n\n===Kenji Miyazawa===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Kenji Miyazawa]]|\u5bae\u6ca2 \u8ce2\u6cbb|Miyazawa Kenji}}\n:{{voiced by|Hiroyuki Kagura<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Lucien Dodge]]<ref name=\"MainDubCast\"/>}}\n: Named after [[Kenji Miyazawa]]. A 14-year-old optimistic and carefree boy hailing from the countryside, he is extremely popular among Yokohama residents due to his honesty and cheerful attitude. This makes him the Agency's primary data collector from eyewitnesses. His ability is called {{nihongo|Undefeated by the Rain|\u96e8\u30cb\u30e2\u30de\u30b1\u30ba|[[Ame ni mo Makezu]]}}, which grants him superhuman strength when he's hungry.\n\n===Akiko Yosano===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Akiko Yosano]]|\u4e0e\u8b1d\u91ce \u6676\u5b50|Yosano Akiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]]<ref name=\"cr20150929\"/>|[[Erica Lindbeck]]<ref name=\"MainDubCast\"/>}}\n: Named after [[Yosano Akiko]].

He is the President of the Armed Detective Agency, as well as Kunikida's mentor. His ability is {{nihongo|All Men Are Created Equal|\u4eba\u4e0a\u4eba\u4e0d\u9020|Hito no Ue ni Hito wo Tsukurazu}}, which allows him to control the abilities of his subordinates. This ability is especially useful for those who lack control over their abilities like Atsushi and Ky\u014dka.\n\n===Ky\u014dka Izumi===\n;{{Nihongo|[[Ky\u014dka Izumi]]|\u6cc9 \u93e1\u82b1|Izumi Ky\u014dka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Sumire Morohoshi]]<ref name=\"ann-96831\"/>|[[Cherami Leigh]]}}\n:Named after [[Ky\u014dka Izumi]]. A 14-year-old orphan girl who was taken in by the Port Mafia and became their youngest assassin. Her ability, {{nihongo|Demon Snow|\u591c\u53c9\u767d\u96ea|Yasha Shirayuki}}, materializes Demon Snow, a ruthless sword-wielding phantom that only follows orders coming from her mobile phone, which allowed Akutagawa to control her ability in the past. Her parents used to be assassins as well until an enemy attempted to use a body manipulation ability on them.

The club is the third major professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary, following the [[Calgary Tigers]] (1921\u20131927) and [[Calgary Cowboys]] (1975\u20131977). The Flames are one of two NHL franchises in Alberta; the other is the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. The cities' proximity has led to a rivalry known as the \"[[Battle of Alberta]]\".\n\nThe team was founded in [[1972\u201373 NHL season|1972]] in [[Atlanta]] as the [[Atlanta Flames]] until [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocating]] to Calgary in [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1980]].

In [[1985\u201386 Calgary Flames season|1985\u201386]], the Flames became the first Calgary team since the [[1923\u201324 WCHL season|1923\u201324]] Tigers to compete for the [[Stanley Cup]]. In [[1989 Stanley Cup Finals|1988\u201389]], the Flames won their first and only championship. The Flames' unexpected run to the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals]] gave rise to the [[Red Mile]], and in 2011 the team hosted and won the second [[2011 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]] outdoor game.\n\nThe Flames have won two [[Presidents' Trophy|Presidents' Trophies]] as the NHL's top regular season team, and have claimed seven division championships. Individually, [[Jarome Iginla]] is the franchise leader in games played, goals and points and is a two-time winner of the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]] as the NHL's leading goal scorer. [[Miikka Kiprusoff]] has the most wins by a goaltender in a Calgary Flames uniform. Nine people associated with the Flames have been inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].\n\nOff the ice, Calgary Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Flames, also own a [[Western Hockey League]] franchise (the [[Calgary Hitmen]]), a [[National Lacrosse League]] franchise (the [[Calgary Roughnecks]]) and a [[Canadian Football League]] franchise (the [[Calgary Stampeders]]).

In 1994, the Flames modified their jersey design, adding black to the team's colour scheme. The new striping pattern included a diagonal set of stripes from the base of the jersey on the player's right side coming up to just below the logo. The contrasting shoulder panels on both jerseys were extended down the sleeves, and contained the striping pattern on the forearms. For the 1996\u201397 season, the Flames reintroduced the Atlanta logo as their alternate captain's patch, and briefly experimented with using a smaller version of the \"flaming C\" as a captain's patch. Although the C was soon reverted to match the jersey's nameplate, the A logo patch remains in use to this day.\n\nIn 1998, to celebrate the \"Year of the Cowboy\", the Flames introduced its inaugural third jersey design, featuring the \"flaming horse\" logo on a black background.<ref name=\"FlamesHistory\"/> Two years later, the jersey became the Flames' road jersey, while the home jersey was updated to incorporate the same V-style striping on the arms and waist of the jersey.

The 2009\u201310 version of the jersey was produced in the traditional style that preceded the Edge redesign; for the following season, the throwback design was adapted to the Edge format as the Flames' new regular third jersey.\n\nFor the [[2011 Heritage Classic]], the Flames were matched against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] at [[McMahon Stadium]]. For this event game, the Flames wore uniforms inspired by the [[Calgary Tigers]], the city's first professional hockey team from the 1920s, which represented the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] in the [[1924 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the Canadiens. The Flames adapted the Tigers' black-and-gold jerseys to darker shades of their own colours \u2013 maroon and burnt yellow, with a yellow stripe across the chest and alternating stripes on the sleeves. The flaming C logo and pants were cream-coloured, adding to the \"vintage\" look of the uniform.\n\nIn 2013, the Flames introduced a new third jersey to replace their throwback uniform. The newest design is Western-inspired, with a script Calgary in black across the front of the jersey, and black shoulders with points on the front mimicking cowboy wear. This uniform was used until the 2015\u201316 season, after which the throwback third uniforms used from 2010 to 2013 were revived anew.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2016/09/21/calgary-flames-third-jersey-retro-nhl-season.html |title=Calgary Flames unveil retro third jersey for 2016/17 NHL season |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022091240/http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2016/09/21/calgary-flames-third-jersey-retro-nhl-season.html |archivedate=October 22, 2016 |accessdate=October 22, 2016 |date=September 21, 2016 |author=Krause, Darren |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe Flames retained their current uniform look when the NHL switched to [[Adidas]] as its uniform provider in 2017, with the exception of player names and numbers going from an italicized to a straight alignment.

The design of the logo has remained constant since it was created, though the Flames use a different coloured logo for the home and away jerseys. From 1980 until 2000, the home logo was red on a white background, while the road logo was white on a red background. In 2003, the NHL switched to using coloured jerseys for the home team.

They compete in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a member of the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. The club is the third major professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary, following the [[Calgary Tigers]] (1921\u20131927) and [[Calgary Cowboys]] (1975\u20131977). The Flames are one of two NHL franchises in Alberta; the other is the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. The cities' proximity has led to a rivalry known as the \"[[Battle of Alberta]]\".\n\nThe team was founded in [[1972\u201373 NHL season|1972]] in [[Atlanta]] as the [[Atlanta Flames]] until [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocating]] to Calgary in [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1980]]. The Flames played their first three seasons in Calgary at the [[Stampede Corral]] before moving into their current home arena, the [[Scotiabank Saddledome]] (originally known as the Olympic Saddledome), in [[1983\u201384 Calgary Flames season|1983]]. In [[1985\u201386 Calgary Flames season|1985\u201386]], the Flames became the first Calgary team since the [[1923\u201324 WCHL season|1923\u201324]] Tigers to compete for the [[Stanley Cup]]. In [[1989 Stanley Cup Finals|1988\u201389]], the Flames won their first and only championship. The Flames' unexpected run to the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals]] gave rise to the [[Red Mile]], and in 2011 the team hosted and won the second [[2011 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]] outdoor game.\n\nThe Flames have won two [[Presidents' Trophy|Presidents' Trophies]] as the NHL's top regular season team, and have claimed seven division championships. Individually, [[Jarome Iginla]] is the franchise leader in games played, goals and points and is a two-time winner of the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]] as the NHL's leading goal scorer. [[Miikka Kiprusoff]] has the most wins by a goaltender in a Calgary Flames uniform. Nine people associated with the Flames have been inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].\n\nOff the ice, Calgary Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Flames, also own a [[Western Hockey League]] franchise (the [[Calgary Hitmen]]), a [[National Lacrosse League]] franchise (the [[Calgary Roughnecks]]) and a [[Canadian Football League]] franchise (the [[Calgary Stampeders]]). Through the Flames Foundation, the team has donated more than {{CA$|32 million|link=yes}} to charity throughout southern Alberta since the franchise arrived.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Atlanta Flames (1972\u20131980)===\n{{Main|Atlanta Flames}}\n[[File:Atlantaflamesgoalhug.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Lysiak]] celebrates with teammates after a goal against the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]].

In 1994, the Flames modified their jersey design, adding black to the team's colour scheme. The new striping pattern included a diagonal set of stripes from the base of the jersey on the player's right side coming up to just below the logo. The contrasting shoulder panels on both jerseys were extended down the sleeves, and contained the striping pattern on the forearms. For the 1996\u201397 season, the Flames reintroduced the Atlanta logo as their alternate captain's patch, and briefly experimented with using a smaller version of the \"flaming C\" as a captain's patch. Although the C was soon reverted to match the jersey's nameplate, the A logo patch remains in use to this day.\n\nIn 1998, to celebrate the \"Year of the Cowboy\", the Flames introduced its inaugural third jersey design, featuring the \"flaming horse\" logo on a black background.<ref name=\"FlamesHistory\"/> Two years later, the jersey became the Flames' road jersey, while the home jersey was updated to incorporate the same V-style striping on the arms and waist of the jersey. This jersey was once again relegated to third jersey status in 2003 when the NHL adopted the coloured jerseys for the home team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2003/01/nhl_039quacked039_up |title=NHL 'quacked' up with hockey jersey switch |author=Karol, Kristofer |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |publisher=statenews.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511221346/http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2003/01/nhl_039quacked039_up |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, with the introduction of the Rbk Edge jersey, the Flames updated their look once again, replacing the horizontal striping with vertical striping down the sides. To honour the team's heritage, the Flames added the [[flag of Alberta|flags of Alberta]] [[Flag of Canada|and Canada]] as shoulder patches.<ref name=\"RbkEdge\" /> In celebration of their 30th season in Calgary, the Flames wore their original jersey design for five games in [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310]], each against a Canadian opponent. The 2009\u201310 version of the jersey was produced in the traditional style that preceded the Edge redesign; for the following season, the throwback design was adapted to the Edge format as the Flames' new regular third jersey.\n\nFor the [[2011 Heritage Classic]], the Flames were matched against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] at [[McMahon Stadium]]. For this event game, the Flames wore uniforms inspired by the [[Calgary Tigers]], the city's first professional hockey team from the 1920s, which represented the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] in the [[1924 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the Canadiens. The Flames adapted the Tigers' black-and-gold jerseys to darker shades of their own colours \u2013 maroon and burnt yellow, with a yellow stripe across the chest and alternating stripes on the sleeves. The flaming C logo and pants were cream-coloured, adding to the \"vintage\" look of the uniform.\n\nIn 2013, the Flames introduced a new third jersey to replace their throwback uniform. The newest design is Western-inspired, with a script Calgary in black across the front of the jersey, and black shoulders with points on the front mimicking cowboy wear. This uniform was used until the 2015\u201316 season, after which the throwback third uniforms used from 2010 to 2013 were revived anew.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2016/09/21/calgary-flames-third-jersey-retro-nhl-season.html |title=Calgary Flames unveil retro third jersey for 2016/17 NHL season |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022091240/http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2016/09/21/calgary-flames-third-jersey-retro-nhl-season.html |archivedate=October 22, 2016 |accessdate=October 22, 2016 |date=September 21, 2016 |author=Krause, Darren |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe Flames retained their current uniform look when the NHL switched to [[Adidas]] as its uniform provider in 2017, with the exception of player names and numbers going from an italicized to a straight alignment.

The design of the logo has remained constant since it was created, though the Flames use a different coloured logo for the home and away jerseys. From 1980 until 2000, the home logo was red on a white background, while the road logo was white on a red background. In 2003, the NHL switched to using coloured jerseys for the home team. The home logo became black, with the road logo red on a white background.

{"title_page": "Navy lighterage pontoon", "text_new": "[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N. Laycock discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell.]]\n\nThe '''Navy Lighterage pontoon''' (NLP) was a type of [[Float (nautical)|pontoon]] developed in World War II by Capt. John N. Laycock [[Civil Engineer Corps]] and used by Naval Construction Battalions([[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]]s) on invasion beaches and shallow harbors or harbors where the facilities had been destroyed or did not exist.  It was referred to as the Seabee's \"magic box\".  It was [[Lego]]-like system of pre-cut pre-drilled [[angle iron]] and steel plate.  It was first assembled into individual boxes that were joined in multiples to construct docks, causeways,  [[rhinos|barges]], dry docks, floating cranes or whatever was needed.\n\nCapt. Carl A. Carlson CEC of the War Plans Office came up with the concept of NLPs in 1935, but it was in 1940 that the US Navy looked at the idea more seriously. Development, with testing, began just before the US entered World War II.  The [[Dieppe Raid]] in early 1942 showed that the idea of seizing a port in the face of modern coastal defences was either costly or impossible. The US Navy saw the vital importance of being able to build their own port facilities and to deploy naval construction units trained and dedicated for just that role.  Creating the Seabees addressed that issue.  Four battalions were tasked as pontoon battalions and four Pontoon Assembly Detachments (PADs) were formed. The US Army soon followed with their own units.\n\n==Construction==\nThe NLPs were constructed of welded steel flotation units that were assembled like Legos, connected by special angle-iron pieces, called stringers. The flotation boxes and stringers were held together by special iron wedge pins. The flotation boxes came in two types: a rectangular basic unit measuring {{convert|5|x|5|x|7|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The majority of NLPs were constructed using these. The second type had one side that was curved or angled to make a [[Bow (ship)|bow]]s on the front of NLP barges or a ramp as needed.\n\n== References ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=2yADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=Navy+Lighterage+pontoons+%22Popular+Science%22&source=bl&ots=vr4VNSb0aj&sig=TaBq1w96Z-QkTHfMtV6ZTSiFuBM&hl=en&ei=wDjmTPGhKdnhnQehyMT2DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Navy's pin-up Boxes\", February 1946, Popular Science] illustrations of NPL units\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/nl.htm \"Navy Lighterage\", ''Global Security'']\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rhino ferry]]\n\n[[Category:World War II military equipment of the United States]]\n[[Category:Military bridging equipment]]\n[[Category:Pontoon bridges in the United States]]\n[[Category:Coastal construction]]\n[[Category:Amphibious warfare]]\n[[Category:Logistics]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Navy Lighterage pontoon''' (NLP) was a type of [[Float (nautical)|pontoon]] developed in World War II by Capt.

The flotation boxes and stringers were held together by special iron wedge pins. The flotation boxes came in two types: a rectangular basic unit measuring {{convert|5|x|5|x|7|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The majority of NLPs were constructed using these. The second type had one side that was curved or angled to make a [[Bow (ship)|bow]]s on the front of NLP barges or a ramp as needed.\n\n== References ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=2yADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=Navy+Lighterage+pontoons+%22Popular+Science%22&source=bl&ots=vr4VNSb0aj&sig=TaBq1w96Z-QkTHfMtV6ZTSiFuBM&hl=en&ei=wDjmTPGhKdnhnQehyMT2DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Navy's pin-up Boxes\", February 1946, Popular Science] illustrations of NPL units\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/nl.htm \"Navy Lighterage\", ''Global Security'']\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rhino ferry]]\n\n[[Category:World War II military equipment of the United States]]\n[[Category:Military bridging equipment]]\n[[Category:Pontoon bridges in the United States]]\n[[Category:Coastal construction]]\n[[Category:Amphibious warfare]]\n[[Category:Logistics]]\n", "name_user": "Mcb133aco", "label": "safe", "comment": "added image", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_lighterage_pontoon"}

On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.
