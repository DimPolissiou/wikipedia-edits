Initially announced in 2009 as ''Thief 4'', it was later announced in 2013 that the game is a reboot for the series.\n\nThe game is set in 'The City', a [[dark fantasy]] world inspired by [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[gaslight fantasy]] and [[steampunk]] aesthetics. Players control [[Garrett (character)|Garrett]], a master thief who embarks on several missions focusing on stealing from the rich. Players may approach levels in a variety of different ways; players can choose the action oriented and lethal approach, where players will disable or kill enemies on their way to their destination, using knives and takedowns, or opt for the non-lethal stealthy approach, where players minimize interaction with NPCs and the environment in order to avoid detection. Players also may choose which path to take to their destination, as each location contains several branching paths.\n\nUpon release, the game received a mixed critical reception, with critics praising its replay value and stealth gameplay, but criticizing the map layout and story.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers control [[Garrett (character)|Garrett]], a master thief, as he goes about a series of missions, most of which are focused around stealing from the rich. As with the previous games in the series, players must use [[stealth game|stealth]] in order to overcome challenges, while violence is left as a minimally effective last resort.\n\nThere are a variety of routes through each level and players are able to utilize a variety of playing styles to traverse them.<ref name=IGN-announce>{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|title=Thief 4 Coming in 2014|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/05/thief-4-coming-in-2014|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> The game contains a variety of ways to distract or kill guards, such as barrels of oil which can be set alight. Levels also contain money and valuable objects which Garrett can steal; these are immediately converted into money which can be spent on equipment and upgrades. Garrett is also able to [[pickpocket]] guards and other characters.<ref name=GE-details>{{cite web|title=Thief \u2013 tons of details from Game Informer|url=http://gamingeverything.com/42090/thief-tons-of-details-from-game-informer/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307032516/http://gamingeverything.com/42090/thief-tons-of-details-from-game-informer/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 March 2013|work=Gaming Everything|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> The player may evade guards by hiding in shadows or around corners and is able to peek around edges and through keyholes in order to track the movements of enemies. Once Garrett has been spotted, guards and other [[non-player characters]] will attempt to hunt him down. The developers have stated that the game's [[artificial intelligence]] is aware of the level design, and as such guards will know in advance of potential hiding spots that the player may be utilizing.<ref name=GE-details /><ref name=Watts-Mar52013 />\n\nPlayers may enter a \"Focus\" mode, which provides several advantages.<ref name=GE-details /><ref name=Watts-Mar52013 /> It enhances Garrett's vision, highlighting pipes that can be climbed, or candles that can be put out to make the area darker. Focus can also slow down time, so that Garrett is able to steal more effectively while pickpocketing. Garrett can also use Focus to push enemies or perform debilitating attacks. It can be further upgraded over the course of the game.\n\nGarrett carries a [[club (weapon)|blackjack]], used to knock guards unconscious; a collapsible,<ref>{{cite web|title=Thief 4 Leaked Trailer |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xICYmQmNNv4/|work=YouTube|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> compound bow, which can be used for both combat and non-lethal purposes such as distracting guards; and a claw, which can be used to [[grapple (tool)|grapple]] onto higher ledges.\n\nAn [[Experience point|XP]] system for the in-game growth of the character was meant to be used in the final game, but was later scrapped after negative feedback from fans, and to reflect the fact that the character was already a master thief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ap.ign.com/en/news/9644/thief-s-xp-system-scrapped-after-fan-feedback |title=All updates: Thief's XP System Scrapped After Fan Feedback |publisher=Ap.ign.com |date=2013-10-20 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n''Thief'' is set in a [[dark fantasy]] world inspired by [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], and [[steampunk]] aesthetics. Garrett, a master thief who has been away from his hometown for a long time, returns to it, a place known only as The City, and finds it ruled with an iron grip by a tyrant called the Baron. While The City is ravaged by a [[plague (disease)|plague]], the rich continue to live in isolation and good fortune while the poor are forming numerous mobs against the authorities. Garrett intends to use the volatile situation to his favor.<ref name=GE-details /><ref name=\"Reeves-Mar52013\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/03/05/april-cover-revealed-thief.aspx| title=April Cover Revealed: Thief |publisher=[[Game Informer]] |first=Ben |last=Reeves |date=March 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA reboot of the series, the story is set several hundreds of years after the original events in the same universe, with clues to the backstory being hidden among documents, letters and  plaques. The original master thief Garrett's (known as the legendary Sneak Thief) iconic mechanical eye is one of the hidden unique loots in the game that can be found inside of a prison complex.<ref>[http://www.primagames.com/games/thief/walkthrough/thief-complete-walkthrough-chapter-5-forsaken-how-kill-freaks Primagames.com]</ref> Other references to the original series include the Keepers, Hammerites and the Old Gods, with ruins relating to them being visitable locations throughout the City and beneath.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.eidosmontreal.com/blogs/Take-5-QA-2?theme=thief|title=Take 5 \u2013 Community Q&A #2|last=Badke|first=Adam|work=Eidos Montr\u00e9al|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nDuring a night of revelry in the City, Garrett, a thief of exceptional skill, finds himself hired by his contact Basso to steal something from the estate of Baron Northcrest, the ruler of the city. To assist him on the job, Garrett finds himself working with Erin, a fellow thief who tends to be reckless in her actions. While seeking a way up to the roof of the Baron's manor, Erin kills a guard with her claw, causing Garrett to chastise her for doing so without a legitimate cause. Upon coming across a skylight on the roof overlooking a large hall, the pair witness Northcrest leading a group of men into conducting a magical ritual. Having a bad feeling about the job, Garrett calls it off, only for Erin to disagree and attempt to complete the task. Upon noticing that Garrett stole her claw to prevent her from using it to kill again, a struggle breaks out between the two, resulting in her falling through the skylight and disrupting the ritual while being influenced by the energy being channeled. Garrett, who fails to save her, soon falls into the hall and is promptly knocked out.\n\nGarrett awakens one year later to find that the City is being plagued by a disease of unknown origin called \"The Gloom\", and that the city's guards are maintaining a lockdown on the various districts as a direct result of the situation. Returning to his hideout in an abandoned clocktower to consider his next move, Garret receives a message from Basso requesting his presence, whereupon after expressing his concerns over the incident at the manor, he hires Garrett to steal a ring off of a noble's body at a foundry that is being used to deal with the victims of the Gloom. Despite being nearly caught by the Baron's right-hand man, the Thief-Taker General, Garrett successfully completes the job and soon finds himself introduced to a man called Orion, the leader of a resistance movement working to bring down the Baron as a result of his tyranny, who hired him to steal the ring. Agreeing to help him, Garrett ventures to a hidden brothel to find a book, visiting Erin's hideout in the process and experiencing a vision of her mentioning a place called Moira Asylum. Shortly after completing Orion's job, Basso is arrested by the General, prompting Garrett to rescue him, while also breaking into the Baron's most secret vault and recovering a piece of a mysterious stone called the Primal, which he had witnessed being used in the ritual at Northcrest's manor. With this piece in his possession, Garrett experiences another vision, revealing to him that Erin is still alive, but under the influence of the power from the stone.\n\nDeciding to search for her, Garrett decides to explore Moira Asylum to find out where she is, but only uncovers the second piece of the stone within the building. Unable to find her, Garrett decides to return to Northcrest's manor and confront the Baron, just as Orion sparks a revolution on the City's streets to overthrow him. Finding Northcrest in a tower of his manor, the Baron reveals that his ritual intended to harness the power of the stone in order to use it as a new energy source, until the ritual was disrupted and the stone fragmented, resulting in the Gloom being unleashed into the City. Orion transpires to be the Baron's illegitimate brother Aldous, who took advantage of the chaos that ensued to arrange for his downfall, and that he now seeks the Primal for his own purposes. Realizing that the final piece of the stone somehow managed to embed itself into Garrett's eye, the Baron drives him away. Seeking information on the stone, Garrett visits one of his informants, the Queen of Beggars, who informs him that the Primal must be reassembled and its power contained, not only for Erin's sake, but also to save the City from the Gloom. Breaking into an old cathedral and finding Aldous using Erin to help him heal citizens, unaware that his 'cure' eventually transform them into monsters, Garrett finds himself in one final confrontation with the General, before pursuing Aldous to his hideout aboard a ship called \"Dawn's Light\". Just as Garrett attempts to dissuade him from using the Primal's power, Erin suddenly unleashes it, killing Aldous in the process, before attacking Garrett.\n\nAfter a lengthy fight, Garrett manages to calm Erin and reassemble the stone, returning her to normal, just as she hangs off the ship above the waters below. As she slips from his grasp, Garrett chooses to do as she asks and throws her down the claw. After being blinded by a flash of light, Garrett awakens to find the claw embedded in a wooden post, implying that she managed to save herself, yet notices that she is nowhere to be found, as dawn arrives.\n\n==Development==\n''Thief'' was initially announced in 2009 under the [[working title]] ''Thief 4'' (stylized as ''Thi4f''), after rumours of its development. Developed at [[Eidos Montr\u00e9al]], the game was handled by a team other than the one that made ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Andy|title=Thief dev: 'There are a lot of action titles... this is Thief'|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/394467/thief-dev-there-are-a-lot-of-action-titles-this-is-thief/|work=Computerandvideogames.com|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> The development team was initially kept small, and the game remained in concept phase for a long time. During this, numerous experimental design changes were proposed, such as having a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective, having a new protagonist, or environmental clambering similar to the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series of games.<ref name=GE-details /><ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Andy|title=Thief 4 team experimented with Assassin's Creed-style third-person elements|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/394556/thief-4-team-experimented-with-assassins-creed-style-third-person-elements/|work=Computerandvideogames.com|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> The general manager of the studio, Stephane D'Astous, was quoted as stating ''Thief 4'' was currently in early development: \"We're in the early development stages for ''Thief 4'', but this is an incredibly ambitious project and a very exciting one. It's too early for us to offer any specific game details.

reviewers praised its stealth gameplay, level design, graphics, and replay value, but criticized its map layout, technical issues, and story.\n\nGameZone's Mike Splechta gave the PlayStation 4 version a 6.5/10, stating \"Some might be able to look past Thief's shortcomings and instead only focus on the moments of brilliance. However, I imagine long-time Thief fans hoping for Garrett's grand return might be somewhat disappointed.\"<ref name=\"GameZone\"/> Giving the reboot a score of 6.8, [[IGN]]'s Dan Stapleton criticized the decision to replace the voice actor for Garrett, saying that the new actor, Romano Orzari, made the protagonist seem \"flat\" and \"poorly lip-synced\"; Stapleton also took issue with the sub-par AI, lack of variety or creativity in Garrett's choice of weapons, the poorly designed and cumbersome layout of The City, and the story, calling it \"bland\" and \"supernatural-driven\". However, he praised the ability to change the difficulty of the game so as to make it more challenging and was also positive about Garrett's new sprinting mechanics.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> The Telegraph's Tim Martin was much more scathing in his review, giving the game 2 stars out of 5 and lambasting the rote manner in which each level plays out, forcing the player to conform to one set path through the maps and very rarely allowing him a sense of freedom and challenge. The review also pointed out that increasing the game's difficulty will do little to heighten any sense of danger or unpredictability; overall, Martin thought to be a half-hearted disaster.<ref name=\"TheTelegraph\"/>\n\nEurogamer Italy gave it a score of 9/10, saying: \"one of the best action-stealth titles in years and the first serious contender for the '2014 Game of the Year' contest\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2014-02-24-thief-review-recensione_9 |title=Thief - review \u2022 Recensioni \u2022 PlayStation 4 \u2022 |publisher=Eurogamer.it

Enix]], and released in February 2014 for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] video gaming platforms. [[Feral Interactive]] brought the game to macOS in November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/news/483/|title=The window opens: get your hands on Thief\u2122 for Mac {{!}} Feral News|website=www.feralinteractive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> It is a revival of the [[cult classic]] [[Thief (series)|''Thief'' video game series]] of which it is the fourth installment. Initially announced in 2009 as ''Thief 4'', it was later announced in 2013 that the game is a reboot for the series.\n\nThe game is set in 'The City', a [[dark fantasy]] world inspired by [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[gaslight fantasy]] and [[steampunk]] aesthetics. Players control [[Garrett (character)|Garrett]], a master thief who embarks on several missions focusing on stealing from the rich. Players may approach levels in a variety of different ways; players can choose the action oriented and lethal approach, where players will disable or kill enemies on their way to their destination, using knives and takedowns, or opt for the non-lethal stealthy approach, where players minimize interaction with NPCs and the environment in order to avoid detection. Players also may choose which path to take to their destination, as each location contains several branching paths.\n\nUpon release, the game received a mixed critical reception, with critics praising its replay value and stealth gameplay, but criticizing the map layout and story.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers control [[Garrett (character)|Garrett]], a master thief, as he goes about a series of missions, most of which are focused around stealing from the rich. As with the previous games in the series, players must use [[stealth game|stealth]] in order to overcome challenges, while violence is left as a minimally effective last resort.\n\nThere are a variety of routes through each level and players are able to utilize a variety of playing styles to traverse them.<ref name=IGN-announce>{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|title=Thief 4 Coming in 2014|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/05/thief-4-coming-in-2014|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> The game contains a variety of ways to distract or kill guards, such as barrels of oil which can be set alight. Levels also contain money and valuable objects which Garrett can steal; these are immediately converted into money which can be spent on equipment and upgrades. Garrett is also able to [[pickpocket]] guards and other characters.<ref name=GE-details>{{cite web|title=Thief \u2013 tons of details from Game Informer|url=http://gamingeverything.com/42090/thief-tons-of-details-from-game-informer/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307032516/http://gamingeverything.com/42090/thief-tons-of-details-from-game-informer/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 March 2013|work=Gaming Everything|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> The player may evade guards by hiding in shadows or around corners and is able to peek around edges and through keyholes in order to track the movements of enemies. Once Garrett has been spotted, guards and other [[non-player characters]] will attempt to hunt him down. The developers have stated that the game's [[artificial intelligence]] is aware of the level design, and as such guards will know in advance of potential hiding spots that the player may be utilizing.<ref name=GE-details /><ref name=Watts-Mar52013 />\n\nPlayers may enter a \"Focus\" mode, which provides several advantages.<ref name=GE-details /><ref name=Watts-Mar52013 /> It enhances Garrett's vision, highlighting pipes that can be climbed, or candles that can be put out to make the area darker. Focus can also slow down time, so that Garrett is able to steal more effectively while pickpocketing. Garrett can also use Focus to push enemies or perform debilitating attacks. It can be further upgraded over the course of the game.\n\nGarrett carries a [[club (weapon)|blackjack]], used to knock guards unconscious; a collapsible,<ref>{{cite web|title=Thief 4 Leaked Trailer |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xICYmQmNNv4/|work=YouTube|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> compound bow, which can be used for both combat and non-lethal purposes such as distracting guards; and a claw, which can be used to [[grapple (tool)|grapple]] onto higher ledges.\n\nAn [[Experience point|XP]] system for the in-game growth of the character was meant to be used in the final game, but was later scrapped after negative feedback from fans, and to reflect the fact that the character was already a master thief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ap.ign.com/en/news/9644/thief-s-xp-system-scrapped-after-fan-feedback |title=All updates: Thief's XP System Scrapped After Fan Feedback |publisher=Ap.ign.com |date=2013-10-20 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n''Thief'' is set in a [[dark fantasy]] world inspired by [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], and [[steampunk]] aesthetics. Garrett, a master thief who has been away from his hometown for a long time, returns to it, a place known only as The City, and finds it ruled with an iron grip by a tyrant called the Baron. While The City is ravaged by a [[plague (disease)|plague]], the rich continue to live in isolation and good fortune while the poor are forming numerous mobs against the authorities.

To assist him on the job, Garrett finds himself working with Erin, a fellow thief who tends to be reckless in her actions. While seeking a way up to the roof of the Baron's manor, Erin kills a guard with her claw, causing Garrett to chastise her for doing so without a legitimate cause. Upon coming across a skylight on the roof overlooking a large hall, the pair witness Northcrest leading a group of men into conducting a magical ritual. Having a bad feeling about the job, Garrett calls it off, only for Erin to disagree and attempt to complete the task. Upon noticing that Garrett stole her claw to prevent her from using it to kill again, a struggle breaks out between the two, resulting in her falling through the skylight and disrupting the ritual while being influenced by the energy being channeled. Garrett, who fails to save her, soon falls into the hall and is promptly knocked out.\n\nGarrett awakens one year later to find that the City is being plagued by a disease of unknown origin called \"The Gloom\", and that the city's guards are maintaining a lockdown on the various districts as a direct result of the situation. Returning to his hideout in an abandoned clocktower to consider his next move, Garret receives a message from Basso requesting his presence, whereupon after expressing his concerns over the incident at the manor, he hires Garrett to steal a ring off of a noble's body at a foundry that is being used to deal with the victims of the Gloom. Despite being nearly caught by the Baron's right-hand man, the Thief-Taker General, Garrett successfully completes the job and soon finds himself introduced to a man called Orion, the leader of a resistance movement working to bring down the Baron as a result of his tyranny, who hired him to steal the ring. Agreeing to help him, Garrett ventures to a hidden brothel to find a book, visiting Erin's hideout in the process and experiencing a vision of her mentioning a place called Moira Asylum. Shortly after completing Orion's job, Basso is arrested by the General, prompting Garrett to rescue him, while also breaking into the Baron's most secret vault and recovering a piece of a mysterious stone called the Primal, which he had witnessed being used in the ritual at Northcrest's manor. With this piece in his possession, Garrett experiences another vision, revealing to him that Erin is still alive, but under the influence of the power from the stone.\n\nDeciding to search for her, Garrett decides to explore Moira Asylum to find out where she is, but only uncovers the second piece of the stone within the building. Unable to find her, Garrett decides to return to Northcrest's manor and confront the Baron, just as Orion sparks a revolution on the City's streets to overthrow him. Finding Northcrest in a tower of his manor, the Baron reveals that his ritual intended to harness the power of the stone in order to use it as a new energy source, until the ritual was disrupted and the stone fragmented, resulting in the Gloom being unleashed into the City. Orion transpires to be the Baron's illegitimate brother Aldous, who took advantage of the chaos that ensued to arrange for his downfall, and that he now seeks the Primal for his own purposes. Realizing that the final piece of the stone somehow managed to embed itself into Garrett's eye, the Baron drives him away. Seeking information on the stone, Garrett visits one of his informants, the Queen of Beggars, who informs him that the Primal must be reassembled and its power contained, not only for Erin's sake, but also to save the City from the Gloom. Breaking into an old cathedral and finding Aldous using Erin to help him heal citizens, unaware that his 'cure' eventually transform them into monsters, Garrett finds himself in one final confrontation with the General, before pursuing Aldous to his hideout aboard a ship called \"Dawn's Light\". Just as Garrett attempts to dissuade him from using the Primal's power, Erin suddenly unleashes it, killing Aldous in the process, before attacking Garrett.\n\nAfter a lengthy fight, Garrett manages to calm Erin and reassemble the stone, returning her to normal, just as she hangs off the ship above the waters below. As she slips from his grasp, Garrett chooses to do as she asks and throws her down the claw. After being blinded by a flash of light, Garrett awakens to find the claw embedded in a wooden post, implying that she managed to save herself, yet notices that she is nowhere to be found, as dawn arrives.\n\n==Development==\n''Thief'' was initially announced in 2009 under the [[working title]] ''Thief 4'' (stylized as ''Thi4f''), after rumours of its development. Developed at [[Eidos Montr\u00e9al]], the game was handled by a team other than the one that made ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Andy|title=Thief dev: 'There are a lot of action titles... this is Thief'|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/394467/thief-dev-there-are-a-lot-of-action-titles-this-is-thief/|work=Computerandvideogames.com|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> The development team was initially kept small, and the game remained in concept phase for a long time. During this, numerous experimental design changes were proposed, such as having a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective, having a new protagonist, or environmental clambering similar to the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series of games.<ref name=GE-details /><ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Andy|title=Thief 4 team experimented with Assassin's Creed-style third-person elements|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/394556/thief-4-team-experimented-with-assassins-creed-style-third-person-elements/|work=Computerandvideogames.com|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> The general manager of the studio, Stephane D'Astous, was quoted as stating ''Thief 4'' was currently in early development: \"We're in the early development stages for ''Thief 4'', but this is an incredibly ambitious project and a very exciting one. It's too early for us to offer any specific game details.

reviewers praised its stealth gameplay, level design, graphics, and replay value, but criticized its map layout, technical issues, and story.\n\nGameZone's Mike Splechta gave the PlayStation 4 version a 6.5/10, stating \"Some might be able to look past Thief's shortcomings and instead only focus on the moments of brilliance. However, I imagine long-time Thief fans hoping for Garrett's grand return might be somewhat disappointed.\"<ref name=\"GameZone\"/> Giving the reboot a score of 6.8, [[IGN]]'s Dan Stapleton criticized the decision to replace the voice actor for Garrett, saying that the new actor, Romano Orzari, made the protagonist seem \"flat\" and \"poorly lip-synced\"; Stapleton also took issue with the sub-par AI, lack of variety or creativity in Garrett's choice of weapons, the poorly designed and cumbersome layout of The City, and the story, calling it \"bland\" and \"supernatural-driven\". However, he praised the ability to change the difficulty of the game so as to make it more challenging and was also positive about Garrett's new sprinting mechanics.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> The Telegraph's Tim Martin was much more scathing in his review, giving the game 2 stars out of 5 and lambasting the rote manner in which each level plays out, forcing the player to conform to one set path through the maps and very rarely allowing him a sense of freedom and challenge. The review also pointed out that increasing the game's difficulty will do little to heighten any sense of danger or unpredictability; overall, Martin thought to be a half-hearted disaster.<ref name=\"TheTelegraph\"/>\n\nEurogamer Italy gave it a score of 9/10, saying: \"one of the best action-stealth titles in years and the first serious contender for the '2014 Game of the Year' contest\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2014-02-24-thief-review-recensione_9 |title=Thief - review \u2022 Recensioni \u2022 PlayStation 4 \u2022 |publisher=Eurogamer.it |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> Digital Spy gave it a glowing review, stating: \"While the game does have its faults - particularly falling apart when Garrett is spotted - ''Thief'' excels in the shadows as a pure stealth title, becoming increasingly enjoyable as your skills improve.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sequel==\nAt an OXM official press event a week before the game's release, Eidos Montr\u00e9al's Nick Cantin hinted a ''Thief'' sequel could be possible, depending upon its reception: \"Nothing's announced yet but we're very keen to see how people respond to the game [...] We've built a really big universe around the first game, and there's a lot of layers to it \u2013 the world is really deep [...] so there's a lot of possibilities to jump on.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/eidos-montreal-thief-sequel-ideas/|title=Eidos Montreal: \u2018Lots of Possibilities\u2019 For \u2018Thief\u2019 Sequel|work=GameRant|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official|http://www.thiefgame.com/}}\n* [https://www.mobygames.com/game/thief_ ''Thief''] at [[MobyGames]]\n* {{IMDb title|2764864}}\n\n{{Thief series}}\n{{Visual Works}}\n\n[[Category:2014 video games]]\n[[Category:Action-adventure games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Square Enix games]]\n[[Category:Stealth video games]]\n[[Category:Steampunk video games]]\n[[Category:Thief (series)]]\n[[Category:Unreal Engine games]]\n[[Category:Video game reboots]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video games that support Mantle]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "name_user": "LightKeyDarkBlade", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_(2014_video_game)"}

In 2004, it was consolidated into WMG's [[Atlantic Records Group]]. After five years of dormancy, the label was revived as an imprint of Atlantic in 2009. As of October 2018, Elektra was detached from the Atlantic Records umbrella and reorganized into Elektra Music Group, once again operating as an independently managed frontline label of Warner Music.\n\n==History==\n===1950\u20131971: Founding and early history===\nElektra was formed in 1950 by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt in Holzman's [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] dorm room.<ref name=\"npr-1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4954635|title=Warner Music Struggles to Restore Its Luster|date=October 11, 2005|work=NPR.org|accessdate=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603224151/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4954635|archive-date=June 3, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Each invested $300.

Holzman famously explained, \"I gave her the \u2018K\u2019 that I lacked\". He found the 'C' in the original name \"too soft\", but liked the \"solid bite\" of the letter 'K', citing its use in the [[Kodak]] name.<ref name=\"FTM_6\"/><ref>\u0397\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in the original Greek.</ref>\n\nThe first Elektra LP, ''New Songs'' (EKLP 1 released March 1951), was a collection of ''[[Lied]]er'' and similar art songs, which sold few copies. During the '50s and early '60s, the label concentrated on [[folk music]] recordings, releasing a number of best-selling albums by [[Theodore Bikel]], [[Ed McCurdy]], [[Oscar Brand]], and [[Judy Collins]], and [[protest song|protest singers]] such as [[Phil Ochs]] and [[Tom Paxton]]. Holzman also recorded [[Josh White]], who was without a record deal as a result of [[House Un-American Activities Committee|McCarthyite blacklisting]].\n\nIn 1964, Elektra launched [[Nonesuch Records]]. This classical budget label was the best-selling budget classical label of the era. Other labels followed suit by starting their own budget series, but Nonesuch remained the most popular and Jac Holzman states in his book that profits from the budget classical label made it possible for Elektra to experiment with their pop releases by the mid-'60s.\n\nIn 1965, Elektra began a short-lived joint venture with Survey Music called Bounty Records, which was Elektra's first foray into pop music.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=HCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=%22bounty+records%22+%2B+elektra#v=onepage&q=%22bounty%20records%22%20%2B%20elektra&f=false | title = Billboard | author1 = Nielsen Business Media | first1 = Inc | date = September 25, 1965}}</ref> The most notable signing for Bounty was the [[Paul Butterfield]] Band who was moved over to Elektra when Bounty folded.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TykEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22bounty+records%22+%2B+elektra#v=onepage&q=%22bounty%20records%22%20%2B%20elektra&f=false | title = Billboard | author1 = Nielsen Business Media | first1 = Inc | date = June 26, 1965}}</ref>\n\nElektra's entrance into pop gained the label considerable prestige within the music scene by being one of the first labels to sign up leading acts from the new wave of American [[psychedelic rock]] of 1966\u20131967. The label's most important signings were the Chicago-based [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] (with [[Mike Bloomfield]]), the Los Angeles bands [[Love (band)|Love]] and [[The Doors]], and the Detroit bands [[The Stooges]] and [[MC5]]. Included in Elektra's LA signings were [[Tim Buckley]] and [[Bread (band)|Bread]]. In 1968, the label also signed pioneering rock guitar soloist [[Lonnie Mack]] to a three-album deal.\n\nAlso in 1967, Elektra launched its influential Nonesuch Explorer Series, one of the first collections of what is now referred to as [[world music]]. Excerpts from several Nonesuch Explorer recordings were later included on the two [[Voyager Golden Record|Voyager Golden Discs]], which were sent into deep space in 1977 aboard the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] space probes.\n\n===1971\u20131989: Elektra/Asylum Records===\nElektra, along with its [[Nonesuch Records]] subsidiary, was acquired by [[Kinney National Company|Kinney National Services]] in 1970, which changed its name to [[Warner Communications]] in 1972.<ref name=\"CNNHistory\"/> Soon afterwards, Kinney consolidated their label holdings under the [[Warner Music Group|Warner-Elektra-Atlantic]] umbrella. Holzman remained in charge of Elektra until 1972, when it merged with [[Asylum Records]] to become Elektra/Asylum Records; Asylum's founder, [[David Geffen]], would head the newly combined label.<ref name=\"CNNHistory\"/> Holzman, in the meantime, was appointed senior vice president and chief technologist for Warner \u2014 ushering the company into home video and the first interactive cable system. Holzman also went on to acquire [[Discovery Records]]. In 1975, Geffen stepped down when he was told that he had a terminal illness;<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 282, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> He later was revealed to have been falsely diagnosed. He was replaced by Joe Smith, who later went on to become CEO of [[Capitol Records]].\n\nJoe Smith, whose leadership resulted in the biggest market share and gross revenues Elektra Asylum was to have, inherited the A&R services of [[Chuck Plotkin]], famed later for producing many of Bruce Springsteen's greatest records, followed up by [[George Daly (music executive)|George Daly]], who is credited as bringing in seminal [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[The Cars]], setting Elektra, again, on another artist direction.\n\nAlthough the label was technically listed as \"Elektra/Asylum Records\" on the label credits, as the years went on, the label began to unofficially call itself Elektra Records again (with Asylum operating as a subsidiary label). In 1982, Elektra launched a jazz subsidiary called [[Elektra/Musician]]. The following year, [[Bob Krasnow]] became president and CEO of Elektra; under his leadership, the label reached its commercial peak throughout the rest of the 1980s and early to mid-1990s.\n\n===1989\u20132004: Elektra Entertainment Group===\nIn 1989, the label officially changed its name to Elektra Entertainment. During the [[Bob Krasnow]] era, the label became home to a wide range of artists, such  as [[Metallica]], [[The Cars]], [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Stereolab]], and [[Teddy Pendergrass]]. Also during this time, Elektra developed a relationship with the [[United Kingdom|UK]] label [[4AD]]. Elektra became the label for 4AD acts such as the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[the Breeders]], [[Black Francis|Frank Black]], and [[The Amps]] in the United States and Canada.\n\nLike its sister labels, Elektra's fortunes began to wane in the mid-1990s, in part because of a series of bitter corporate battles between senior Warner label executives, which seriously damaged the collective reputation of the group. Unhappy with major structural changes enacted by then Warner Music Group chairman Robert Morgado, Bob Krasnow abruptly resigned in July 1994, and others soon followed; the highly respected Warner Bros CEO [[Mo Ostin]] decided not to renew his contract and left in December 1994, and Ostin's friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Lenny Waronker]] left early the next year. Krasnow was replaced by [[Sylvia Rhone]], who at the time was a senior vice president at Atlantic Records, and also the CEO of Atlantic's [[East West Records|EastWest Records America]] imprint. Upon Rhone's arrival at Elektra, the label took over the operations of EastWest, as well as [[Sire Records]] (which had previously operated through its sister label [[Warner Bros. Records]]) and  was renamed Elektra Entertainment Group.\n\nIn September 1994, another damaging controversy erupted when top heavy-metal band [[Metallica]] filed suit against Elektra to terminate their contract and gain ownership of their master recordings. The group based its claim on a section of the [[California Labor Code]] that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. By this time, Metallica had been with the label for more than a decade and had racked up sales over 40 million records, but they were still operating under the terms of their original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/28/arts/heavy-metal-band-sues-record-label.html?pagewanted=1%3Fpagewanted%3D1 |title=\"Heavy Metal Band Sues Record Label\", ''New York Times'', 28 September 1994 |access-date=September 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215233329/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/28/arts/heavy-metal-band-sues-record-label.html?pagewanted=1%3Fpagewanted%3D1 |archive-date=December 15, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The group also claimed that they were taking the action because Robert Morgado had refused to honor a new deal they had worked out with Bob Krasnow shortly before he quit the label. Elektra responded by countersuing the group, but in December, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine reported rumors that then Warner Music US chairman [[Doug Morris]] had offered the group a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit,<ref>Pat Wechsler & Roger D. Friedman, \"Heavy Metal Gets the Heavy Bucks\", Intelligencer section, ''New York'' magazine, December 19\u201326, 1994, p.26</ref> which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January, the group and Elektra jointly announced that they had settled the suit, and although a nondisclosure agreement kept the terms secret, media sources claimed, \"a significant increase in royalty payments to the band as well as a renegotiation of the group's recording contract were key factors in Metallica and Elektra coming to terms.\"<ref>[http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-01-06/entertainment/17791896_1_metallica-elektra-entertainment-group-band SFGAte.com, 6 January 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811212130/http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-01-06/entertainment/17791896_1_metallica-elektra-entertainment-group-band |date=August 11, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDespite having a large stable of noted acts, as the 1990s drew to a close, Elektra began to see a slump in revenue, while noticeably underperforming on the charts. It also developed a bit of a sullen reputation in the industry for not properly promoting many of its releases, thus earning the nickname \"Neglektra\" from several signed artists, such as [[Marvelous 3]], [[Jason Falkner]], and [[Greg Dulli]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sachs|first1=Tony|title=Author (Still) Unknown: The Brilliant Music and Star-Crossed Career of Jason Falkner|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-sachs/author-still-unknown-the_b_604062.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=8 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914003208/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-sachs/author-still-unknown-the_b_604062.html|archive-date=September 14, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Greg Dulli Sells His Soul at Summer's Kiss - Afghan Whigs, Twilight Singers|url=http://www.summerskiss.com/awpress/greg_dulli_sells_his_soul.php|website=www.summerskiss.com|accessdate=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925084306/http://www.summerskiss.com/awpress/greg_dulli_sells_his_soul.php|archive-date=September 25, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> and was easily lagging behind its sister labels Warner Bros.

As of October 2018, Elektra was detached from the Atlantic Records umbrella and reorganized into Elektra Music Group, once again operating as an independently managed frontline label of Warner Music.\n\n==History==\n===1950\u20131971: Founding and early history===\nElektra was formed in 1950 by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt in Holzman's [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] dorm room.<ref name=\"npr-1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4954635|title=Warner Music Struggles to Restore Its Luster|date=October 11, 2005|work=NPR.org|accessdate=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603224151/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4954635|archive-date=June 3, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Each invested $300. The usual spelling of the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiad]] [[Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]]<ref name=\"FTM_6\">Follow the Music p6</ref> was changed. Holzman famously explained, \"I gave her the \u2018K\u2019 that I lacked\". He found the 'C' in the original name \"too soft\", but liked the \"solid bite\" of the letter 'K', citing its use in the [[Kodak]] name.<ref name=\"FTM_6\"/><ref>\u0397\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in the original Greek.</ref>\n\nThe first Elektra LP, ''New Songs'' (EKLP 1 released March 1951), was a collection of ''[[Lied]]er'' and similar art songs, which sold few copies. During the '50s and early '60s, the label concentrated on [[folk music]] recordings, releasing a number of best-selling albums by [[Theodore Bikel]], [[Ed McCurdy]], [[Oscar Brand]], and [[Judy Collins]], and [[protest song|protest singers]] such as [[Phil Ochs]] and [[Tom Paxton]]. Holzman also recorded [[Josh White]], who was without a record deal as a result of [[House Un-American Activities Committee|McCarthyite blacklisting]].\n\nIn 1964, Elektra launched [[Nonesuch Records]]. This classical budget label was the best-selling budget classical label of the era. Other labels followed suit by starting their own budget series, but Nonesuch remained the most popular and Jac Holzman states in his book that profits from the budget classical label made it possible for Elektra to experiment with their pop releases by the mid-'60s.\n\nIn 1965, Elektra began a short-lived joint venture with Survey Music called Bounty Records, which was Elektra's first foray into pop music.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=HCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=%22bounty+records%22+%2B+elektra#v=onepage&q=%22bounty%20records%22%20%2B%20elektra&f=false | title = Billboard | author1 = Nielsen Business Media | first1 = Inc | date = September 25, 1965}}</ref> The most notable signing for Bounty was the [[Paul Butterfield]] Band who was moved over to Elektra when Bounty folded.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TykEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22bounty+records%22+%2B+elektra#v=onepage&q=%22bounty%20records%22%20%2B%20elektra&f=false | title = Billboard | author1 = Nielsen Business Media | first1 = Inc | date = June 26, 1965}}</ref>\n\nElektra's entrance into pop gained the label considerable prestige within the music scene by being one of the first labels to sign up leading acts from the new wave of American [[psychedelic rock]] of 1966\u20131967. The label's most important signings were the Chicago-based [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] (with [[Mike Bloomfield]]), the Los Angeles bands [[Love (band)|Love]] and [[The Doors]], and the Detroit bands [[The Stooges]] and [[MC5]]. Included in Elektra's LA signings were [[Tim Buckley]] and [[Bread (band)|Bread]]. In 1968, the label also signed pioneering rock guitar soloist [[Lonnie Mack]] to a three-album deal.\n\nAlso in 1967, Elektra launched its influential Nonesuch Explorer Series, one of the first collections of what is now referred to as [[world music]]. Excerpts from several Nonesuch Explorer recordings were later included on the two [[Voyager Golden Record|Voyager Golden Discs]], which were sent into deep space in 1977 aboard the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] space probes.\n\n===1971\u20131989: Elektra/Asylum Records===\nElektra, along with its [[Nonesuch Records]] subsidiary, was acquired by [[Kinney National Company|Kinney National Services]] in 1970, which changed its name to [[Warner Communications]] in 1972.<ref name=\"CNNHistory\"/> Soon afterwards, Kinney consolidated their label holdings under the [[Warner Music Group|Warner-Elektra-Atlantic]] umbrella. Holzman remained in charge of Elektra until 1972, when it merged with [[Asylum Records]] to become Elektra/Asylum Records; Asylum's founder, [[David Geffen]], would head the newly combined label.<ref name=\"CNNHistory\"/> Holzman, in the meantime, was appointed senior vice president and chief technologist for Warner \u2014 ushering the company into home video and the first interactive cable system. Holzman also went on to acquire [[Discovery Records]]. In 1975, Geffen stepped down when he was told that he had a terminal illness;<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 282, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> He later was revealed to have been falsely diagnosed. He was replaced by Joe Smith, who later went on to become CEO of [[Capitol Records]].\n\nJoe Smith, whose leadership resulted in the biggest market share and gross revenues Elektra Asylum was to have, inherited the A&R services of [[Chuck Plotkin]], famed later for producing many of Bruce Springsteen's greatest records, followed up by [[George Daly (music executive)|George Daly]], who is credited as bringing in seminal [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[The Cars]], setting Elektra, again, on another artist direction.\n\nAlthough the label was technically listed as \"Elektra/Asylum Records\" on the label credits, as the years went on, the label began to unofficially call itself Elektra Records again (with Asylum operating as a subsidiary label). In 1982, Elektra launched a jazz subsidiary called [[Elektra/Musician]]. The following year, [[Bob Krasnow]] became president and CEO of Elektra; under his leadership, the label reached its commercial peak throughout the rest of the 1980s and early to mid-1990s.\n\n===1989\u20132004: Elektra Entertainment Group===\nIn 1989, the label officially changed its name to Elektra Entertainment. During the [[Bob Krasnow]] era, the label became home to a wide range of artists, such  as [[Metallica]], [[The Cars]], [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Stereolab]], and [[Teddy Pendergrass]]. Also during this time, Elektra developed a relationship with the [[United Kingdom|UK]] label [[4AD]]. Elektra became the label for 4AD acts such as the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[the Breeders]], [[Black Francis|Frank Black]], and [[The Amps]] in the United States and Canada.\n\nLike its sister labels, Elektra's fortunes began to wane in the mid-1990s, in part because of a series of bitter corporate battles between senior Warner label executives, which seriously damaged the collective reputation of the group. Unhappy with major structural changes enacted by then Warner Music Group chairman Robert Morgado, Bob Krasnow abruptly resigned in July 1994, and others soon followed; the highly respected Warner Bros CEO [[Mo Ostin]] decided not to renew his contract and left in December 1994, and Ostin's friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Lenny Waronker]] left early the next year. Krasnow was replaced by [[Sylvia Rhone]], who at the time was a senior vice president at Atlantic Records, and also the CEO of Atlantic's [[East West Records|EastWest Records America]] imprint. Upon Rhone's arrival at Elektra, the label took over the operations of EastWest, as well as [[Sire Records]] (which had previously operated through its sister label [[Warner Bros. Records]]) and  was renamed Elektra Entertainment Group.\n\nIn September 1994, another damaging controversy erupted when top heavy-metal band [[Metallica]] filed suit against Elektra to terminate their contract and gain ownership of their master recordings. The group based its claim on a section of the [[California Labor Code]] that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. By this time, Metallica had been with the label for more than a decade and had racked up sales over 40 million records, but they were still operating under the terms of their original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/28/arts/heavy-metal-band-sues-record-label.html?pagewanted=1%3Fpagewanted%3D1 |title=\"Heavy Metal Band Sues Record Label\", ''New York Times'', 28 September 1994 |access-date=September 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215233329/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/28/arts/heavy-metal-band-sues-record-label.html?pagewanted=1%3Fpagewanted%3D1 |archive-date=December 15, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The group also claimed that they were taking the action because Robert Morgado had refused to honor a new deal they had worked out with Bob Krasnow shortly before he quit the label. Elektra responded by countersuing the group, but in December, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine reported rumors that then Warner Music US chairman [[Doug Morris]] had offered the group a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit,<ref>Pat Wechsler & Roger D. Friedman, \"Heavy Metal Gets the Heavy Bucks\", Intelligencer section, ''New York'' magazine, December 19\u201326, 1994, p.26</ref> which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January, the group and Elektra jointly announced that they had settled the suit, and although a nondisclosure agreement kept the terms secret, media sources claimed, \"a significant increase in royalty payments to the band as well as a renegotiation of the group's recording contract were key factors in Metallica and Elektra coming to terms.\"<ref>[http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-01-06/entertainment/17791896_1_metallica-elektra-entertainment-group-band SFGAte.com, 6 January 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811212130/http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-01-06/entertainment/17791896_1_metallica-elektra-entertainment-group-band |date=August 11, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDespite having a large stable of noted acts, as the 1990s drew to a close, Elektra began to see a slump in revenue, while noticeably underperforming on the charts.

This engine allows the aircraft to cruise relatively fast, at 130 kts (240 km/h) at 75% of the power.

This construction method has many advantages, starting with the reduction of the parts count, thus reducing costs while improving reliability and safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engineering.com/DesignSoftware/DesignSoftwareArticles/ArticleID/14322/Why-Cant-Engineers-Improve-on-a-60-Year-Old-Aircraft-Design.aspx|title=Why Can\u2019t Engineers Improve on a 60 Year Old Aircraft Design?|website=www.engineering.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> For instance, the wing is made from a single piece ([[Wing tip|wingtip]] to wingtip), like the [[fuselage]], the [[Tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]], the [[Aileron|ailerons]], the [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] and the canopy arch.\n\nOne of the most noticeable results from this technique is the complete removal of [[Longeron|longerons]], [[Rib (aeronautics)|ribs]] and [[Spar (aeronautics)|spars]] within the wing.\n\n=== Powerplant ===\nThe Elixir is powered by a [[Rotax 912|Rotax 912iS]], fuel injected version of one of the most popular engines fitting light aircraft, although the airframe is told to be dimensioned to receive the [[Rotax 915 iS|Rotax 915iS]]. This engine allows the aircraft to cruise relatively fast, at 130 kts (240 km/h) at 75% of the power. Apart from the performance in cruise, that type of engine turns out to be suitable for a use in flight training - which is the primary role of the Elixir - where piloting is taught at moderate speeds.\n\n=== Safety features ===\nThe modern design of the aircraft allows it to integrate safety at the very beginning of the design process.\n\n* BRS [[ballistic parachute]]\n* [[Angle of attack]] indicator\n* Anti-burst fuel tank (filled with foam)\n* Evolutive wing profile (with wing-fences to increase maneuverability at low speeds)\n\n== Production ==\nThe Elixir's production is currently taking place in [[P\u00e9rigny, Charente-Maritime|P\u00e9rigny]], next to [[La Rochelle]]. In the long run, Elixir Aircraft will produce the aircraft at [[La Rochelle \u2013 \u00cele de R\u00e9 Airport|La Rochelle airport]], where a 1.500 sqm plant will be built.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=8c0290b8-1cb5-4d6c-aff9-dd9d3689a162|title=Elixir Springs to Life|last=Sarsfield|first=Kate|date=June 20, 2019|website=Flight Global|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe production rate is going to be relatively reduced in a first time (10 to 12 aircraft the first year), before increasing in 2021 to reach 30 aircraft per year.<ref name=\":0\" /> The manufacturer hopes to reach a cadency of 100 aircraft per year around 2024.\n\n== Commercialization ==\nDuring the [[Paris Air Show]] 2019, the company was counting 87 pre-orders.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aerovfr.com/2019/06/lelixir-en-finale-pour-la-cs-23/|title=L'Elixir en finale pour la CS-23|last=Besse|first=Fran\u00e7ois|date=|website=AeroVFR|language=French|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> According to Elixir Aircraft, two thirds of their bookers are flight training organizations (private flight schools or aeroclubs), the rest being private pilots mainly based in Europe, but also in the United States.\n\n== Variants ==\nElixir Aircraft has already announced several variants :\n\n* [[Night VFR|NVFR]]<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Instrument flight rules|IFR]]<ref name=\":1\" />\n* A more powerful version, equipped with the [[Rotax 915 iS|Rotax 915iS]], mainly suited for travel.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* A version equipped with a towing hook, allowing [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]] towing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Specifications==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=<ref name=\"private\" /> Elixir Aircraft\n|prime units?=met\n\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|genhide=\n\n|crew=one\n|capacity=One passenger\n|length m=\n|length note=\n|span m=\n|span note=\n|height m=\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=600\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=29\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=[[Rotax 912]]iS\n|eng1 type=flat four air and water cooled piston\n|eng1 kw=73.5\n|eng1 note=\n|power original=\n|more power=\n\n|prop blade number=3\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia ft=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia in=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop note=\n\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|perfhide=\n\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|max speed mach=<!-- supersonic aircraft -->\n|cruise speed kts=170\n|cruise speed note=with Rotax 915iS\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed kmh=\n|minimum control speed mph=\n|minimum control speed kts=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range km=\n|range note=\n|combat range km=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range nmi=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate note=at sea level\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=\n\n|avionics=\n*Garmin G3X\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2010s French civil utility aircraft]]\n[[Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft]]\n[[Category:Low-wing aircraft]]\n[[Category:Aircraft first flown in 2017]]\n", "name_user": "Jan olieslagers", "label": "safe", "comment": "Link to company website", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_Aircraft_Elixir"}

[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]] lived at this second ch\u00e2teau, and the first manned flight, in a [[hot air balloon]], set off from the ch\u00e2teau in 1783.\n\nThe old ch\u00e2teau was demolished in the 1920s to make room for substantial houses, including a new ch\u00e2teau built by [[Henri James de Rothschild]], which is now part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's]] headquarters.\n\n==Name==\nThe meaning of ''muette'' is not certain. In modern French, it denotes a [[Mute (disorder)|mute]] woman. However, the name of the ch\u00e2teau may be derived from several words in the [[French language]]:\n*{{lang|fr|muete}}, a spelling which appears frequently up to the end of the 18th century and signifies a pack of [[deerhound]]s;\n*{{lang|fr|mues}}, the [[antler]] shed by [[stag]]s in the autumn; or\n*{{lang|fr|mue}}, the moulting-period of hunting [[hawk]]s.\nIt is clear that the name was connected with the hunting-lodge in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], which mediaeval French kings used when they hunted deer in the forest.\n\n==History==\n\n===First ch\u00e2teau===\nAt the end of the 16th century, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] had a royal hunting lodge on the site  transformed into a small ch\u00e2teau for [[Marguerite de Valois]] (popularly known as ''Reine Margot''), the first wife of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]. Although their marriage was always rocky and eventually annulled, they became friends late in life and she was able to return to Paris and set up house in the ch\u00e2teau. Marguerite bequeathed her ch\u00e2teau to the ''little Dauphin'', later [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], in 1606.\n\nFrom 1606 to 1792, the property remained part of the royal estates. In 1716, the ch\u00e2teau became the home of the Duchesse de Berry, [[Marie Louise Elisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans]], daughter of the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans]], Regent of France. [[Antoine Watteau]] decorated the rooms with [[chinoiserie]].  Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] of [[Russia]] visited her here. The visit was talked about because of the scandal of her pregnancy, which was a scandal at the time because she was unmarried. When welcoming the Russian emperor, the Duchess appeared \"stout as a tower\" (\u201cpuisssante comme une tour\u201d).<ref>E. de Barthelemy (ed.), Gazette de la Regence. Janvier 1715-1719, Paris, 1887, p.180</ref> The royal princess had been nicknamed \u201cJoufflotte\u201d (\u201cchubby\u201d) because of her generous proportions. By the spring of 1717, her increasing corpulence had begun to cause her serious inconvenience so that she had given up hunting and sold her saddle-horses. But the prodigious quantities of food she devoured, washed away with wine and strong liquors, was not the main cause for her weight. Early July, Madame de Berry, who by then kept fully secluded in her castle at La Muette, was being \u201cinconvenienced\u201d, \u201chaving grown so big\u201d that it was feared for her life !

The king used the ch\u00e2teau to entertain his mistresses, including the three de Nesle sisters, [[Madame de Pompadour]] and [[Madame du Barry]].\n\nLouis XV had the ch\u00e2teau entirely rebuilt by the architects [[Jacques V Gabriel]] and [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] between 1741 and 1745. The new, much larger, building was flanked by two large wings with many smaller outlying buildings. The Dauphin, later [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], took possession of La Muette in 1764, and his future wife, [[Marie-Antoinette]], lodged there on her arrival in France.\n\n[[File:Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois, Arion on the Dolphin, 1748.jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''[[Arion]] on the Dolphin'', 1748, [[Princeton University Art Museum]], intended as an [[overdoor]] in the chateau<ref>{{cite web|title=Arion on the Dolphin (y1980-2)|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/32343|website=Princeton University Art Museum|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>]]\n\n===Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette===\n[[File:Josef Hauzinger 002.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria]] visits Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI on 7 February 1775 at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette (painting by the Austrian portraitist Josef Hauzinger)]]\n\nLouis XVI is said to have spent the happiest days of his life at the ch\u00e2teau with his young bride, although they had no knowledge of sexual matters and thus did not have children for seven years. During this period Louis abolished certain royal taxes, and he opened the gates of the [[Bois de Boulogne]] to the populace.  The Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], Marie-Antoinette's brother (travelling incognito under the name of \"Count Falkenstein\") visited the couple here in April 1777.\n\nLouis granted a small area of sandy ground of the ch\u00e2teau's estate at ''les Sablons'' (near [[Les Sablons (Paris M\u00e9tro)|les Sablons metro station]]) to [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]] (1737\u20131813) to demonstrate the growing of [[potato]]es, which had not previously been considered in Europe, other than in [[Ireland]], as safe for human consumption. Indeed, they were considered to be a source of [[leprosy]] among other things. Parmentier carried out a series of publicity stunts, which led to the acceptance of potatoes in France and then throughout Europe.\n\nThe ch\u00e2teau, together with the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid]] and other properties, were put on sale in February 1788, with a view to demolition. The castle fell into disrepair, and the main building was demolished in 1793.\n\n===Montgolfier brothers===\n[[Image:Montgolfier Balloon.JPG|thumb|right|A model of the [[Montgolfier brothers]] balloon at the [[London Science Museum]].]]\nThe first manned flight commenced from the ch\u00e2teau on 21 November 1783, with a [[hot air balloon]] manufactured by the [[Montgolfier brothers]] lifting off from the garden of La Muette carrying [[Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier]] and the [[Marquis d'Arlandes]]. Among the crowd who observed this feat were the royal family and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. They flew for 25&nbsp;minutes, travelling almost 300&nbsp;metres above Paris and covering a distance of about nine kilometres, before landing between the [[windmill]]s on the [[Butte-aux-Cailles]]. Enough fuel remained on board at the end of the flight to have allowed the balloon to fly four to five times as far. However, burning embers from the fire were scorching the balloon fabric and had to be extinguished with sponges, and so the pilots decided to land as soon as they were over open countryside.\n\n===Post revolutionary history===\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette became state property. The property was split up into several lots and sold at auction. The ch\u00e2teau returned to the royal family in 1816. One wing was given to the Minister for Finance, [[Louis Emmanuel Corvetto]]. The other wing, and most of the grounds, were purchased in 1820 by [[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard]], who manufactured [[piano]]s used by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt]]. In 1821, S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard invented the double escapement action, which permitted a note to be repeated even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position, a great benefit for rapid playing.\n\nIn 1912, the ch\u00e2teau's then owner, the Franqueville family, sold much of the remaining property, and the former estate developed into a fashionable residential area.\n\n===Third ch\u00e2teau===\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette, Paris 2012.jpg|thumb|Rothschild's ch\u00e2teau in 2012]]\nTwo large lots were sold to Baron [[Henri James de Rothschild]], who built a new ch\u00e2teau in 1921 and 1922 as his Paris residence to a 19th-century design by [[Lucien Hesse]]. By the beginning of [[World War II]], the old ch\u00e2teau had been completely demolished and replaced by mansions.\n\nThe new ch\u00e2teau was appropriated by Nazi Germany's ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during the Second World War. During the [[Liberation of Paris]] in August 1944 the ch\u00e2teau was captured after a brief gunfight by the British '[[No. 30 Commando|30 Assault Unit]]' keen on gathering vital intelligence. In late 1945 [[United States Army]] took over the buildings to organise operations in the aftermath of the war. In 1949, it became the headquarters of the [[Organization for European Economic Co-operation]] (OEEC) set up under the [[Marshall Plan]] to help administer funds provided by the United States to promote post-war recovery and to encourage European economic cooperation.  The OEEC developed into the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in 1961, with the new Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette as its headquarters.\n\nThe \"Rue Andr\u00e9 Pascal\" street on which the [[cour d'honneur]] of the ch\u00e2teau opens is named after one of the [[pseudonyms]] under which Henri de Rothschild published his literary works.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France}}\n* [[List of firsts in aviation]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web | url=https://www.oecd.org/document/63/0,2340,en_2649_201185_1956607_1_1_1_1,00.html |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]| title=History of the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette|first=Michael|last= Oborne | accessdate=29 September 2009}}\n<references />\n\n== External links==\n{{Commons category|Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette (Paris)}}\n*[https://www.oecd.org/ Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]\n\n{{coord|48|51|41|N|2|16|10|E|display=title|region:FR_type:landmark_source:frwiki}}\n\n{{Royal Residences in France}}{{Rothschild topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muette, Chateau}}\n[[Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Paris]]\n[[Category:Ancien R\u00e9gime French architecture]]\n[[Category:Palaces in France]]\n[[Category:Royal residences in France]]\n[[Category:Montgolfier brothers]]\n[[Category:OECD]]\n[[Category:Rothschild family residences]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the 16th arrondissement of Paris]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Paris chateau muette.jpg|thumb|300px|Rothschild's Ch\u00e2teau, at Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette, Paris in 2013]]\nThe '''Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette''' ({{IPA-fr|\u0283ato d\u0259 la m\u0265\u025bt}}) is a [[ch\u00e2teau]] located on the edge of the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in [[Paris]], France, near the [[City gates of Paris|Porte de la Muette]].\n\nThree ch\u00e2teaux have been located on the site since a hunting lodge was transformed into the first ch\u00e2teau for Princess [[Marguerite de Valois]], favorite daughter of [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]], sister of Kings [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] and [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and the first wife of [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]], in the 16th century.

[[Sulaymaniyah Museum|Slemani Museum]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].]]\nThe complex [[grammatical conjugation]] and [[declension]] of Old Persian yielded to the structure of Middle Persian in which the dual number disappeared, leaving only singular and plural, as did gender. Middle Persian developed the [[ez\u0101fe]] construction, expressed through ''\u012b'' (modern ''ye''), to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system.\n\nAlthough the \"middle period\" of the Iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the transition from Old to Middle Persian had probably already begun before the 4th century BC. However, Middle Persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the Sassanid era (224\u2013651) inscriptions, so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty. Moreover, as a literary language, Middle Persian is not attested until much later, in the 6th or 7th century. From the 8th century onward, Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian, with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\nMiddle Persian is considered to be a later form of the same dialect as Old Persian.<ref>Nicholas Sims-Williams, \"The Iranian Languages\", in Steever, Sanford (ed.) (1993), ''The Indo-European Languages'', p. 129.</ref> The native name of Middle Persian was ''Parsig'' or ''Parsik'', after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest, that is, \"of ''Pars''\", Old Persian ''Parsa'', New Persian ''[[Fars Province|Fars]]''. This is the origin of the name ''Farsi'' as it is today used to signify New Persian. Following the collapse of the Sassanid state, ''Parsik'' came to be applied exclusively to (either Middle or New) Persian that was written in the [[Arabic script]]. From about the 9th century onward, as Middle Persian was on the threshold of becoming New Persian, the older form of the language came to be erroneously called ''[[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]'', which was actually but one of the ''writing systems'' used to render both Middle Persian as well as various other Middle Iranian languages. That writing system had previously been adopted by the Sassanids (who were Persians, i.e. from the southwest) from the preceding Arsacids (who were Parthians, i.e. from the northeast). While [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] (eighth century) still distinguished between ''Pahlavi'' (i.e. Parthian) and ''Persian'' (in Arabic text: al-Farisiyah) (i.e. Middle Persian), this distinction is not evident in Arab commentaries written after that date.\n\nGernot Windfuhr considers new Persian as an evolution of the Old Persian language and the Middle Persian language<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|title=The Major Languages of South Asia, the Middle East and Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXJ1RbE8-8C|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-93257-3}}, p. 82. \"The evolution of Persian as the culturally dominant language of major parts of the Near East, from Anatolia and Iran, to Central Asia, to northwest India until recent centuries, began with the political domination of these areas by dynasties originating in southwestern province of Iran, Pars, later Arabicised to Fars: first the Achaemenids (599\u2013331 BC) whose official language was Old Persian; then the Sassanids (c. AD 225\u2013651) whose official language was Middle Persian. Hence, the entire country used to be called Perse by the ancient Greeks, a practice continued to this day. The more general designation 'Iran(-shahr)\" derives from Old Iranian aryanam (Khshathra)' (the realm) of Aryans'. The dominance of these two dynasties resulted in Old and Middle-Persian colonies throughout the empire, most importantly for the course of the development of Persian, in the north-east i.e., what is now Khorasan, northern Afghanistan and Central Asia, as documented by the Middle Persian texts of the Manichean found in the oasis city of Turfan in Chinese Turkistan ([[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]]).

In fact, a writer of Classical Persian had at one's disposal the entire Arabic lexicon and could use Arab terms freely either for literary effect or to display erudition. Classical Persian remained essentially unchanged until the nineteenth century, when the dialect of Teheran rose in prominence, having been chosen as the capital of Persia by the Qajar Dynasty in 1787.

The [[Bengal Sultanate]] witnessed an influx of Persian scholars, lawyers, teachers and clerics. Thousands of Persian books and manuscripts were published in Bengal. The period of the reign of Sultan [[Ghiyathuddin Azam Shah]], is described as the \"golden age of Persian literature in Bengal\".

In addition, under the Qajar rule numerous [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]] terms entered the Persian language, especially vocabulary related to technology. \n\nThe first official attentions to the necessity of protecting the Persian language against foreign words, and to the standardization of [[Persian alphabet|Persian orthography]], were under the reign of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser ed Din Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]] in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} After Naser ed Din Shah, [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar ed Din Shah]] ordered the establishment of the first Persian association in 1903.<ref name=\"Farhangestan\"/> This association officially declared that it used Persian and [[Arabic]] as acceptable sources for coining words. The ultimate goal was to prevent books from being printed with wrong use of words. According to the executive guarantee of this association, the government was responsible for wrongfully printed books. Words coined by this association, such as ''r\u0101h-\u0101han'' ({{lang|fa|\u0631\u0627\u0647\u200c\u0622\u0647\u0646}}) for \"railway\", were printed in ''Soltani Newspaper''; but the association was eventually closed due to inattention.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nA scientific association was founded in 1911, resulting in a dictionary called ''Words of Scientific Association'' ({{lang|fa|\u0644\u063a\u062a \u0627\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u06cc}}), which was completed in the future and renamed ''Katouzian Dictionary'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0627\u0646}}).<ref>{{cite book|title=\u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647\u200c\u0631\u06cc\u0632\u06cc \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc|publisher=\u0631\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0641\u062a\u062d|isbn=978-600-6128-05-4|author=\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u062f\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u06cc|page=33|year=1389}}</ref>\n\n===== Pahlavi dynasty =====\n\nThe first academy for the Persian language was founded in 20 May 1935, under the name ''Academy of Iran''. It was established by the initiative of [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], and mainly by [[Hekmat E Shirazi|Hekmat e Shirazi]] and [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], all prominent names in the nationalist movement of the time. \nThe academy was a key institution in the struggle to re-build Iran as a nation-state after the collapse of the Qajar dynasty. During the 1930s and 1940s, the academy led massive campaigns to replace the many [[Arabic]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] loanwords whose widespread use in Persian during the centuries preceding the foundation of the Pahlavi dynasty had created a literary language considerably different from the spoken Persian of the time. This became the basis of what is now known as \"Contemporary Standard Persian\".\n\n== Varieties ==\nThere are three standard varieties of modern Persian:\n*''[[Western Persian|Iranian Persian]]'' (''Persian'', ''Western Persian'', or ''Farsi'') is spoken in [[Iran]], and by minorities in [[Iraq]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] states.\n*''[[Dari language|Eastern Persian]]'' (''Dari Persian'', ''Afghan Persian'', or ''Dari'') is spoken in [[Afghanistan]].\n*''[[Tajik language|Tajiki]]'' (''Tajik Persian'') is spoken in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It is written in the [[Cyrillic script]].\n\nAll these three varieties are based on the classic Persian literature and its literary tradition. There are also several local dialects from Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard Persian. The [[Hazaragi dialect]] (in Central Afghanistan and Pakistan), [[Herat]]i (in Western Afghanistan), Darwazi (in Afghanistan and Tajikistan), and the [[Tehrani accent]] (in Iran, the basis of standard Iranian Persian) are examples of these dialects. Persian-speaking peoples of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2005_817_17g_Beeman.pdf |title=Persian, Dari and Tajik |first=William |last=Beeman |work=[[Brown University]] |accessdate=30 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025210857/http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2005_817_17g_Beeman.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe following are some languages closely related to Persian, or in some cases are considered dialects:\n*[[Luri language|Luri]] (or ''Lori''), spoken mainly in the southwestern Iranian provinces of [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]], [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province]], some western parts of [[Fars Province]] and some parts of [[Khuzestan Province]].\n*[[Lari language|Lari]] (in southern Iran)\n*[[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]], spoken in parts of Azerbaijan, Russia, and Transcaucasia.

Early New Persian had a series of five long vowels ({{IPAslink|i\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|u\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|\u0252\u02d0}}, {{IPAslink|o\u02d0}} and {{IPAslink|e\u02d0}}) along with three short vowels {{IPAslink|\u00e6}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}. At some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern Iran, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Thus, older contrasts such as {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u0113r'' \"lion\" vs. {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u012br'' \"milk\", and {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u062f}} ''z\u016bd'' \"quick\" vs {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u0631}} ''z\u014dr'' \"strong\" were lost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and in some words, ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d'' are merged into the diphthongs {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[o\u028a]}} (which are descendants of the diphthongs {{IPA|[\u00e6\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6\u028a]}} in Early New Persian), instead of merging into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Examples of the exception can be found in words such as {{lang|fa|\u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646}} {{IPA|[ro\u028a\u0283\u00e6n]}} (bright). Numerous other instances exist.\n\nHowever, in Dari, the archaic distinction of {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} (respectively known as {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''Y\u0101-ye majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''Y\u0101-ye ma'r\u016bf'') is still preserved as well as the distinction of {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (known as {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''W\u0101w-e majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''W\u0101w-e ma'r\u016bf''). On the other hand, in standard Tajik, the length distinction has disappeared, and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged with {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} with {{IPA|/u/}}.<ref>Perry, J. R. (2005) ''A Tajik Persian Reference Grammar'' (Boston : Brill) {{ISBN|90-04-14323-8}}</ref> Therefore, contemporary Afghan Dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of Early New Persian.\n\nAccording to most studies on the subject (e.g. Samareh 1977, Pisowicz 1985, Najafi 2001), the three vowels traditionally considered long ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u0252/}}) are currently distinguished from their short counterparts ({{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}) by position of articulation rather than by length. However, there are studies (e.g. Hayes 1979, Windfuhr 1979) that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system, with {{IPA|/\u0252/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} phonologically long or bimoraic and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} phonologically short or monomoraic.\n\nThere are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the Iranian system (such as Toosarvandani 2004). That offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity, which often suggests that Modern Persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of Classical Persian and a hypothetical future Iranian language, which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature.\n\nThe length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties (including Tajik).\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

The Turkish and Mongolian vocabulary in Persian is minor in comparison to that of Arabic and these words were mainly confined to military, pastoral terms and political sector (titles, administration, etc.).<ref>Xavier Planhol, \"Land of Iran\", ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. \"The Turks, on the other hand, posed a formidable threat: their penetration into Iranian lands was considerable, to such an extent that vast regions adapted their language. This process was all the more remarkable since, in spite of their almost uninterrupted political domination for nearly 1,500 years, the cultural influence of these rough nomads on Iran's refined civilization remained extremely tenuous. This is demonstrated by the mediocre linguistic contribution, for which exhaustive statistical studies have been made (Doerfer). The number of Turkish or Mongol words that entered Persian, though not negligible, remained limited to 2,135, i.e., 3 percent of the vocabulary at the most. These new words are confined on the one hand to the military and political sector (titles, administration, etc.) and, on the other hand, to technical pastoral terms. The contrast with Arab influence is striking. While cultural pressure of the Arabs on Iran had been intense, they in no way infringed upon the entire Iranian territory, whereas with the Turks, whose contributions to Iranian civilization were modest, vast regions of Iranian lands were assimilated, notwithstanding the fact that resistance by the latter was ultimately victorious. Several reasons may be offered.\"</ref> New military and political titles were coined based partially on Middle Persian (e.g. {{lang|fa|\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0634}} ''arte\u0161'' for \"army\", instead of the Uzbek {{lang|fa|\u0642\u0624\u0634\u06cc\u0646}} ''qo\u02bbshin''; {{lang|fa|\u0633\u0631\u0644\u0634\u06a9\u0631}} ''sarla\u0161kar''; {{lang|fa|\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646}} ''dary\u0101b\u0101n''; etc.) in the 20th century.\nPersian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially other [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iv|title=ARMENIA AND IRAN iv.

In some instances in addition to the Persian vocabulary, the equivalent synonyms from multiple foreign languages can be used. For example, in Iranian colloquial Persian (not in Afghanistan or Tajikistan), the phrase \"thank you\" may be expressed using the French word {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0631\u0633\u06cc}} ''merci'' (stressed, however, on the first syllable), the hybrid Persian-Arabic phrase {{lang|fa|\u0645\u062a\u0634\u06a9\u0651\u0631 \u0627\u0645}} ''mote\u0161akker am'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u062a\u0634\u06a9\u0651\u0631}} ''mote\u0161akker'' being \"thankful\" in Arabic, commonly pronounced ''mot\u010dakker'' in Persian, and the verb {{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645}} ''am'' meaning \"I am\" in Persian), or by the pure Persian phrase {{lang|fa|\u0633\u067e\u0627\u0633\u200c\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0645}} ''sep\u0101s-goz\u0101r am''.\n\n== Orthography ==\n[[File:Nastaliq-proportions.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Example showing Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq's (Persian) proportion rules.{{ref label | Smith1989 | 1 | a}}]]\n[[File:Dehkhoda note.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]]'s personal handwriting, a typical [[cursive]] Persian script.]]\n[[File:The word Persian in Pahlavi script.png|thumb|right|upright=1.3|The word Persian in the [[Book Pahlavi]] script]]\n\nThe vast majority of modern Iranian Persian and Dari text is written with the [[Arabic script]].

There also exist several [[Romanization of Persian|romanization systems for Persian]].\n\n=== Persian alphabet ===\n{{Main|Persian alphabet}}\n\nModern Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian are written using the [[Persian alphabet]] which is a modified variant of the [[Arabic alphabet]], which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in Arabic language. After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest of Persia]], it took approximately 200 years which is referred to as [[Two Centuries of Silence]] in Iran, before Persians adopted the Arabic script in place of the older alphabet. Previously, two different scripts were used, [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]], used for Middle Persian, and the [[Avestan alphabet]] (in Persian, D\u012bndapirak or Din Dabire\u2014literally: religion script), used for religious purposes, primarily for the [[Avestan]] but sometimes for Middle Persian.\n\nIn the modern Persian script, [[Vowel length|historically short vowels]] are usually not written, only the historically long ones are represented in the text, so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing: Iranian Persian ''{{transl|fa|kerm}}'' \"worm\", ''{{transl|fa|karam}}'' \"generosity\", ''{{transl|fa|kerem}}'' \"cream\", and ''{{transl|fa|krom}}'' \"chrome\" are all spelled ''{{transl|fa|krm}}'' ({{lang|fa|\u06a9\u0631\u0645}}) in Persian. The reader must determine the word from context. The Arabic system of vocalization marks known as ''[[harakat]]'' is also used in Persian, although some of the symbols have different pronunciations. For example, a ''[[\u1e0dammah]]'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u028a~u]}}, while in Iranian Persian it is pronounced {{IPA|[o]}}. This system is not used in mainstream Persian literature; it is primarily used for teaching and in some (but not all) dictionaries.\n[[File:Persian typewriter keyboard layout.svg|thumb|Persian typewriter keyboard layout]]\nThere are several letters generally only used in Arabic loanwords. These letters are pronounced the same as similar Persian letters. For example, there are four functionally identical letters for {{IPAslink|z}} ({{lang|fa|\u0632 \u0630 \u0636 \u0638}}), three letters for {{IPAslink|s}} ({{lang|fa|\u0633 \u0635 \u062b}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|t}} ({{lang|fa|\u0637 \u062a}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|h}} ({{lang|fa|\u062d \u0647}}).\nOn the other hand, there are four letters that don't exist in Arabic {{lang|fa| \u067e \u0686 \u0698 \u06af}}.\n\n==== Additions ====\nThe [[Persian alphabet]] adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

This letter is no longer used, as the /\u03b2/-sound changed to /b/, e.g. archaic \u0632\u06a4\u0627\u0646 /za\u03b2\u0101n/ > \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 /z\u00e6b\u0252n/ 'language'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/persian-language-1-early-new-persian|title=PERSIAN LANGUAGE i.

For example, ''alef with hamza below'' ( {{lang|ar|\u0625}} ) changes to ''[[aleph|alef]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u0627}} ); words using various [[hamza]]s get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644}} becomes {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0626\u0648\u0644}}) even though the latter is also correct in Arabic; and ''[[teh marbuta]]'' ( {{lang|ar|\u0629}} ) changes to ''[[he (letter)|heh]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u0647}} ) or ''[[taw (letter)|teh]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u062a}} ).\n\nThe letters different in shape are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

The alphabet was phased out in favor of [[Tajik Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"perry2005\" />\n\n[[Fingilish]] is Persian using [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. It is most commonly used in [[online chat|chat]], [[email]]s and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] applications. The orthography is not standardized, and varies among writers and even media (for example, typing 'aa' for the {{IPA|[\u0252]}} phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards, resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphones).\n\n=== Tajik alphabet ===\n[[File:Akademijai ilmxhoi jumxhurii tojikiston.jpg|thumb|right|Tajiki advertisement for an academy]]\n{{Main|Tajik alphabet}}\n\nThe Cyrillic script was introduced for writing the [[Tajik language]] under the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the late 1930s, replacing the [[Tajik alphabet#Transliteration standards|Latin alphabet]] that had been used since the [[October Revolution]] and the Persian script that had been used earlier.

[[Sulaymaniyah Museum|Slemani Museum]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].]]\nThe complex [[grammatical conjugation]] and [[declension]] of Old Persian yielded to the structure of Middle Persian in which the dual number disappeared, leaving only singular and plural, as did gender. Middle Persian developed the [[ez\u0101fe]] construction, expressed through ''\u012b'' (modern ''ye''), to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system.\n\nAlthough the \"middle period\" of the Iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the transition from Old to Middle Persian had probably already begun before the 4th century BC. However, Middle Persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the Sassanid era (224\u2013651) inscriptions, so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty. Moreover, as a literary language, Middle Persian is not attested until much later, in the 6th or 7th century. From the 8th century onward, Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian, with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\nMiddle Persian is considered to be a later form of the same dialect as Old Persian.<ref>Nicholas Sims-Williams, \"The Iranian Languages\", in Steever, Sanford (ed.) (1993), ''The Indo-European Languages'', p. 129.</ref> The native name of Middle Persian was ''Parsig'' or ''Parsik'', after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest, that is, \"of ''Pars''\", Old Persian ''Parsa'', New Persian ''[[Fars Province|Fars]]''. This is the origin of the name ''Farsi'' as it is today used to signify New Persian. Following the collapse of the Sassanid state, ''Parsik'' came to be applied exclusively to (either Middle or New) Persian that was written in the [[Arabic script]]. From about the 9th century onward, as Middle Persian was on the threshold of becoming New Persian, the older form of the language came to be erroneously called ''[[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]'', which was actually but one of the ''writing systems'' used to render both Middle Persian as well as various other Middle Iranian languages. That writing system had previously been adopted by the Sassanids (who were Persians, i.e. from the southwest) from the preceding Arsacids (who were Parthians, i.e. from the northeast). While [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] (eighth century) still distinguished between ''Pahlavi'' (i.e. Parthian) and ''Persian'' (in Arabic text: al-Farisiyah) (i.e. Middle Persian), this distinction is not evident in Arab commentaries written after that date.\n\nGernot Windfuhr considers new Persian as an evolution of the Old Persian language and the Middle Persian language<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|title=The Major Languages of South Asia, the Middle East and Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXJ1RbE8-8C|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-93257-3}}, p. 82. \"The evolution of Persian as the culturally dominant language of major parts of the Near East, from Anatolia and Iran, to Central Asia, to northwest India until recent centuries, began with the political domination of these areas by dynasties originating in southwestern province of Iran, Pars, later Arabicised to Fars: first the Achaemenids (599\u2013331 BC) whose official language was Old Persian; then the Sassanids (c. AD 225\u2013651) whose official language was Middle Persian. Hence, the entire country used to be called Perse by the ancient Greeks, a practice continued to this day. The more general designation 'Iran(-shahr)\" derives from Old Iranian aryanam (Khshathra)' (the realm) of Aryans'. The dominance of these two dynasties resulted in Old and Middle-Persian colonies throughout the empire, most importantly for the course of the development of Persian, in the north-east i.e., what is now Khorasan, northern Afghanistan and Central Asia, as documented by the Middle Persian texts of the Manichean found in the oasis city of Turfan in Chinese Turkistan ([[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]]).

During this period, Persian was adopted as the lingua franca of the eastern Islamic nations. Extensive contact with Arabic led to a large influx of Arab vocabulary. In fact, a writer of Classical Persian had at one's disposal the entire Arabic lexicon and could use Arab terms freely either for literary effect or to display erudition. Classical Persian remained essentially unchanged until the nineteenth century, when the dialect of Teheran rose in prominence, having been chosen as the capital of Persia by the Qajar Dynasty in 1787. This Modern Persian dialect became the basis of what is now called Contemporary Standard Persian.

At some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern Iran, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} merged into {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Thus, older contrasts such as {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u0113r'' \"lion\" vs. {{lang|fa|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}} ''sh\u012br'' \"milk\", and {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u062f}} ''z\u016bd'' \"quick\" vs {{lang|fa|\u0632\u0648\u0631}} ''z\u014dr'' \"strong\" were lost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and in some words, ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d'' are merged into the diphthongs {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[o\u028a]}} (which are descendants of the diphthongs {{IPA|[\u00e6\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6\u028a]}} in Early New Persian), instead of merging into {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Examples of the exception can be found in words such as {{lang|fa|\u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646}} {{IPA|[ro\u028a\u0283\u00e6n]}} (bright). Numerous other instances exist.\n\nHowever, in Dari, the archaic distinction of {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} (respectively known as {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''Y\u0101-ye majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''Y\u0101-ye ma'r\u016bf'') is still preserved as well as the distinction of {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (known as {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644}} ''W\u0101w-e majh\u016bl'' and {{lang|fa|\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641}} ''W\u0101w-e ma'r\u016bf''). On the other hand, in standard Tajik, the length distinction has disappeared, and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} merged with {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} with {{IPA|/u/}}.<ref>Perry, J. R. (2005) ''A Tajik Persian Reference Grammar'' (Boston : Brill) {{ISBN|90-04-14323-8}}</ref> Therefore, contemporary Afghan Dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of Early New Persian.\n\nAccording to most studies on the subject (e.g. Samareh 1977, Pisowicz 1985, Najafi 2001), the three vowels traditionally considered long ({{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u0252/}}) are currently distinguished from their short counterparts ({{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}) by position of articulation rather than by length. However, there are studies (e.g. Hayes 1979, Windfuhr 1979) that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system, with {{IPA|/\u0252/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} phonologically long or bimoraic and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} phonologically short or monomoraic.\n\nThere are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the Iranian system (such as Toosarvandani 2004). That offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity, which often suggests that Modern Persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of Classical Persian and a hypothetical future Iranian language, which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature.\n\nThe length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties (including Tajik).\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

The Turkish and Mongolian vocabulary in Persian is minor in comparison to that of Arabic and these words were mainly confined to military, pastoral terms and political sector (titles, administration, etc.).<ref>Xavier Planhol, \"Land of Iran\", ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. \"The Turks, on the other hand, posed a formidable threat: their penetration into Iranian lands was considerable, to such an extent that vast regions adapted their language. This process was all the more remarkable since, in spite of their almost uninterrupted political domination for nearly 1,500 years, the cultural influence of these rough nomads on Iran's refined civilization remained extremely tenuous. This is demonstrated by the mediocre linguistic contribution, for which exhaustive statistical studies have been made (Doerfer). The number of Turkish or Mongol words that entered Persian, though not negligible, remained limited to 2,135, i.e., 3 percent of the vocabulary at the most. These new words are confined on the one hand to the military and political sector (titles, administration, etc.) and, on the other hand, to technical pastoral terms. The contrast with Arab influence is striking. While cultural pressure of the Arabs on Iran had been intense, they in no way infringed upon the entire Iranian territory, whereas with the Turks, whose contributions to Iranian civilization were modest, vast regions of Iranian lands were assimilated, notwithstanding the fact that resistance by the latter was ultimately victorious. Several reasons may be offered.\"</ref> New military and political titles were coined based partially on Middle Persian (e.g. {{lang|fa|\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0634}} ''arte\u0161'' for \"army\", instead of the Uzbek {{lang|fa|\u0642\u0624\u0634\u06cc\u0646}} ''qo\u02bbshin''; {{lang|fa|\u0633\u0631\u0644\u0634\u06a9\u0631}} ''sarla\u0161kar''; {{lang|fa|\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646}} ''dary\u0101b\u0101n''; etc.) in the 20th century.\nPersian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially other [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iv|title=ARMENIA AND IRAN iv.

There also exist several [[Romanization of Persian|romanization systems for Persian]].\n\n=== Persian alphabet ===\n{{Main|Persian alphabet}}\n\nModern Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian are written using the [[Persian alphabet]] which is a modified variant of the [[Arabic alphabet]], which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in Arabic language. After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest of Persia]], it took approximately 200 years which is referred to as [[Two Centuries of Silence]] in Iran, before Persians adopted the Arabic script in place of the older alphabet. Previously, two different scripts were used, [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]], used for Middle Persian, and the [[Avestan alphabet]] (in Persian, D\u012bndapirak or Din Dabire\u2014literally: religion script), used for religious purposes, primarily for the [[Avestan]] but sometimes for Middle Persian.\n\nIn the modern Persian script, [[Vowel length|historically short vowels]] are usually not written, only the historically long ones are represented in the text, so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing: Iranian Persian ''{{transl|fa|kerm}}'' \"worm\", ''{{transl|fa|karam}}'' \"generosity\", ''{{transl|fa|kerem}}'' \"cream\", and ''{{transl|fa|krom}}'' \"chrome\" are all spelled ''{{transl|fa|krm}}'' ({{lang|fa|\u06a9\u0631\u0645}}) in Persian. The reader must determine the word from context. The Arabic system of vocalization marks known as ''[[harakat]]'' is also used in Persian, although some of the symbols have different pronunciations. For example, a ''[[\u1e0dammah]]'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u028a~u]}}, while in Iranian Persian it is pronounced {{IPA|[o]}}. This system is not used in mainstream Persian literature; it is primarily used for teaching and in some (but not all) dictionaries.\n[[File:Persian typewriter keyboard layout.svg|thumb|Persian typewriter keyboard layout]]\nThere are several letters generally only used in Arabic loanwords. These letters are pronounced the same as similar Persian letters. For example, there are four functionally identical letters for {{IPAslink|z}} ({{lang|fa|\u0632 \u0630 \u0636 \u0638}}), three letters for {{IPAslink|s}} ({{lang|fa|\u0633 \u0635 \u062b}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|t}} ({{lang|fa|\u0637 \u062a}}), two letters for {{IPAslink|h}} ({{lang|fa|\u062d \u0647}}).\nOn the other hand, there are four letters that don't exist in Arabic {{lang|fa| \u067e \u0686 \u0698 \u06af}}.\n\n==== Additions ====\nThe [[Persian alphabet]] adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

For example, ''alef with hamza below'' ( {{lang|ar|\u0625}} ) changes to ''[[aleph|alef]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u0627}} ); words using various [[hamza]]s get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644}} becomes {{lang|fa|\u0645\u0633\u0626\u0648\u0644}}) even though the latter is also correct in Arabic; and ''[[teh marbuta]]'' ( {{lang|ar|\u0629}} ) changes to ''[[he (letter)|heh]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u0647}} ) or ''[[taw (letter)|teh]]'' ( {{lang|fa|\u062a}} ).\n\nThe letters different in shape are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center;\"\n!

The orthography is not standardized, and varies among writers and even media (for example, typing 'aa' for the {{IPA|[\u0252]}} phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards, resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphones).\n\n=== Tajik alphabet ===\n[[File:Akademijai ilmxhoi jumxhurii tojikiston.jpg|thumb|right|Tajiki advertisement for an academy]]\n{{Main|Tajik alphabet}}\n\nThe Cyrillic script was introduced for writing the [[Tajik language]] under the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the late 1930s, replacing the [[Tajik alphabet#Transliteration standards|Latin alphabet]] that had been used since the [[October Revolution]] and the Persian script that had been used earlier.

In school she was teased because she was small, chubby, and suffered from [[strabismus]].\n\n== Copenhagen and marriage to Sophus Micha\u00eblis ==\n\nIn her youth Micha\u00eblis was a private teacher for a few years, partly in [[L\u00e6s\u00f8]] and partly in a manor house north of Randers. In 1892 she moved to Copenhagen, to become trained as a piano teacher, where she became acquainted with the writer [[Sophus Micha\u00eblis]] (1865\u20131932), whom she married in 1895. The couple earned their living predominantly through theater reviews. In 1911 the marriage was terminated.\n\n== Second marriage and writing career ==\n\nThe following year, Micha\u00eblis married the Norwegian-American diplomat [[Charles Emil Stangeland]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. She had met Stangeland the previous year while returning from the U.S. to Denmark aboard a ship. He was a political economist, educated at Columbia University, and at the time of his marriage to Micha\u00eblis was posted to Bolivia as secretary to the American Legation.<ref>{{cite news | title= Karin Michaelis, Author, Marries | work= New York Times | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/02/25/100353187.pdf | accessdate= 2011-04-27 | date=25 February 1912}}</ref> Stangeland was unhappy with the literary and political activities of his wife, who just at this time experienced a breakthrough as an author with ''Den farlige Alder (The Dangerous Age).'' They were separated in 1917 and divorced in 1930. There were no children from either marriage.<ref name=kvinfo.dk/>\n\n== Political and social activity ==\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Micha\u00eblis was active in humanitarian work in\nAustria.  Her great friendship with [[Eugenie Schwarzwald]] stood not only for her connection with [[Vienna]] but also for her social engagement in this country.\n\nEarly on, Karin Micha\u00eblis warned of the danger arising from [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. In 1932 she took part in an anti-war congress in [[Amsterdam]] where she advocated [[conscientious objection]] and [[peace education]] for children.<ref name=Dies>{{cite web |first=Harry F. |last=Ward |title=Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Hearings before a Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, 75th Congress, 3rd session-78th Congress, 2nd session, on HR 282 |publisher=US GPO |url=https://archive.org/stream/investigationofu10unit#page/6227 |pages=6227f |date=1940}}</ref> From 1933 on she took in German emigrants on her property in [[Thur\u00f8]], including [[Bertolt Brecht]] and his wife [[Helene Weigel]].

She is buried in the Thur\u00f8 cemetery.\n\n== Works ==\n\nIn the course of 50 years, Karin Micha\u00eblis wrote 36 novels for adults, nine children's books, and two autobiographies, plus many other books and a number of newspaper and periodical articles.\n\nIn 1910 she published ''Den farlige Alder (The Dangerous Age)''. It is the story of Elsie Lindtner, who, after divorcing her husband,  attempts to rekindle a relationship with a younger man who had once worshipped her from afar. When this relationship fails as well, she resolves to spend her life traveling throughout the world with a female friend. The book created a great sensation, because it began to cut through tabooed themes like the sexual desires of a 40-year-old woman. The novel was translated many times and filmed several times, including a 1927 version with [[Asta Nielsen]].<ref>{{cite news | title= Elsie Lindtner a Sad Heroine | work= New York Times | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/08/27/100501533.pdf | accessdate= 2011-04-29 | date=27 August 1911}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fembio.org/biographie.php/frau/biographie/karin-michaelis/ fembio.org](German)</ref>\n\nAmong the articles she wrote for American magazines were a two-part series for Munsey's Magazine in 1913, entitled \"Why Are Women Less Truthful Than Men\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Munseys-1913may-00185 |title=\"Why Are Women Less Truthful Than Men\" |last= Micha\u00eblis |first= Karin |publisher=Munsey's Magazine|date=13 May 1913|format=readable PDF |website=www.unz.org|access-date=16 June 2015}}</ref> and an interview with Woodrow Wilson for Living Age Magazine in 1925, \"On President Wilson's Trail\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/LivingAge-1925jul18-00131 |title=\"On President Wilson's Trail\" |last= Micha\u00eblis |first= Karin |publisher=Living AgeMagazine|date=18 July 1925|format=readable PDF |website=www.unz.org|access-date=16 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1914, ''Glaedens Skole (School of Joy)'' was published, about a reform school in Vienna led by her friend, the Austrian pedagogue Eugenie Schwarzwald.

The ''Bibi'' books came in seven volumes from 1929 to 1939 and became a big international success. In these novels for adolescents, readers meet the stationmaster's daughter Bibi, who is motherless, but as a result free.
