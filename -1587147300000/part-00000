It is about 5&nbsp;km from the [[Uzbekistan]] border.\n\n==Overview==\nOsh has an important outdoor [[bazaar]] which has been taking place on the same spot for the past 2000 years, and was a major market along the [[Silk Road]]. The city's industrial base, established during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, largely collapsed after the break-up of the Soviet Union and has recently only started to revive.\n\nThe proximity of the [[Uzbekistan]] border, which cuts through historically linked territories and settlements, deprives Osh of much of its former [[hinterland]] and presents a serious obstacle to trade and economic development. Daily flights from [[Osh Airport]] link Osh\u2014and hence the southern part of Kyrgyzstan\u2014to [[Bishkek]] and some international destinations, mainly in Russia. Osh has two railway stations and a railway connection to [[Andijan]] in neighbouring Uzbekistan, but no passenger traffic and only sporadic freight traffic. Most transport is by road. The recent upgrading of the long and arduous road through the mountains to Bishkek has greatly improved communications.\n\nThe city has several monuments, including one to the southern Kyrgyz \"queen\" [[Kurmanjan Datka]] and one of the few remaining statues of [[Lenin]]. A [[Russian Orthodox]] church, reopened after the demise of the Soviet Union, the second largest [[mosque]] in the country (situated beside the bazaar) and the 16th-century Rabat Abdul Khan Mosque can be found here.

It is about 5&nbsp;km from the [[Uzbekistan]] border.\n\n==Overview==\nOsh has an important outdoor [[bazaar]] which has been taking place on the same spot for the past 2000 years, and was a major market along the [[Silk Road]]. The city's industrial base, established during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, largely collapsed after the break-up of the Soviet Union and has recently only started to revive.\n\nThe proximity of the [[Uzbekistan]] border, which cuts through historically linked territories and settlements, deprives Osh of much of its former [[hinterland]] and presents a serious obstacle to trade and economic development. Daily flights from [[Osh Airport]] link Osh\u2014and hence the southern part of Kyrgyzstan\u2014to [[Bishkek]] and some international destinations, mainly in Russia. Osh has two railway stations and a railway connection to [[Andijan]] in neighbouring Uzbekistan, but no passenger traffic and only sporadic freight traffic. Most transport is by road. The recent upgrading of the long and arduous road through the mountains to Bishkek has greatly improved communications.\n\nThe city has several monuments, including one to the southern Kyrgyz \"queen\" [[Kurmanjan Datka]] and one of the few remaining statues of [[Lenin]]. A [[Russian Orthodox]] church, reopened after the demise of the Soviet Union, the second largest [[mosque]] in the country (situated beside the bazaar) and the 16th-century Rabat Abdul Khan Mosque can be found here.

It was also one of her most successful albums reaching number five on the R&B albums chart and hitting the top 20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Background==\nBy 2002, Patti LaBelle had been with [[MCA Records]] for seventeen years. The label had helped to increase LaBelle's popularity with both pop and R&B audiences resulting in 2 platinum album and four subsequent gold-selling follow-ups. However, LaBelle's last album with the label, 2000's solemnly-produced ''[[When a Woman Loves]]'' failed to generate a hit record or even go gold. In 2003, MCA Records was absorbed by [[Geffen Records]]. As a result, LaBelle signed with [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]]'s [[Def Jam Records|Def Soul Classics]] division, joining [[The Isley Brothers]] as the two first acts on [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]]'s new Def Jam imprint. LaBelle went to work on her new album in 2003 and by 2004, LaBelle and Def Jam released ''Timeless Journey''. By the end of the year the album went gold with sales shipping past the 500,000 mark.\n\n==Release==\nFueled by the release of LaBelle's first hit single in seven years, \"New Day\", the album eventually did well on the pop and R&B charts reaching number 18 on the former and number 5 on the latter. However, LaBelle and Def Jam fell into problems immediately after its release. Shortly after releasing 2005's ''Classic Moments'', LaBelle told reporters that she was \"unceremoniously\" kicked out of the label by Reid. After a public spat, Reid renegotiated a new contract with LaBelle in 2007 releasing a Christmas album. Though the album did go gold, it did receive some popularity. Five years later, the ballad \"2 Steps Away\", written by Philadelphia songwriter and friend Jon DeLise, was featured on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''. Two Steps Away also aired multiple times on \"So you think you can dance\" among other network shows and was re-released on the Care for Haiti compilation with notable artists such as Wycleaf Jean and Natasha Beddingfield. The success of the song eventually helped it reach Billboard's Digital Singles chart, her first charted single on that chart. \"New Day\" topped the Billboard Hot Dance Songs chart in 2004.\n\n==Track listing==\n#\"More Than Material\" (LaBelle, [[J.

shared upon the song's release on April 9, 2020 and was directed by frequent collaborator Reel Bear Media.<ref name=\"variety\"/> It features additional appearances from Joseph's wife Jenna, their child Rosie and Dun's fiancee [[Debby Ryan]]. It loosely documents the creation of the song and video as Joseph and Dun individually record and film their parts, uploading the audio and video onto a [[USB flash drive]] and sending it via [[snail-mail]] (although it is revealed that the two are living next door to each other at the end of the video). This is cut between clips of the Joseph and Dun spending time with their respective partners and decorating their houses with flashing lights and fluorescent stars.<ref name=\"rs\"/><ref name=\"variety\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2020/04/twenty-one-pilots-share-video-for-level-of-concern/|title=Twenty One Pilots Share Video for 'Level of Concern'|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=April 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410142822/https://www.spin.com/2020/04/twenty-one-pilots-share-video-for-level-of-concern/|archive-date=April 10, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/listen-twenty-one-pilots-new-song-level-of-concern|title=LISTEN: Twenty One Pilots' New Song 'Level of Concern'|last=Rogers|first=Jack|website=[[Rock Sound]]|date=April 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410143141/https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/listen-twenty-one-pilots-new-song-level-of-concern|archive-date=April 10, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loOWKm8GW6A|title=twenty one pilots - Level of Concern (Official Video)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=April 9, 2020|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref name=\"tidal\"/>\n\n*[[Tyler Joseph]] \u2013 production, recording, songwriting\n*[[Paul Meany]] \u2013 production\n*[[Chris Gehringer]] \u2013 mastering\n*[[Adam Hawkins]] \u2013 mixing\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders Tip|23|artist=Twenty One Pilots|song=Level of Concern|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Billboardcanadarock|42|artist=Twenty One Pilots 2|rowheader=true|accessdate= April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|23|year=2020|week=15|artist=Twenty One Pilots|rowheader=true|accessdate= April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|29|date=20200417|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w16/|title=2020 16-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 10-16 d.)

Finishing it in three hours and titling it ''Wish It, Want It, Do It'', Brian publishes the book, and it immediately becomes a commercial success. Brian decides to hire Stewie (because of his connections that helped publish the book) as his [[publicist]] when the book becomes popular, and organizes a publicity tour. Though Brian is initially skeptical of Stewie's arrogant demeanour, Brian soon follows suit and becomes an egomaniac. While reflecting on his fame during dinner, Brian notices [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] at the front of the restaurant; after angrily berating Stewie for not booking their table there, he punishes him by refusing to give him a lift to their hotel. Seeking to reconcile his relationship with Brian, Stewie books him an appearance on ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' to discuss [[separation of church and state]] with [[Bill Maher|Maher]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]].\n\nTwo hours prior to his appearance, Brian continues to bully Stewie for insignificant inconveniences, when they are informed that Hitchens cannot attend, and that [[Arianna Huffington]] and [[Dana Gould]] will serve as replacement panelists.

While on the show, Maher, Huffington and Gould begin to criticize Brian's book, stating that it fails to meet the expectations of the public and is pretentious, repetitive, unhelpful and banal.
