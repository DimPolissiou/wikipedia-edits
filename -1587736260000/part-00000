The team won the [[2017 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup]].\n\nIn all other competitions, including the [[Hockey World Cup]], the [[Commonwealth Games]] and some editions of the [[Hockey Champions Trophy]], the four [[home nations]] compete in their own right: [[England men's national field hockey team|England]], [[Ireland men's national field hockey team|Ireland]] (includes both the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]] and [[Northern Ireland]]), [[Scotland men's national field hockey team|Scotland]] and [[Wales men's national field hockey team|Wales]].\n\nThe team was established in 1920 as '''Great Britain and Ireland''', prior to the independence of most of Ireland as the [[Irish Free State]]. They only played one tournament under that name: the [[Field hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp, [[Belgium]], when they won the gold medal. Prior to 1920 there was only one field hockey tournament at the Olympics, in [[Field hockey at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], when England won the gold, Ireland the silver, and Scotland and Wales the bronze medals.\n\n==Honours==\n===Summer Olympics===\n*''[[Field hockey at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]]'' \u2013 {{goca}} {{sica}} {{brca}} {{brca}}\n*[[Field hockey at the 1920 Summer

Olympics in [[Seoul]]. The team won the [[2017 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup]].\n\nIn all other competitions, including the [[Hockey World Cup]], the [[Commonwealth Games]] and some editions of the [[Hockey Champions Trophy]], the four [[home nations]] compete in their own right: [[England men's national field hockey team|England]], [[Ireland men's national field hockey team|Ireland]] (includes both the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]] and [[Northern Ireland]]), [[Scotland men's national field hockey team|Scotland]] and [[Wales men's national field hockey team|Wales]].\n\nThe team was established in 1920 as '''Great Britain and Ireland''', prior to the independence of most of Ireland as the [[Irish Free State]]. They only played one tournament under that name: the [[Field hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp, [[Belgium]], when they won the gold medal. Prior to 1920 there was only one field hockey tournament at the Olympics, in [[Field hockey at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], when England won the gold, Ireland the silver, and Scotland and Wales

It is a sequel to 2011's ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' and was released in October 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]; then later in November for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Battlefield 4'' was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign mode, and for its numerous [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|title=Battlefield 4 sells 7+ million, only 2% are still playing|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331205158/http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game's [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.\n\nWeapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can \"spot\" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting.\n\n===Campaign===\nThe single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, [[#Setting and characters|Recker]], the player can use two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\nThe campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible [[dog tag]]s which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons.

After being trapped underwater while being pursued by Russian special forces, Dunn, critically wounded and trapped, sacrifices himself by ordering the squad to break the windscreen and escape. Reuniting with their commanding officer Captain Garrison, Tombstone learns that Admiral Chang,  head of the Chinese army, has taken control of China with Russian support, and eliminated Chinese presidential candidate Jin Ji\u00e9, a progressive politician seeking reforms within the Chinese government. The group finds themselves sent to Shanghai with orders to rescue two VIPs - a woman named Hannah, and her husband - with assistance from an intelligence agent named Kovic.\n\nAlthough the rescue is a success and Kovic takes the VIPs back to the USS ''Valkyrie'', a [[Wasp-class amphibious assault ship]], Tombstone becomes trapped in the city and forced to rescue civilians against Pac's protests. Shortly after returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Garrison assigns Kovic as head of the squad, and sends them to the USS ''Titan'', a [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier]] that had just been attacked, to recover its [[voyage data recorder]] before the wreckage sinks. Upon returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Tombstone finds the ship under assault by [[People's Liberation Army Navy-Marine Corps|Chinese Marines]]. While the squad rescue Garrison, and the VIPs, Kovic is fatally wounded and passes control of the squad to Recker. Learning that China's air force is grounded due to a storm, Garrison assigns Tombstone to lend assistance to US forces planning to assault the Chinese-controlled [[Singapore]] airfield so that Chinese air superiority is weakened. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone on their mission, much to Irish's chagrin.\n\nDespite the airfield being destroyed by a missile strike, Pac is separated from Tombstone during evacuation and assumed killed in the blast. Hannah then betrays Recker and Irish, allowing both to be captured by Chinese soldiers. Both men find themselves taken to a prison in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] for interrogation under Chang's orders. In his cell, Recker finds himself befriended by a Russian prisoner named [[Battlefield 3|\"Dima\"]] - a survivor of the Paris nuclear blast, now suffering from [[radiation poisoning]]. The pair escape from their cell, start a mass prison riot and use the chaos to make their escape, with Recker rescuing Irish along the way. As the Chinese military arrives to quell the riot, Hannah prevents the group from being recaptured by a group of soldiers. Although Irish mistrusts her, Hannah reveals her action was necessary for her mission, revealing her husband is, in reality, Jin Ji\u00e9, who survived Chang's assassination attempt.\n\nThe group makes use of a tram to get out of the mountains, only for it to be shot down by an enemy helicopter, killing Dima in the crash. Forced to make their way down on foot, hunting for food to survive, the group eventually find a jeep and drive towards the US-occupied city of Tashgar. During the journey, Hannah reveals how she lost her family to Chang's men after bringing Jin Ji\u00e9 to meet them, causing Irish to make amends with her for his behavior. Upon reaching Tashgar, the squad find US troops being besieged by both Chinese and Russian forces, and offer assistance to the US commander by destroying a nearby dam, flooding the area and eliminating the opposing forces. Learning the ''Valkyrie'' is within the region of the [[Suez Canal]], Tombstone is airlifted to the ship, and arrives to warn the vessel that they are blindly heading towards Chang's navy. Assisting in stopping Chinese forces from boarding the ship, the squad soon find Jin Ji\u00e9 amongst other survivors, including Pac (who had survived Singapore).\n\nKnowing he must show his face, as Chinese forces had been fighting under the assumption he was dead, Jin Ji\u00e9 convinces Recker to let him show his face and calm tensions between the three forces. The assault quickly ends with Chinese forces beginning to spread the news of Jin Ji\u00e9's return. Chang, desiring to prevent this and conceal the truth, proceeds to barrage the ''Valkyrie'' with his personal warship. Recker, Irish, and Hannah volunteer to board the warship and use explosives to destroy it. However, when the remote detonation fails, Hannah and Irish each volunteer to manually replacing the charges. If the player chooses not to do anything, Chang obliterates the ''Valkyrie'', thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Ji\u00e9; if they send one of the two, the volunteer goes back to set the explosives, and is killed in the blast along with Chang, while the survivor and Recker are recovered by the ''Valkyrie''. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with no regrets.\n\n==Development==\nElectronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to ''Battlefield 3'' during a keynote at the [[University of Southern California]] where he said \"There is going to be a ''Battlefield 4''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|title=EA president mentions Battlefield 4 during college keynote|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103224032/http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: \"Frank was speaking broadly about the ''Battlefield'' brand&mdash;a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to.\" On the eve of ''Battlefield 3''{{'}}s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make ''Battlefield 4''. \"This feels like day one now,\" executive producer Patrick Bach said. \"It's exciting.

Will there be the same Levolution (falling building) or different Levolution in other maps?\"'''<br />Yes, Levolution occurs on every map. Some things are massive like reducing a skyscraper to rubble or flooding an entire level in real-time. Others are small but hugely impact the game like shooting fire extinguishers to distract enemies or cutting the power of a building to blind opponents.<br />If you haven\u2019t seen the Paracel Storm map we unveiled at Gamescom we encourage you to do so. There you can see how players have the option of taking down a turbine weakened by lightning in order to free the damaged destroyer stuck on it. If you manage to set the destroyer adrift, it will crash onto the island, changing the layout of the map and allowing your team to take control of the anti-air weaponry on the ship.<br />These moments are all triggered by the players \u2013 they aren\u2019t just timed moments that will happen no matter what you do in the match. You and your teammates will have to decide if it would be a better tactical decision to radically change the map, or if it would be wiser and better for your play-style if you stopped the other team from triggering these events.|access-date=September 16,

It is a sequel to 2011's ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' and was released in October 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]; then later in November for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Battlefield 4'' was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign mode, and for its numerous [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|title=Battlefield 4 sells 7+ million, only 2% are still playing|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331205158/http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game's [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.\n\nWeapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can \"spot\" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting.\n\n===Campaign===\nThe single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, [[#Setting and characters|Recker]], the player can use two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\nThe campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible [[dog tag]]s which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\n===Multiplayer===\n[[File:Battlefield 4 - MP - Commander Mode.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The new Commander Mode interface in ''Battlefield 4'', showing an overhead view of the map \"Siege of Shanghai\"]]\n''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s multiplayer contains three playable factions\u2014the United States, China, and Russia\u2014fighting against each other, in up to 64-player matches on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (24-Player on Xbox 360 and PS3). A newly reintroduced \"Commander Mode\", last seen in ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'', gives one player on each team a [[real-time strategy]]-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates. Also, the Commander can observe the battle through the eyes of the players on the battlefield, deploying vehicle and weapon drops to \"keep the war machinery going\", and order in missile strikes on hostile targets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |title= Battlefield 4 promo material reveals return of Commander Mode, three playable factions |date= April 15, 2013 |accessdate= May 7, 2013 |first= Wesley |last= Yin-Poole |publisher= Euro Gamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195650/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |archive-date= March 3, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |title=Battlefield 4: Official Commander Mode Trailer |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611235513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A spectator mode is included, enabling players to spectate others in first or third person, as well as use a free camera to pan around the map from any angle.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, at E3, DICE featured the map \"Siege of Shanghai\", pitting the [[People's Liberation Army]] against the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]]. The gameplay showcased Commander Mode; new weapons and vehicles; and the \"Levolution\" gameplay mechanic. The video displays the last of these at various points, including: a player destroying a support pillar to trap an enemy tank above it; and a large skyscraper (with an in-game objective on the top floor) collapsing in the center of the map, kicking up a massive dust cloud throughout the map and bringing the objective closer to ground level.<ref name=bf4_levolution_trailer>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3W4FbsAqIY|title=Battlefield 4: Official Levolution Features Video|publisher=DICE|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=August 22, 2013|quote='''Aleksander Gr\u00f8ndal''': Levolution is the next step in player choice, in how you affect the world, and the world affects you back.

The Assault kit must now wait for the defibrillator to recharge after reviving teammates in quick succession. The Engineer kit uses [[Personal defense weapon|PDWs]], and carbines are available to all kits. The support kit has access to the new remote mortar and the [[XM25 CDTE|XM25]] allowing for indirect suppressive fire. The Recon kit is now more mobile and is able to equip carbines, [[designated marksman rifle]]s (DMRs), and C4. Sniping mechanics also give with the ability to zero in your sights (set an aiming distance), and equip more optics and accessories than previous Battlefield games. The Recon kit is still able to utilize the MAV, T-UGS, and the Radio Beacon.<ref name=\"GameSpot-YouTube\" /><ref name=\"EA-YouTube\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7l-eUmhEW8 |title=Battlefield 4 Multiplayer Demo - Siege of Shanghai E3 2013 |publisher=YouTube |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061912/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7l-eUmhEW8 |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.battlefield.com/2013/08/road-to-bf4-field-upgrades/|title=The Road to Battlefield 4: Tweaked to the Core|access-date=September 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053817/http://blogs.battlefield.com/2013/08/road-to-bf4-field-upgrades/|archive-date=September 21, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNew vehicles have also been introduced. With the addition of the Chinese faction, new vehicles include the [[Type 99 tank|Type 99 MBT]], the [[ZFB-05]] armored car, and the [[CAIC Z-10|Z-10W attack helicopter]]. Jets have also been rebalanced and put into two classes, \"attack\" and \"stealth\". The attack jets focus is mainly air-to-ground capabilities, while stealth jets focus mainly on air-to-air combat. Another vehicle added in ''Battlefield 4'' is the addition of the [[CB90|RCB]] and DV-15 Interceptor attack boats, which function as heavily armed aquatic assault craft.\n\nCustomization options have also been increased in ''Battlefield 4'', with all new camos available for every gun. A new \"adaptive\" camo has been introduced that can adapt the camo to the map being played without the player having to change camos every map. Camos can now be applied to jets, helicopters, tanks, transport vehicles and guns. Previously this option was introduced to parachutes but has been removed, emblems are now printed onto parachutes.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s single-player Campaign takes place during the fictional \"War of 2020\", six years after the events of its [[Battlefield 3#Plot|predecessor]].

After being trapped underwater while being pursued by Russian special forces, Dunn, critically wounded and trapped, sacrifices himself by ordering the squad to break the windscreen and escape. Reuniting with their commanding officer Captain Garrison, Tombstone learns that Admiral Chang,  head of the Chinese army, has taken control of China with Russian support, and eliminated Chinese presidential candidate Jin Ji\u00e9, a progressive politician seeking reforms within the Chinese government. The group finds themselves sent to Shanghai with orders to rescue two VIPs - a woman named Hannah, and her husband - with assistance from an intelligence agent named Kovic.\n\nAlthough the rescue is a success and Kovic takes the VIPs back to the USS ''Valkyrie'', a [[Wasp-class amphibious assault ship]], Tombstone becomes trapped in the city and forced to rescue civilians against Pac's protests. Shortly after returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Garrison assigns Kovic as head of the squad, and sends them to the USS ''Titan'', a [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier]] that had just been attacked, to recover its [[voyage data recorder]] before the wreckage sinks. Upon returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Tombstone finds the ship under assault by [[People's Liberation Army Navy-Marine Corps|Chinese Marines]]. While the squad rescue Garrison, and the VIPs, Kovic is fatally wounded and passes control of the squad to Recker. Learning that China's air force is grounded due to a storm, Garrison assigns Tombstone to lend assistance to US forces planning to assault the Chinese-controlled [[Singapore]] airfield so that Chinese air superiority is weakened. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone on their mission, much to Irish's chagrin.\n\nDespite the airfield being destroyed by a missile strike, Pac is separated from Tombstone during evacuation and assumed killed in the blast. Hannah then betrays Recker and Irish, allowing both to be captured by Chinese soldiers. Both men find themselves taken to a prison in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] for interrogation under Chang's orders. In his cell, Recker finds himself befriended by a Russian prisoner named [[Battlefield 3|\"Dima\"]] - a survivor of the Paris nuclear blast, now suffering from [[radiation poisoning]]. The pair escape from their cell, start a mass prison riot, and use the chaos to make their escape, with Recker rescuing Irish along the way. As Chinese military arrive to quell the riot, Hannah prevents the group from being recaptured by a group of soldiers. Although Irish mistrusts her, Hannah reveals her action was necessary for her mission, revealing her husband is, in reality, Jin Ji\u00e9, who survived Chang's assassination attempt.\n\nThe group makes use of a tram to get out of the mountains, only for it to be shot down by an enemy helicopter, killing Dima in the crash. Forced to make their way down on foot, hunting for food to survive, the group eventually find a jeep and drive towards the US-occupied city of Tashgar. During the journey, Hannah reveals how she lost her family to Chang's men after bringing Jin Ji\u00e9 to meet them, causing Irish to make amends with her for his behavior. Upon reaching Tashgar, the squad find US troops being besieged by both Chinese and Russian forces, and offer assistance to the US commander by destroying a nearby dam, flooding the area and eliminating the opposing forces. Learning the ''Valkyrie'' is within the region of the [[Suez Canal]], Tombstone is airlifted to the ship, and arrives to warn the vessel that they are blindly heading towards Chang's navy. Assisting in stopping Chinese forces from boarding the ship, the squad soon find Jin Ji\u00e9 amongst other survivors, including Pac (who had survived Singapore).\n\nKnowing he must show his face, as Chinese forces had been fighting under the assumption he was dead, Jin Ji\u00e9 convinces Recker to let him show his face and calm tensions between the three forces. The assault quickly ends with Chinese forces beginning to spread the news of Jin Ji\u00e9's return. Chang, desiring to prevent this and conceal the truth, proceeds to barrage the ''Valkyrie'' with his personal warship. Recker, Irish, and Hannah volunteer to board the warship and use explosives to destroy it. However, when the remote detonation fails, Hannah and Irish each volunteer to manually replacing the charges. If the player chooses not to do anything, Chang obliterates the ''Valkyrie'', thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Ji\u00e9; if they send one of the two, the volunteer goes back to set the explosives, and is killed in the blast along with Chang, while the survivor and Recker are recovered by the ''Valkyrie''. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with no regrets.\n\n==Development==\nElectronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to ''Battlefield 3'' during a keynote at the [[University of Southern California]] where he said \"There is going to be a ''Battlefield 4''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|title=EA president mentions Battlefield 4 during college keynote|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103224032/http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: \"Frank was speaking broadly about the ''Battlefield'' brand&mdash;a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to.\" On the eve of ''Battlefield 3''{{'}}s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make ''Battlefield 4''. \"This feels like day one now,\" executive producer Patrick Bach said. \"It's exciting.

Will there be the same Levolution (falling building) or different Levolution in other maps?\"'''<br />Yes, Levolution occurs on every map. Some things are massive like reducing a skyscraper to rubble or flooding an entire level in real-time. Others are small but hugely impact the game like shooting fire extinguishers to distract enemies or cutting the power of a building to blind opponents.<br />If you haven\u2019t seen the Paracel Storm map we unveiled at Gamescom we encourage you to do so. There you can see how players have the option of taking down a turbine weakened by lightning in order to free the damaged destroyer stuck on it. If you manage to set the destroyer adrift, it will crash onto the island, changing the layout of the map and allowing your team to take control of the anti-air weaponry on the ship.<br />These moments are all triggered by the players \u2013 they aren\u2019t just timed moments that will happen no matter what you do in the match. You and your teammates will have to decide if it would be a better tactical decision to radically change the map, or if it would be wiser and better for your play-style if you stopped the other team from triggering these events.|access-date=September 16,

It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], March 17, 1978 on Stage 33 at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears in a comic sketch; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured is a final sketch of \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" with Burnett and Lawrence as Eunice and Mama where Eunice consults a psychiatrist (played by [[Craig Richard Nelson]]) trying to figure out what went wrong with her life, as well as a final sketch of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" with Burnett and Conway as Mrs. Wiggins and Mr. Tudball in which Mr. Tudball is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre. With the changes in cast (Harvey Korman left the series after the 1976\u201377 season and was replaced by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) along with the mediocre ratings (finishing its last season in 66th place), she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out.

It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], March 17, 1978 on Stage 33 at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears in a comic sketch; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured is a final sketch of \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" with Burnett and Lawrence as Eunice and Mama where Eunice consults a psychiatrist (played by [[Craig Richard Nelson]]) trying to figure out what went wrong with her life, as well as a final sketch of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" with Burnett and Conway as Mrs. Wiggins and Mr. Tudball in which Mr. Tudball is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre. With the changes in cast (Harvey Korman left the series after the 1976\u201377 season and was replaced by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) along with the mediocre ratings (finishing its last season in 66th place), she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett and Tim Conway): Mr. Tudball is moving his office and has a flashback to when he first interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" (Harvey Korman)\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" / \"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]]): Eunice talks to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*Finale: \"The Charwoman\": \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFeatured segments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Special_Evening_with_Carol_Burnett"}

In departure from prior Mustang models, the sixth generation Mustang includes fully [[Independent suspension|independent rear suspension]] on all models, as well as an optional 2.3L [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] and [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injected]] four cylinder engine. The new Mustang was introduced as a 2015 model year vehicle, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Ford Mustang, which was revealed as a 1965 model year vehicle on April 17, 1964.\n\nThe sixth generation is also the first [[Ford Mustang]] to be marketed and sold globally, and represented the first time that factory [[right hand drive]] Mustangs were produced in addition to the [[left hand drive]] models.

In December 2010, an exterior design theme proposal by Kemal Curic from Ford's Cologne, Germany design studios was selected by design management. Curic (also responsible for the 2011 Focus (2012 in the US) and the 2014 Mondeo/Fusion) relocated to Ford's design studios in Dearborn in January 2011. During mid-stage development, Curic's original exterior design proposal was eventually rejected by Ford executives, resulting in rapid design changes. After reviewing 3 different exterior theme proposals (A, B, and C) in design clinics in September 2012, the final exterior design (Theme A) was approved by Ford management, with the final design freeze occurring in December 2012, 20 months ahead of originally scheduled August 2014 production. The interior design program began in the spring of 2010, under Doyle Letson. By late 2011, a final interior proposal was settled on and was a combination of Themes A & B. In June 2012, the final interior design was frozen. The first [[development mule|test mules]] in 2010 model year bodies were spotted earlier in June 2012, and the first S550 prototypes were built five months later (exterior design freeze) in May 2013.<ref name=\"Simona\">{{cite web|author=Simona |title=2015 Ford Mustang|url= http://www.topspeed.com/cars/ford/2015-ford-mustang-ar114432.html|publisher=topspeed.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"articles-latimes\">{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Jerry|title=Ford unveils sixth-generation Mustang for 50th anniversary|url= https://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/04/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-mustang-debut-20131204|publisher=articles.latimes.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"gizmag\">{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=C.C.|title=All-new Ford Mustang gets a fastback makeover, EcoBoost engine|url= http://www.gizmag.com/ford-sixth-generation-mustang/30037/ |publisher=gizmag.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"caradvice\">{{cite web|last=Zalstein|first=David|title=Ford Mustang sixth-gen muscle car detailed in new videos|url= http://www.caradvice.com.au/263272/ford-mustang-sixth-gen-muscle-car-detailed-in-new-videos/|publisher=caradvice.com.au|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2015-ford-mustang-in-depth-with-the-team-that-made-it-happen-feature|title=2015 Ford Mustang: In-Depth with the Team that Made It Happen|author=|date=|work=caranddriver.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kemal-curic/a/8b4/84a Kemal Curic Mustang/GT350 Design Manager Ford of America], ''linkedin.com''</ref>\n\n==Engines==\nAt launch, three engines were available: a standard aluminum 3.7 L [[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|\"Cyclone\"]] V6, an optional 2.3 L [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[Gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] I4, or a 5.0 L [[Ford Modular engine#5.0 L Coyote|\"Coyote\"]] V8.<ref name=\"Specs\">{{cite press release|url= https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/asset.download.document.pdf.html/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2015_Specs/Mustang_Specs_USA.pdf |title=2015 Ford Mustang USA - technical specifications |publisher=Ford Media  |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 2.3 L EcoBoost engine is new to the Mustang, having debuted in the 2015 model year [[Lincoln MKC]] crossover.

The Convertible remains the same. The 2015 Ford Mustang is offered in several models:\n\n* The base '''V6''' model offers standard features such as the carryover 3.7 L V6 engine from the previous-generation Mustang, cloth front bucket seats, an AM/FM radio with six speakers, [[Ford SYNC]], [[USB]], [[iPod]], and auxiliary input jacks, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, keyless access with push-button start and either a six-speed [[manual transmission]] or [[automatic transmission]]. The model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\n* The sporty '''EcoBoost''' model offers the same features as the '''V6''' model, but replaces the carryover 3.7 L V6 engine with a new 2.3 L Turbocharged I4 engine and adds power front driver's and passenger's seats. This model is only available in Fastback style. \n* The midrange '''EcoBoost Premium''' model adds to the EcoBoost model [[leather]] seating surfaces, [[MyFord Touch]] with Ford SYNC, and [[HD Radio]], the SHAKER Premium Sound System,  and more. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\n* The performance-oriented '''GT''' model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. This model is only available in Fastback style.\n* The top-of-the-line '''GT Premium''' model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. It also adds nineteen-inch alloy wheels. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\nThe old [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby]] GT500 models are discontinued for 2015, along with the 5.8 L V8 [[supercharged]] engine.  They have since been supplanted by the GT350/350R models featuring the new 5.2 L flat plane crank V8.\n\nExport-spec variants currently consist of only the EcoBoost and GT grades, with the UK and Australia receiving both the Fastback and Convertible styles and various parts of Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan) receiving the Fastback only (as of June 2016).  Meanwhile, Performance Packages are standard on all Asia-bound EcoBoost and GT trims. Markets like India receive only the GT trim (mated to the automatic transmission).\n\nAn '''EcoBoost Performance Package''' was added for the 2020 model year, which raised the output of the turbocharged I4 engine to {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, using the engine from the Focus RS, and upgraded various parts.  A handling package was also available, which added active dampers ([[MagneRide]]) and wider tires.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a27131311/2020-ford-mustang-2-3-liter-performance-package/|title=The 2020 Ford Mustang EcoBoost Base Model Gets a Better Performance Package|publisher=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Wendler|first=Andrew|date=April 15, 2019|accessdate=June 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Models and Special Editions==\n\n===Mustang 50 Year Limited Edition (2015)===\n[[File:Ford MUSTANG GT 50 Year Limited Edition (S550).jpg|thumb|right|Mustang 50 Year Limited Edition]]\nA total of 1964 units of a version of the 2015 Ford Mustang GT Coup\u00e9 with the performance pack and either a manual or automatic transmission, were made to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Ford Mustang vehicle lineup.

The GT350 is more track focused than the GT500, and was benchmarked against the Camaro Z28, Porsche GT3, and BMW M4. Notable features are track-focused chassis tuning, significant aero-dynamic changes to include lowering the hood around the engine, 2-piece, cross-drilled brake rotors paired with [[Brembo]] calipers, [[MagneRide]] damping option, lightweight [[Tremec TR-3160 transmission|Tremec TR-3160]] six speed manual transmission, [[Recaro]] seats, and various lightweight components (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced polymer radiator support that directs cooling channels for various components).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/13709/|title=Flat-plane crankshaft spins 'Voodoo' into Ford\u2019s new Shelby V8|author=|date=|work=sae.org}}</ref>\n\nAdditional options, such as larger alloy wheels, [[navigation system]], rear backup sensors, a rear backup camera, blind spot monitoring, security system, SHAKER PRO [[Surround Sound]] Premium Sound System, premium leather seating surfaces, and [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] front [[headlamps]] are available.

Items removed include air conditioning, the stereo system, rear seats, trunk floorboard and carpet, backup camera and emergency tire sealer and inflator. Exhaust resonators also have been removed for weight savings with the benefit of creating a sharper exhaust tone.\n\nThe Shelby GT350R is more than 130&nbsp;lbs (59&nbsp;kg) lighter than the Shelby GT350 Track Pack model, which has proven its durability in multiple 24-hour racetrack tests. The GT350R also comes with carbon fiber wheels which weigh only 18&nbsp;lbs (8&nbsp;kg) each compared to similarly specified aluminum wheels which typically weigh 33&nbsp;lbs (15&nbsp;kg) each.\n\nAside from carbon fiber wheels, larger front splitter and rear wing, Shelby GT350R features distinct design details. Exterior touches include red painted brake calipers, red pin striping at the edges of the optional over-the-top racing stripes and Shelby GT350R badging.

The package is ideal for GT350R buyers who plan to use their car for more than track purposes or for show.  Parts of this package, namely the infotainment system and backup camera, were made standard during April 2018 production, due to U.S. legislation requiring all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to have backup cameras.\n\n===Bullitt Mustang (2019)===\n[[File:Ford Mustang Bullit Genf 2018.jpg|thumb|2019 Mustang Bullitt|alt=]]\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', Ford unveiled the latest incarnation of the ''Bullitt'' edition Mustang GT at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] (NAIAS).

For 2018, Ford has dropped the previously base V6 model and its {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.7L Cyclone V6 engine, leaving the EcoBoost, the GT, the Shelby GT350 and the Shelby GT350R. The new Mustang sports a mildly restyled front clip and dashboard design, and new standard and optional wheels. Inside, a new optional twelve-inch, fully digital LCD instrument cluster adorns the dash, and can be heavily customized by the driver.  However, none of these updates were applied to the Shelby GT350/GT350R, which retained their unique front end and speedometer/tachometer/instrument cluster.\n\nA new ten-speed automatic transmission replaces the existing six-speed unit, and joins the six-speed manual transmission as an option. The new ten-speed automatic transmission is a joint development between [[General Motors]] and the [[Ford Motor Company]], where it is already used in the 2017 [[Chevrolet Camaro (sixth generation)|Chevrolet Camaro ZL1]] and 2017 [[Ford F-150 SVT Raptor]]. The MagneRide adjustable suspension system, previously only available in the Shelby GT350 and the Shelby GT350R, is now available on standard Mustang models. An Active Valve Performance switchable exhaust system allows the driver to customize the Mustang's exhaust note. Also newly available is a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, which is now offered in addition to the available heated and ventilated leather-trimmed front bucket seats. The instrument panel has also been redesigned with new trim panels, available in four standard finishes, as well as [[carbon fiber]], depending upon the model of Mustang that is chosen.  A new Performance Package 2 incorporates a larger radiator, wider Pilot Cup 2 tires and Brembo brake calipers (like on the GT350), enhanced springs, K-Brace, a Strut-Tower Brace, larger Sway Bar, and unique chassis tuning, and brings the Mustang GT much closer to the GT350 in handling and performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cjponyparts.com/resources/2018-mustang-gt-performance-package-level-2 |title= 2018 MUSTANG GT PERFORMANCE PACKAGE VS PERFORMANCE PACKAGE LEVEL 2\n|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFeatures that remain available from the 2017 Ford Mustang include: the [[Ford Sync|SYNC 3]] infotainment system featuring [[Android Auto]] and [[Apple CarPlay]] compatibility, the SHAKER PRO premium audio system, the GT Performance Package, the Premium Plus Package, and the Wheel and Stripe Package.

This is part of the \"One Ford\" business plan, which also applies to the [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]], [[Ford Focus|Focus]], [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Fusion]]/[[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]], [[Ford Escape|Escape]]/[[Ford Kuga|Kuga]], [[Ford Edge|Edge]], [[Ford Transit Connect]], and [[Ford Transit]], as well as other models.\n\n==Background==\nThe sixth generation of the Ford Mustang debuted on December 5, 2013 with same-day media events in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], [[Los Angeles, California]], [[New York City, New York]], [[Barcelona, Spain]], [[Shanghai, China]], and [[Sydney, Australia]].<ref name=\"debut\">{{cite press release|title=Ford to reveal all-new Mustang Dec. 5; Teams with Facebook and Instagram for 15-day countdown|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2013/11/19/ford-to-reveal-all-new-mustang-dec--5--teams-with-facebook-and-i.html|publisher=media.ford.com|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref> The 2015 Mustang marks the 50th anniversary of continuous Mustang production, which began in March 1964 in advance of the debut of the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|original Mustang]] at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] on April 17, 1964 in [[Flushing, Queens]].\n\nDevelopment of the 2015 Mustang, codenamed \"S550\", began in 2009 under chief engineer Dave Pericak and (from late-2009) exterior design director Joel Piaskowski, shortly after the updated 2010 model year Mustang went on sale. In December 2010, an exterior design theme proposal by Kemal Curic from Ford's Cologne, Germany design studios was selected by design management. Curic (also responsible for the 2011 Focus (2012 in the US) and the 2014 Mondeo/Fusion) relocated to Ford's design studios in Dearborn in January 2011. During mid-stage development, Curic's original exterior design proposal was eventually rejected by Ford executives, resulting in rapid design changes. After reviewing 3 different exterior theme proposals (A, B, and C) in design clinics in September 2012, the final exterior design (Theme A) was approved by Ford management, with the final design freeze occurring in December 2012, 20 months ahead of originally scheduled August 2014 production. The interior design program began in the spring of 2010, under Doyle Letson. By late 2011, a final interior proposal was settled on and was a combination of Themes A & B. In June 2012, the final interior design was frozen. The first [[development mule|test mules]] in 2010 model year bodies were spotted earlier in June 2012, and the first S550 prototypes were built five months later (exterior design freeze) in May 2013.<ref name=\"Simona\">{{cite web|author=Simona |title=2015 Ford Mustang|url= http://www.topspeed.com/cars/ford/2015-ford-mustang-ar114432.html|publisher=topspeed.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"articles-latimes\">{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Jerry|title=Ford unveils sixth-generation Mustang for 50th anniversary|url= https://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/04/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-mustang-debut-20131204|publisher=articles.latimes.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"gizmag\">{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=C.C.|title=All-new Ford Mustang gets a fastback makeover, EcoBoost engine|url= http://www.gizmag.com/ford-sixth-generation-mustang/30037/ |publisher=gizmag.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"caradvice\">{{cite web|last=Zalstein|first=David|title=Ford Mustang sixth-gen muscle car detailed in new videos|url= http://www.caradvice.com.au/263272/ford-mustang-sixth-gen-muscle-car-detailed-in-new-videos/|publisher=caradvice.com.au|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2015-ford-mustang-in-depth-with-the-team-that-made-it-happen-feature|title=2015 Ford Mustang: In-Depth with the Team that Made It Happen|author=|date=|work=caranddriver.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kemal-curic/a/8b4/84a Kemal Curic Mustang/GT350 Design Manager Ford of America], ''linkedin.com''</ref>\n\n==Engines==\nAt launch, three engines were available: a standard aluminum 3.7 L [[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|\"Cyclone\"]] V6, an optional 2.3 L [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[Gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] I4, or a 5.0 L [[Ford Modular engine#5.0 L Coyote|\"Coyote\"]] V8.<ref name=\"Specs\">{{cite press release|url= https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/asset.download.document.pdf.html/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2015_Specs/Mustang_Specs_USA.pdf |title=2015 Ford Mustang USA - technical specifications |publisher=Ford Media  |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 2.3 L EcoBoost engine is new to the Mustang, having debuted in the 2015 model year [[Lincoln MKC]] crossover.

The model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\n* The sporty '''EcoBoost''' model offers the same features as the '''V6''' model, but replaces the carryover 3.7 L V6 engine with a new 2.3 L Turbocharged I4 engine and adds power front driver's and passenger's seats. This model is only available in Fastback style. \n* The midrange '''EcoBoost Premium''' model adds to the EcoBoost model [[leather]] seating surfaces, [[MyFord Touch]] with Ford SYNC, and [[HD Radio]], the SHAKER Premium Sound System,  and more. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\n* The performance-oriented '''GT''' model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. This model is only available in Fastback style.\n* The top-of-the-line '''GT Premium''' model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. It also adds nineteen-inch alloy wheels. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\nThe old [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby]] GT500 models are discontinued for 2015, along with the 5.8 L V8 [[supercharged]] engine.  They have since been supplanted by the GT350/350R models featuring the new 5.2 L flat plane crank V8.\n\nExport-spec variants currently consist of only the EcoBoost and GT grades, with the UK and Australia receiving both the Fastback and Convertible styles and various parts of Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan) receiving the Fastback only (as of June 2016).  Meanwhile, Performance Packages are standard on all Asia-bound EcoBoost and GT trims.

The package is ideal for GT350R buyers who plan to use their car for more than track purposes or for show.

The new Mustang sports a mildly restyled front clip and dashboard design, and new standard and optional wheels. Inside, a new optional twelve-inch, fully digital LCD instrument cluster adorns the dash, and can be heavily customized by the driver.  However, none of these updates were applied to the Shelby GT350/GT350R, which retained their unique front end and speedometer/tachometer/instrument cluster.\n\nA new ten-speed automatic transmission replaces the existing six-speed unit, and joins the six-speed manual transmission as an option. The new ten-speed automatic transmission is a joint development between [[General Motors]] and the [[Ford Motor Company]], where it is already used in the 2017 [[Chevrolet Camaro (sixth generation)|Chevrolet Camaro ZL1]] and 2017 [[Ford F-150 SVT Raptor]]. The MagneRide adjustable suspension system, previously only available in the Shelby GT350 and the Shelby GT350R, is now available on standard Mustang models. An Active Valve Performance switchable exhaust system allows the driver to customize the Mustang's exhaust note. Also newly available is a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, which is now offered in addition to the available heated and ventilated leather-trimmed front bucket seats. The instrument panel has also been redesigned with new trim panels, available in four standard finishes, as well as [[carbon fiber]], depending upon the model of Mustang that is chosen.  A new Performance Package 2 incorporates a larger radiator, wider Pilot Cup 2 tires and Brembo brake calipers (like on the GT350), enhanced springs, K-Brace, a Strut-Tower Brace, larger Sway Bar, and unique chassis tuning, and brings the Mustang GT much closer to the GT350 in handling and performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cjponyparts.com/resources/2018-mustang-gt-performance-package-level-2 |title= 2018 MUSTANG GT PERFORMANCE PACKAGE VS PERFORMANCE PACKAGE LEVEL 2\n|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFeatures that remain available from the 2017 Ford Mustang include: the [[Ford Sync|SYNC 3]] infotainment system featuring [[Android Auto]] and [[Apple CarPlay]] compatibility, the SHAKER PRO premium audio system, the GT Performance Package, the Premium Plus Package, and the Wheel and Stripe Package.
