G. Chakrapani]] became members of a drama troupe to support their family. Influenced by Gandhian ideals, MGR joined the [[Indian National Congress]]. After a few years of acting in plays, he made his film debut in the 1936 film ''[[Sathi Leelavathi (1936 film)|Sathi Leelavathi]]'' in a supporting role. By the late 1940s, he graduated to the lead roles and for the next three decades dominated the Tamil film industry. He became a member of the [[C. N. Annadurai]]-led [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK party) and rapidly rose through its ranks, using his enormous popularity as a film star to build a large political base. In 1972, three years after Annadurai's death, he left the DMK, then led by [[Karunanidhi]], MGR's once friend and now rival, to form his own party\u2014the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK). Five years later, he steered an AIADMK-led alliance to victory in the [[1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1977 election]], routing the DMK in the process. He became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the first film actor to become a [[chief minister (India)|chief minister]] in India. Except for a six-month [[interregnum]] in 1980, when his government was [[President's rule|overthrown]] by the Union government, he remained as chief minister till his death in 1987, leading the AIADMK to two more electoral triumphs in [[1980 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1980]] and [[1984 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1984]].{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, a few peacock words without justification, excess dramatism such as once a friend now a foe|date=December 2016}}\n\nRamachandran's autobiography ''Naan Yaen Piranthaen'' (''Why I was Born'') was published in 2003 in two volumes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/janakis-son-alone-has-copyright-to-mgrs-autobiography-court/article3600414.ece |title=Janaki's son alone has copyright to MGR's autobiography: court |date=4 July 2012 |work=The Hindu |access-date=6 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210024121/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/janakis-son-alone-has-copyright-to-mgrs-autobiography-court/article3600414.ece |archive-date=10 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and background==\nM.G.R. was born in [[Kandy]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Attar Chand|title=M.G.

These further surfaced in 1983 when he had kidney problems. When Sinnappa Devar paid his first visit to see MGR at the hospital after the shooting incident he paid MGR an advance for MGR's next film. After getting released from the hospital and finishing ''Arasakattalai'', MGR acted in Devar's film ''Vivasaayee'' against doctors' advice. Due to the operation, MGR's speaking parts in the film ''Kaavalkaaran'' were reduced.

Consequently, MGR was expelled from the party. \n\nUpon his ouster from DMK, Ramachandran floated a new party which he called Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK), later renamed [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK), the only powerful opponent of the DMK. He mobilised between 1972 and 1977 to spread and preach his party ambition with films like ''Netru Indru Naalai'' (1974), ''Idhayakani'' (1975), ''Indru Pol Endrum Vazhga'' (1977), etc.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, the ouster from DMK especially needs a citation|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Continued success in TN Assembly elections===\n\n====1977 Assembly elections====\nThe [[AIADMK]] contested the 1977 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. The election was a four cornered contest between the ADMK, DMK, the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Janata Party. The ADMK allied itself with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), while INC(I) and Communist Party of India (CPI) contested as allies. The DMK and Janata Party (JNP) contested the elections alone. The ADMK did not field any candidate in the Usilampatti Constituency in support of the Forward Bloc leader P.K. Mookiah Thevar. Similarly, the ADMK also supported the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) candidate M. Abdul Latheef in the Vaniyambadi Constituency. In the parliamentary elections that occurred just three months prior to these elections, there had been two major alliances \u2013 the ADMK led ADMK-INC-CPI coalition and the DMK led DMK-NCO-JNP-CPM coalition. But in the months that followed the parliamentary election, these coalitions fell apart. The [[AIADMK]] alliance won the elections by winning 144 seats out of 234 and [[MGR]] became the [[Chief Minister]] of Tamil Nadu. Upon winning the 1977 state elections, MG Ramachandran became the [[Chief Minister]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] on 30 June 1977, remaining in office till his death in 1987. In 1979, members of his party [[Satyavani Muthu]] and [[Aravinda Bala Pajanor]] became the first non-Congress politicians from Tamil Nadu to be ministers in the [[Union Cabinet]]. The AIADMK won every state assembly election as long as MGR was alive. Although Anna Durai and Karunanidhi had acted in stage plays in trivial roles, in their younger days, before becoming chief minister, MGR was the first popular film actor to be a Chief Minister in India.\n\n====1980 Parliament and assembly elections====\nAnna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam allied with Indian National Congress (Indira) in the 1977 parliamentary election. However, when Janata Party won the election and Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister, M. G. Ramachandran extended unconditional support to the Janata party Government. He continued his support to the Charan Singh Government in 1979. After the fall of the Charan Singh government, fresh parliamentary elections were conducted in 1980. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam struck alliance with INC(I). ADMK and Janata Party alliance won only 2 seats in Tamil Nadu in that parliamentary election. INC(I) won the election and Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister.\nCongress-DMK victory in the 1980 parliamentary election emboldened their alliance and made them think that people lost their faith in M. G. Ramachandran government. DMK pressed the central government to dismiss the Tamil Nadu government using similar allegations used by MGR to dismiss DMK government in 1976. The ADMK ministry and the assembly were dismissed by the central government and fresh elections conducted in 1980.\nDespite their victory at the 1980 Lok Sabha polls, DMK and Indira Congress failed to win the legislative assembly election. ADMK won the election and its leader and incumbent Chief Minister, M. G. Ramachandran was sworn in as Chief Minister for the second time. He became the first leader since K. Kamaraj to win a re-election as Chief Minister.\n\n====1984 assembly elections====\nIndira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October 1984. During the same time, M. G. Ramachandran was diagnosed with kidney failure and admitted into a hospital in New York City. Rajiv Gandhi assumed office immediately and this required a fresh mandate from the people. Indian National Congress (Indira) and Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam formed an alliance and contested the election. M. G. Ramachandran was confined to the hospital. Video coverage of MGR recuperating in hospital along with Indira Gandhi's assassination were stitched together by the ADMK man in charge of campaigning, R. M. Veerappan. The video was distributed and played across all over Tamil Nadu. Rajiv Gandhi visited cyclone-hit areas in Tamil Nadu, which also boosted the alliance. The sympathy wave created by Indira's assassination, MGR's illness and Rajiv Gandhi's charisma helped the alliance sweep the election.[1][2] DMK leader M. Karunanidhi did not contest this election, due to the fact that the ADMK leader M.G.R was admitted to a hospital in the U.S. and Indira Gandhi being assassinated. It was a landslide victory for AIADMK-Congress combine which won 195 seats in assembly polls. The electoral victory proved the undying charisma of [[MGR]] upon the masses.\n\n===Achievements as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu===\n[[File:Hindustan_Ambassador_Mark_III_of_M.G._Ramachandran.jpg|thumb|right|M. G. Ramachandran's Ambassador Car with National flag]]\nOnce he became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, he placed great emphasis on social development, especially education. One of his most successful policies was the conversion of the \"[[Midday Meal Scheme]]\", introduced by the popular Congress Chief Minister and kingmaker [[K Kamaraj]], which already was encouraging underprivileged children to attend school, into \"MGR's Nutritious Meal Scheme\" in the government-run and -aided schools in Tamil Nadu by adding ''saththurundai''&nbsp;\u2013 a nutritious sugary flour dumpling. This scheme was at a cost of Rs. 1&nbsp;billion and was imposed in 1982. A little more than 120,000 children of the state were benefited. He also introduced Women's Special buses. He introduced a liquor ban in the state and preservation of old temples and historical monuments, ultimately increasing the state's tourist income. He set up a free school for the cinema technicians children in Kodambakkam called MGR Primary & Higher Secondary School which provided free mid-day meals in the 1950s. He led the ADMK to victory in the 1984 assembly elections, despite not taking part in the campaigning. At that time he was undergoing medical treatment in America and his images were broadcast in Tamil Nadu through cinema halls. This was an effective campaign tactic and ADMK won the elections claiming around 56% of assembly seats, indicating the depth of his popular support. He won his seat in a double landslide victory in 1984. He still holds the record of being the chief minister with the highest consistent longevity of more than a decade.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, a few peacock words without justification|date=December 2016}}\n\nKarunanidhi claimed on 1 April 2009 and again on 13 May 2012 that MGR was ready for the merger of his party with the DMK in 1979, with [[Biju Patnaik]] acting as the mediator. The plan failed, because [[Panruti S.

Economic data under his rule showed that annual growth and per capita income was lower than the national average and the state went from being second among 25 industrialised states in development after Kamaraj's rule to tenth. This decline, according to critics has been due to shift of government resources from power and irrigation to social and agriculture sector according to Madras Institute of Development Studies reported in 1988. In addition, the emphasis on \"welfare schemes\" such as free electricity to farmers, mid-day meal schemes, etc. has been seen by many as taking money away from infrastructure development that could have benefited the poor. In addition, the liquor tax imposed during his rule was considered to contribute to a regressive tax mostly affecting the poor.{{Citation needed|reason=more citation are needd for the claims in this paragraph, a few peacock words without justification|date=December 2016}}\n\nOther criticisms have been on MGR's centralised decision-making, which many blame for inefficiency and corruption taking hold of his administration. Some examples stated by the critics include Goondas act in 1982 and other acts that limited political criticism in the media, which led to a \"police state\" during his administration. While these criticisms have been in the minority, supporters of MGR counter that most of these problems were a result of the party members serving MGR rather than the leader himself. While he is not considered a divisive figure in the state, critics and supporters alike agree that his charisma and popularity trumped policy decisions that led to his eventual success during his tenure as chief minister.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lub.lu.se/index.php/st/article/view/2939|author=Ingrid Widlund|title=A Vote for MGR Transaction and Devotion in South Indian Politics|volume=96|issue=3|year=1993|journal=Statsvetenskaplig Tidskrifts|pages=225\u2013257|access-date=28 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228220416/http://journals.lub.lu.se/index.php/st/article/view/2939|archive-date=28 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Natwar Singh]] in his autobiography [[One Life is Not Enough]] alleges that M.G.R. covertly supported the cause of independent [[Tamil Eelam]] and financed the [[LTTE]] and their cadres were being given military training in Tamil Nadu.

Rajagopalachari]] and [[K. Kamaraj]]. The timing of the award was controversial, due to the fact that it was given so quickly after his death and he was elected as Chief Minister only 11 years before the award. Many opponents, mostly outside Tamil Nadu, criticised then ruling party [[Indian National Congress|INC]], under [[Rajiv Gandhi]] to have influenced the selection committee to give the award to help win the upcoming [[1989 Indian general election|1989 Lok Sabha election]].

G. Chakrapani]] became members of a drama troupe to support their family. Influenced by Gandhian ideals, MGR joined the [[Indian National Congress]]. After a few years of acting in plays, he made his film debut in the 1936 film ''[[Sathi Leelavathi (1936 film)|Sathi Leelavathi]]'' in a supporting role. By the late 1940s, he graduated to the lead roles and for the next three decades dominated the Tamil film industry. He became a member of the [[C. N. Annadurai]]-led [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK party) and rapidly rose through its ranks, using his enormous popularity as a film star to build a large political base. In 1972, three years after Annadurai's death, he left the DMK, then led by [[Karunanidhi]], MGR's once friend and now rival, to form his own party\u2014the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK). Five years later, he steered an AIADMK-led alliance to victory in the [[1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1977 election]], routing the DMK in the process. He became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the first film actor to become a [[chief minister (India)|chief minister]] in India. Except for a six-month [[interregnum]] in 1980, when his government was [[President's rule|overthrown]] by the Union government, he remained as chief minister till his death in 1987, leading the AIADMK to two more electoral triumphs in [[1980 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1980]] and [[1984 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1984]].{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, a few peacock words without justification, excess dramatism such as once a friend now a foe|date=December 2016}}\n\nRamachandran's autobiography ''Naan Yaen Piranthaen'' (''Why I was Born'') was published in 2003 in two volumes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/janakis-son-alone-has-copyright-to-mgrs-autobiography-court/article3600414.ece |title=Janaki's son alone has copyright to MGR's autobiography: court |date=4 July 2012 |work=The Hindu |access-date=6 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210024121/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/janakis-son-alone-has-copyright-to-mgrs-autobiography-court/article3600414.ece |archive-date=10 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and background==\nM.G.R. was born in [[Kandy]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Attar Chand|title=M.G.

He won twice the number of votes polled by his Congress rival and the largest vote polled by any candidate for the Assembly.<ref name=\"isbn0-415-39680-8\">{{cite book |author=Selvaraj Velayutham|title=Tamil cinema: the cultural politics of India's other film industry|publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-39680-6}}</ref>\n\n===Split from DMK and formation of AIADMK===\n\n[[File:ChennaiAIADMK 1762.JPG|thumb|left|Statue at AIADMK headquarters]]\nIn 1972, DMK leader Karunanidhi started to project his first son M.K. Muthu in a big way in film and politics, around the same time MGR was accusing that corruption had grown in the party after the demise of [[Annadurai]], and in a public meeting, asking for the financial details of the party to be publicised, thereby enraging the DMK leadership. Consequently, MGR was expelled from the party. \n\nUpon his ouster from DMK, Ramachandran floated a new party which he called Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK), later renamed [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK), the only powerful opponent of the DMK. He mobilised between 1972 and 1977 to spread and preach his party ambition with films like ''Netru Indru Naalai'' (1974), ''Idhayakani'' (1975), ''Indru Pol Endrum Vazhga'' (1977), etc.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, the ouster from DMK especially needs a citation|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Continued success in TN Assembly elections===\n\n====1977 Assembly elections====\nThe [[AIADMK]] contested the 1977 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. The election was a four cornered contest between the ADMK, DMK, the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Janata Party. The ADMK allied itself with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), while INC(I) and Communist Party of India (CPI) contested as allies. The DMK and Janata Party (JNP) contested the elections alone. The ADMK did not field any candidate in the Usilampatti Constituency in support of the Forward Bloc leader P.K. Mookiah Thevar. Similarly, the ADMK also supported the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) candidate M. Abdul Latheef in the Vaniyambadi Constituency. In the parliamentary elections that occurred just three months prior to these elections, there had been two major alliances \u2013 the ADMK led ADMK-INC-CPI coalition and the DMK led DMK-NCO-JNP-CPM coalition. But in the months that followed the parliamentary election, these coalitions fell apart. The [[AIADMK]] alliance won the elections by winning 144 seats out of 234 and [[MGR]] became the [[Chief Minister]] of Tamil Nadu. Upon winning the 1977 state elections, MG Ramachandran became the [[Chief Minister]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] on 30 June 1977, remaining in office till his death in 1987. In 1979, members of his party [[Satyavani Muthu]] and [[Aravinda Bala Pajanor]] became the first non-Congress politicians from Tamil Nadu to be ministers in the [[Union Cabinet]]. The AIADMK won every state assembly election as long as MGR was alive. Although Anna Durai and Karunanidhi had acted in stage plays in trivial roles, in their younger days, before becoming chief minister, MGR was the first popular film actor to be a Chief Minister in India.\n\n====1980 Parliament and assembly elections====\nAnna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam allied with Indian National Congress (Indira) in the 1977 parliamentary election. However, when Janata Party won the election and Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister, M. G. Ramachandran extended unconditional support to the Janata party Government. He continued his support to the Charan Singh Government in 1979. After the fall of the Charan Singh government, fresh parliamentary elections were conducted in 1980. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam struck alliance with INC(I). ADMK and Janata Party alliance won only 2 seats in Tamil Nadu in that parliamentary election. INC(I) won the election and Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister.\nCongress-DMK victory in the 1980 parliamentary election emboldened their alliance and made them think that people lost their faith in M. G. Ramachandran government. DMK pressed the central government to dismiss the Tamil Nadu government using similar allegations used by MGR to dismiss DMK government in 1976. The ADMK ministry and the assembly were dismissed by the central government and fresh elections conducted in 1980.\nDespite their victory at the 1980 Lok Sabha polls, DMK and Indira Congress failed to win the legislative assembly election. ADMK won the election and its leader and incumbent Chief Minister, M. G. Ramachandran was sworn in as Chief Minister for the second time. He became the first leader since K. Kamaraj to win a re-election as Chief Minister.\n\n====1984 assembly elections====\nIndira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October 1984. During the same time, M. G. Ramachandran was diagnosed with kidney failure and admitted into a hospital in New York City. Rajiv Gandhi assumed office immediately and this required a fresh mandate from the people. Indian National Congress (Indira) and Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam formed an alliance and contested the election. M. G. Ramachandran was confined to the hospital. Video coverage of MGR recuperating in hospital along with Indira Gandhi's assassination were stitched together by the ADMK man in charge of campaigning, R. M. Veerappan. The video was distributed and played across all over Tamil Nadu. Rajiv Gandhi visited cyclone-hit areas in Tamil Nadu, which also boosted the alliance. The sympathy wave created by Indira's assassination, MGR's illness and Rajiv Gandhi's charisma helped the alliance sweep the election.[1][2] DMK leader M. Karunanidhi did not contest this election, due to the fact that the ADMK leader M.G.R was admitted to a hospital in the U.S. and Indira Gandhi being assassinated. It was a landslide victory for AIADMK-Congress combine which won 195 seats in assembly polls. The electoral victory proved the undying charisma of [[MGR]] upon the masses.\n\n===Achievements as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu===\n[[File:Hindustan_Ambassador_Mark_III_of_M.G._Ramachandran.jpg|thumb|right|M. G. Ramachandran's Ambassador Car with National flag]]\nOnce he became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, he placed great emphasis on social development, especially education. One of his most successful policies was the conversion of the \"[[Midday Meal Scheme]]\", introduced by the popular Congress Chief Minister and kingmaker [[K Kamaraj]], which already was encouraging underprivileged children to attend school, into \"MGR's Nutritious Meal Scheme\" in the government-run and -aided schools in Tamil Nadu by adding ''saththurundai''&nbsp;\u2013 a nutritious sugary flour dumpling. This scheme was at a cost of Rs. 1&nbsp;billion and was imposed in 1982. A little more than 120,000 children of the state were benefited. He also introduced Women's Special buses. He introduced a liquor ban in the state and preservation of old temples and historical monuments, ultimately increasing the state's tourist income. He set up a free school for the cinema technicians children in Kodambakkam called MGR Primary & Higher Secondary School which provided free mid-day meals in the 1950s. He led the ADMK to victory in the 1984 assembly elections, despite not taking part in the campaigning. At that time he was undergoing medical treatment in America and his images were broadcast in Tamil Nadu through cinema halls. This was an effective campaign tactic and ADMK won the elections claiming around 56% of assembly seats, indicating the depth of his popular support. He won his seat in a double landslide victory in 1984. He still holds the record of being the chief minister with the highest consistent longevity of more than a decade.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, a few peacock words without justification|date=December 2016}}\n\nKarunanidhi claimed on 1 April 2009 and again on 13 May 2012 that MGR was ready for the merger of his party with the DMK in 1979, with [[Biju Patnaik]] acting as the mediator. The plan failed, because [[Panruti S.

Economic data under his rule showed that annual growth and per capita income was lower than the national average and the state went from being second among 25 industrialised states in development after Kamaraj's rule to tenth. This decline, according to critics has been due to shift of government resources from power and irrigation to social and agriculture sector according to Madras Institute of Development Studies reported in 1988. In addition, the emphasis on \"welfare schemes\" such as free electricity to farmers, mid-day meal schemes, etc. has been seen by many as taking money away from infrastructure development that could have benefited the poor. In addition, the liquor tax imposed during his rule was considered to contribute to a regressive tax mostly affecting the poor.{{Citation needed|reason=more citation are needd for the claims in this paragraph, a few peacock words without justification|date=December 2016}}\n\nOther criticisms have been on MGR's centralised decision-making, which many blame for inefficiency and corruption taking hold of his administration. Some examples stated by the critics include Goondas act in 1982 and other acts that limited political criticism in the media, which led to a \"police state\" during his administration. While these criticisms have been in the minority, supporters of MGR counter that most of these problems were a result of the party members serving MGR rather than the leader himself. While he is not considered a divisive figure in the state, critics and supporters alike agree that his charisma and popularity trumped policy decisions that led to his eventual success during his tenure as chief minister.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lub.lu.se/index.php/st/article/view/2939|author=Ingrid Widlund|title=A Vote for MGR Transaction and Devotion in South Indian Politics|volume=96|issue=3|year=1993|journal=Statsvetenskaplig Tidskrifts|pages=225\u2013257|access-date=28 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228220416/http://journals.lub.lu.se/index.php/st/article/view/2939|archive-date=28 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Natwar Singh]] in his autobiography [[One Life is Not Enough]] alleges that M.G.R. covertly supported the cause of independent [[Tamil Eelam]] and financed the [[LTTE]] and their cadres were being given military training in Tamil Nadu.

The timing of the award was controversial, due to the fact that it was given so quickly after his death and he was elected as Chief Minister only 11 years before the award.

[[National Library of New Zealand|Alexander Turnbull Library]], [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].]]\n[[Australia]] has over 160 grape varieties distrbuted on 146,244 hectares (ha) across all six states, [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] (see [[Australian wine]]). These activities are concentrated in the southern part of the continent and only where the ''[[terroir]]'' - that is, [[Soil|soil types]], [[Microclimate|local climate]], [[Irrigation|availability of irrigation]] and so on - is suited to viticulture.<ref>Jones, Gregory. \"Climate, Grapes, and Wine: Terroir and the Importance of Climate to Winegrape Production.\" GuildSomm, 12 August 2015.[https://www.guildsomm.com/public_content/features/articles/b/gregory_jones/posts/climate-grapes-and-wine] Accessed 20 March 2020.</ref>\n\nTogether, the three sectors of the industry, [[Viticulture|grape growing]], [[winemaking]] and [[Enotourism|wine tourism]], play a major role in Australia's economy. In the 2018-2019 financial year, they contributed AU$45.5 billion to the national income.<ref name=MarketBulletin178>Wine Australia. \"Australian wine sector\u2019s contribution to the Australian economy grows to $45.5 billion.\" ''Market Bulletin'', Issue 178, Wine Australia, 2019.[https://www.wineaustralia.com/news/market-bulletin/issue-178] Accessed 18 March 2020.</ref> In addition, many other businesses benefit from the services they provide to the wine industry.<ref>This was summarised in a 1995 report to the Australian government which said: <blockquote>\"Some cater exclusively for grapegrowers or wineries (eg harvesting contractors, bottling companies and fermentation equipment suppliers), but many also supply other industries in the region (although the wine industry may be their major customer). Included in this latter category are: transport companies; metal fabricators (eg manufacturers of stainless steel tanks); manufacturers of viticultural machinery; label manufacturers; suppliers of fertilisers and chemicals; consultants specialising in viticulture services; accounting and legal firms; and suppliers of packaging materials.\" (''Winegrape and Wine Industry in Australia: A Report by the Committee of Inquiry into the Winegrape and Wine Industry'', June 1995. pp. 72-73.[https://www.pc.gov.au/research/supporting/wine-grape/winegrap.pdf] Accessed 7 April 2020.)</blockquote></ref>\n\n==Wine grape varieties overview==\nAs of 2018<ref>Karlsson, Britt. \"Australia\u2019s most popular grape varieties.\" Edited by Britt and Per Karlsson.

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels. These include [[Arneis]], [[Barbera]], [[Durif]], [[Fiano (grape)|Fiano]], [[Gamay|Gamay Noir \u00e0 Jus Blanc]]<ref>In Robinson's essay on the worldwide use of this variety, she says, \"And then there is the remarkable Sorrenberg of Beechworth in north-east Victoria, Australia which make one of the most exciting Gamays I have ever tasted.\" (See Robinson, Jancis. \"Gamay.\" ''Grape Varieties.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/grape-varieties/red/gamay] Accessed 3 April 2020.</ref> [[Gr\u00fcner Veltliner]], [[Lagrein]], [[Nebbiolo]], [[Sangiovese]], [[Saperavi]] [[Tannat]], [[Tempranillo]], [[Vermentino]] and so on, all of which are dealt with below. \n\nAccording to Jancis Robinson, \"This is an exciting time for Australian viticulture.\"<ref>Robinson, Jancis. ''Vines, Grapes & Wines: A wine drinker's guide to grape varieties.'' Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product. As a result, the column headed \"Location - Growers and Makers\" contains both.\n\n==Government rules and regulations==\nThe wine industry operates under the ''Wine Australia Act 2013''<ref name=WineAct>''Wine Australia Act 2013.''

(See Tischelmayer, \"Traminer\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/traminer], \"Gew\u00fcrtztraminer\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/gewurztraminer] and \"Savagnin Rose.\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/savagnin-rose] \n\nRobinson teases this out further in a chapter entitled \"Savagnin\" where she says:<blockquote>\u201cToday Savagnin shows a considerable level of clonal diversity, seen in berry colour, aroma, leaf shape, cluster size and so on. Several of these forms have often been mistakenly considered to be distinct varieties, eg Gew\u00fcrztraminer in Alsace and Germany; Heida or Pa\u00efen in Switzerland; Traminer or Traminer Weisser in Germany; Traminer Aromatico in Trentino-Alto Adige in Italy. Yet DNA profiling has shown that they all have the same genetic fingerprint, with the exception of some minor clonal genetic differences, and that they all correspond to the same variety (Regner et al. 2000a; Imazio et al. 2002). It is consequently misleading to talk about a \u2018Savagnin family\u2019 or a \u2018Traminer family\u2019 because this suggests family ties such as parent\u2013offspring, uncle\u2013nephew, cousins.</blockquote><blockquote>\u201cFor that reason, the most significant clonal mutations of this variety will be discussed as subsections within this Savagnin entry: the white-yellow-berried Savagnin Blanc, the pink-berried Savagnin Rose and the pink-berried, aromatic Gew\u00fcrztraminer, in chronological order of appearance in the literature. Even though the historical references to Traminer are earlier than those to Savagnin, the latter is used here as the prime name because it is less misleading in terms of the variety\u2019s origin.\u201d (See Robinson ''et al.'' \"Savagnin.\" ''Wine Grapes'', pp. 2403-2404.)</blockquote>\n\nRobinson's next chapter is entitled \"Savagnin Blanc\" where she makes the introductory remark, \u201cFull-bodied, firm, ageworthy wines, sometimes called Traminer.\u201d (See Robinson ''et al.'' \"Savagnin.\" ''Wine Grapes'', p. 2408.)\n\nRegardless of this well-based argument from Robinson, in this chart Savagnin Blanc and Traminer have been given separate entries as a reflection of the usage of both names in Australia.</ref><ref name=Albari\u00f1oError /><ref>Mercer, Chris. \"What is Savagnin?

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels.

''Vines, Grapes & Wines: A wine drinker's guide to grape varieties.'' Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product. As a result, the column headed \"Location - Growers and Makers\" contains both.\n\n==Government rules and regulations==\nThe wine industry operates under the ''Wine Australia Act 2013''<ref name=WineAct>''Wine Australia Act 2013.''

(See Tischelmayer, \"Traminer\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/traminer], \"Gew\u00fcrtztraminer\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/gewurztraminer] and \"Savagnin Rose.\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/savagnin-rose] \n\nRobinson teases this out further in a chapter entitled \"Savagnin\" where she says:<blockquote>\u201cToday Savagnin shows a considerable level of clonal diversity, seen in berry colour, aroma, leaf shape, cluster size and so on. Several of these forms have often been mistakenly considered to be distinct varieties, eg Gew\u00fcrztraminer in Alsace and Germany; Heida or Pa\u00efen in Switzerland; Traminer or Traminer Weisser in Germany; Traminer Aromatico in Trentino-Alto Adige in Italy. Yet DNA profiling has shown that they all have the same genetic fingerprint, with the exception of some minor clonal genetic differences, and that they all correspond to the same variety (Regner et al. 2000a; Imazio et al. 2002). It is consequently misleading to talk about a \u2018Savagnin family\u2019 or a \u2018Traminer family\u2019 because this suggests family ties such as parent\u2013offspring, uncle\u2013nephew, cousins.</blockquote><blockquote>\u201cFor that reason, the most significant clonal mutations of this variety will be discussed as subsections within this Savagnin entry: the white-yellow-berried Savagnin Blanc, the pink-berried Savagnin Rose and the pink-berried, aromatic Gew\u00fcrztraminer, in chronological order of appearance in the literature.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

However, as discussed above, this contract must be done in writing where it involves the transfer of ownership under the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995. \n\n'''Conditional Offers''' \n\nA Buyer will often include conditions that have to be met in his offer in the missives. In residential property, this is usually done by incorporating the '''Scottish Standard Clauses''' (see below) into the offer, which includes such conditions such as having sight of reports on the property or the inclusion of any moveable property (such as [[white goods]]) in the sale of the property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawscot.org.uk/members/rules-and-guidance/rules-and-guidance/section-f/division-c/advice-and-information/scottish-standard-clauses/|title=Scottish Standard Clauses|website=Law Society of Scotland|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> \n\n'''Qualified Acceptance''' \n\nA Seller of property can accept the Buyer's offer to buy outright as a ''de plano'' acceptance. However, it is usually common practice to ''qualify'' an acceptance by the making of further conditions. Where a seller makes a qualified acceptance, Scots law treats this as new offer, ''an offer to sell,'' which the Buyer must then accept ''de plano'' or issue a new ''offer to buy'' with further or amended conditions; the offer to buy is effectively 'destroyed' by the qualified acceptance or offer to sell and cannot be relied upon by the Seller.<ref>''Wolf and Wolf v Forfar Potato Co'' ''1984 SLT 10''</ref> This creates a 'ping pong' effect of a series of offers to sell/offers to purchase between the two parties, also termed missives, with no formally agreed contract until one party accepts the other's offer ''de plano.'' The final offer and ''de plano'' acceptance letters form the the contract of sale in Scots law, hence the contract being called the missives (ie: letters) of sale''.'' \n\n'''Time Limits''' \n\nIt is possible to qualify an offer to buy/qualified acceptance with a time limits for acceptance where wording is clearly used for the other party to identify the deadline.<ref>''Littlejohn v Hadwen'' ''(1882) 20 SLR 5''; Bell ''Principles'' s 73; ''Gloag'' p 35; W W McBryde ''The Law of Contract in Scotland'' (3rd edn, 2007) para 6-57</ref> However, a new counter-offer made within the time limit will 'destroy' the qualified acceptance time limit.  Where no time limit is made, the offer or counter-offer will cease for acceptance after the passage of a reasonable time.<ref>''Thomson v James'' ''(1855) 18 D 1'' at 10; Stair ''Institutions'' I,3,9.</ref> \n\n=== '''The Postal Rule'''  ===\nWhen a party accepts the other parties' offer to purchase/offer to sell ''de plano'', it is effective to create a binding contract from the moment it is posted or sent to a document exchange irretrievably (such as [[DX Group|DX]]) '''not''' when it is received by the other party. This is due to the application of the doctrine known as the [[Posting rule|Postal Acceptance Rule]] in Scots law.<ref>''Thomson v James'' ''(1855) 18 D 1''; ''Henthorn v Fraser'' ''[1892] 2 Ch 27''.</ref> \n\n==== '''Abolition of the Postal Acceptance Rule''' ====\nIt should be noted that the [[Scottish Law Commission]] has published a report in 2018 (''Report on Review of Contract Law: Formation, Interpretation, Remedies for Breach, and Penalty Clauses, SLC Report 252)'' recommending the abolition of the postal acceptance rule and its replacement with a new statutory regime, available to view in its draft form on the Scottish Law Commission website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/reports/2010-present/|title=Scottish Law Commission :: Reports :: 2010 - present|website=www.scotlawcom.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether this draft bill accompanying the report will be introduced into the Scottish Parliament.<ref>Response from the [[Scottish Government]] Minister for Community Safety, Ash Denham MSP to the 2018 Report.

The principle of ''consensus ad idem'' in Scots law is taken to mean that parties must both agree to contract as a state of mind, they cannot be held to a contract they did not intend to be part of. In ''MacMillan v Caldwell,''<ref>''1990 SC 389, 1991 SCLR 73, 1991 SLT 325, OH''. NB: This is an Outer House judgment and may be overruled by a subsequent new case in the Inner House or United Kingdom Supreme Court. </ref>  Lord Kirkwood held that once one of the parties indicated he was no longer prepared to contract, the other party can create the contract by accepting ''de plano'' an existing offer.<ref>''1990 SC 38''</ref> However, the onus will be on the party who made the offer to prove that timeous notice of withdrawal of the offer was communicated to the other party's agent before any valid acceptance ''de plano'' is made.<ref>''1990 SC 389''</ref> It is not possible in Scots law for a party to withdraw their own qualifications to an offer once these qualifications have been received by the other party, and then to send a new ''de plano'' acceptance to the other party's offer in an attempt to create a valid contract which could not have been concluded previously.<ref>''Rutterford Ltd v Allied Breweries Ltd'' ''1990 SCLR 186, 1990 SLT 249, OH''.</ref> \n\n== Residential Property ==\nIn cases of residential property (typically, but not limited to, houses/flats with adjacent land), the Seller will place the property for sale on the market through an estate agent of solicitor firm.\n\n=== '''Home Report''' ===\nDepending on the nature of the residential property, the Seller typically must obtain a home report (including a questionnaire and [[Home survey|survey report]]) when placing the property on the market,<ref>Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 s.98; The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008.</ref> excluding:<ref>See The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008.</ref>\n\n* Property for sale as part of a portfolio.\n* Seasonal and holiday accommodation.\n* Property for sale alongside or ancillary to non-residential property.\n* Property used for both residential and non-residential use\n* Property which is unoccupied and unsafe for occupation\n* Property which has not been previously used as a house before.\n\n=== Missives Process in Residential Property Transactions ===\nThe Buyer will act through a solicitor and, if they wish to purchase the property, will submit a formal written offer through their solicitor to the Seller's agents to purchase the residential property.  All prospective buyers will typically submit an offer outlining the purchase price and any conditions to be complied with by the Seller, such as the Buyer having sight of reports on the property or the inclusion of any moveable property (such as [[white goods]]) in the sale of the property. Only any moveable property that has acceeded to the heritable property will be included in the transfer automatically. Prior to any ''closing date'', the date on which the Seller decides to stop receiving offers, the buyers will submit offers to purchase the corporeal heritable property. The Seller will then review the offers made by the prospective buyers and choose a preferred buyer and will respond to this preferred buyer's offer. This response, called the acceptance, may accept the offer outright, known as a ''simple'' or ''de plano acceptance,'' resulting in a binding contract between the parties in Scots law. \n\n=== The Scottish Standard Clauses ===\nBecause of the individualistic nature of offers of sale/offers to purchase, the system of missives in residential property became liable to complexity. Over time, standard styles (templates) became used in localities and across Sheriffdoms in an effort to simplify the missives stage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sinclair, Euan,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1100869226|title=Conveyancing practice in Scotland.|isbn=978-1-78043-943-3|edition=Seventh edition.|location=London|oclc=1100869226}}</ref> The Law Society of Scotland's Property Committee has built on this work which culminated with the publication of the '''Scottish Standard Clauses'''.

The Scottish Standard Clauses are registered as a public document in the Books of Council and Session for all solicitors in Scotland to incorporate them into the missives of sale to simplify the process. However there is nothing to preclude a solicitor from using their own drafting in the missives of sale of property.\n\n== Commercial Property Missives of Sale ==\nCommercial Property transactions may involve planning permissions and other legal requirements under planning law prior to the usage of land as a commercial property. As such, the missives of commercial property may have numerous conditions and complex terms, leading to a large amount of contractual negotiations. The Property Standardisation Group was formed by four law firms, [[CMS (law firm)|CMS]] (formerly known as [[Dundas & Wilson]]), [[Dentons]] (formerly known as [[Maclay Murray & Spens]]), [[Pinsent Masons]] (formerly known as [[McGrigors]]), and [[Shepherd and Wedderburn]] in 2001 in a combined effort to produce common agreed styles (templates) for transactions of commercial heritable property in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psglegal.co.uk/|title=The Property Standardisation Group|website=www.psglegal.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> These templates are available to view on the Property Standardisation Group website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psglegal.co.uk/|title=The Property Standardisation Group|website=www.psglegal.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nCommercial transactions usually operate by the sharing of a draft agreement between the parties agents, now commonly done online on secure [[Cloud computing|cloud softwares]] where both parties' agents can amend the document or by e-mail exchange of draft documents between agents, until the agreement of a draft missives of sale.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, ''Conveyancing (2nd reissue),'' Chapter 2, para 8. </ref> The parties, or their authorised agents, can then formally sign and bind the parties to the contract in line with the the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/contents Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995]. \n\n== Property Sold at Auction (Roup) ==\nHeritable property may also be sold at an auction, called a ''roup'' in Scots law. The Seller prepares a standard contract that is exhibited to the bidders in advance of the auction.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property'', Ch.4, ''Corporeal Heritable Property'', para 641.</ref> The winning bidder at the roup, signs a ''minute of enactment and preference'' to bind himself to the pre-prepared contract and becomes the Buyer.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property'', Ch.4, ''Corporeal Heritable Property'', para 641.</ref>\n\n== Conclusion of Missives ==\nOnce the parties contractual negotiations have concluded, a contract will be validly created where, as discussed above, a party makes a simple acceptance to another party's offer, which can incorporate acceptance to any previous qualified acceptances/offers conditions made. This is known as the \"conclusion of missives\" and ends the contractual stage of the [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Voluntary Transfer|voluntary transfer of land]]. The conclusion of missives typically takes a few weeks due to the due diligence process that each party must undertake before the creation of a legally binding agreement.<ref>Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, ''Conveyancing (2nd reissue)'', Ch 2, ''Missives and Other Obligations,'' para 9. </ref> However, it should be noted that the parties only have a personal right '''at the point the missives conclude''', there is no enforceable right against the Buyer or Seller until then.  Following the conclusion of missives, the Buyer will only have a personal right against the Seller '''not''' a [[Scots property law#Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law|real right (right in rem)]]. \n\nOnce the missives have concluded, the parties in a voluntary transfer of land can move to the registration stage. After conclusion, the missives, as an enforceable contract, may only be revoked  by written discharge of the two parties.<ref>''Inglis v Lowrie'' ''1990 SLT (Sh Ct) 60''</ref> Should the parties wish to amend rather than discharge the missives and enter into a new contract, they may apply to the [[Sheriff court|Sheriff Court]] or [[Court of Session]] for a rectification order under [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/73/contents Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985] section 8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/73/contents/data.htm|title=Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory Personal Bar ==\nA statutory personal bar exists in Scots law in relation to written contracts, similar to the concept of ''[[Estoppel|esoppel]]'' in other jurisdictions. This protection allows an otherwise invalid contract to be held valid and enforceable where parties have acted in reliance of the contract with material (financial or otherwise) consequences. Under the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/3 Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995,] section 1(3) and 1(4) provides that: <blockquote>\"'''Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995''' \n\n'''Section 1(3)'''\n\nWhere a contract, obligation or trust mentioned in subsection (2)(a) [''list of situations where writings are required''l] above is not constituted in a document complying with section 2 [written document] or, as the case may be, section 9B [''electronic documents''] of this Act, <u>but one of the parties to the contract</u>, a creditor in the obligation or a beneficiary under the trust (\u201cthe first person\u201d) has <u>acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contrac</u>t, obligation or trust <u>with the knowledge</u> and <u>acquiescence</u> of the other party to the contract, the <u>debtor</u> in the obligation or the truster (\u201cthe second person\u201d)\u2014\n(a)the second person shall <u>not be entitled to withdraw from the contrac</u>t, obligation or trust; and\n\n(b)the contract, obligation or trust <u>shall not be regarded as invalid</u>,\n\non the ground that it is not so constituted, if the condition set out in subsection (4) below is satisfied.\n\n'''Section 1(4)'''\n\n(4)The condition referred to in '''subsection (3)''' above is that the position of the <u>first person</u>\u2014\n\n(a)as a <u>result of acting or refraining from acting</u> as mentioned in that subsection <u>has been affected</u> to a <u>material exten</u>t; and\n\n(b)as a <u>result of such a withdrawal</u> as is mentioned in that subsection <u>would be adversely affected</u> to a <u>material extent</u>.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/1/data.htm|title=Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>[''brackets and <u>underlines</u> added]'' </blockquote>This means where the missives of sale were not created in compliance to the 1995 Act, such as by informal writings or oral agreement, can still be enforceable against a person where the the other party has: \n\n# '''Has acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contract,''' (eg: s''econd party is the seller who has made an offer to purchase a house because he believed his house to be sold,  the second party is the buyer who has made arrangements to leave her current property'') \n# '''the second person knew of the party's actions,''' (eg: ''the second person (Buyer) was told that the person (Seller) was going to purchase another house, the second person (Buyer) told the person (Seller) that she was going to make arrangements to leave property)'' \n# '''The second person acquiesced to this acting or refraining from acting,''' (eg: ''the second person (Buyer) did not object to the Seller making a purchase another house, the second person (Seller) did not object to the Buyer quitting her current property and ceasing searching for another property)'' \n# '''as a result of the acting or refraining from acting, the first person has been affected to a <u>material</u> extent.''' (eg: ''the first person (Seller) has now entered into a contract of sale, the first person (Buyer) has incurred cancellation costs and other fees)'' \n\nThe first party then has to prove that if the second party does withdraw from the invalid contract, the first party would be '''<u>adversely affected</u>''' to a material extent.

This electronic document must be <u>authenticated</u> by the party sending it (ie: the Buyer/Seller) and meet any requirements made by the Scottish Ministers, the legal name for the [[Scottish Government]].<ref>Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 s.9B(1(a)).</ref> Authenticated means:<blockquote>'''\"Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 Section 9B'''\n\n(2) \u00a0An electronic document is authenticated by a person if the electronic signature of that person\u2014\n\n(a) \u00a0is i<u>ncorporated into</u>, or <u>logically associated</u> with, the electronic document,\n\n(b) \u00a0was <u>created by the person by whom it purports to have been created</u>, and\n\n(c) \u00a0is of such type, and <u>satisfies such requirements</u> (if any), as may be prescribed by the <u>Scottish Ministers in regulations</u>.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/contents/data.htm|title=Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref></blockquote>The Scottish Government has introduced regulations for electronic documents under the Electronic Documents (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (SSI 2014/83).

However, as discussed above, this contract must be done in writing where it involves the transfer of ownership under the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995. \n\n'''Conditional Offers''' \n\nA Buyer will often include conditions that have to be met in his offer in the missives. In residential property, this is usually done by incorporating the '''Scottish Standard Clauses''' (see below) into the offer, which includes such conditions such as having sight of reports on the property or the inclusion of any moveable property (such as [[white goods]]) in the sale of the property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawscot.org.uk/members/rules-and-guidance/rules-and-guidance/section-f/division-c/advice-and-information/scottish-standard-clauses/|title=Scottish Standard Clauses|website=Law Society of Scotland|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> \n\n'''Qualified Acceptance''' \n\nA Seller of property can accept the Buyer's offer to buy outright as a ''de plano'' acceptance. However, it is usually common practice to ''qualify'' an acceptance by the making of further conditions. Where a seller makes a qualified acceptance, Scots law treats this as new offer, ''an offer to sell,'' which the Buyer must then accept ''de plano'' or issue a new ''offer to buy'' with further or amended conditions; the offer to buy is effectively 'destroyed' by the qualified acceptance or offer to sell and cannot be relied upon by the Seller.<ref>''Wolf and Wolf v Forfar Potato Co'' ''1984 SLT 10''</ref> This creates a 'ping pong' effect of a series of offers to sell/offers to purchase between the two parties, also termed missives, with no formally agreed contract until one party accepts the other's offer ''de plano.'' The final offer and ''de plano'' acceptance letters form the the contract of sale in Scots law, hence the contract being called the missives (ie: letters) of sale''.'' \n\n'''Time Limits''' \n\nIt is possible to qualify an offer to buy/qualified acceptance with a time limits for acceptance where wording is clearly used for the other party to identify the deadline.<ref>''Littlejohn v Hadwen'' ''(1882) 20 SLR 5''; Bell ''Principles'' s 73; ''Gloag'' p 35; W W McBryde ''The Law of Contract in Scotland'' (3rd edn, 2007) para 6-57</ref> However, a new counter-offer made within the time limit will 'destroy' the qualified acceptance time limit.  Where no time limit is made, the offer or counter-offer will cease for acceptance after the passage of a reasonable time.<ref>''Thomson v James'' ''(1855) 18 D 1'' at 10; Stair ''Institutions'' I,3,9.</ref> \n\n=== '''The Postal Rule'''  ===\nWhen a party accepts the other parties' offer to purchase/offer to sell ''de plano'', it is effective to create a binding contract from the moment it is posted or sent to a document exchange irretrievably (such as [[DX Group|DX]]) '''not''' when it is received by the other party. This is due to the application of the doctrine known as the [[Posting rule|Postal Acceptance Rule]] in Scots law.<ref>''Thomson v James'' ''(1855) 18 D 1''; ''Henthorn v Fraser'' ''[1892] 2 Ch 27''.</ref> \n\n==== '''Abolition of the Postal Acceptance Rule''' ====\nIt should be noted that the [[Scottish Law Commission]] has published a report in 2018 (''Report on Review of Contract Law: Formation, Interpretation, Remedies for Breach, and Penalty Clauses, SLC Report 252)'' recommending the abolition of the postal acceptance rule and its replacement with a new statutory regime, available to view in its draft form on the Scottish Law Commission website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/reports/2010-present/|title=Scottish Law Commission :: Reports :: 2010 - present|website=www.scotlawcom.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether this draft bill accompanying the report will be introduced into the Scottish Parliament.<ref>Response from the [[Scottish Government]] Minister for Community Safety, Ash Denham MSP to the 2018 Report.

The principle of ''consensus ad idem'' in Scots law is taken to mean that parties must both agree to contract as a state of mind, they cannot be held to a contract they did not intend to be part of. In ''MacMillan v Caldwell,''<ref>''1990 SC 389, 1991 SCLR 73, 1991 SLT 325, OH''. NB: This is an Outer House judgment and may be overruled by a subsequent new case in the Inner House or United Kingdom Supreme Court. </ref>  Lord Kirkwood held that once one of the parties indicated he was no longer prepared to contract, the other party can create the contract by accepting ''de plano'' an existing offer.<ref>''1990 SC 38''</ref> However, the onus will be on the party who made the offer to prove that timeous notice of withdrawal of the offer was communicated to the other party's agent before any valid acceptance ''de plano'' is made.<ref>''1990 SC 389''</ref> It is not possible in Scots law for a party to withdraw their own qualifications to an offer once these qualifications have been received by the other party, and then to send a new ''de plano'' acceptance to the other party's offer in an attempt to create a valid contract which could not have been concluded previously.<ref>''Rutterford Ltd v Allied Breweries Ltd'' ''1990 SCLR 186, 1990 SLT 249, OH''.</ref> \n\n== Residential Property ==\nIn cases of residential property (typically, but not limited to, houses/flats with adjacent land), the Seller will place the property for sale on the market through an estate agent of solicitor firm.\n\n=== '''Home Report''' ===\nDepending on the nature of the residential property, the Seller typically must obtain a home report (including a questionnaire and [[Home survey|survey report]]) when placing the property on the market,<ref>Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 s.98; The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008.</ref> excluding:<ref>See The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008.</ref>\n\n* Property for sale as part of a portfolio.\n* Seasonal and holiday accommodation.\n* Property for sale alongside or ancillary to non-residential property.\n* Property used for both residential and non-residential use\n* Property which is unoccupied and unsafe for occupation\n* Property which has not been previously used as a house before.\n\n=== Missives Process in Residential Property Transactions ===\nThe Buyer will act through a solicitor and, if they wish to purchase the property, will submit a formal written offer through their solicitor to the Seller's agents to purchase the residential property.  All prospective buyers will typically submit an offer outlining the purchase price and any conditions to be complied with by the Seller, such as the Buyer having sight of reports on the property or the inclusion of any moveable property (such as [[white goods]]) in the sale of the property. Only any moveable property that has acceeded to the heritable property will be included in the transfer automatically. Prior to any ''closing date'', the date on which the Seller decides to stop receiving offers, the buyers will submit offers to purchase the corporeal heritable property. The Seller will then review the offers made by the prospective buyers and choose a preferred buyer and will respond to this preferred buyer's offer. This response, called the acceptance, may accept the offer outright, known as a ''simple'' or ''de plano acceptance,'' resulting in a binding contract between the parties in Scots law. \n\n=== The Scottish Standard Clauses ===\nBecause of the individualistic nature of offers of sale/offers to purchase, the system of missives in residential property became liable to complexity. Over time, standard styles (templates) became used in localities and across Sheriffdoms in an effort to simplify the missives stage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sinclair, Euan,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1100869226|title=Conveyancing practice in Scotland.|isbn=978-1-78043-943-3|edition=Seventh edition.|location=London|oclc=1100869226}}</ref> The Law Society of Scotland's Property Committee has built on this work which culminated with the publication of the '''Scottish Standard Clauses'''.

The Scottish Standard Clauses are registered as a public document in the Books of Council and Session for all solicitors in Scotland to incorporate them into the missives of sale to simplify the process. However there is nothing to preclude a solicitor from using their own drafting in the missives of sale of property.\n\n== Commercial Property Missives of Sale ==\nCommercial Property transactions may involve planning permissions and other legal requirements under planning law prior to the usage of land as a commercial property. As such, the missives of commercial property may have numerous conditions and complex terms, leading to a large amount of contractual negotiations. The Property Standardisation Group was formed by four law firms, [[CMS (law firm)|CMS]] (formerly known as [[Dundas & Wilson]]), [[Dentons]] (formerly known as [[Maclay Murray & Spens]]), [[Pinsent Masons]] (formerly known as [[McGrigors]]), and [[Shepherd and Wedderburn]] in 2001 in a combined effort to produce common agreed styles (templates) for transactions of commercial heritable property in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psglegal.co.uk/|title=The Property Standardisation Group|website=www.psglegal.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> These templates are available to view on the Property Standardisation Group website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psglegal.co.uk/|title=The Property Standardisation Group|website=www.psglegal.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nCommercial transactions usually operate by the sharing of a draft agreement between the parties agents, now commonly done online on secure [[Cloud computing|cloud softwares]] where both parties' agents can amend the document or by e-mail exchange of draft documents between agents, until the agreement of a draft missives of sale.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, ''Conveyancing (2nd reissue),'' Chapter 2, para 8. </ref> The parties, or their authorised agents, can then formally sign and bind the parties to the contract in line with the the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/contents Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995]. \n\n== Property Sold at Auction (Roup) ==\nHeritable property may also be sold at an auction, called a ''roup'' in Scots law. The Seller prepares a standard contract that is exhibited to the bidders in advance of the auction.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property'', Ch.4, ''Corporeal Heritable Property'', para 641.</ref> The winning bidder at the roup, signs a ''minute of enactment and preference'' to bind himself to the pre-prepared contract and becomes the Buyer.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property'', Ch.4, ''Corporeal Heritable Property'', para 641.</ref>\n\n== Conclusion of Missives ==\nOnce the parties contractual negotiations have concluded, a contract will be validly created where, as discussed above, a party makes a simple acceptance to another party's offer, which can incorporate acceptance to any previous qualified acceptances/offers conditions made. This is known as the \"conclusion of missives\" and ends the contractual stage of the [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Voluntary Transfer|voluntary transfer of land]]. The conclusion of missives typically takes a few weeks due to the due diligence process that each party must undertake before the creation of a legally binding agreement.<ref>Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, ''Conveyancing (2nd reissue)'', Ch 2, ''Missives and Other Obligations,'' para 9. </ref> However, it should be noted that the parties only have a personal right '''at the point the missives conclude''', there is no enforceable right against the Buyer or Seller until then.  Following the conclusion of missives, the Buyer will only have a personal right against the Seller '''not''' a [[Scots property law#Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law|real right (right in rem)]]. \n\nOnce the missives have concluded, the parties in a voluntary transfer of land can move to the registration stage. After conclusion, the missives, as an enforceable contract, may only be revoked  by written discharge of the two parties.<ref>''Inglis v Lowrie'' ''1990 SLT (Sh Ct) 60''</ref> Should the parties wish to amend rather than discharge the missives and enter into a new contract, they may apply to the [[Sheriff court|Sheriff Court]] or [[Court of Session]] for a rectification order under [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/73/contents Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985] section 8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/73/contents/data.htm|title=Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory Personal Bar ==\nA statutory personal bar exists in Scots law in relation to written contracts, similar to the concept of ''[[Estoppel|esoppel]]'' in other jurisdictions. This protection allows an otherwise invalid contract to be held valid and enforceable where parties have acted in reliance of the contract with material (financial or otherwise) consequences. Under the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/3 Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995,] section 1(3) and 1(4) provides that: <blockquote>\"'''Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995''' \n\n'''Section 1(3)'''\n\nWhere a contract, obligation or trust mentioned in subsection (2)(a) [''list of situations where writings are required''l] above is not constituted in a document complying with section 2 [written document] or, as the case may be, section 9B [''electronic documents''] of this Act, <u>but one of the parties to the contract</u>, a creditor in the obligation or a beneficiary under the trust (\u201cthe first person\u201d) has <u>acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contrac</u>t, obligation or trust <u>with the knowledge</u> and <u>acquiescence</u> of the other party to the contract, the <u>debtor</u> in the obligation or the truster (\u201cthe second person\u201d)\u2014\n(a)the second person shall <u>not be entitled to withdraw from the contrac</u>t, obligation or trust; and\n\n(b)the contract, obligation or trust <u>shall not be regarded as invalid</u>,\n\non the ground that it is not so constituted, if the condition set out in subsection (4) below is satisfied.\n\n'''Section 1(4)'''\n\n(4)The condition referred to in '''subsection (3)''' above is that the position of the <u>first person</u>\u2014\n\n(a)as a <u>result of acting or refraining from acting</u> as mentioned in that subsection <u>has been affected</u> to a <u>material exten</u>t; and\n\n(b)as a <u>result of such a withdrawal</u> as is mentioned in that subsection <u>would be adversely affected</u> to a <u>material extent</u>.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/1/data.htm|title=Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>[''brackets and <u>underlines</u> added]'' </blockquote>This means where the missives of sale were not created in compliance to the 1995 Act, such as by informal writings or oral agreement, can still be enforceable against a person where the the other party has: \n\n# '''Has acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contract,''' (eg: s''econd party is the seller who has made an offer to purchase a house because he believed his house to be sold,  the second party is the buyer who has made arrangements to leave her current property'') \n# '''the second person knew of the party's actions,''' (eg: ''the second person (Buyer) was told that the person (Seller) was going to purchase another house, the second person (Buyer) told the person (Seller) that she was going to make arrangements to leave property)'' \n# '''The second person acquiesced to this acting or refraining from acting,''' (eg: ''the second person (Buyer) did not object to the Seller making a purchase another house, the second person (Seller) did not object to the Buyer quitting her current property and ceasing searching for another property)'' \n# '''as a result of the acting or refraining from acting, the first person has been affected to a <u>material</u> extent.''' (eg: ''the first person (Seller) has now entered into a contract of sale, the first person (Buyer) has incurred cancellation costs and other fees)'' \n\nThe first party then has to prove that if the second party does withdraw from the invalid contract, the first party would be '''<u>adversely affected</u>''' to a material extent. As always in [[Scots civil procedure|Scots civil law]], the first person must prove the above statutory burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that it occurred. \n<br />[[Category:[[Scots law]]] {{Uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "Kentigern1136", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWithdrawing an Offer to Buy/Offer to Sell", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missives_(Scots_law)"}

It uses [[Pressure sensor|pressure sensors]] to add another method of input to Apple's devices.<ref name=\"Force Touch - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/macos/force-touch/|title=Force Touch - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref><ref name=\"3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/ios/3d-touch/|title=3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> The technology was first unveiled on September 9, 2014, during the introduction of [[Apple Watch]]. Starting with the Apple Watch, Force Touch has been incorporated into many products within Apple's lineup. This notably includes [[MacBook family|MacBooks]] and the [[Magic Trackpad 2]]. The technology is known as '''3D Touch''' on the [[iPhone]] models. The technology brings [[usability]] enhancements to the software by offering a third dimension to accept input. Accessing shortcuts, previewing details, drawing art and system wide features enable users to additionally interact with the displayed content by applying force on the input surface.\n\n3D Touch has 3 levels of input based on the pressure sensitivity. This enables users to customize a preference of light, medium, or firm press on the iPhone's screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-my/HT205056|title=Change 3D Touch sensitivity on your iPhone - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Force Touch on the other hand, has two layers of interaction. Apple's [[haptic technology|haptic]] engine called the Taptic Engine resides in these devices, which houses a [[linear actuator]] producing vibratory effects as feedback. Apple allows application developers to leverage the pressure sensitivity of trackpads and touchscreens into their own apps.\n\nHaptic Touch is a feature on the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max and iPhone SE (2nd generation) replacing 3D Touch. The screen itself is not pressure sensitive, but a long-press will trigger certain 3D Touch features (only ones for elements that do not have an action assigned to long press).\n\n==User functionality==\n\nForce touch on Macs bring a variety of features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204352|title=How to use the Force Touch trackpad - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> A few notable ones are:\n\n* Look up text to show more information from [[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]], Wikipedia, etc.\n* Show an [[Apple Maps]] preview of an address location.\n* Add dates and events to [[Calendar (Apple)|Calendar]].\n* Preview details of flight numbers, tracking numbers and events.\n* Accelerate fast-forwarding and rewinding on [[QuickTime]] and [[iMovie]] using variable pressure.\n\n3D Touch on iPhones bring the following features<ref name=\"3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204352|title=How to use the Force Touch trackpad - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>, but are not limited to:\n\n* Quick Actions allow users to access shortcuts, many right from the Home screen.\n* Peek and Pop allows users to preview content and take actions on it, without having to open it. Pressing further, the user can pop into the content in the app.\n* Pressure Sensitivity allows creative apps to take advantage of the pressure-sensing display, for varying line thickness or giving a brush a changing style.\n* Holding down to preview Live Photos, enable multitasking, etc.\n* Pressing down on the keyboard displays a cursor which can be moved in two dimensions. Pressing again enters selection mode.\n\nForce Touch on Apple Watch brings some significant features<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imore.com/secret-apple-watch-options-14-force-touch-tips-your-wrist|title=Secret Apple Watch options: 14 Force Touch tips!|website=www.imore.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>, such as:\n\n* See alternate watch faces from the current watch face.\n* Change [[emoji]] colours: yellow smiley face to red, red heart to blue or purple.\n* Get the analog, digital, graph, and hybrid modes on the stopwatch app.\n* Toggle between day, list, or today view on the calendar app.\n* See weather, rain predictions and temperature on the weather app.\n\n==Software==\n\nApple allows [[Programmer|application developers]] to integrate the force touch functionality into their applications. The [[Application programming interface|APIs]] facilitate the following interactions<ref name=\"Force Touch - Apple Developer\"/>:\n\n* Apps respond to a press of stronger pressure, providing a shortcut as an additional functionality.\n* Pressure sensitivity for drawing and creative apps to make lines thicker or give brushes a changing style.\n* Accelerators allow receiving pressure sensitivity, to give users greater control. Say, fast-forward in media playback can speed up as pressure increases.\n* [[Drag and drop]] to allow users react to a force gesture amidst the hold, to immediately open a new target for the drop.\n\n==Hardware==\n\n[[File:IPhone 6s - Taptic Engine-92994.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taptic Engine embedded into the iPhone 6s]]\n\nOn iPhones, the [[Capacitive sensing|capacitive sensors]] are directly integrated into the display. When a press is detected, these capacitive sensors measure microscopic changes in the distance between the back light and the cover glass. On the Apple Watch, a series of [[electrode]]s line the curvature of the screen. When a press is detected, these electrodes determine the pressure applied. The trackpads deploy a similar mechanism, although sensory information is determined by a series of four sensors that align with the corners of the trackpad. The detected pressure is then relayed to the Taptic Engine, which is Apple's [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]] engine. The [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[linear actuator]] within the Taptic engine is capable of reaching its peak output in just one cycle and producing [[vibration]]s that last 10 milliseconds. Unlike typical motors, the linear actuator does not rotate but oscillates back and forth. The Taptic Engine produces immediate haptic feedback, without the need to offset the balance of mass. The haptic feedback produced may be accompanied by an audible tone.<ref name=\"Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/user-interaction/haptic-feedback/|title=Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> This helps in gaining the user's attention in order to convey an important information such as a success, warning or a failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/feedback/|title=Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - iOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Each haptic type is defined for a specific purpose, to convey a specific meaning.<ref name=\"Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer\"/>\n\n==Mechanics==\n\n[[File:IPhone 6s - Taptic Engine-92995.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taptic Engine module used in the iPhone 6s]]\n\nThe touch sensitive interface could either be a trackpad or a touch screen. Multiple actuators are mechanically connected to the back of the input surface. The actuators are distributed along the surface, each at a separate contact location, to provide localized haptic feedback to the user. [[Piezoelectricity]] is used by actuators to convert the physically-induced vibration or the input displacement into an [[electrical signal]].

It uses [[Pressure sensor|pressure sensors]] to add another method of input to Apple's devices.<ref name=\"Force Touch - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/macos/force-touch/|title=Force Touch - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref><ref name=\"3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/ios/3d-touch/|title=3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> The technology was first unveiled on September 9, 2014, during the introduction of [[Apple Watch]]. Starting with the Apple Watch, Force Touch has been incorporated into many products within Apple's lineup. This notably includes [[MacBook family|MacBooks]] and the [[Magic Trackpad 2]]. The technology is known as '''3D Touch''' on the [[iPhone]] models. The technology brings [[usability]] enhancements to the software by offering a third dimension to accept input. Accessing shortcuts, previewing details, drawing art and system wide features enable users to additionally interact with the displayed content by applying force on the input surface.\n\n3D Touch has 3 levels of input based on the pressure sensitivity. This enables users to customize a preference of light, medium, or firm press on the iPhone's screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-my/HT205056|title=Change 3D Touch sensitivity on your iPhone - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Force Touch on the other hand, has two layers of interaction. Apple's [[haptic technology|haptic]] engine called the Taptic Engine resides in these devices, which houses a [[linear actuator]] producing vibratory effects as feedback. Apple allows application developers to leverage the pressure sensitivity of trackpads and touchscreens into their own apps.\n\nHaptic Touch is a feature on the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max and iPhone SE (2nd generation) replacing 3D Touch. The screen itself is not pressure sensitive, but a long-press will trigger certain 3D Touch features (only ones for elements that do not have an action assigned to long press).\n\n==User functionality==\n\nForce touch on Macs bring a variety of features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204352|title=How to use the Force Touch trackpad - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> A few notable ones are:\n\n* Look up text to show more information from [[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]], Wikipedia, etc.\n* Show an [[Apple Maps]] preview of an address location.\n* Add dates and events to [[Calendar (Apple)|Calendar]].\n* Preview details of flight numbers, tracking numbers and events.\n* Accelerate fast-forwarding and rewinding on [[QuickTime]] and [[iMovie]] using variable pressure.\n\n3D Touch on iPhones bring the following features<ref name=\"3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204352|title=How to use the Force Touch trackpad - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>, but are not limited to:\n\n* Quick Actions allow users to access shortcuts, many right from the Home screen.\n* Peek and Pop allows users to preview content and take actions on it, without having to open it.

The [[Application programming interface|APIs]] facilitate the following interactions<ref name=\"Force Touch - Apple Developer\"/>:\n\n* Apps respond to a press of stronger pressure, providing a shortcut as an additional functionality.\n* Pressure sensitivity for drawing and creative apps to make lines thicker or give brushes a changing style.\n* Accelerators allow receiving pressure sensitivity, to give users greater control. Say, fast-forward in media playback can speed up as pressure increases.\n* [[Drag and drop]] to allow users react to a force gesture amidst the hold, to immediately open a new target for the drop.\n\n==Hardware==\n\n[[File:IPhone 6s - Taptic Engine-92994.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taptic Engine embedded into the iPhone 6s]]\n\nOn iPhones, the [[Capacitive sensing|capacitive sensors]] are directly integrated into the display. When a press is detected, these capacitive sensors measure microscopic changes in the distance between the back light and the cover glass. On the Apple Watch, a series of [[electrode]]s line the curvature of the screen. When a press is detected, these electrodes determine the pressure applied. The trackpads deploy a similar mechanism, although sensory information is determined by a series of four sensors that align with the corners of the trackpad. The detected pressure is then relayed to the Taptic Engine, which is Apple's [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]] engine. The [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[linear actuator]] within the Taptic engine is capable of reaching its peak output in just one cycle and producing [[vibration]]s that last 10 milliseconds. Unlike typical motors, the linear actuator does not rotate but oscillates back and forth. The Taptic Engine produces immediate haptic feedback, without the need to offset the balance of mass. The haptic feedback produced may be accompanied by an audible tone.<ref name=\"Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/user-interaction/haptic-feedback/|title=Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> This helps in gaining the user's attention in order to convey an important information such as a success, warning or a failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/feedback/|title=Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - iOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Each haptic type is defined for a specific purpose, to convey a specific meaning.<ref name=\"Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer\"/>\n\n==Mechanics==\n\n[[File:IPhone 6s - Taptic Engine-92995.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taptic Engine module used in the iPhone 6s]]\n\nThe touch sensitive interface could either be a trackpad or a touch screen. Multiple actuators are mechanically connected to the back of the input surface. The actuators are distributed along the surface, each at a separate contact location, to provide localized haptic feedback to the user. [[Piezoelectricity]] is used by actuators to convert the physically-induced vibration or the input displacement into an [[electrical signal]]. A [[Microcontroller|controller]] is configured to activate the actuators in and around the point of contact. The actuators at the point of contact induces [[waveform]]s to produce vibration. However, since there are multiple actuators around the point of contact, the vibration can [[Wave propagation|propagate]] to other locations, thus limiting the localization effect. This is why a second set of actuators induce waveforms to suppress the vibratory cross-talk produced by the first set of actuators.

Examples are the [[salmon]] fishery of [[Alaska]], the [[Atlantic cod|cod]] fishery off the [[Lofoten]] islands, the [[tuna]] fishery of the [[Pacific Ocean|Eastern Pacific]], or the [[shrimp farm]] fisheries in [[China]]. Capture fisheries can be broadly classified as industrial scale, small-scale or artisanal, and recreational.\n\nClose to 90% of the world's fishery catches come from [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s, as opposed to inland waters. These marine catches have remained relatively stable since the mid-nineties (between 80 and 86 million tonnes).<ref>{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Fisheries| publisher=GreenFacts Website | date=2009-03-02 | accessdate=2009-03-25 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/fisheries/index.htm\n}}</ref> Most marine fisheries are based near the [[coast]]. This is not only because harvesting from relatively shallow waters is easier than in the open ocean, but also because fish are much more abundant near the [[coast|coastal shelf]], due to the abundance of [[nutrient]]s available there from [[upwelling|coastal upwelling]] and [[land runoff]]. However, productive wild fisheries also exist in open oceans, particularly by [[seamount]]s, and inland in lakes and rivers.\n\nMost fisheries are [[wild fisheries]], but [[Fish farm|farmed fisheries]] are increasing. Farming can occur in coastal areas, such as with [[Oyster farming|oyster farms]],<ref>New Zealand Seafood Industry Council. [http://www.seafood.co.nz/musselfarming ''Mussel Farming.'']</ref> but more typically occur inland, in lakes, ponds, tanks and other enclosures.\n\nThere are species fisheries worldwide for finfish, [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[echinoderm]]s, and by extension, [[aquatic plant]]s such as [[kelp]]. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], tuna, [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], salmon, [[crab]], [[lobster]], [[oyster]] and [[scallop]]s. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a [[million]] [[tonne]]s in 1999, with herring and [[sardine]]s together providing a harvest of over 22 million metric tons in 1999.

In earlier times, even [[biologist]]s did not make a distinction\u2014sixteenth century [[natural historian]]s classified also [[Pinniped|seals]], [[whale]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of [[marine invertebrate]]s, as fish.<ref>Jr.Cleveland P Hickman, Larry S. Roberts, Allan L. Larson: ''Integrated Principles of Zoology'', McGraw-Hill Publishing Co, 2001, {{ISBN|0-07-290961-7}}</ref>\n* '''In fisheries''' \u2013 the term ''fish'' is used as a collective term, and includes [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and any [[aquatic animal]] which is harvested.<ref name=\"FAO-Glossary\" />\n* '''True fish''' \u2013 The strict biological definition of a fish, above, is sometimes called a true fish. True fish are also referred to as ''finfish'' or ''fin fish'' to distinguish them from other [[aquatic life]] harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Faina de Pesca,Sesimbra.jpg|thumb|right|Fishermen in [[Sesimbra]], Portugal]]\nFisheries are harvested for their value ([[Commercial fishing|commercial]], [[Recreational fishing|recreational]] or [[Artisan fishing|subsistence]]). They can be [[Seawater|saltwater]] or [[freshwater]], [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[farmed]]. Examples are the [[salmon]] fishery of [[Alaska]], the [[Atlantic cod|cod]] fishery off the [[Lofoten]] islands, the [[tuna]] fishery of the [[Pacific Ocean|Eastern Pacific]], or the [[shrimp farm]] fisheries in [[China]]. Capture fisheries can be broadly classified as industrial scale, small-scale or artisanal, and recreational.\n\nClose to 90% of the world's fishery catches come from [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s, as opposed to inland waters. These marine catches have remained relatively stable since the mid-nineties (between 80 and 86 million tonnes).<ref>{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Fisheries| publisher=GreenFacts Website | date=2009-03-02 | accessdate=2009-03-25 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/fisheries/index.htm\n}}</ref> Most marine fisheries are based near the [[coast]]. This is not only because harvesting from relatively shallow waters is easier than in the open ocean, but also because fish are much more abundant near the [[coast|coastal shelf]], due to the abundance of [[nutrient]]s available there from [[upwelling|coastal upwelling]] and [[land runoff]]. However, productive wild fisheries also exist in open oceans, particularly by [[seamount]]s, and inland in lakes and rivers.\n\nMost fisheries are [[wild fisheries]], but [[Fish farm|farmed fisheries]] are increasing. Farming can occur in coastal areas, such as with [[Oyster farming|oyster farms]],<ref>New Zealand Seafood Industry Council. [http://www.seafood.co.nz/musselfarming ''Mussel Farming.'']</ref> but more typically occur inland, in lakes, ponds, tanks and other enclosures.\n\nThere are species fisheries worldwide for finfish, [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[echinoderm]]s, and by extension, [[aquatic plant]]s such as [[kelp]]. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], tuna, [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], salmon, [[crab]], [[lobster]], [[oyster]] and [[scallop]]s. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a [[million]] [[tonne]]s in 1999, with herring and [[sardine]]s together providing a harvest of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are harvested in smaller numbers.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Global capture fisheries and aquaculture production, 1990-2030.svg|thumb|right|Global capture fisheries and aquaculture production reported by FAO, 1990-2030]]\n\nTotal fish production in 2016 reached an all-time high of 171 million tonnes, of which 88 percent was utilized for direct human consumption, thanks to relatively stable capture fisheries production, reduced wastage and continued aquaculture growth. This production resulted in a record-high per capita consumption of 20.3&nbsp;kg in 2016.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/3/ca0191en/ca0191en.pdf|title=In brief, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2018|last=|first=|publisher=FAO|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Since 1961 the annual global growth in fish consumption has been twice as high as population growth.
