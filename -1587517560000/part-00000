The first documented settlement, by the [[Flemish people|Fleming]] [[Willem van der Haegen]], occurred in the zone of Ribeira da Cruz (north of the parish) in the 16th century.\n\nBy 1510, the area of Lajes consisted of a significant population; it had benefited from its natural port and the settlement was elevated to the status of ''vila'' by the Portuguese government (responsible for administering the south and western portions of the island) by 1515 (making it the oldest settlement in the Western Group with this status).<ref name=SIPA/> Initially, the settlement included Ribeira da Silva (in the area of [[Lomba (Lajes das Flores)|Lomba]]), Faj\u00e3 Grande, as well as the settlements of Lajedo, Faj\u00e3zinha, Caldeira, Mosteiro, Faj\u00e3 Grande and Fazenda. Settlements in the western coast, with the exception of Lajedo, were de-annexed to form the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios das Faj\u00e3s (independent as of 1676, with its seat in Faj\u00e3zinha).\n\nThe primitive church was constructed in the present location of the cemetery, but was burned-down by English privateers on July 25, 1587,<ref name=SIPA/> when five English ships offloaded troops and sacked the village, and caused the residents to flee into the hills. Two fortes were constructed to guard the coastal frontier and villages: the Fort of Santo Ant\u00f3nio, which defended the town from two American privateers in 1770 and the Forte do Esp\u00edrito Santo. By 1868 these garrisons were demolished, but the name Santo Ant\u00f3nio in the village remains, designating the area along the coast in front of the Church, the former location of the fort and chapel of the same name.\n\nThe historian Father Ant\u00f3nio Cordeiro, in his work ''Hist\u00f3ria Insulana'' described the village:\n:''Her in the North, is the noble and strong Village of Lajes, in nothing is it subject to the Village of Santa Cruz, with more than 300 homes, and two great Companies, the Captain of Ordinance and the Captain-General of the Village, their space, constituted of one great road with many intersections, and have in front of them, to the sea, a few dangerous lowlands, where they committed the Villa, more than two leagues from the place known as S\u00e3o Pedro.''\n\nThe Florense, [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es]], in his ''Roteiro Exacto da Costa da Ilha'', writing in the first decade of the 19th century, affirmed:\n:''...there is that Village port in the south-southeast; outside is a bay anchored by sand.

There is more, a chapel of the Castillians constructed in 1741...There is in this Village 75 homes where 486 souls reside, of them 240 men and 246 women. There are 35 tiled houses and 17 men with shoes. There are two companies of ordinance.  The first formed in the Village, Monte and Morros, with one captain, one ensign, two lieutenants, that were strong, two sergeants and 170 soldiers, the second formed in Fazenda, Lajedo and Mosteiro, with one Captain, one Ensign, one Lieutenant, three Sergeants and 147 soldiers, with 77 in Fazenda, 36 in Lajedo and along the coast, and 34 in Mosteiro and Caldeira.

The first documented settlement, by the [[Flemish people|Fleming]] [[Willem van der Haegen]], occurred in the zone of Ribeira da Cruz (north of the parish) in the 16th century.\n\nBy 1510, the area of Lajes consisted of a significant population; it had benefited from its natural port and the settlement was elevated to the status of ''vila'' by the Portuguese government (responsible for administering the south and western portions of the island) by 1515 (making it the oldest settlement in the Western Group with this status).<ref name=SIPA/> Initially, the settlement included Ribeira da Silva (in the area of [[Lomba (Lajes das Flores)|Lomba]]), Faj\u00e3 Grande, as well as the settlements of Lajedo, Faj\u00e3zinha, Caldeira, Mosteiro, Faj\u00e3 Grande and Fazenda. Settlements in the western coast, with the exception of Lajedo, were de-annexed to form the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios das Faj\u00e3s (independent as of 1676, with its seat in Faj\u00e3zinha). \n\nThe primitive church was constructed in the present location of the cemetery, but was burned-down by English privateers on July 25, 1587,<ref name=SIPA/> when five English ships offloaded troops and sacked the village, and caused the residents to flee into the hills. Two fortes were constructed to guard the coastal frontier and villages: the Fort of Santo Ant\u00f3nio, which defended the town from two American privateers in 1770 and the Forte do Esp\u00edrito Santo. By 1868 these garrisons were demolished, but the name Santo Ant\u00f3nio in the village remains, designating the area along the coast in front of the Church, the former location of the fort and chapel of the same name.\n\nThe historian Father Ant\u00f3nio Cordeiro, in his work ''Hist\u00f3ria Insulana'' described the village:\n:''Her in the North, is the noble and strong Village of Lajes, in nothing is it subject to the Village of Santa Cruz, with more than 300 homes, and two great Companies, the Captain of Ordinance and the Captain-General of the Village, their space, constituted of one great road with many intersections, and have in front of them, to the sea, a few dangerous lowlands, where they committed the Villa, more than two leagues from the place known as S\u00e3o Pedro.''\n\nThe Florense, [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es]], in his ''Roteiro Exacto da Costa da Ilha'', writing in the first decade of the 19th century, affirmed:\n:''...there is that Village port in the south-southeast; outside is a bay anchored by sand. Continuing from the mentioned port, to the south is born a various cliffs, that is called the '''Canos d\u2019agoa''', that they say proceeded from the Caldeira Funda, which is found above it.

The majority (over half) of the parish is occupied by Air Base No. 4, and the barracks/homes of Air Force personnel stationed on the base (including American and Portuguese servicemen). The remainder of the base is actually in the neighbouring civil parish of Santa Cruz.\n\nThe western frontier is delineated by the ''Ribeira da Areia'' that crosses into the interior, reaching the parishes of Vila Nova and S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s. The border then skirts Lorais, until Fund\u00f5es, and parts towards the interior again, intersecting at ''Rua do Terreiro'', ''Rua das Covas'', ''Rua dos Fund\u00f5es'' and ''Rua Padre Greg\u00f3rio B. Rocha'', before arriving in Pic\u00e3o. The border then passes through the pasturelands of the interior, before aligning with the regional roadway at Santa Luzia, and running perpendicular towards the regional airport, bisecting the runway in the direction of Santa Rita, until the coast at Ponta dos Carneiros.\n\nIn addition to ''Ribeira da Areia'' and ''Ribeira dos P\u00e3es'', the parish is crossed by subterranean branches of the ''Ribeira do Marques'' (that crosses the airport/air base).\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Lajes ([[Lajes Airport]])\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 21.1\n|Feb record high C = 21.1\n|Mar record high C = 22.2\n|Apr record high C = 23.9\n|May record high C = 24.4\n|Jun record high C = 27.8\n|Jul record high C = 28.9\n|Aug record high C = 30.0\n|Sep record high C = 30.0\n|Oct record high C = 28.3\n|Nov record high C = 23.9\n|Dec record high C = 22.2\n|year record high C = 30.0\n|Jan high C = 16.1\n|Feb high C = 16.1\n|Mar high C = 16.7\n|Apr high C = 17.2\n|May high C = 18.9\n|Jun high C = 21.1\n|Jul high C = 23.3\n|Aug high C = 24.4\n|Sep high C = 23.3\n|Oct high C = 21.1\n|Nov high C = 18.3\n|Dec high C = 17.2\n|year high C = 19.4\n|Jan mean C = 14.4\n|Feb mean C = 13.9\n|Mar mean C = 14.5\n|Apr mean C = 14.9\n|May mean C = 16.4\n|Jun mean C = 18.7\n|Jul mean C = 21.0\n|Aug mean C = 22.1\n|Sep mean C = 21.1\n|Oct mean C = 18.6\n|Nov mean C = 16.7\n|Dec mean C = 15.2\n|year mean C = 17.3\n|Jan low C = 12.2\n|Feb low C = 11.7\n|Mar low C = 11.7\n|Apr low C = 12.2\n|May low C = 13.9\n|Jun low C = 16.1\n|Jul low C = 17.8\n|Aug low C = 18.9\n|Sep low C = 17.8\n|Oct low C = 16.1\n|Nov low C = 14.4\n|Dec low C = 12.8\n|year low C = 14.4\n|Jan record low C = 2.8\n|Feb record low C = 4.4\n|Mar record low C = 5.0\n|Apr record low C = 5.6\n|May record low C = 7.2\n|Jun record low C = 7.8\n|Jul record low C = 11.7\n|Aug record low C = 12.2\n|Sep record low C = 11.1\n|Oct record low C = 8.3\n|Nov record low C = 5.6\n|Dec record low C = 5.6\n|year record low C = 2.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 154.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 137.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 143.0\n|Apr precipitation mm = 75.7\n|May precipitation mm = 49.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 37.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 44.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 75.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 129.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 128.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 118.9\n|year precipitation mm = 1138.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 19\n|Feb precipitation days = 17\n|Mar precipitation days = 18\n|Apr precipitation days = 13\n|May precipitation days = 12\n|Jun precipitation days = 9\n|Jul precipitation days = 7\n|Aug precipitation days = 9\n|Sep precipitation days = 12\n|Oct precipitation days = 16\n|Nov precipitation days = 17\n|Dec precipitation days = 18\n|year precipitation days = 167\n|Jan humidity = 79\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 79\n|Apr humidity = 77\n|May humidity = 78\n|Jun humidity = 79\n|Jul humidity = 78\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 78\n|Oct humidity = 78\n|Nov humidity = 80\n|Dec humidity = 79\n|year humidity = 78\n|Jan sun = 104\n|Feb sun = 109\n|Mar sun = 136\n|Apr sun = 159\n|May sun = 197\n|Jun sun = 203\n|Jul sun = 230\n|Aug sun = 236\n|Sep sun = 199\n|Oct sun = 152\n|Nov sun = 110\n|Dec sun = 89\n|year sun = \n|source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (sun, 1961\u20131990)<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_085090_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Lajes (Flugh.) / Insel Terceira; Azoren / Portugal\n| work = Baseline climate means (1961-1990) from stations all over the world\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 30 January 2016}}</ref><ref name = DWDsun>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/multi_annual/sunshine_duration/1961_1990.txt\n| title = Station 08509 Lajes (Acores)\n| work = Global station data 1961\u20131990\u2014Sunshine Duration\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| accessdate = 30 January 2016\n| archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171017195327/ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/multi_annual/sunshine_duration/1961_1990.txt\n| archive-date = 17 October 2017\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>{{efn|[ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/help/stations_list_CLIMAT_data.txt Station ID for Lajes (Acores) is 08509] Use this station ID to locate the sunshine duration}}\n}}\n\n==Economy==\nOwing to the significance and importance of the regional air field, the economy of Lajes has a symbiotic relationship with the activities at Air Base No.4. Most of the auxiliary staff at the base are residents of Lajes, and many services in the parish support the international demands of the stationed personal. Although most services are provided on base for servicemen, there are still trickle-down affects to the local community, with support personnel living in the parish and spending their money in the local economy. At the same time, it is common for foreign servicemen to support the local economy, when not on duty.\n\nLocal activities include carpentry shops, services directed to farmers, automobile and mechanical garages, video, graphic and promotional services and financial institutions, including branches of the national and regional banks (Montepio, Banif, etc.). In addition, several shops, mini-markets, fruit stands and groceries service the local residents with bakeries, a butcher shop, and hairstylists.\n\n==Architecture==\nLajes has several elementary schools with the main one located in Aldeia Nova. It has two churches with the main one dating back to the 16th century. This church has been destroyed by earthquakes in 1614 and 1841 and partially destroyed in the 1 January 1980 earthquake. The other smaller church is located in Cabouco.\n\n===Civic===\n* Fountain of Ribeira da Areia ({{lang-pt|Chafarizes da Ribeira da Areia}})\n* Fountain of Mal\u00edcias ({{lang-pt|Chafarizes das Mal\u00edcias}})\n* Fountain of Largo de S.

The border then passes through the pasturelands of the interior, before aligning with the regional roadway at Santa Luzia, and running perpendicular towards the regional airport, bisecting the runway in the direction of Santa Rita, until the coast at Ponta dos Carneiros.\n\nIn addition to ''Ribeira da Areia'' and ''Ribeira dos P\u00e3es'', the parish is crossed by subterranean branches of the ''Ribeira do Marques'' (that crosses the airport/air base).\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Lajes ([[Lajes Airport]])\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 21.1\n|Feb record high C = 21.1\n|Mar record high C = 22.2\n|Apr record high C = 23.9\n|May record high C = 24.4\n|Jun record high C = 27.8\n|Jul record high C = 28.9\n|Aug record high C = 30.0\n|Sep record high C = 30.0\n|Oct record high C = 28.3\n|Nov record high C = 23.9\n|Dec record high C = 22.2\n|year record high C = 30.0\n|Jan high C = 16.1\n|Feb high C = 16.1\n|Mar high C = 16.7\n|Apr high C = 17.2\n|May high C = 18.9\n|Jun high C = 21.1\n|Jul high C = 23.3\n|Aug high C = 24.4\n|Sep high C = 23.3\n|Oct high C = 21.1\n|Nov high C = 18.3\n|Dec high C = 17.2\n|year high C = 19.4\n|Jan mean C = 14.4\n|Feb mean C = 13.9\n|Mar mean C = 14.5\n|Apr mean C = 14.9\n|May mean C = 16.4\n|Jun mean C = 18.7\n|Jul mean C = 21.0\n|Aug mean C = 22.1\n|Sep mean C = 21.1\n|Oct mean C = 18.6\n|Nov mean C = 16.7\n|Dec mean C = 15.2\n|year mean C = 17.3\n|Jan low C = 12.2\n|Feb low C = 11.7\n|Mar low C = 11.7\n|Apr low C = 12.2\n|May low C = 13.9\n|Jun low C = 16.1\n|Jul low C = 17.8\n|Aug low C = 18.9\n|Sep low C = 17.8\n|Oct low C = 16.1\n|Nov low C = 14.4\n|Dec low C = 12.8\n|year low C = 14.4\n|Jan record low C = 2.8\n|Feb record low C = 4.4\n|Mar record low C = 5.0\n|Apr record low C = 5.6\n|May record low C = 7.2\n|Jun record low C = 7.8\n|Jul record low C = 11.7\n|Aug record low C = 12.2\n|Sep record low C = 11.1\n|Oct record low C = 8.3\n|Nov record low C = 5.6\n|Dec record low C = 5.6\n|year record low C = 2.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 154.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 137.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 143.0\n|Apr precipitation mm = 75.7\n|May precipitation mm = 49.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 37.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 44.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 75.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 129.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 128.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 118.9\n|year precipitation mm = 1138.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 19\n|Feb precipitation days = 17\n|Mar precipitation days = 18\n|Apr precipitation days = 13\n|May precipitation days = 12\n|Jun precipitation days = 9\n|Jul precipitation days = 7\n|Aug precipitation days = 9\n|Sep precipitation days = 12\n|Oct precipitation days = 16\n|Nov precipitation days = 17\n|Dec precipitation days = 18\n|year precipitation days = 167\n|Jan humidity = 79\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 79\n|Apr humidity = 77\n|May humidity = 78\n|Jun humidity = 79\n|Jul humidity = 78\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 78\n|Oct humidity = 78\n|Nov humidity = 80\n|Dec humidity = 79\n|year humidity = 78\n|Jan sun = 104\n|Feb sun = 109\n|Mar sun = 136\n|Apr sun = 159\n|May sun = 197\n|Jun sun = 203\n|Jul sun = 230\n|Aug sun = 236\n|Sep sun = 199\n|Oct sun = 152\n|Nov sun = 110\n|Dec sun = 89\n|year sun = \n|source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (sun, 1961\u20131990)<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_085090_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Lajes (Flugh.) / Insel Terceira; Azoren / Portugal\n| work = Baseline climate means (1961-1990) from stations all over the world\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 30 January 2016}}</ref><ref name = DWDsun>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/multi_annual/sunshine_duration/1961_1990.txt\n| title = Station 08509 Lajes (Acores)\n| work = Global station data 1961\u20131990\u2014Sunshine Duration\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| accessdate = 30 January 2016\n| archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171017195327/ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/multi_annual/sunshine_duration/1961_1990.txt\n| archive-date = 17 October 2017\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>{{efn|[ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/help/stations_list_CLIMAT_data.txt Station ID for Lajes (Acores) is 08509] Use this station ID to locate the sunshine duration}}\n}}\n\n==Economy==\nOwing to the significance and importance of the regional air field, the economy of Lajes has a symbiotic relationship with the activities at Air Base No.4. Most of the auxiliary staff at the base are residents of Lajes, and many services in the parish support the international demands of the stationed personal. Although most services are provided on base for servicemen, there are still trickle-down affects to the local community, with support personnel living in the parish and spending their money in the local economy. At the same time, it is common for foreign servicemen to support the local economy, when not on duty.\n\nLocal activities include carpentry shops, services directed to farmers, automobile and mechanical garages, video, graphic and promotional services and financial institutions, including branches of the national and regional banks (Montepio, Banif, etc.). In addition, several shops, mini-markets, fruit stands and groceries service the local residents with bakeries, a butcher shop, and hairstylists.\n\n==Architecture==\nLajes has several elementary schools with the main one located in Aldeia Nova. It has two churches with the main one dating back to the 16th century. This church has been destroyed by earthquakes in 1614 and 1841 and partially destroyed in the 1 January 1980 earthquake. The other smaller church is located in Cabouco.\n===Civic===\n* Fountain of Ribeira da Areia ({{lang-pt|Chafarizes da Ribeira da Areia}})\n* Fountain of Mal\u00edcias ({{lang-pt|Chafarizes das Mal\u00edcias}})\n* Fountain of Largo de S.
