He was a student at CNSAD [[Conservatoire national sup\u00e9rieur d'art dramatique]] from 1959 to 1962 and was the first male student to win all three categories (Classical Comedy, Modern Comedy, Tragedy). In 1962 he was the first recipient of the newly created Prix G\u00e9rard Philipe. He was engaged at the [[Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise]] in 1962 but left after a few months as he was only offered minor roles. In 1964 he was awarded the Theater World Award for his role of Hippolyte in [[Phedre]]<ref>http://www.theatreworldawards.org/past-recipients.html</ref>. He returned to the [[Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise]] in 1972 and stayed there until 1982, when he joined [[Jean-Laurent Cochet]]'s newly created [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre H\u00e9bertot]].\n\nClaude Giraud played the leading role as Capitaine Langlois in [[Fran\u00e7ois Leterrier]]'s movie ''[[A King Without Distraction]]'' in 1962.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=49875|title=Un roi sans divertissement|language=French|work=bifi.fr|publisher=[[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]|accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref> He was Oedipus in the film adaptation of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s [[The Infernal Machine]]. He played the role of Georges in [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Circle of Love (film)|Circle of Love]]'', an adaptation of [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s scandalous play [[La Ronde (play)]]. Between 1964 and 1966, Claude Giraud played the part of Philippe de Plessis-Belli\u00e8res beside [[Mich\u00e8le Mercier]] in three Ang\u00e9lique films: ''[[Ang\u00e9lique, Marquise des Anges]]'', ''[[Marvelous Angelique]]'', and ''[[Angelique and the King]]''.\n\nAt the same time he gained fame in TV series as hero Morgan/Jacques de Saint-Hermine in the adventure series ''Les Compagnons de J\u00e9hu'' by [[Michel Drach]] adapted from the eponymous novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]]. [[Bernard Toublanc-Michel]] engaged him in 1967 for the role of d'Aulnay in ''Adolphe ou l'\u00e2ge tendre''.

The project was initiated in the [[Netherlands]] in 2009 by Lydia Vroegindeweij and is directed towards [[cultural heritage|cultural legacy]] and [[music education]].  Initially the project consisted of a website with educational tips and lesson suggestions to organize, among other projects,  an excursion to a large pipe organ.  Since 2013, Orgelkids has at its disposal a specially developed educational organ assembly kit.  A complete, craftsman-built organ, in unassembled component parts, is contained in a lesson box.  The instrument can be assembled and subsequently played.  This so-called Do-organ is rented out by Orgelkids to [[organist]]s, [[organ builder]]s or organ teachers who want to organize educational projects for children.\n\n== Justification / Background ==\nThe classical pipe organ is almost always built in a fixed location in a building and not very accessible for children.  Due to increased [[secularization]] of society, fewer children attend churches, so they have fewer occasions to spontaneously experience a pipe organ.<ref name=secu>an. 2016.</ref> Many smaller churches in N. America have electronic organs.  <br />\nIn the Netherlands there is a wealth of historical organs.  For the preservation and maintenance of this cultural legacy, it is important to encourage a continuing flow of new organists and organ builders.  To prevent that knowledge and enthusiasm for organs continue to decline, Orgelkids has made a special instrument available to schools.  An [[organist]] or [[organ builder]] visits the school with the Do-organ and supervises the students as they build/assemble the organ.\n\n== Orgelkids Do-organ ==\n[[File:2013 Orgelkids Doe-orgel pijpen plaatsen.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Children in primary school are assembling the Do-organ]]\nAn organ in a lesson box is a unique concept, first conceived and built by Dutch organ builder Wim Janssen specially for the goal of educating children with the technology and playing of the organ.  It is not a demonstration organ with just a few keys, but a real instrument with which children can self-discover how it works.  That is the reason it was given the name, \"Do-organ.\"\nThe Orgelkids instrument is a mechanical, tracker organ with two [[octave]]s (24 keys) and two [[organ stop|registers]] which can be used independently or in combination. Air (wind in organ parlance)  is supplied by a hand-pumped [[bellows]].<ref name=octaves>Verhoeven 2016.</ref>\n\nAll the materials used are identical to those used in a large pipe organ (such as [[oak wood]] and [[sheepskin|sheep leather]]).  Children experience the value and quality of craftsman-made instruments.\n\nThe lesson box is supplied with instruction manuals which include many photos, by which children can assemble the organ with a minimum of instructions, in about 45 minutes.  In addition, there are other lesson materials available such as an [[instructional video]] by the builder, an [[e-book]], and a presentation for a digital [[blackboard]].\n\nTon Stevens, organist of the basilica of St. John in [[Oosterhout]], the Netherlands, works with kids on [[World Animal Day]] in the basilica every year. First they build and play the Do-organ of Orgelkids, and afterwards the children can take a look at the \"real\" organ built by [[Maarschalkerweerd]] in 1890. Of course songs like ''[[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]]'' are played on the organ on the occasion of that special day.<ref name=stevens>Rodenburg 2014</ref>\n\n== International developments ==\nOrgelkids started in the [[Netherlands]] in 2013 with a single lesson box.  The home for this organ is in the [[Amersfoort]] region, which is in the center of the country.  In the first year, 1350 children were reached.{{fact}}\nIn 2015 it was expanded with a second organ which is based in [[Belgium]], operating out of [[Antwerp]].  In its first year there, 800 children were reached.{{fact}}\n\nThe project has attracted more international attention.  In Oregon a sister project, Orgelkids USA, an educational 501c3 nonprofit,<ref name=\"orgelkidsusa.org\">{{cite web|title=Orgelkids USA|url=http://www.orgelkidsusa.org|website=orgelkidsusa.org|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> was launched in 2016 with the mission to help grow a nationwide network of independent kits. They helped place five organ kits built by the US builders in their first year. Orgelkids USA kits are being commissioned to serve as regional resources by chapters of the [[American Guild of Organists]] as well as by non-profit organizations whose missions are pipe organ related. \n== Training for organ builders ==\nSince 2016, Orgelkids has been supporting the training of organ builders and the passing down of artisanal skills.  Organ building shops can have apprentice builders work on an Orgelkids instrument during their practical training.  In doing so they develop all manner of practical skills which are also needed in the building or restoration of large, monumental organs.  After completion, the organ kit can be made available for educational projects.\nFor those who wish to build an organ kit themselves, building instructions are available including 20 technical drawings that correspond to the original organ.\n\n== Foundation ==\nThe Orgelkids project has been brought into the Dutch \"Stichting Kerk Muziek Netwerk\" (Church Music Network Foundation) since 2013.<ref name=SKMN>Van den Broucke en Vroegindeweij 2016, p. 113.</ref> This non-profit foundation engages to make relevant aspects of church music accessible to the greater public.\n\n== Orgelkids USA ==\nUS-based Orgelkids USA<ref name=\"orgelkidsusa.org\" /> was founded in June 2015 as a program<ref>{{cite web|title=OrgelKids - USA, Pipe Speak, 1st November 2015, Volume 6 No. 3|url=http://agoeugene.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nov-2015-Newsletter-Final.pdf|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> of the Eugene Oregon USA chapter of the American Guild of Organists,<ref>{{cite web|title=Eugene AGO|url=http://agoeugene.org/|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> and later incorporated on 29 August 2016 as a section-501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

That is the reason it was given the name, \"Do-organ.\"\nThe Orgelkids instrument is a mechanical, tracker organ with two [[octave]]s (24 keys) and two [[organ stop|registers]] which can be used independently or in combination. Air (wind in organ parlance)  is supplied by a hand-pumped [[bellows]].<ref name=octaves>Verhoeven 2016.</ref>\n\nAll the materials used are identical to those used in a large pipe organ (such as [[oak wood]] and [[sheepskin|sheep leather]]).  Children experience the value and quality of craftsman-made instruments.\n\nThe lesson box is supplied with instruction manuals which include many photos, by which children can assemble the organ with a minimum of instructions, in about 45 minutes.  In addition, there are other lesson materials available such as an [[instructional video]] by the builder, an [[e-book]], and a presentation for a digital [[blackboard]].\n\nTon Stevens, organist of the basilica of St. John in [[Oosterhout]], the Netherlands, works with kids on [[World Animal Day]] in the basilica every year. First they build and play the Do-organ of Orgelkids, and afterwards the children can take a look at the \"real\" organ built by [[Maarschalkerweerd]] in 1890. Of course songs like ''[[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]]'' are played on the organ on the occasion of that special day.<ref name=stevens>Rodenburg 2014</ref>\n\n== International developments ==\nOrgelkids started in the [[Netherlands]] in 2013 with a single lesson box.  The home for this organ is in the [[Amersfoort]] region, which is in the center of the country.  In the first year, 1350 children were reached.\nIn 2015 it was expanded with a second organ which is based in [[Belgium]], operating out of [[Antwerp]].  In its first year there, 800 children were reached.\n\nThe project has attracted more international attention.  In Oregon a sister project, Orgelkids USA, an educational 501c3 nonprofit,<ref name=\"orgelkidsusa.org\">{{cite web|title=Orgelkids USA|url=http://www.orgelkidsusa.org|website=orgelkidsusa.org|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> was launched in 2016 with the mission to help grow a nationwide network of independent kits. They helped place five organ kits built by the US builders in their first year. Orgelkids USA kits are being commissioned to serve as regional resources by chapters of the [[American Guild of Organists]] as well as by non-profit organizations whose missions are pipe organ related. \n== Training for organ builders ==\nSince 2016, Orgelkids has been supporting the training of organ builders and the passing down of artisanal skills.  Organ building shops can have apprentice builders work on an Orgelkids instrument during their practical training.  In doing so they develop all manner of practical skills which are also needed in the building or restoration of large, monumental organs.  After completion, the organ kit can be made available for educational projects.\nFor those who wish to build an organ kit themselves, building instructions are available including 20 technical drawings that correspond to the original organ.\n\n== Foundation ==\nThe Orgelkids project has been brought into the Dutch \"Stichting Kerk Muziek Netwerk\" (Church Music Network Foundation) since 2013.<ref name=SKMN>Van den Broucke en Vroegindeweij 2016, p. 113.</ref> This non-profit foundation engages to make relevant aspects of church music accessible to the greater public.\n\n== Orgelkids USA ==\nUS-based Orgelkids USA<ref name=\"orgelkidsusa.org\" /> was founded in June 2015 as a program<ref>{{cite web|title=OrgelKids - USA, Pipe Speak, 1st November 2015, Volume 6 No. 3|url=http://agoeugene.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nov-2015-Newsletter-Final.pdf|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> of the Eugene Oregon USA chapter of the American Guild of Organists,<ref>{{cite web|title=Eugene AGO|url=http://agoeugene.org/|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> and later incorporated on 29 August 2016 as a section-501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
