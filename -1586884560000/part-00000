He then took his surname from his estate, a not uncommon practice of the time. It is assumed that he built the first stone fortifications at the site.\n\n[[James II of Scotland|James II]] stayed at Home en route to the siege of [[Roxburgh Castle]], the last English garrison left in Scotland following the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Wars of Independence]].

At this time, Scotland's Governor Regent Albany was planning to bring an army against the Hume family on the Scottish borders. Albany captured Hume Castle, but according to a report by [[Cardinal Wolsey]]'s chaplain, William Frankelayn, Chancellor of Durham, [[Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home|Lord Hume]], [[Chamberlain of Scotland|Lord Chamberlain]], retook the castle on 26 August 1515, and kept Albany's captain, [[John Fleming, 2nd Lord Fleming|Lord Fleming]]'s uncle, prisoner. Lord Hume then [[Slighting|slighted]] his own castle, razed the walls, \"and dammed the well for ever more.\" <ref>''Letters & Papers of Henry VIII'', vol. 2 (London, 1864), no. 861.</ref>\n\nBefore the advent of [[artillery]], Hume castle was considered almost impregnable. However it was captured in 1547 during the \"[[Rough Wooing]]\", by the [[Lord Protector Somerset]]. [[Regent Arran]] had sent 12 [[arquebus|gunners]] to man the castle in August 1547.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), 100.</ref> [[George Home, 4th Lord Home]], was injured at the [[Battle of Pinkie]] and his son Alexander captured.  After stout resistance by [[Mariotta Haliburton|Mariotta (or Marion) Haliburton]] Lady Home, the castle fell and an English garrison was installed. According to an English account, the castle was rendered by the negotiation of Lady Home after the English army encamped nearby at [[the Hirsel]] or Hare Craig. Although English artillery was placed to commence bombardment, no shot was fired by either side. [[Somerset Herald]] conveyed Lady Home's instructions to the reluctant garrison who would have preferred Lord Home's word. [[Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley|Sir Edward Sutton]], a cousin of the [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Earl of Warwick]], was made Captain of Hume, and received the keys from Andrew Home, [[Abbot of Jedburgh|Commendator of Jedburgh and Restennet]], on Thursday 22 September 1547.

The soldiers planned to rob him and change sides. Loyal members of the garrison fired the beacon and Sir John Ellerker's men arrested the would-be deserters. One was killed escaping, and [[William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton|Grey of Wilton]] planned to hang six of them, but the two leaders escaped into Scotland.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (1898), 76-7, 101: ''Calendar of State Papers Spain'', vol. 9 (London, 1912), 260.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of his father, captive in the [[Tower of London|Tower]], Alexander, the young [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home|5th Lord Home]], with the help of his brother Andrew the Commendator, recaptured the castle in December 1548.

[[Jean de Beaugu\u00e9]], a French soldier and writer, gave an account of the re-capture. He said that an inside-man let in seven Scots, and at night an eighth man climbed in. These then overwhelmed the garrison.

The Earls of Home had already established a new seat at [[The Hirsel]] by 1611. However, the castle finally succumbed to the forces of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] in 1650 during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. [[James Home, 3rd Earl of Home|James, 3rd Earl of Home]] was a prominent member of the [[Kirk Party]], and after Cromwell's successful investiture of  [[Edinburgh Castle]], he sent [[George Fenwick (Parliamentarian)|Colonel George Fenwick]] to beset the Earl's Castle with two regiments. Catherine Morrison, the Lady of Wedderburn, paid \u00a36 to bring cannon to defend Hume.<ref>HMC, ''Home of Wedderburn'', (1902), 102</ref> [[John Cockburn (Scottish officer)|Colonel John Cockburn]], the castle's Scottish governor,<ref>Cockburn, Sir Robert, and Harry A. Cockburn, ''The Records of the Cockburn Family'', T. N. Foulis, London, 1913.</ref> engaged in witty repartee with the [[Roundheads]], but refused to deliver the castle. Colonel Cockburn feigned that he had no idea who Cromwell was and that the castle stood on a rock. He then sent a note to Fenwick with the following doggerel: \n:\"I, Will of the Wastle\n:Am King of my castle\n:All the dogs in the town \n:Shall gare gang me down!\"<ref name=humehistory>{{cite web |url=http://humecastle.org/castle-history/ |title=Castle History |publisher=Hume Castle Preservation Trust  |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever once the bombardment began, it became clear  that there was no option but submission. Fenwick's troops entered the castle, and accepted Cockburn's surrender. Cockburn and his men were given quarter for life only. They retreated and Fenwick [[slighting|slighted]] the fortification.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/58561/hume-castle |title=Hume Castle |publisher=Historic Environment Scotland |work=Canmore |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Resurrection ===\n[[File:Hume Battlements.JPG|thumb|250px|Crenellation at Hume]]\nIn the early 18th century, Hume and its environs came into the possession of the [[Lord Polwarth|Earls of Marchmont]],  wealthier and more influential cadets of the main line of the family. The Castle at this point was level with the ground that it was built upon. \nAt some point before his death in 1794, Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, 3rd Lord Polwarth, restored the castle as a [[folly]], from the waste left from its destruction, on the original foundations of its [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. He adorned the wall tops with enormous [[crenellations]] that are  more picturesque than practical.\n\n=== The Great Alarm ===\nIn light of its function as a medi\u00e6val early warning system, the castle was used again as a beacon during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1804, on the night of 31 January, a sergeant of the Berwickshire Volunteers in charge of the beacon mistook charcoal burners' fires on nearby [[Dirrington Great Law]] for a warning. Lighting the beacon at Hume Castle, he set in train the lighting of all the Borders beacons to the West, and 3,000 volunteers turned out in what became known as 'The Great Alarm'.<ref name=humehistory/>\n\nAgain, during the [[Second World War]] it functioned as a lookout post, and was also to act as a base for resistance in the event of a German invasion.\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe castle is still seen as the spiritual home of the many Homes and Humes in Scotland and abroad. The castle was bought by the state in 1929, and in 1985 a restoration programme was undertaken by the [[Berwickshire Civic Society]] funded by the [[Scottish Office]]. It re-opened to the public in 1992. \nIn 2006 the Civic Society handed over the castle to a charitable trust run by the Clan Home Association, under the auspices of [[Historic Scotland]], to maintain its preservation in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humecastle.org/ |title=Welcome to the Hume Castle Preservation Trust |publisher=Hume Castle Preservation Trust  |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of places in the Scottish Borders]]\n*[[Clan Home]]\n*[[Hume (surname)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Ordnance Gazetteer-Scotland Vol IV,ed.

In Jean's account the man who climbed the wall was a Home, aged 60.<ref>Beaugu\u00e9, Jean de, ''History of the Campaigns of 1548 and 1549'', (1707), 77-82.</ref> Sutton was still a prisoner at the end of the war, and the [[Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]] was asked to organise his release by the exchange of French hostages.<ref>John Roche Dasent, ''Acts of the Privy Council'', vol. 2, HMSO (1890), 421.</ref>\n\nMariotta, Lady Home, sent the news to [[Mary of Guise]] on 28 December 1548 from Edinburgh. [[Regent Arran]] thanked John Hume of Cowdenknowes for his service recovering the castle.

The Earls of Home had already established a new seat at [[The Hirsel]] by 1611. However, the castle finally succumbed to the forces of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] in 1650 during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. [[James Home, 3rd Earl of Home|James, 3rd Earl of Home]] was a prominent member of the [[Kirk Party]], and after Cromwell's successful investiture of  [[Edinburgh Castle]], he sent [[George Fenwick (Parliamentarian)|Colonel George Fenwick]] to beset the Earl's Castle with two regiments. Catherine Morrison, the Lady of Wedderburn, paid \u00a36 to bring cannon to defend Hume.<ref>HMC, ''Home of Wedderburn'', (1902), 102</ref> [[John Cockburn (Scottish officer)|Colonel John Cockburn]], the castle's Scottish governor,<ref>Cockburn, Sir Robert, and Harry A. Cockburn, ''The Records of the Cockburn Family'', T. N. Foulis, London, 1913.</ref> engaged in witty repartee with the [[Roundheads]], but refused to deliver the castle. Colonel Cockburn feigned that he had no idea who Cromwell was and that the castle stood on a rock. He then sent a note to Fenwick with the following doggerel: \n:\"I, Will of the Wastle\n:Am King of my castle\n:All the dogs in the town \n:Shall gare gang me down!\"<ref name=humehistory>{{cite web |url=http://humecastle.org/castle-history/ |title=Castle History |publisher=Hume Castle Preservation Trust  |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever once the bombardment began, it became clear  that there was no option but submission. Fenwick's troops entered the castle, and accepted Cockburn's surrender. Cockburn and his men were given quarter for life only. They retreated and Fenwick [[slighting|slighted]] the fortification.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/58561/hume-castle |title=Hume Castle |publisher=Historic Environment Scotland |work=Canmore |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Resurrection ===\n[[File:Hume Battlements.JPG|thumb|250px|Crenellation at Hume]]\nIn the early 18th century, Hume and its environs came into the possession of the [[Lord Polwarth|Earls of Marchmont]],  wealthier and more influential cadets of the main line of the family. The Castle at this point was level with the ground that it was built upon. \nAt some point before his death in 1794, Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, 3rd Lord Polwarth, restored the castle as a [[folly]], from the waste left from its destruction, on the original foundations of its [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. He adorned the wall tops with enormous [[crenellations]] that are  more picturesque than practical.\n\n=== The Great Alarm ===\nIn light of its function as a medi\u00e6val early warning system, the castle was used again as a beacon during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1804, on the night of 31 January, a sergeant of the Berwickshire Volunteers in charge of the beacon mistook charcoal burners' fires on nearby [[Dirrington Great Law]] for a warning. Lighting the beacon at Hume Castle, he set in train the lighting of all the Borders beacons to the West, and 3,000 volunteers turned out in what became known as 'The Great Alarm'.<ref name=humehistory/>\n\nAgain, during the [[Second World War]] it functioned as a lookout post, and was also to act as a base for resistance in the event of a German invasion.\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe castle is still seen as the spiritual home of the many Homes and Humes in Scotland and abroad. The castle was bought by the state in 1929, and in 1985 a restoration programme was undertaken by the [[Berwickshire Civic Society]] funded by the [[Scottish Office]]. It re-opened to the public in 1992. \nIn 2006 the Civic Society handed over the castle to a charitable trust run by the Clan Home Association, under the auspices of [[Historic Scotland]], to maintain its preservation in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humecastle.org/ |title=Welcome to the Hume Castle Preservation Trust |publisher=Hume Castle Preservation Trust  |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of places in the Scottish Borders]]\n*[[Clan Home]]\n*[[Hume (surname)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Ordnance Gazetteer-Scotland Vol IV,ed.

There are many different stories about her from different states and countries.\n\nAfter her father dies from being pushed off of a train, she is forced into servitude in her own home and is constantly tormented by her evil stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella. Despite this, she maintains hope through her dreams and remains a kind, gentle and sweet person. She has faith that someday her dreams of happiness will come true and her kindness will be repaid. Cinderella is shown to have a down-to-earth attitude, but she is also a daydreamer. For example, in \"Sing Sweet Nightingale\", she becomes distracted with the bubbles, allowing Lucifer the cat to smudge the floor she was cleaning. Also, after hearing that the Grand Duke is traveling the kingdom with the missing slipper, she dreamily dances back to the attic humming the song she heard at the ball. She is also shown to have a sarcastic side and a sharp wit.\n\nWith the help of her animal friends, she fixes up an old dress of her mother's so she can attend a royal ball. However, when her evil stepsisters brutally tear the dress apart, she is heartbroken and fears that her dreams will never come true.\n\nHowever, her Fairy Godmother appears, restoring Cinderella's hope by transforming her torn homemade gown into her now-iconic silver (powder blue in the shadows) ball gown with a glittering puffed over-skirt, a delicate laced white petticoat and puffy sleeves. She wears her hair in a French twist supported by a silver headband and her accessories include silver opera gloves, a black choker, and glass slippers.\nAs a servant, she wears her hair down in a ponytail, sometimes supported by a white scarf and wears a brown dress with a powder blue blouse, a white apron, and black flats.\n\nShe was voiced by [[Ilene Woods]] in the original film and later [[Jennifer Hale]] in the sequels. \n\nIn the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action film]], '''Ella''' was the character's original name, ''Cinderella'' was instead a spiteful nickname given by the stepsisters to Ella after she slept near the fireplace and subsequently covered by ''cinder'' (ash). In the film, Eloise Webb portrayed the 10-year old Ella in the prologue, with [[Lily James]] portrayed the older Ella.\n\n==Jaq and Gus==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Jaq \n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ward Kimball]]<br>[[John Lounsbery]]\n| voice = [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]]<br> (in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Rob Paulsen]]<br> (in sequels)\n| alias = Jaq-Jaq\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Gus \n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ward Kimball]]<br>[[John Lounsbery]]\n| voice = [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] <br>(in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Corey Burton]]<br> (in sequels)\n| alias = Gus-Gus\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Jaq''' (real name '''Jacques''') and '''Gus''' (real name '''Octavius''') are two mice who serve as Cinderella's sidekicks. Gus has a penchant for cheese.\n\nIn the first film, [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] rescues the mice from traps and the cat Lucifer and dresses and feeds them. They perform many favors in return. Jaq seems to be one of the leaders of the mice, planning strategies to avoid the cat, sneak food, and help Cinderella with her ball gown. The other mice gladly follow his lead. Jaq is thin, with scruffy hair, and speaks a fast kind of [[pidgin]] English. Gus appears in the first scene of the film, trapped shivering in a cage where Jaq finds him and brings Cinderella to rescue him. Cinderella names him \"Octavius,\" and calls him \"Gus\" for short. This is an example of an [[inside joke]] among the writers and (some) viewers of the movie. Gus is actually short for Augustus. In ancient Rome, Octavius was renamed Augustus when he became emperor. Hence Octavius - Augustus - Gus. Jaq explains the situation to Gus, that Cinderella wants to help him, and Gus catches on and joins the mouse troop. Gus has a large belly that pokes out of his yellow shirt and seems to be a bit slow on the pickup, but brave in a pinch, and speaks even more broken English than Jaq, who calls him \"Gus-Gus\".\n\nJaq and Gus are two of four mice that the Fairy Godmother transforms into stallions so that Cinderella can attend the ball, but at the stroke of midnight, they are transformed back into mice. Later, Jaq and Gus are responsible for stealing the key to Cinderella's room from the wicked stepmother, [[Lady Tremaine]], and freeing Cinderella to try on the glass slipper, which of course fits. While trying to steal the key, Jaq is stuck in [[Lady Tremaine]]'s pocket and gets knocked around as she pats the key. Gus gets trapped in a tea cup and [[Lady Tremaine]] offers some tea to the Duke, with Gus inside. She begins to pour tea into the cup and it drops towards Gus's large belly. Gus sucks in his belly to survive, trembling and sweating, but in a moment the Duke says he wants none, the tea lifts, and Gus is safe (though he gets his butt burnt by the tea later when they get the key). They are last seen in the film in tiny palace uniforms, eating and waving at the wedding of Cinderella and [[#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]].\n\nIn ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'', Gus and Jaq were also present, living in the castle along with all the other mice. It was Gus' idea to make the new book of stories to replace the old one. In Cinderella's Story, Jaq and Gus helped Cinderella to prepare for the ball and gave her support when she doubted her abilities. In Jaq's Story, Jaq, feeling useless, wishes that he were a human; Fairy Godmother grants this wish and Jaq tries to help Cinderella and the others prepare for the fair until he realizes he liked being a mouse better and returns to normal. In [[#Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]]'s Story, they attempt to help their old nemesis Lucifer win the affections of a snobby female cat named Pom Pom (the mice's, and probably Bruno's, new nemesis) in the castle in the hopes the cats will then leave the mice alone.\n\nIn ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', Gus and Jaq make their opening appearance helping the fairy godmother prepare for the prince and Cinderella's anniversary party. After Lady Tremaine reversed time and made the slipper fit Anastasia's foot, they helped Cinderella search for the prince, (wreaking havoc in the palace kitchen in the process). They discover Lady Tremaine's use of dark magic by witnessing her cast a spell on the prince to forget Cinderella (and think that he danced with [[Anastasia]]). In a plan to steal the wand back, they succeed in taking the wand from Lady Tremaine, but she has Cinderella arrested with a banishment sentence before she can lift the spell on the prince. Gus and Jaq manage to convince the prince that Cinderella is the right girl through a catchy showtune, \"At the Ball\". They later help Cinderella put on her wedding gown, but the three are magically sent away by Lady Tremaine, who assigns Lucifer the cat to drive them in a pumpkin carriage over a cliff. After they narrowly escape their deaths, Cinderella, Jaq, and Gus return to the palace where the mice attack the entrance guards to let Cinderella through to the wedding. The mice are last seen in ''Cinderella III'' during the [[closing credits]] in a picture with a very decorated king, one with them stuffed with cheese, Gus in a rather sophisticated uniform, and the final picture in a photo booth style series with Cinderella, the prince, and the two mice.\n\nJaq and Gus also appeared in the [[Grandma Duck]] comics in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' where they live with Grandma Duck and her grandnephew [[Gus Goose]]. At some time before then, they crossed paths with [[Donald Duck]] and [[Daisy Duck]]. They appeared in one [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] adventure titled ''Mousepotamia'' where they appear to be the same size as Mickey rather than standard mouse size.\n\nJaq appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]], and was one of the first new confirmed characters, while Gus is absent. He finds Ventus, shrunk down to 3 in (10&nbsp;cm) by the Fairy Godmother, placed in a mousetrap, and helps free him, marking the beginning of their friendship. Ventus later helps him gather the necessary materials for Cinderella's dress, and despite a fight between Ventus and Lucifer, they succeed. Later on, while Cinderella is locked in her room by Lady Tremaine, Jaq attempts to get the key to her room up the stairs and is protected by Aqua when the Unversed ambush him. Jaq succeeds and the slipper fits Cinderella perfectly. In the original film they were both voiced by [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]]; in the sequels, Jaq is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]] and Gus is voiced by [[Corey Burton]].\n\nIn the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 remake]], Jaq is changed to a doe (female mouse) named Jacqueline; Gus remains male but is referred to as Gus-Gus.\n\n==Lady Tremaine==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5599EE\n| name        = Lady Tremaine\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]]\n| lbl1        = Based on\n| data1       = The Wicked Stepmother from [[Charles Perrault]]'s [[Cinderella|fairy tale]]\n| portrayer   = [[Cate Blanchett]] <br><small>([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])</small><br />[[Gabrielle Anwar]]<br><small>([[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]])</small>\n| voice       = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Eleanor Audley]] <br>(in ''Cinderella'')<br>[[Susanne Blakeslee]]<br> (in sequels)\n}}\n| nickname    = Madame Tremaine\n| occupation  = [[Socialite]]\n| affiliation = [[List of Disney villains|Disney villains]]\n| title       = The Wicked Stepmother\n| spouse      = Cinderella's father {{small|(deceased)}}<br>Sir Francis Tremaine {{small|(deceased)}}\n| family = Cinderella (step-daughter)<br>Anastasia and Drizella Tremaine (daughters)<br>Prince Charming (step-son-in-law)<br>The Baker (son-in-law)<br>Anthony Tremaine (grandson, ''Descendants'')<br>Dizzy Tremaine (granddaughter, ''Descendants'')\n}}\n'''Lady Tremaine''' (also known as '''the Wicked [[Stepfamily|Stepmother]]''' or '''Cinderella's stepmother''') is the main antagonist of the franchise. She is based on the original character from the Cinderella [[fairy tale]] created by [[Charles Perrault]]. Animators [[Ollie Johnston]] and [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], in their book ''The Disney Villain'', describe animating Audley's voice as \"a difficult assignment but a thrilling one, working to that voice track with so much innuendo mixed in with the fierce power.\" In contrast to the broad treatment given to some of the other characters, Lady Tremaine was animated in malevolent and subtle realism.<ref name=archives>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Lady Tremaine and Stepsisters Character History| url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/tremaine/tremaine.html}}</ref>\n\nA cruel, cold, and calculating tyrant, Lady Tremaine wants nothing more than her daughters to succeed. Unlike most Disney villains, who sport fiery personalities and desire power and the spotlight, she possesses a more cunning, subtle, [[passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive]] personality with a shrewd intelligence and ability for manipulation, particularly towards her daughters. She rarely yells, speaking in a calm, collected voice, even when angered. She wishes her daughters to succeed so that she may reap the benefits when it best suits her.\n\nShe is introduced in the prologue of the film. Cinderella's father, a [[widow]]er anxious for his daughter to have a mother figure, married Lady Tremaine, whom the narrator describes as \"a woman of good family\". She was a [[widow]] herself, with two daughters from her first marriage. After an unspecified amount of time living happily together as a family, Cinderella's father tragically died and Lady Tremaine revealed her true colors. She lets the chateau fall into disrepair while pampering her own selfishly spoiled daughters and forcing Cinderella to become a maid in her own home. Lady Tremaine allows Cinderella to attend the Royal Ball, on the condition that Cinderella finishes all her chores and finds a suitable dress. When Cinderella actually finishes her work and appears ready for the Ball in a suitable dress, Lady Tremaine mildly mentions the beads and sash that Jaq and Gus found after Anastasia and Drizella threw them out. Enraged, her daughters cruelly tear apart Cinderella's dress, leaving her unable to attend the ball. When Cinderella, with the help of a [[#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]], nevertheless attends the ball, her stepfamily does not recognize her, but Lady Tremaine notes a familiarity about her appearance as she dances with [[#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]].\n\nNews promptly arrives by way of a Royal Proclamation that the Prince will marry the girl whose foot fits the glass slipper accidentally left behind by Cinderella at the ball. Lady Tremaine overhears Cinderella dreamily humming the song \"So This is Love\" as she heads to the attic, and realizes that she was the mysterious girl at the ball. Hoping to pass off one of her daughters as the mysterious girl, Lady Tremaine follows Cinderella up to the attic and locks her in her room, putting the key in her pocket. However, two of Cinderella's mice friends, [[#Gus and Jaq|Gus and Jaq]], steal the key from the stepmother's pocket (after Lady Tremaine almost boils Gus in a tea cup) and succeed in returning the key to Cinderella, who rushes downstairs to the Grand Duke just as he and the footman are about to leave. Lady Tremaine attempts to convince the Duke that Cinderella is merely a lowly [[scullery maid]] who did not even attend the ball. But the Duke, who is required by the King's Royal Proclamation not to skip a single maiden in the kingdom on his quest for the mysterious girl the Prince danced with, solemnly rebuffs Lady Tremaine. The Duke also finds Cinderella strikingly familiar to him. He proceeds to try the glass slipper on Cinderella. In a last-ditch effort to foil Cinderella's dreams, Lady Tremaine trips the footman bearing the glass slipper, causing it to smash. She deviously grins with wicked satisfaction as the Duke wails in despair and fear of the King's reaction when he finds out that the slipper was broken. But Cinderella still manages to come out on top by revealing that she has the other slipper, and that it fits her foot, proving that she is the girl who danced with Prince Charming, much to her stepmother's appalled horror. Beyond a single brief close-up of her appalled face, the movie does not dwell on her defeat, how she and her daughters further reacted or what happened to them; instead there is only a quick resolution where Cinderella is shown as the Prince's happy bride, her stepfamily out of the picture.\n\nLady Tremaine made her second appearance in the [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'', this time voiced by [[Susanne Blakeslee]]. In this film, she only appeared in the ''An Uncommon Romance'' segment, where Anastasia has to go against her mother for the first time. A likable, slightly plump humble baker falls in love with Anastasia, as does she with him. Lady Tremaine and Drizella do everything they can to thwart this romance, but Cinderella encourages Anastasia to follow her own heart (which she does).\n\nHer latest animated appearance was in the second direct-to-video ''Cinderella'' sequel, ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', again voiced by Blakeslee, wherein she resumes her role as the pivotal antagonist. This time, she acquires the Fairy Godmother's magic wand after Anastasia finds it. Lady Tremaine, strangely still bent on ruining Cinderella's life (in what she believes to be revenge) then uses the wand to reverse time to undo Cinderella's \"happily ever after\"; she manipulates the glass slipper to fit Anastasia so that Cinderella never gets to try on the slipper herself, then she brainwashes the Prince into forgetting Cinderella and marrying Anastasia. When Cinderella tries to set things right, Lady Tremaine thwarts her efforts, aided by the magic wand. Ultimately, Anastasia is her mother's undoing; feeling guilty about marrying someone she does not love and who does not love her, she rejects the Prince at the altar, to Cinderella's amazement. Furious at Anastasia's sudden conscience, and still intent on fulfilling her desire for revenge on Cinderella, Lady Tremaine emerges from her hiding place and begins turning some of the palace guards into farm animals. She then resolves to destroy Cinderella's happy ending and also get revenge on Anastasia for trying to fix it by turning both of them into toads, but the Prince defends the two from the spell and reflects it back with his sword, turning Lady Tremaine and Drizella into toads instead. Anastasia then gives the magic wand to Cinderella so that she can undo all the wrongs that had been committed. During the end credits, Lady Tremaine and Drizella have been restored, but are wearing [[scullery maid|scullery]] clothes identical to those Cinderella used to wear, implying that they will be working in the palace as servants as their punishment.\n\nAside from the films, Lady Tremaine has also made various appearances on the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]''; she frequently shares a table with another famous wicked stepmother, [[Queen Grimhilde]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. Again, in these appearances, she is voiced by Susan Blakeslee. She also makes an appearance in the ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' Special Edition DVD in one of the menus.\n\nShe appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', along with Anastasia and Drizella. In the game, she is much crueler and is even hinted to be a [[Cruelty|sadist]]. She plays out the same role as in the film, only this time, the extreme darkness in her heart creates two Unversed, fuelled by her hatred of Cinderella. Aqua makes note of this as she passes Lady Tremaine, and later goes to the Tremaines' chateau to assassinate her and her daughters before their darkness kills anyone, but the Fairy Godmother stops her, advising her that Light and Darkness must co-exist. After the slipper fits Cinderella, Lady Tremaine gives into her fury once again and her negativity transforms Cinderella's pumpkin coach into a giant Unversed, the Cursed Coach, who is then sent to [[Filicide|murder the now-freed Cinderella]]. When Aqua jumps in and rescues Cinderella, the Cursed Coach accidentally drops a fire bomb in front of Lady Tremaine and her daughters, which explodes and (as revealed in ''Kingdom Hearts III'') turns them into Heartless.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Eleanor Audley]] in the original film, and by [[Susanne Blakeslee]] in subsequent appearances.\n\nIn the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action version]], Lady Tremaine was portrayed by [[Cate Blanchett]]. A woman of grace and refinement, she married Ella's father for the sake of her daughters; shortly after her first husband, Sir Francis Tremaine, died. At first, Lady Tremaine did not seem to bear any particular animosity towards Ella, but her jealousy and spite was incited after overhearing a private conversation in which it was confirmed that her second husband loved his biological daughter more than he did her, and that he still cherished the memory of his first wife. After he died while on a business trip, Lady Tremaine was hurt and jealous that his dying words had only been of Ella and her mother. Revealing her true colors, she takes her jealousy out on Ella, firing all of the servants and forcing Ella to take up most of their duties. She even joins in her daughters' childish taunting of Ella, and mocks her as \"Cinderella\". When she and her daughters are getting ready to go to the ball, Ella comes downstairs at the last minute, wearing a gown of her mother's. Lady Tremaine rips one of the sleeves and encourages her daughters to help her tear the dress apart. At the ball, she is as mystified as all the other guests when a mysterious girl in a blue gown enraptures Kit (the Fairy Godmother having cast an additional spell to prevent Ella's step-family recognizing her), but realizes that it's really Ella based on her attitude after the ball. The next morning, she discovers a glass slipper hidden in the attic. Knowing that the other slipper will fit Ella, she demands that Ella make her the head of the royal household and to ensure that Drisella and Anastasia find proper husbands. Ella rejects this out of hand, telling her that she isn't about to let Kit fall into her stepmother's clutches after she failed to protect her father. An enraged Lady Tremaine locks Ella in the attic and shatters the slipper. She then blackmails the Grand Duke into ensuring that she will become a [[countess]] and that her daughters will get wealthy husbands, in return for keeping the secret so that Kit can be married to a princess from another kingdom, as his father had originally intended. When the Captain finds Ella hidden in the attic, Lady Tremaine initially tells the Captain that as her mother, she will not allow Ella to try it on. Ella curtly tells her that she is not, nor will she ever will be, her mother. Ella leaves with Kit after forgiving her stepmother. The Tremaines leave the kingdom with the Grand Duke, never to return.\n\nIn ''Disney Descendants: Isle of the Lost'' (novel), Lady Tremaine obtains a grandson, Anthony, by one of her children and several granddaughters (referred to as the step-granddaughters) and teaches \"Evil 101\" on the Isle of the Lost. Lady Tremaine has a voice cameo in the sequel ''[[Descendants 2]]'' as she yells at her granddaughter Dizzy to be quiet, but the actress that voiced her was uncredited. She makes a physical appearance in ''[[Descendants 3]]'', portrayed by Linda Ko.\n\n==Anastasia Tremaine==\n{{Anchor|Anastasia Tremaine}} <!-- redirect target -->\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Anastasia Tremaine\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ollie Johnston]]\n| voice = [[Lucille Bliss]] <br>(in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Tress MacNeille]] <br>(in sequels) <br> [[Lesli Margherita]] <br>(singing voice in sequels)\n| portrayer = [[Holliday Grainger]] <br>([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])\n| family      = Sir Francis Tremaine (father, deceased)<br>Lady Tremaine (mother) <br> Drizella Tremaine (sister) <br> Cinderella's father (step-father, deceased) <br> [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] (step-sister) <br> [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]] (step-brother-in-law)\n| spouse = The Baker\n| children    = Anthony Tremaine (''Descendants'')\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Anastasia Tremaine''' is the [[red hair|redheaded]] younger [[daughter]] of [[Lady Tremaine]].<ref>Pat Williams, James Denney, and Jim Denney, How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Magic Every Day of Your Life (HCI, 2004)</ref> Though following the original story's depiction of the ugly and cruel stepsister in the first film, Anastasia becomes a more sympathetic character in later Disney sequels, depicted as struggling to find genuine love and follow her conscience despite her mother and sister's negative influence and scheming. Pat Williams, James Denney, and Jim Denney report that actress \"Lucille Bliss was the voice of Cinderella's stepsister, Anastasia, an experience that remains one of her fondest memories.\" The actress explains, \"I was just a teenager when I got the part...I read that Walt had personally selected me for the part of Anastasia.\"<ref>Pat Williams, James Denney, and Jim Denney, ''How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Magic Every Day of Your Life'' (HCI, 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lSJIngvkCsAC&pg=PA161&dq=Anastasia+%22Lucille+Bliss%22&ei=GZITSqj9AqKuzAS99oGjCw Google Books Search]</ref>\n\nIn ''Cinderella'', Anastasia is demanding and whiny, but not as bad as Drizella. Anastasia also has enormous feet. During their music lesson, Anastasia plays the [[flute]] as Drizella sings but in the sequels she has a beautiful singing voice. Anastasia quarrels with her sister often, though they are united in their jealousy of and contempt for Cinderella. Anastasia's most common [[dress]] attire is a [[pink]] dress with fuchsia bodice with a lighter pink skirt and fuchsia slippers which she wears with  white collar and petticoat. and a [[sun]]ny coloured hair bow and wears pink [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] underneath. Her hair is tied to sausage curls longer than Drizella's, flowing on her shoulders. Her ball dress is [[lavender (color)|lavender]] and has a purple bustle, a [[violet (color)|violet]] bodice, choker and slippers  and wears a green feather on her head instead of her gold headpiece and her curls are shorter than before. However, unlike Drizella, Anastasia's hair style changes throughout the film. In the very beginning, her hair is much shorter and the ringlets are tied back behind her head. When she sleeps and is preparing for the ball, Anastasia's hair is put into a bun. During the first film, she was seen as physically ugly, however in the sequels, she blossomed into a more beautiful young woman as her inner goodness developed.\n\nIn ''Cinderella II'', Anastasia is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, following the latter-day tradition of setting a stepsister on a redemptive path. She falls in love with a working-class [[baker]] and wants to get close to him, but her mother refuses to allow her to because of her own prejudices towards the baker's social standing. [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] reassures Anastasia that the baker is a good man, regardless of what Lady Tremaine thinks, and encourages Anastasia to follow her heart. With the help of Cinderella, Anastasia gets a make-over and becomes more beautiful, although her new looks never approach the same level as Cinderella. With help from Cinderella and her animal friends, Anastasia and the baker are reunited and reconciled, they attend Cinderella's [[Ball (dance)|ball]], where Anastasia thanks her for her help.\n\nIn ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time'', Anastasia is shown not only to have compassion for Cinderella, but to also have a conscience. She unintentionally gains access to Cinderella's fairy godmother's wand, which sets in motion her mother's nefarious plot to destroy Cinderella's \"happily ever after\" and gain access to an opulent lifestyle at the palace. As she is manipulated into marrying the Prince as a means to fulfill her mother and sister's selfish desires, Anastasia begins to feel remorse and guilt. At the altar, realizing she does not truly love the Prince and having understood what true love really means after she talked with the King, Anastasia refuses to marry him and steps aside for Cinderella, to her amazement. After a tense standoff with Lady Tremaine and Drizella, where Cinderella protects Anastasia for her honesty, and the two evil ladies were turned in toads after the spell went against them, Anastasia acquires the wand, sets everything right and makes peace with Cinderella, who subsequently invites her to stay in the castle to be her [[Lady-in-waiting]] which she happily accepts. This repentant act excludes her from the punishment that is seen to befall her mother and sister as Cinderella believes that Anastasia only tried to go through with Lady Tremaine's plot because she was also emotionally abused and manipulated by her mother and she truly still had a kind heart in the end; at the close of the film, they have been reduced to working as servants at the palace. During the credits, a picture shows Anastasia sitting in the palace garden while gazing happily at the baker with whom she fell in love in the second film.\n\nOver the films she gradually becomes less 'ugly' and more snub-nosed, chubby-faced, 'sweet', although never approaching Cinderella's beauty, becoming 'plain' instead of downright 'ugly'. This is partly because she smiles more and partly due to the animators' efforts.\n\n''Variety'' asserts that \"stepsister Anastasia is appreciably more sympathetic\" in ''Cinderella III''.<ref>Joe Leydon, \"[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932673.html?categoryid=1023&cs=1 Review of ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time''],\" ''Variety'' (February 5, 2007).</ref>  At [[Walt Disney World]] during the Cinderella's Gala Feast attraction, Julie and Mike Neal declare that \"everyone will love Anastasia and Drizella, Cinderella's evil stepsisters, who wander the room with Lady Tremaine...\"<ref>Julie Neal and Mike Neal, ''The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World 2008'' (Coconut Press, 2007), 314.</ref>\n\nShe appears in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'' in her homeworld, Castle of Dreams, with her family, playing out the same role as in the original film, except for the strong darkness in her heart nearly causing her to sadistically murder Cinderella before the Cursed Coach drops a bomb on her and her blood family, destroying their bodies and causing them to become Heartless.\n\nA 2015 live-action version of ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]'' featured Anastasia in the same role as the classic story. She was portrayed by [[Holliday Grainger]].

Her name is spelled \"Drisella\" in the 2015 Disney [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella film]].

For the palace ball, she wears a pale green gown with aqua bustle, pale green sleeves, and a jade green bodice, choker, and slippers and a second jade green bustle under the aqua one and wears a turquoise feather instead of a bow in her hair. In her second movie, her ribbon changes to pale blue. After her downfall she is reduced to wearing a maid servant's frock. In live appearances, and in many book illustrations, Drizella wears a dress similar to that shown for the palace ball in the first film and wears green slippers and green [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] underneath. Like her sister, Drizella has enormous feet.\n\nShe is portrayed as haughty, abusive, and sadistically cruel. She sets so many bad examples of spitefulness towards Cinderella for her younger sister to follow, that between them Anastasia's the better of the two. Highly unorganized, and, in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, murderous, she is contemptuously envious of [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]]'s success and [[beauty]] and often gets her into trouble. Unlike her younger sister [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]], who changes her spiteful ways and develops into a kind and good-natured woman, Drizella remains mean-spirited and cruel, and never overcomes her hatred of Cinderella. She is also depicted as having slovenly eating habits in the third movie, where she samples the food and the wedding cake being prepared for her sister's wedding by shoving handfuls of it into her face and eating them noisily. In the sequels, though not in the original film, Drizella is essentially a younger version of her mother.\n\nDrizella and her mother constantly plot to ruin Cinderella's life and have no qualms about hurting her feelings. Lady Tremaine is well aware of her older daughter's harsh and cold-hearted \u2013 and even violent \u2013 mannerisms, and can trigger Drizella's anger with a mere handful of casually delivered words. In a particularly distressing scene in the original film, as Lady Tremaine and her daughters prepare to leave for the Prince's ball, Cinderella appears wearing her beautiful homemade gown. Lady Tremaine notes that Cinderella is wearing [[bead]]s that belonged to Drizella, who rejected them on the claims she was sick of the sight of them. After Lady Tremaine casually points out to Drizella that the beads add a charming touch to the dress, Drizella flies into a rage and violently yanks the beads from Cinderella's neck, and along with Anastasia, lunges upon her stepsister and tears her gown to rags, leaving Cinderella devastated.\n\nLater on throughout the series, Drizella turns on Anastasia and torments her, being able to physically intimidate her. Although she seems to be awed by her during the story ''An Uncommon Romance'', after Anastasia openly rebelled against their overbearing mother and told her she was in love with a [[baker]] of low-birth and that she was happier with him than she would ever be with the wealthy suitor Lady Tremaine had hoped she would encounter at another palace ball. Angered, Lady Tremaine stormed off, leaving Drizella stunned, though she sided with her mother and returned home with her.\n\nUnlike Anastasia, who eventually liberates herself from her mother's domination, Drizella obeys her mother's every order and schemes with her to undermine her hated stepsister, Cinderella, though they are foiled by Anastasia and as punishment, they are removed of their wealth and status and are reduced to working as [[scullery maid]]s in Cinderella's palace.\n\nLike her mother and sister, she appears in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'', playing the same role as in the original film. However, unlike in the films, she is very sadistic and is willing to murder Cinderella to prevent her from ever getting her happiness, and nearly succeeds with the Cursed Coach. However, Aqua manages to save her, and Drizella is hit by a firebomb alongside her mother and sister, causing their eternal plunge into the Realm of Darkness as powerful Heartless, a fate later shared with [[Tangled|Mother Gothel]] and [[Hans (Disney)|Prince Hans]].\n\nShe was voiced by [[Rhoda Williams]] in the original film and by [[Russi Taylor]] in the sequels.\n\nIn the 2015 live-action version of ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]'', the \"z\" in Drizella was replaced by an \"s\" to reflect the British stereotype. '''Drisella''' was portrayed by [[Sophie McShera]]. Like her mother and sister, Drizella left the kingdom with the Grand Duke never to return.\n\nWhile Drizella does not appear in ''[[Descendants 2]]'', the film does feature her daughter, Dizzy, who is a hair stylist on the Isle of the Lost who helps Mal regain her signature purple hair when she leaves Auradon. After the threat posed by Uma has been dealt with, Evie and Mal ask that Dizzy be the next 'villain kid' to be released from the Isle, with Dizzy expressing great enthusiasm for the offer.\n\n==Prince Charming==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Prince Charming\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Milt Kahl]]\n| voice = [[William Edward Phipps|William Phipps]] (in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Mike Douglas]] (singing in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] (in sequels) <br> Matt Nolan (''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'')\n| portrayer = [[Richard Madden]] <br>([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])\n| alias       =\n| spouse      = [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]]\n| family = The King and Queen (parents)<br>Lady Tremaine (step-mother-in-law)<br>Anastasia and Drizella Tremaine (step-sisters-in-law)\n| children    = Chad Charming (Descendants)\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''[[Prince Charming]]''' is Cinderella's love interest. He is a dark-haired, tall, and handsome young man. In the first film, he has no given name. Cinderella's prince is never actually identified in the film as \"Prince Charming\", nor is there any clear reason why he has come to be known by that title in the Disney vernacular. The only media where he is referred to as \"Prince Charming\" as of today is ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' and the attraction ''[[Prince Charming Regal Carrousel]]''.\n\nDetermined to see grandchildren, the King organizes a ball for Prince Charming in an effort to cause his son to fall in love and marry, with every eligible maiden in the kingdom ordered to attend. At the ball, Prince Charming rejects every girl, until he sees Cinderella, with whom he is immediately smitten in love. The two dance throughout the castle grounds until the clock starts to chime midnight and Cinderella flees away from the castle, accidentally dropping one of her glass slippers. Prince Charming picks up the glass slipper and the next day a royal proclamation is issued, stating the Grand Duke will visit every house in the kingdom to find the girl who fits the glass slipper, so that she can be married to Prince Charming. After the slipper perfectly fits onto Cinderella's foot, Prince Charming marries her.\n\nPrince Charming has little involvement in the sequel, ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]''. In the third film, ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', while Prince Charming and Cinderella are celebrating the first anniversary of their wedding, Lady Tremaine gets possession of the Fairy Godmother's wand and reverses time, going back to the moment of the Duke's arrival at her manor with the glass slipper. Lady Tremaine then uses the wand to fit the slipper onto Anastasia's foot and make her marry Prince Charming. When he sees Anastasia, he is about to dismiss but Lady Tremaine uses the wand to make him forget about Cinderella completely and to marry Anastasia. Cinderella is later caught trying to get the wand from her stepmother, but she manages to touch Prince Charming's hand, and the connection they both feel confuses him. Prince Charming is then addressed by Gus and Jaq who confront him with their side of the story, using the other mended glass slipper as evidence. Prince Charming, although he still cannot remember her, believes the mice's tale and sets out to retrieve Cinderella before she sails off under Lady Tremaine's orders. The two lovers are reunited and get prepared for the wedding, but Lady Tremaine makes Anastasia to look exactly like Cinderella to take the real Cinderella's place during the wedding. When Anastasia hesitates during the wedding and says \"I don't\", Lady Tremaine aims the wand at both Cinderella and Anastasia. However, Prince Charming manages to step between them and blocks the magic with his sword, causing it to bounce back and transform Lady Tremaine and Drizella into toads. Prince Charming and Cinderella stay in this new timeline and get married again.\n\nHe appears in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'' along with his homeworld, playing out the same role as in the film. Just after Cinderella flees the ball, he briefly mistakes Aqua for Cinderella. In a scene which was originally intended for the film but deleted, Prince Charming and Cinderella are reunited after the slipper fits Cinderella's foot perfectly, and he embraces her lovingly. In the original film, his speaking is provided by [[William Edward Phipps|William Phipps]] while his singing is provided by [[Mike Douglas]]. He is later voiced by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] (who originally voiced Prince Eric from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') in the sequels. \n\nThe animated movies never made mention of his real name. An official advertisement from Disney France said \"The Prince's name is Henry\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Disney Soul|url=http://www.disneysoul.com/2012/09/se-descubre-el-autentico-nombre-del.html|accessdate=11 July 2013|language=spanish}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action film]], the prince was named '''Kit''' (a diminutive form of either Christopher or Christian) and portrayed by [[Richard Madden]]. In the film, Prince Kit and Cinderella first met in the woods without knowing each other's true identity, and took a liking to each other, with Cinderella believing that Kit is an apprentice training under his father without recognizing him as the prince. The desire to see Cinderella again was what caused Prince Kit to open the ball to commoners, Cinderella attending to find him rather than to meet the prince (not knowing they are the same person). Prince Kit also became king in the last one-third of the film after his father died from illness.\n\n==Lucifer==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Lucifer\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ward Kimball]]<br>[[John Lounsbery]]<br>[[Wolfgang Reitherman]]<br>[[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]]\n| voice = [[June Foray]] (in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Frank Welker]] (in sequels)\n| gender = Male\n| alias       =\n| noinfo = yes}}\n\n'''Lucifer''' is the Tremaines' pet cat and the third antagonist of the franchise. Tonally, his existence can be justified to provide a sinister and scheming opposing counterpart to Cinderella's loyal and good-natured pet dog Bruno as well as the birds and mice who are supportive and loving friends and allies of Cinderella. He has black fur and is depicted as a sly, wicked, and manipulative mouse consumer. In a particularly conniving scene in the beginning of the original film, Lucifer tries to rid the ch\u00e2teau's pet dog Bruno outside of the kitchen Lucifer is consuming his breakfast bowl of milk in, by scratching him painfully and slyly while Cinderella's back is momentarily turned away. Bruno then growls loudly and threateningly out of infuriation and pain, and Lucifer lets out a benign and exaggerated fake shriek of pain, as if ''Bruno'' scratched ''him''. Cinderella hears Lucifer's whining fake screech and blames Bruno, bitterly scolding him to go outside and to stop misbehaving, reasoning \"we have to at least ''try'', to get along together\". Back inside the kitchen, Lucifer wears a mischievous grin of wicked satisfaction, lazily licking his milk bowl, while Cinderella reprimands him with scorn and annoyance \"and that includes ''you'' too, ''your majesty!''\". He becomes very focused on catching the mice when provoked, but his attempts to catch them always end in a comical failure. First, in the first movie, that also the main antagonist, Jaq bravely makes a distraction to lure Lucifer away from the other mice's path to getting their breakfast. While returning with the mice, Gus struggles with carrying his load and easily grabs Lucifer's attention. Fortunately, and unexpectedly, Cinderella enters the room and accidentally takes Gus away on her breakfast serving platters for Lady Tremaine and her daughters. Tremaine's youngest daughter, Anastasia, is the dubious recipient of Gus, for the teacup he was hiding under was the one Cinderella served her. Lucifer knowingly puts his ear against all three of their closed doors to decipher Gus' location, and races over in delight to Anastasia's once he hears her scream of horror upon discovering the poor, frightened little mouse in her tea. Anastasia continues to scream wildly upon hastily accusing Cinderella of the perceived sabotage, and in severe distress and anguish, immediately notifies her mother, inciting an enormous frenzy, whereupon Cinderella is summoned to her stepmother's bedroom for a private talk. Lucifer slips into the room as well for a brief grooming by his malevolent owner, before she reprimands her stepdaughter with frigid ferocity. At the conclusion of this degrading and abusive private talk, after sadistically rattling off an inordinately long list of chores that Lady Tremaine is forcing Cinderella to complete, in a moment of amusing comical [[tongue-in-cheek]], the wicked stepmother muses \"and one more thing: see that Lucifer gets his ''bath\" ''at which the ears of the evil feline shoot straight up in horror, and he snarls at his owners quarrelsome request with repugnant disdain, which suggests that he dislikes baths or prefers to remain filthy.\n\nLucifer's next appearance in the film is when he encounters Jaq and Gus as they attempt to retrieve a sash and necklace of beads from a laundry pile, as part of making Cinderella's dress for the ball. At the start of the scene, Jaq and Gus assume they are alone and approach the sash, initially unaware that a slumbering Lucifer is lying on top of an ottoman directly above them. Once they realize that they are in fact not alone, they attempt to sneak past their foe while carrying the sash. Unfortunately, Lucifer's impeccable hearing ability picks up suspicious movement nearby and awakes, confused and a bit cranky. Jaq and Gus' cover is eventually blown, yet they still manage to slip the sash into their mouse hole, partly thanks to Lucifer's clumsiness. With the sash successfully obtained, Jaq and Gus shift their focus towards the bead necklace. Overcome with excitement, Gus blurts out the duo's desire to take the beads along with the sash. Determined not to fail this time around, Lucifer spots the necklace and immediately sits on it, awaiting the mice's next move. Now faced with an inevitable detour, Jaq formulates a plan, much to Gus' delight and Lucifer's suspicion. Jaq then fully exposes himself and starts casually walking in Lucifer's direction. Pleased with what he thinks is a surrender, Lucifer readies his paws and prepares for his pounce, unknowingly letting Jaq sneak directly behind him. His focus is then interrupted when he turns and is shocked to hear Jaq, now amidst the laundry pile at the other side of the room, humming to himself and biting off buttons of an overcoat. Jaq does so in the hopes of luring Lucifer away from the beads, thus giving Gus time to grab them and escape. Lucifer eventually catches on to this, and initially has trouble deciding on whether he should pursue Jaq or protect the necklace from Gus, standing by at the mouse hole. Lucifer ultimately figures out a way to accomplish both tasks and uses his tail to keep the necklace close to him as he moves towards Jaq. By the time Lucifer reaches Jaq, the witty little mouse launches a button that does no more than leave an imprint on the annoyed feline's nose. Shifting his attention completely on Jaq, Lucifer pounces on the pest and chases him into the heap of laundry, mainly into a light-blue nightgown. Finally sensing an opening, Gus makes his way to the necklace and struggles to get a grip on it. After a few more seconds of chasing, Lucifer temporarily emerges from the gown and examines it, attempting to get a better idea of where Jaq might be. Ironically, Jaq has hid himself in Lucifer's thick fur atop his head, using this pause to check on Gus. The portly mouse seems to be successfully making his way back to the mouse hole, but then suddenly slips on a bead, loses his footing, and slams into the far side wall, breaking the necklace into its several beads. Lucifer's attention briefly turns to the sudden disturbance, only to have Jaq intervene by keeping his eyes closed. Lucifer then tries to grab the intruder on his head, learns that the intruder was Jaq, and ultimately chases him back into the nightgown again. During this struggle, Gus begins picking up the beads, one by one, and placing them into his hat. The struggle in the laundry pile reaches its end, this time by Jaq making an escape out of one the nightgown's sleeves, with Lucifer close behind. Being evidently far too large for such a small exit, the cat only manages to poke his head out of the sleeve, as Jaq rushes to Gus' aid. Enraged by the trap he has been put in, Lucifer uses all the limited mobility he has and slithers across the floor towards the mice. Jaq tries speeding up the process of picking up the beads by stringing them to Gus' tail, hoping to gather them all before time runs out. Gus barely manages to grab the last bead before Lucifer reaches him and attempts to bite on him. The two mice narrowly escape back through the mouse hole, leaving Lucifer temporarily trapped in the nightgown, dazed and confused after slamming his face against the now closed hole as part of an unsuccessful last pounce.\n\nAt the film's climax, he attempts to catch Jaq and Gus while they try to free Cinderella from her locked room, but Cinderella's dog, Bruno (a friend of the mice and enemy to Lucifer) intervenes and scares Lucifer so much that he jumps out of the tower's window. This is the last see of Lucifer in the film, but the sequels reveal that he survived the fall, due to [[Cat righting reflex|cats always landing on their feet]].\n\nLucifer appears in the two sequels. In ''Cinderella II: Dreams Come True'', the second film, he only appears in the third and final segment, ''An Uncommon Romance'', where he falls in love with the snobby palace cat, Pom Pom, to the point that he makes a deal with the mice never to chase them again if they help him reconcile with Pom Pom. The plan works, but Pom Pom goads Lucifer into helping her catch and eat the mice. His treachery backfires, and Pom Pom dumps him.\n\nIn ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time'', the third film, after Lady Tremaine reverses time with the Fairy Godmother's wand, Lucifer resumes his role as adversary to both Cinderella and the mice. In his most notable scene, Lady Tremaine turns him into a human coachman to take Cinderella and the mice as far away from the palace as he can, but during the chase, Lucifer falls off the coach into a small pond, where he turns back into a cat and is left stranded in the woods.\n\nLucifer appears in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', as a boss character in Ven's scenario, in which he attempts to stop Jaq and Ventus from gathering the necessary materials for Cinderella's dress. Despite having been shrunk to the size of a mouse, Ventus valiantly engages Lucifer in a brutal battle which Ventus wins. Frightened, Lucifer runs off.\n\nHe is voiced by [[June Foray]] in the original film and by Frank Welker in its sequels.\n\n==The Fairy Godmother==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Fairy Godmother\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Milt Kahl]]\n| voice = [[Verna Felton]] (in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Russi Taylor]] (in sequels) <br> [[Barbara Dirikson]] (Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind)\n| portrayer = [[Helena Bonham Carter]] ([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])<br/>[[Melanie Paxson]] (''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'')\n| alias       =\n| species = Fairy\n| children    = Jane (Descendants)\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\nThe '''[[Fairy Godmother]]''' first appears in the film after Cinderella's stepsisters tear her gown to shreds before Prince Charming's ball. She appears in the garden, and greatly transforms her appearance for the ball. She transforms the mice into stallions, Bruno the dog into a footman, Major the horse into a coachman, a pumpkin into a white coach, and transforms her torn dress into a beautiful silvery-blue dress with comfortable glass slippers. Cinderella departs for the ball after the Fairy Godmother warns her that the spell will expire at the stroke of midnight. With her work done, she vanishes into thin air.\n\n''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'' begins with the Fairy Godmother reading the story of Cinderella to the animals until Gus and Jaq arrive. The three of them set off to make a new book to narrate what happens after the \"Happily Ever After\" by stringing the three segments of the film together into one narrative. During one of the segments, the Fairy Godmother turns Jaq into a human six times taller than his height so that he can help Cinderella in the palace.\nIn ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', the Fairy Godmother's powerful magic wand is stolen by Anastasia, who accidentally turns her into a stone statue, and her wand is misused by the venomously evil Lady Termaine. The Fairy Godmother is turned back to her normal form at the end of the film. She offers to return Cinderella and Prince Charming to their former lives, but allows the two lovers be live happily ever after...again.\n\nThe Fairy Godmother also appears in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series. After the destruction of her world, Castle of Dreams, by [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], she manages to safely escape. She lives in Traverse Town with [[Merlin (Disney)|Merlin]], and every time [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] gives her summon gem, she restores that being's spirit, allowing Sora to summon them in battle. She eventually gives Donald Duck the Lord Fortune staff. She also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' in her own world, reprising the same role as in the film and also shrinking Ventus and Aqua to the size of mice in order to avoid Lady Tremaine spotting them. She also makes a brief appearance in the Re Mind DLC of ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' where she appears in Radiant Garden, having been asked by Merlin and Yen Sid to assist in the search for Sora by looking into Riku's dreams.\n\nThe Fairy Godmother is one of the many guests in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. She also is the host in the ''[[Magic, Music and Mayhem]]'' live show. She was voiced by [[Verna Felton]] in the first film and its sequels voiced by [[Russi Taylor]].\n\nIn Italian dub the fairy is called ''Smemorina'', for the scene in first film where she didn't find her magic wand.\n\nShe is portrayed by [[Helena Bonham Carter]] in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 remake live-action version]] of the [[Cinderella (1950 film)|original Disney movie]], and also serves as the narrator of the story. As well as casting the spells to create Cinderella's coach, gown, and slippers, she also casts a quick spell to prevent Cinderella's step-family from recognizing her at the ball.\n\n==Other characters==\n===The King===\nThe King is Prince Charming's father who desperately wants his son to marry and have children because he wants to see his grandchildren before he dies as shown in the first film. In the second film, he appears a few times in the first and second segments.

He was voiced by [[Luis Van Rooten]] in the first film and by [[Andre Stojka]] in the sequels. [[Derek Jacobi]] played the character in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action film]], where he becomes ill and dies in the movie, although he has a brief conversation with Cinderella at the ball that inspires him to accept her as Kit's wife despite his initial plans for Kit to marry a real princess.\n\n===The Grand Duke=== \nThe Duke is The King's right-hand man who organized the ball for Prince Charming to find him a wife. He later visited the Tremaine manor to find the glass slipper's owner. He appears a few times in the second film, more than the King. In the third film, the Grand Duke is responsible for organizing the wedding between Prince Charming and Anastasia. The Grand Duke also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', playing out the same role as in the film with some differences. He was voiced by [[Luis Van Rooten]] (who also voiced the King in the original film) in the first film and by [[Rob Paulsen]] in the sequels. [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] plays him in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action film]], in which he played a supporting role to the Prince and Cinderella. Unlike the original film, he played a more antagonistic role by conspiring with Cinderella's evil stepmother Lady Tremaine. By the end of the film, the Grand Duke alongside Lady Tremaine and her family leave the kingdom never to return.\n\n===Bruno=== \nBruno is a [[Bloodhound]] who is Cinderella's pet dog, a friend of the mice, and enemy to Lucifer.

She wears a dark-grey dress, and keeps her dark brown hair in a tight bun. Cinderella helps change Prudence's view on things through her improvements to the ball; she comes to trust Cinderlla's judgement as the King loves the changes. Her name is a pun about her behavior. She was voiced by [[Holland Taylor]] in both sequels.\n\n===Beatrice and Daphne===\nTwo kind, understanding, and helpful female palace servants help Cinderella caringly with her royal-ball preparation duties, in the first segment that appears in the second film, ''Cinderella II: Dreams Come True''. They try to comfort Cinderella, amidst the stuck-up, arrogant whims of the insufferably overbearing, burdensome, and bland Prudence, the female head servant. Beatrice is a tall, thin women with chocolate-brown eyes, who wears a blue dress, and keeps her light blonde hair in a tight bun. Daphne is shorter and stubbier with bright blue eyes, clad in a rose-pink dress, and also keeps her dark brown hair in a bun. [[Russi Taylor]] voices both characters.\n\n===Mary===\nA female mouse who appears in the second film, she is a close friend to Jaq and Gus and has feelings for Jaq.\n\n===Pom-Pom===\nA white female cat.

Lady Tremaine again tries to take Anastasia away again but she stands up to her and says she will go with the baker to the ball. After this, her mother and elder sister leave. Later that night, Anastasia attends the ball and dances with the baker. He would later make a cameo appearance during the end credits of the third film, as he is shown in a painting with Anastasia.\n\n==Appearing in ''Cinderella'' (2015 film)==\n===Cinderella's Mother=== \nCinderella's Mother (portrayed by [[Hayley Atwell]]) She is Cinderella's biological mother, who passed away when her daughter was ten years old. what is her name\n\n===Mr. Goose===\nA goose live with Cinderella in the farm with other animals in [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action film]].

During the chase, one of the footmen (who at this point got back their tails) uses his tail to flip a switch which closed a cast iron gate and stopped the Duke from chasing them. The lizards are seen again at the end of the film where they are seen scurrying around the palace balcony (along with the four mice and Mr. Goose) when Ella and Kit are married as they address the public on a balcony. The Lizards replace Bruno the Bloodhound as the footmen in Cinderella (2015 Disney film).\n\n===The Captain===\nthe Captain (portrayed by Nonso Anozie) is a character from the 2015 live-action Cinderella film.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Disney's Cinderella}}\n{{Cinderella (Fairy tale)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cinderella characters}}\n[[Category:Cinderella (franchise)|Characters]]\n[[Category:Disney animated characters]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of Disney animated film characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{In-universe|date=March 2020}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of Disney's ''Cinderella'' characters}}\n[[File:CinderellaCharacters.jpg|thumb|300 px|Cinderella fits the glass slipper.

There are many different stories about her from different states and countries.\n\nAfter her father dies from being pushed off of a train, she is forced into servitude in her own home and is constantly tormented by her evil stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella. Despite this, she maintains hope through her dreams and remains a kind, gentle and sweet person. She has faith that someday her dreams of happiness will come true and her kindness will be repaid. Cinderella is shown to have a down-to-earth attitude, but she is also a daydreamer. For example, in \"Sing Sweet Nightingale\", she becomes distracted with the bubbles, allowing Lucifer the cat to smudge the floor she was cleaning. Also, after hearing that the Grand Duke is traveling the kingdom with the missing slipper, she dreamily dances back to the attic humming the song she heard at the ball. She is also shown to have a sarcastic side and a sharp wit.\n\nWith the help of her animal friends, she fixes up an old dress of her mother's so she can attend a royal ball. However, when her evil stepsisters brutally tear the dress apart, she is heartbroken and fears that her dreams will never come true.\n\nHowever, her Fairy Godmother appears, restoring Cinderella's hope by transforming her torn homemade gown into her now-iconic silver (powder blue in the shadows) ball gown with a glittering puffed over-skirt, a delicate laced white petticoat and puffy sleeves. She wears her hair in a French twist supported by a silver headband and her accessories include silver opera gloves, a black choker, and glass slippers.\nAs a servant, she wears her hair down in a ponytail, sometimes supported by a white scarf and wears a brown dress with a powder blue blouse, a white apron, and black flats.\n\nShe was voiced by [[Ilene Woods]] in the original film and later [[Jennifer Hale]] in the sequels. \n\nIn the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action film]], '''Ella''' was the character's original name, ''Cinderella'' was instead a spiteful nickname given by the stepsisters to Ella after she slept near the fireplace and subsequently covered by ''cinder'' (ash). In the film, Eloise Webb portrayed the 10-year old Ella in the prologue, with [[Lily James]] portrayed the older Ella.\n\n==Jaq and Gus==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Jaq \n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ward Kimball]]<br>[[John Lounsbery]]\n| voice = [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]]<br> (in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Rob Paulsen]]<br> (in sequels)\n| alias = Jaq-Jaq\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Gus \n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ward Kimball]]<br>[[John Lounsbery]]\n| voice = [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] <br>(in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Corey Burton]]<br> (in sequels)\n| alias = Gus-Gus\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Jaq''' (real name '''Jacques''') and '''Gus''' (real name '''Octavius''') are two mice who serve as Cinderella's sidekicks. Gus has a penchant for cheese.\n\nIn the first film, [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] rescues the mice from traps and the cat Lucifer and dresses and feeds them. They perform many favors in return. Jaq seems to be one of the leaders of the mice, planning strategies to avoid the cat, sneak food, and help Cinderella with her ball gown. The other mice gladly follow his lead. Jaq is thin, with scruffy hair, and speaks a fast kind of [[pidgin]] English. Gus appears in the first scene of the film, trapped shivering in a cage where Jaq finds him and brings Cinderella to rescue him. Cinderella names him \"Octavius,\" and calls him \"Gus\" for short. This is an example of an [[inside joke]] among the writers and (some) viewers of the movie. Gus is actually short for Augustus. In ancient Rome, Octavius was renamed Augustus when he became emperor. Hence Octavius - Augustus - Gus. Jaq explains the situation to Gus, that Cinderella wants to help him, and Gus catches on and joins the mouse troop. Gus has a large belly that pokes out of his yellow shirt and seems to be a bit slow on the pickup, but brave in a pinch, and speaks even more broken English than Jaq, who calls him \"Gus-Gus\".\n\nJaq and Gus are two of four mice that the Fairy Godmother transforms into stallions so that Cinderella can attend the ball, but at the stroke of midnight, they are transformed back into mice. Later, Jaq and Gus are responsible for stealing the key to Cinderella's room from the wicked stepmother, [[Lady Tremaine]], and freeing Cinderella to try on the glass slipper, which of course fits. While trying to steal the key, Jaq is stuck in [[Lady Tremaine]]'s pocket and gets knocked around as she pats the key. Gus gets trapped in a tea cup and [[Lady Tremaine]] offers some tea to the Duke, with Gus inside. She begins to pour tea into the cup and it drops towards Gus's large belly. Gus sucks in his belly to survive, trembling and sweating, but in a moment the Duke says he wants none, the tea lifts, and Gus is safe (though he gets his butt burnt by the tea later when they get the key). They are last seen in the film in tiny palace uniforms, eating and waving at the wedding of Cinderella and [[#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]].\n\nIn ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'', Gus and Jaq were also present, living in the castle along with all the other mice. It was Gus' idea to make the new book of stories to replace the old one. In Cinderella's Story, Jaq and Gus helped Cinderella to prepare for the ball and gave her support when she doubted her abilities. In Jaq's Story, Jaq, feeling useless, wishes that he were a human; Fairy Godmother grants this wish and Jaq tries to help Cinderella and the others prepare for the fair until he realizes he liked being a mouse better and returns to normal. In [[#Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]]'s Story, they attempt to help their old nemesis Lucifer win the affections of a snobby female cat named Pom Pom (the mice's, and probably Bruno's, new nemesis) in the castle in the hopes the cats will then leave the mice alone.\n\nIn ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', Gus and Jaq make their opening appearance helping the fairy godmother prepare for the prince and Cinderella's anniversary party. After Lady Tremaine reversed time and made the slipper fit Anastasia's foot, they helped Cinderella search for the prince, (wreaking havoc in the palace kitchen in the process). They discover Lady Tremaine's use of dark magic by witnessing her cast a spell on the prince to forget Cinderella (and think that he danced with [[Anastasia]]). In a plan to steal the wand back, they succeed in taking the wand from Lady Tremaine, but she has Cinderella arrested with a banishment sentence before she can lift the spell on the prince. Gus and Jaq manage to convince the prince that Cinderella is the right girl through a catchy showtune, \"At the Ball\". They later help Cinderella put on her wedding gown, but the three are magically sent away by Lady Tremaine, who assigns Lucifer the cat to drive them in a pumpkin carriage over a cliff. After they narrowly escape their deaths, Cinderella, Jaq, and Gus return to the palace where the mice attack the entrance guards to let Cinderella through to the wedding. The mice are last seen in ''Cinderella III'' during the [[closing credits]] in a picture with a very decorated king, one with them stuffed with cheese, Gus in a rather sophisticated uniform, and the final picture in a photo booth style series with Cinderella, the prince, and the two mice.\n\nJaq and Gus also appeared in the [[Grandma Duck]] comics in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' where they live with Grandma Duck and her grandnephew [[Gus Goose]]. At some time before then, they crossed paths with [[Donald Duck]] and [[Daisy Duck]]. They appeared in one [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] adventure titled ''Mousepotamia'' where they appear to be the same size as Mickey rather than standard mouse size.\n\nJaq appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]], and was one of the first new confirmed characters, while Gus is absent. He finds Ventus, shrunk down to 3 in (10&nbsp;cm) by the Fairy Godmother, placed in a mousetrap, and helps free him, marking the beginning of their friendship. Ventus later helps him gather the necessary materials for Cinderella's dress, and despite a fight between Ventus and Lucifer, they succeed. Later on, while Cinderella is locked in her room by Lady Tremaine, Jaq attempts to get the key to her room up the stairs and is protected by Aqua when the Unversed ambush him. Jaq succeeds and the slipper fits Cinderella perfectly. In the original film they were both voiced by [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]]; in the sequels, Jaq is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]] and Gus is voiced by [[Corey Burton]].\n\nIn the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 remake]], Jaq is changed to a doe (female mouse) named Jacqueline; Gus remains male but is referred to as Gus-Gus.\n\n==Lady Tremaine==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5599EE\n| name        = Lady Tremaine\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]]\n| lbl1        = Based on\n| data1       = The Wicked Stepmother from [[Charles Perrault]]'s [[Cinderella|fairy tale]]\n| portrayer   = [[Cate Blanchett]] <br><small>([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])</small><br />[[Gabrielle Anwar]]<br><small>([[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]])</small>\n| voice       = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Eleanor Audley]] <br>(in ''Cinderella'')<br>[[Susanne Blakeslee]]<br> (in sequels)\n}}\n| nickname    = Madame Tremaine\n| occupation  = [[Socialite]]\n| affiliation = [[List of Disney villains|Disney villains]]\n| title       = The Wicked Stepmother\n| spouse      = Cinderella's father {{small|(deceased)}}<br>Sir Francis Tremaine {{small|(deceased)}}\n| family = Cinderella (step-daughter)<br>Anastasia and Drizella Tremaine (daughters)<br>Prince Charming (step-son-in-law)<br>The Baker (son-in-law)<br>Anthony Tremaine (grandson, ''Descendants'')<br>Dizzy Tremaine (granddaughter, ''Descendants'')\n}}\n'''Lady Tremaine''' (also known as '''the Wicked [[Stepfamily|Stepmother]]''' or '''Cinderella's stepmother''') is the main antagonist of the franchise. She is based on the original character from the Cinderella [[fairy tale]] created by [[Charles Perrault]]. Animators [[Ollie Johnston]] and [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], in their book ''The Disney Villain'', describe animating Audley's voice as \"a difficult assignment but a thrilling one, working to that voice track with so much innuendo mixed in with the fierce power.\" In contrast to the broad treatment given to some of the other characters, Lady Tremaine was animated in malevolent and subtle realism.<ref name=archives>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Lady Tremaine and Stepsisters Character History| url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/tremaine/tremaine.html}}</ref>\n\nA cruel, cold, and calculating tyrant, Lady Tremaine wants nothing more than her daughters to succeed. Unlike most Disney villains, who sport fiery personalities and desire power and the spotlight, she possesses a more cunning, subtle, [[passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive]] personality with a shrewd intelligence and ability for manipulation, particularly towards her daughters. She rarely yells, speaking in a calm, collected voice, even when angered. She wishes her daughters to succeed so that she may reap the benefits when it best suits her.\n\nShe is introduced in the prologue of the film. Cinderella's father, a [[widow]]er anxious for his daughter to have a mother figure, married Lady Tremaine, whom the narrator describes as \"a woman of good family\". She was a [[widow]] herself, with two daughters from her first marriage. After an unspecified amount of time living happily together as a family, Cinderella's father tragically died and Lady Tremaine revealed her true colors. She lets the chateau fall into disrepair while pampering her own selfishly spoiled daughters and forcing Cinderella to become a maid in her own home. Lady Tremaine allows Cinderella to attend the Royal Ball, on the condition that Cinderella finishes all her chores and finds a suitable dress. When Cinderella actually finishes her work and appears ready for the Ball in a suitable dress, Lady Tremaine mildly mentions the beads and sash that Jaq and Gus found after Anastasia and Drizella threw them out. Enraged, her daughters cruelly tear apart Cinderella's dress, leaving her unable to attend the ball. When Cinderella, with the help of a [[#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]], nevertheless attends the ball, her stepfamily does not recognize her, but Lady Tremaine notes a familiarity about her appearance as she dances with [[#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]].\n\nNews promptly arrives by way of a Royal Proclamation that the Prince will marry the girl whose foot fits the glass slipper accidentally left behind by Cinderella at the ball. Lady Tremaine overhears Cinderella dreamily humming the song \"So This is Love\" as she heads to the attic, and realizes that she was the mysterious girl at the ball. Hoping to pass off one of her daughters as the mysterious girl, Lady Tremaine follows Cinderella up to the attic and locks her in her room, putting the key in her pocket. However, two of Cinderella's mice friends, [[#Gus and Jaq|Gus and Jaq]], steal the key from the stepmother's pocket (after Lady Tremaine almost boils Gus in a tea cup) and succeed in returning the key to Cinderella, who rushes downstairs to the Grand Duke just as he and the footman are about to leave. Lady Tremaine attempts to convince the Duke that Cinderella is merely a lowly [[scullery maid]] who did not even attend the ball. But the Duke, who is required by the King's Royal Proclamation not to skip a single maiden in the kingdom on his quest for the mysterious girl the Prince danced with, solemnly rebuffs Lady Tremaine. The Duke also finds Cinderella strikingly familiar to him. He proceeds to try the glass slipper on Cinderella. In a last-ditch effort to foil Cinderella's dreams, Lady Tremaine trips the footman bearing the glass slipper, causing it to smash. She deviously grins with wicked satisfaction as the Duke wails in despair and fear of the King's reaction when he finds out that the slipper was broken. But Cinderella still manages to come out on top by revealing that she has the other slipper, and that it fits her foot, proving that she is the girl who danced with Prince Charming, much to her stepmother's appalled horror. Beyond a single brief close-up of her appalled face, the movie does not dwell on her defeat, how she and her daughters further reacted or what happened to them; instead there is only a quick resolution where Cinderella is shown as the Prince's happy bride, her stepfamily out of the picture.\n\nLady Tremaine made her second appearance in the [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'', this time voiced by [[Susanne Blakeslee]]. In this film, she only appeared in the ''An Uncommon Romance'' segment, where Anastasia has to go against her mother for the first time. A likable, slightly plump humble baker falls in love with Anastasia, as does she with him. Lady Tremaine and Drizella do everything they can to thwart this romance, but Cinderella encourages Anastasia to follow her own heart (which she does).\n\nHer latest animated appearance was in the second direct-to-video ''Cinderella'' sequel, ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', again voiced by Blakeslee, wherein she resumes her role as the pivotal antagonist. This time, she acquires the Fairy Godmother's magic wand after Anastasia finds it. Lady Tremaine, strangely still bent on ruining Cinderella's life (in what she believes to be revenge) then uses the wand to reverse time to undo Cinderella's \"happily ever after\"; she manipulates the glass slipper to fit Anastasia so that Cinderella never gets to try on the slipper herself, then she brainwashes the Prince into forgetting Cinderella and marrying Anastasia. When Cinderella tries to set things right, Lady Tremaine thwarts her efforts, aided by the magic wand. Ultimately, Anastasia is her mother's undoing; feeling guilty about marrying someone she does not love and who does not love her, she rejects the Prince at the altar, to Cinderella's amazement. Furious at Anastasia's sudden conscience, and still intent on fulfilling her desire for revenge on Cinderella, Lady Tremaine emerges from her hiding place and begins turning some of the palace guards into farm animals. She then resolves to destroy Cinderella's happy ending and also get revenge on Anastasia for trying to fix it by turning both of them into toads, but the Prince defends the two from the spell and reflects it back with his sword, turning Lady Tremaine and Drizella into toads instead. Anastasia then gives the magic wand to Cinderella so that she can undo all the wrongs that had been committed. During the end credits, Lady Tremaine and Drizella have been restored, but are wearing [[scullery maid|scullery]] clothes identical to those Cinderella used to wear, implying that they will be working in the palace as servants as their punishment.\n\nAside from the films, Lady Tremaine has also made various appearances on the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]''; she frequently shares a table with another famous wicked stepmother, [[Queen Grimhilde]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. Again, in these appearances, she is voiced by Susan Blakeslee. She also makes an appearance in the ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' Special Edition DVD in one of the menus.\n\nShe appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', along with Anastasia and Drizella. In the game, she is much crueler and is even hinted to be a [[Cruelty|sadist]]. She plays out the same role as in the film, only this time, the extreme darkness in her heart creates two Unversed, fuelled by her hatred of Cinderella. Aqua makes note of this as she passes Lady Tremaine, and later goes to the Tremaines' chateau to assassinate her and her daughters before their darkness kills anyone, but the Fairy Godmother stops her, advising her that Light and Darkness must co-exist. After the slipper fits Cinderella, Lady Tremaine gives into her fury once again and her negativity transforms Cinderella's pumpkin coach into a giant Unversed, the Cursed Coach, who is then sent to [[Filicide|murder the now-freed Cinderella]]. When Aqua jumps in and rescues Cinderella, the Cursed Coach accidentally drops a fire bomb in front of Lady Tremaine and her daughters, which explodes and (as revealed in ''Kingdom Hearts III'') turns them into Heartless.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Eleanor Audley]] in the original film, and by [[Susanne Blakeslee]] in subsequent appearances.\n\nIn the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action version]], Lady Tremaine was portrayed by [[Cate Blanchett]]. A woman of grace and refinement, she married Ella's father for the sake of her daughters; shortly after her first husband, Sir Francis Tremaine, died. At first, Lady Tremaine did not seem to bear any particular animosity towards Ella, but her jealousy and spite was incited after overhearing a private conversation in which it was confirmed that her second husband loved his biological daughter more than he did her, and that he still cherished the memory of his first wife. After he died while on a business trip, Lady Tremaine was hurt and jealous that his dying words had only been of Ella and her mother. Revealing her true colors, she takes her jealousy out on Ella, firing all of the servants and forcing Ella to take up most of their duties. She even joins in her daughters' childish taunting of Ella, and mocks her as \"Cinderella\". When she and her daughters are getting ready to go to the ball, Ella comes downstairs at the last minute, wearing a gown of her mother's. Lady Tremaine rips one of the sleeves and encourages her daughters to help her tear the dress apart. At the ball, she is as mystified as all the other guests when a mysterious girl in a blue gown enraptures Kit (the Fairy Godmother having cast an additional spell to prevent Ella's step-family recognizing her), but realizes that it's really Ella based on her attitude after the ball. The next morning, she discovers a glass slipper hidden in the attic. Knowing that the other slipper will fit Ella, she demands that Ella make her the head of the royal household and to ensure that Drisella and Anastasia find proper husbands. Ella rejects this out of hand, telling her that she isn't about to let Kit fall into her stepmother's clutches after she failed to protect her father. An enraged Lady Tremaine locks Ella in the attic and shatters the slipper. She then blackmails the Grand Duke into ensuring that she will become a [[countess]] and that her daughters will get wealthy husbands, in return for keeping the secret so that Kit can be married to a princess from another kingdom, as his father had originally intended. When the Captain finds Ella hidden in the attic, Lady Tremaine initially tells the Captain that as her mother, she will not allow Ella to try it on. Ella curtly tells her that she is not, nor will she ever will be, her mother. Ella leaves with Kit after forgiving her stepmother. The Tremaines leave the kingdom with the Grand Duke, never to return.\n\nIn ''Disney Descendants: Isle of the Lost'' (novel), Lady Tremaine obtains a grandson, Anthony, by one of her children and several granddaughters (referred to as the step-granddaughters) and teaches \"Evil 101\" on the Isle of the Lost. Lady Tremaine has a voice cameo in the sequel ''[[Descendants 2]]'' as she yells at her granddaughter Dizzy to be quiet, but the actress that voiced her was uncredited. She makes a physical appearance in ''[[Descendants 3]]'', portrayed by Linda Ko.\n\n==Anastasia Tremaine==\n{{Anchor|Anastasia Tremaine}} <!-- redirect target -->\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Anastasia Tremaine\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ollie Johnston]]\n| voice = [[Lucille Bliss]] <br>(in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Tress MacNeille]] <br>(in sequels) <br> [[Lesli Margherita]] <br>(singing voice in sequels)\n| portrayer = [[Holliday Grainger]] <br>([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])\n| family      = Sir Francis Tremaine (father, deceased)<br>Lady Tremaine (mother) <br> Drizella Tremaine (sister) <br> Cinderella's father (step-father, deceased) <br> [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] (step-sister) <br> [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]] (step-brother-in-law)\n| spouse = The Baker\n| children    = Anthony Tremaine (''Descendants'')\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Anastasia Tremaine''' is the [[red hair|redheaded]] younger [[daughter]] of [[Lady Tremaine]].<ref>Pat Williams, James Denney, and Jim Denney, How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Magic Every Day of Your Life (HCI, 2004)</ref> Though following the original story's depiction of the ugly and cruel stepsister in the first film, Anastasia becomes a more sympathetic character in later Disney sequels, depicted as struggling to find genuine love and follow her conscience despite her mother and sister's negative influence and scheming. Pat Williams, James Denney, and Jim Denney report that actress \"Lucille Bliss was the voice of Cinderella's stepsister, Anastasia, an experience that remains one of her fondest memories.\" The actress explains, \"I was just a teenager when I got the part...I read that Walt had personally selected me for the part of Anastasia.\"<ref>Pat Williams, James Denney, and Jim Denney, ''How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Magic Every Day of Your Life'' (HCI, 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lSJIngvkCsAC&pg=PA161&dq=Anastasia+%22Lucille+Bliss%22&ei=GZITSqj9AqKuzAS99oGjCw Google Books Search]</ref>\n\nIn ''Cinderella'', Anastasia is demanding and whiny, but not as bad as Drizella. Anastasia also has enormous feet. During their music lesson, Anastasia plays the [[flute]] as Drizella sings but in the sequels she has a beautiful singing voice. Anastasia quarrels with her sister often, though they are united in their jealousy of and contempt for Cinderella. Anastasia's most common [[dress]] attire is a [[pink]] dress with fuchsia bodice with a lighter pink skirt and fuchsia slippers which she wears with  white collar and petticoat. and a [[sun]]ny coloured hair bow and wears pink [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] underneath. Her hair is tied to sausage curls longer than Drizella's, flowing on her shoulders. Her ball dress is [[lavender (color)|lavender]] and has a purple bustle, a [[violet (color)|violet]] bodice, choker and slippers  and wears a green feather on her head instead of her gold headpiece and her curls are shorter than before. However, unlike Drizella, Anastasia's hair style changes throughout the film. In the very beginning, her hair is much shorter and the ringlets are tied back behind her head. When she sleeps and is preparing for the ball, Anastasia's hair is put into a bun. During the first film, she was seen as physically ugly, however in the sequels, she blossomed into a more beautiful young woman as her inner goodness developed.\n\nIn ''Cinderella II'', Anastasia is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, following the latter-day tradition of setting a stepsister on a redemptive path. She falls in love with a working-class [[baker]] and wants to get close to him, but her mother refuses to allow her to because of her own prejudices towards the baker's social standing. [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] reassures Anastasia that the baker is a good man, regardless of what Lady Tremaine thinks, and encourages Anastasia to follow her heart. With the help of Cinderella, Anastasia gets a make-over and becomes more beautiful, although her new looks never approach the same level as Cinderella. With help from Cinderella and her animal friends, Anastasia and the baker are reunited and reconciled, they attend Cinderella's [[Ball (dance)|ball]], where Anastasia thanks her for her help.\n\nIn ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time'', Anastasia is shown not only to have compassion for Cinderella, but to also have a conscience. She unintentionally gains access to Cinderella's fairy godmother's wand, which sets in motion her mother's nefarious plot to destroy Cinderella's \"happily ever after\" and gain access to an opulent lifestyle at the palace. As she is manipulated into marrying the Prince as a means to fulfill her mother and sister's selfish desires, Anastasia begins to feel remorse and guilt. At the altar, realizing she does not truly love the Prince and having understood what true love really means after she talked with the King, Anastasia refuses to marry him and steps aside for Cinderella, to her amazement. After a tense standoff with Lady Tremaine and Drizella, where Cinderella protects Anastasia for her honesty, and the two evil ladies were turned in toads after the spell went against them, Anastasia acquires the wand, sets everything right and makes peace with Cinderella, who subsequently invites her to stay in the castle to be her [[Lady-in-waiting]] which she happily accepts. This repentant act excludes her from the punishment that is seen to befall her mother and sister as Cinderella believes that Anastasia only tried to go through with Lady Tremaine's plot because she was also emotionally abused and manipulated by her mother and she truly still had a kind heart in the end; at the close of the film, they have been reduced to working as servants at the palace. During the credits, a picture shows Anastasia sitting in the palace garden while gazing happily at the baker with whom she fell in love in the second film.\n\nOver the films she gradually becomes less 'ugly' and more snub-nosed, chubby-faced, 'sweet', although never approaching Cinderella's beauty, becoming 'plain' instead of downright 'ugly'. This is partly because she smiles more and partly due to the animators' efforts.\n\n''Variety'' asserts that \"stepsister Anastasia is appreciably more sympathetic\" in ''Cinderella III''.<ref>Joe Leydon, \"[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932673.html?categoryid=1023&cs=1 Review of ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time''],\" ''Variety'' (February 5, 2007).</ref>  At [[Walt Disney World]] during the Cinderella's Gala Feast attraction, Julie and Mike Neal declare that \"everyone will love Anastasia and Drizella, Cinderella's evil stepsisters, who wander the room with Lady Tremaine...\"<ref>Julie Neal and Mike Neal, ''The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World 2008'' (Coconut Press, 2007), 314.</ref>\n\nShe appears in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'' in her homeworld, Castle of Dreams, with her family, playing out the same role as in the original film, except for the strong darkness in her heart nearly causing her to sadistically murder Cinderella before the Cursed Coach drops a bomb on her and her blood family, destroying their bodies and causing them to become Heartless.\n\nA 2015 live-action version of ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]'' featured Anastasia in the same role as the classic story. She was portrayed by [[Holliday Grainger]]. Like her mother and sister, she left the kingdom with the Grand Duke never to return.\n\n==Drizella Tremaine==\n{{Anchor|Drizella Tremaine}} <!-- redirect target -->\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Drizella Tremaine\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ollie Johnston]]\n| voice = [[Rhoda Williams]]<br> (in ''Cinderella'') <br/> [[Russi Taylor]] (pre-2019)<br>(in sequels)\n| portrayer = [[Sophie McShera]] <br>([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])<br/> [[Adelaide Kane]] <br>([[Once Upon a Time (TV Series)|Once Upon a Time]])\n| family      = Sir Francis Tremaine (father, deceased)<br>Lady Tremaine (mother) <br> Anastasia Tremaine (sister) <br> Cinderella's father (step-father) <br>[[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] (step-sister) <br> [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]] (step-brother-in-law)<br>The Baker (brother-in-law)\n| children    = Dizzy Tremaine (''[[Descendants 2]]'')\n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Drizella Tremaine''' is the brown-haired older daughter of [[Lady Tremaine]].<ref>R.J.

Her name is spelled \"Drisella\" in the 2015 Disney [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella film]].

For the palace ball, she wears a pale green gown with aqua bustle, pale green sleeves, and a jade green bodice, choker, and slippers and a second jade green bustle under the aqua one and wears a turquoise feather instead of a bow in her hair. In her second movie, her ribbon changes to pale blue. After her downfall she is reduced to wearing a maid servant's frock. In live appearances, and in many book illustrations, Drizella wears a dress similar to that shown for the palace ball in the first film and wears green slippers and green [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] underneath. Like her sister, Drizella has enormous feet.\n\nShe is portrayed as haughty, abusive, and sadistically cruel. She sets so many bad examples of spitefulness towards Cinderella for her younger sister to follow, that between them Anastasia's the better of the two. Highly unorganized, and, in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, murderous, she is contemptuously envious of [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]]'s success and [[beauty]] and often gets her into trouble. Unlike her younger sister [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]], who changes her spiteful ways and develops into a kind and good-natured woman, Drizella remains mean-spirited and cruel, and never overcomes her hatred of Cinderella. She is also depicted as having slovenly eating habits in the third movie, where she samples the food and the wedding cake being prepared for her sister's wedding by shoving handfuls of it into her face and eating them noisily. In the sequels, though not in the original film, Drizella is essentially a younger version of her mother.\n\nDrizella and her mother constantly plot to ruin Cinderella's life and have no qualms about hurting her feelings. Lady Tremaine is well aware of her older daughter's harsh and cold-hearted \u2013 and even violent \u2013 mannerisms, and can trigger Drizella's anger with a mere handful of casually delivered words. In a particularly distressing scene in the original film, as Lady Tremaine and her daughters prepare to leave for the Prince's ball, Cinderella appears wearing her beautiful homemade gown. Lady Tremaine notes that Cinderella is wearing [[bead]]s that belonged to Drizella, who rejected them on the claims she was sick of the sight of them. After Lady Tremaine casually points out to Drizella that the beads add a charming touch to the dress, Drizella flies into a rage and violently yanks the beads from Cinderella's neck, and along with Anastasia, lunges upon her stepsister and tears her gown to rags, leaving Cinderella devastated.\n\nLater on throughout the series, Drizella turns on Anastasia and torments her, being able to physically intimidate her. Although she seems to be awed by her during the story ''An Uncommon Romance'', after Anastasia openly rebelled against their overbearing mother and told her she was in love with a [[baker]] of low-birth and that she was happier with him than she would ever be with the wealthy suitor Lady Tremaine had hoped she would encounter at another palace ball. Angered, Lady Tremaine stormed off, leaving Drizella stunned, though she sided with her mother and returned home with her.\n\nUnlike Anastasia, who eventually liberates herself from her mother's domination, Drizella obeys her mother's every order and schemes with her to undermine her hated stepsister, Cinderella, though they are foiled by Anastasia and as punishment, they are removed of their wealth and status and are reduced to working as [[scullery maid]]s in Cinderella's palace.\n\nLike her mother and sister, she appears in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'', playing the same role as in the original film. However, unlike in the films, she is very sadistic and is willing to murder Cinderella to prevent her from ever getting her happiness, and nearly succeeds with the Cursed Coach. However, Aqua manages to save her, and Drizella is hit by a firebomb alongside her mother and sister, causing their eternal plunge into the Realm of Darkness as powerful Heartless, a fate later shared with [[Tangled|Mother Gothel]] and [[Hans (Disney)|Prince Hans]].\n\nShe was voiced by [[Rhoda Williams]] in the original film and by [[Russi Taylor]] in the sequels.\n\nIn the 2015 live-action version of ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]'', the \"z\" in Drizella was replaced by an \"s\" to reflect the British stereotype. '''Drisella''' was portrayed by [[Sophie McShera]]. Like her mother and sister, Drizella left the kingdom with the Grand Duke never to return.\n\nWhile Drizella does not appear in ''[[Descendants 2]]'', the film does feature her daughter, Dizzy, who is a hair stylist on the Isle of the Lost who helps Mal regain her signature purple hair when she leaves Auradon. After the threat posed by Uma has been dealt with, Evie and Mal ask that Dizzy be the next 'villain kid' to be released from the Isle, with Dizzy expressing great enthusiasm for the offer.\n\n==Prince Charming==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Prince Charming\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Milt Kahl]]\n| voice = [[William Edward Phipps|William Phipps]] (in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Mike Douglas]] (singing in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] (in sequels) <br> Matt Nolan (''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'')\n| portrayer = [[Richard Madden]] <br>([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])\n| alias       =\n| spouse      = [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]]\n| family = The King and Queen (parents)<br>Lady Tremaine (step-mother-in-law)<br>Anastasia and Drizella Tremaine (step-sisters-in-law)\n| children    = Chad Charming (Descendants)\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''[[Prince Charming]]''' is Cinderella's love interest. He is a dark-haired, tall, and handsome young man. In the first film, he has no given name. Cinderella's prince is never actually identified in the film as \"Prince Charming\", nor is there any clear reason why he has come to be known by that title in the Disney vernacular. The only media where he is referred to as \"Prince Charming\" as of today is ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' and the attraction ''[[Prince Charming Regal Carrousel]]''.\n\nDetermined to see grandchildren, the King organizes a ball for Prince Charming in an effort to cause his son to fall in love and marry, with every eligible maiden in the kingdom ordered to attend. At the ball, Prince Charming rejects every girl, until he sees Cinderella, with whom he is immediately smitten in love. The two dance throughout the castle grounds until the clock starts to chime midnight and Cinderella flees away from the castle, accidentally dropping one of her glass slippers. Prince Charming picks up the glass slipper and the next day a royal proclamation is issued, stating the Grand Duke will visit every house in the kingdom to find the girl who fits the glass slipper, so that she can be married to Prince Charming. After the slipper perfectly fits onto Cinderella's foot, Prince Charming marries her.\n\nPrince Charming has little involvement in the sequel, ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]''. In the third film, ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', while Prince Charming and Cinderella are celebrating the first anniversary of their wedding, Lady Tremaine gets possession of the Fairy Godmother's wand and reverses time, going back to the moment of the Duke's arrival at her manor with the glass slipper. Lady Tremaine then uses the wand to fit the slipper onto Anastasia's foot and make her marry Prince Charming. When he sees Anastasia, he is about to dismiss but Lady Tremaine uses the wand to make him forget about Cinderella completely and to marry Anastasia. Cinderella is later caught trying to get the wand from her stepmother, but she manages to touch Prince Charming's hand, and the connection they both feel confuses him. Prince Charming is then addressed by Gus and Jaq who confront him with their side of the story, using the other mended glass slipper as evidence. Prince Charming, although he still cannot remember her, believes the mice's tale and sets out to retrieve Cinderella before she sails off under Lady Tremaine's orders. The two lovers are reunited and get prepared for the wedding, but Lady Tremaine makes Anastasia to look exactly like Cinderella to take the real Cinderella's place during the wedding. When Anastasia hesitates during the wedding and says \"I don't\", Lady Tremaine aims the wand at both Cinderella and Anastasia. However, Prince Charming manages to step between them and blocks the magic with his sword, causing it to bounce back and transform Lady Tremaine and Drizella into toads. Prince Charming and Cinderella stay in this new timeline and get married again.\n\nHe appears in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep'' along with his homeworld, playing out the same role as in the film. Just after Cinderella flees the ball, he briefly mistakes Aqua for Cinderella. In a scene which was originally intended for the film but deleted, Prince Charming and Cinderella are reunited after the slipper fits Cinderella's foot perfectly, and he embraces her lovingly. In the original film, his speaking is provided by [[William Edward Phipps|William Phipps]] while his singing is provided by [[Mike Douglas]]. He is later voiced by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] (who originally voiced Prince Eric from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') in the sequels. \n\nThe animated movies never made mention of his real name. An official advertisement from Disney France said \"The Prince's name is Henry\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Disney Soul|url=http://www.disneysoul.com/2012/09/se-descubre-el-autentico-nombre-del.html|accessdate=11 July 2013|language=spanish}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action film]], the prince was named '''Kit''' (a diminutive form of either Christopher or Christian) and portrayed by [[Richard Madden]]. In the film, Prince Kit and Cinderella first met in the woods without knowing each other's true identity, and took a liking to each other, with Cinderella believing that Kit is an apprentice training under his father without recognizing him as the prince. The desire to see Cinderella again was what caused Prince Kit to open the ball to commoners, Cinderella attending to find him rather than to meet the prince (not knowing they are the same person). Prince Kit also became king in the last one-third of the film after his father died from illness.\n\n==Lucifer==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Lucifer\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Ward Kimball]]<br>[[John Lounsbery]]<br>[[Wolfgang Reitherman]]<br>[[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]]\n| voice = [[June Foray]] (in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Frank Welker]] (in sequels)\n| gender = Male\n| alias       =\n| noinfo = yes}}\n\n'''Lucifer''' is the Tremaines' pet cat and the third antagonist of the franchise. Tonally, his existence can be justified to provide a sinister and scheming opposing counterpart to Cinderella's loyal and good-natured pet dog Bruno as well as the birds and mice who are supportive and loving friends and allies of Cinderella. He has black fur and is depicted as a sly, wicked, and manipulative mouse consumer. In a particularly conniving scene in the beginning of the original film, Lucifer tries to rid the ch\u00e2teau's pet dog Bruno outside of the kitchen Lucifer is consuming his breakfast bowl of milk in, by scratching him painfully and slyly while Cinderella's back is momentarily turned away. Bruno then growls loudly and threateningly out of infuriation and pain, and Lucifer lets out a benign and exaggerated fake shriek of pain, as if ''Bruno'' scratched ''him''. Cinderella hears Lucifer's whining fake screech and blames Bruno, bitterly scolding him to go outside and to stop misbehaving, reasoning \"we have to at least ''try'', to get along together\". Back inside the kitchen, Lucifer wears a mischievous grin of wicked satisfaction, lazily licking his milk bowl, while Cinderella reprimands him with scorn and annoyance \"and that includes ''you'' too, ''your majesty!''\". He becomes very focused on catching the mice when provoked, but his attempts to catch them always end in a comical failure. First, in the first movie, that also the main antagonist, Jaq bravely makes a distraction to lure Lucifer away from the other mice's path to getting their breakfast. While returning with the mice, Gus struggles with carrying his load and easily grabs Lucifer's attention. Fortunately, and unexpectedly, Cinderella enters the room and accidentally takes Gus away on her breakfast serving platters for Lady Tremaine and her daughters. Tremaine's youngest daughter, Anastasia, is the dubious recipient of Gus, for the teacup he was hiding under was the one Cinderella served her. Lucifer knowingly puts his ear against all three of their closed doors to decipher Gus' location, and races over in delight to Anastasia's once he hears her scream of horror upon discovering the poor, frightened little mouse in her tea. Anastasia continues to scream wildly upon hastily accusing Cinderella of the perceived sabotage, and in severe distress and anguish, immediately notifies her mother, inciting an enormous frenzy, whereupon Cinderella is summoned to her stepmother's bedroom for a private talk. Lucifer slips into the room as well for a brief grooming by his malevolent owner, before she reprimands her stepdaughter with frigid ferocity. At the conclusion of this degrading and abusive private talk, after sadistically rattling off an inordinately long list of chores that Lady Tremaine is forcing Cinderella to complete, in a moment of amusing comical [[tongue-in-cheek]], the wicked stepmother muses \"and one more thing: see that Lucifer gets his ''bath\" ''at which the ears of the evil feline shoot straight up in horror, and he snarls at his owners quarrelsome request with repugnant disdain, which suggests that he dislikes baths or prefers to remain filthy.\n\nLucifer's next appearance in the film is when he encounters Jaq and Gus as they attempt to retrieve a sash and necklace of beads from a laundry pile, as part of making Cinderella's dress for the ball. At the start of the scene, Jaq and Gus assume they are alone and approach the sash, initially unaware that a slumbering Lucifer is lying on top of an ottoman directly above them. Once they realize that they are in fact not alone, they attempt to sneak past their foe while carrying the sash. Unfortunately, Lucifer's impeccable hearing ability picks up suspicious movement nearby and awakes, confused and a bit cranky. Jaq and Gus' cover is eventually blown, yet they still manage to slip the sash into their mouse hole, partly thanks to Lucifer's clumsiness. With the sash successfully obtained, Jaq and Gus shift their focus towards the bead necklace. Overcome with excitement, Gus blurts out the duo's desire to take the beads along with the sash. Determined not to fail this time around, Lucifer spots the necklace and immediately sits on it, awaiting the mice's next move. Now faced with an inevitable detour, Jaq formulates a plan, much to Gus' delight and Lucifer's suspicion. Jaq then fully exposes himself and starts casually walking in Lucifer's direction. Pleased with what he thinks is a surrender, Lucifer readies his paws and prepares for his pounce, unknowingly letting Jaq sneak directly behind him. His focus is then interrupted when he turns and is shocked to hear Jaq, now amidst the laundry pile at the other side of the room, humming to himself and biting off buttons of an overcoat. Jaq does so in the hopes of luring Lucifer away from the beads, thus giving Gus time to grab them and escape. Lucifer eventually catches on to this, and initially has trouble deciding on whether he should pursue Jaq or protect the necklace from Gus, standing by at the mouse hole. Lucifer ultimately figures out a way to accomplish both tasks and uses his tail to keep the necklace close to him as he moves towards Jaq. By the time Lucifer reaches Jaq, the witty little mouse launches a button that does no more than leave an imprint on the annoyed feline's nose. Shifting his attention completely on Jaq, Lucifer pounces on the pest and chases him into the heap of laundry, mainly into a light-blue nightgown. Finally sensing an opening, Gus makes his way to the necklace and struggles to get a grip on it. After a few more seconds of chasing, Lucifer temporarily emerges from the gown and examines it, attempting to get a better idea of where Jaq might be. Ironically, Jaq has hid himself in Lucifer's thick fur atop his head, using this pause to check on Gus. The portly mouse seems to be successfully making his way back to the mouse hole, but then suddenly slips on a bead, loses his footing, and slams into the far side wall, breaking the necklace into its several beads. Lucifer's attention briefly turns to the sudden disturbance, only to have Jaq intervene by keeping his eyes closed. Lucifer then tries to grab the intruder on his head, learns that the intruder was Jaq, and ultimately chases him back into the nightgown again. During this struggle, Gus begins picking up the beads, one by one, and placing them into his hat. The struggle in the laundry pile reaches its end, this time by Jaq making an escape out of one the nightgown's sleeves, with Lucifer close behind. Being evidently far too large for such a small exit, the cat only manages to poke his head out of the sleeve, as Jaq rushes to Gus' aid. Enraged by the trap he has been put in, Lucifer uses all the limited mobility he has and slithers across the floor towards the mice. Jaq tries speeding up the process of picking up the beads by stringing them to Gus' tail, hoping to gather them all before time runs out. Gus barely manages to grab the last bead before Lucifer reaches him and attempts to bite on him. The two mice narrowly escape back through the mouse hole, leaving Lucifer temporarily trapped in the nightgown, dazed and confused after slamming his face against the now closed hole as part of an unsuccessful last pounce.\n\nAt the film's climax, he attempts to catch Jaq and Gus while they try to free Cinderella from her locked room, but Cinderella's dog, Bruno (a friend of the mice and enemy to Lucifer) intervenes and scares Lucifer so much that he jumps out of the tower's window. This is the last see of Lucifer in the film, but the sequels reveal that he survived the fall, due to [[Cat righting reflex|cats always landing on their feet]].\n\nLucifer appears in the two sequels. In ''Cinderella II: Dreams Come True'', the second film, he only appears in the third and final segment, ''An Uncommon Romance'', where he falls in love with the snobby palace cat, Pom Pom, to the point that he makes a deal with the mice never to chase them again if they help him reconcile with Pom Pom. The plan works, but Pom Pom goads Lucifer into helping her catch and eat the mice. His treachery backfires, and Pom Pom dumps him.\n\nIn ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time'', the third film, after Lady Tremaine reverses time with the Fairy Godmother's wand, Lucifer resumes his role as adversary to both Cinderella and the mice. In his most notable scene, Lady Tremaine turns him into a human coachman to take Cinderella and the mice as far away from the palace as he can, but during the chase, Lucifer falls off the coach into a small pond, where he turns back into a cat and is left stranded in the woods.\n\nLucifer appears in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', as a boss character in Ven's scenario, in which he attempts to stop Jaq and Ventus from gathering the necessary materials for Cinderella's dress. Despite having been shrunk to the size of a mouse, Ventus valiantly engages Lucifer in a brutal battle which Ventus wins. Frightened, Lucifer runs off.\n\nHe is voiced by [[June Foray]] in the original film and by Frank Welker in its sequels.\n\n==The Fairy Godmother==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Fairy Godmother\n| first       = ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950)\n| creator     = [[Milt Kahl]]\n| voice = [[Verna Felton]] (in ''Cinderella'') <br> [[Russi Taylor]] (in sequels) <br> [[Barbara Dirikson]] (Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind)\n| portrayer = [[Helena Bonham Carter]] ([[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film]])<br/>[[Melanie Paxson]] (''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'')\n| alias       =\n| species = Fairy\n| children    = Jane (Descendants)\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\nThe '''[[Fairy Godmother]]''' first appears in the film after Cinderella's stepsisters tear her gown to shreds before Prince Charming's ball. She appears in the garden, and greatly transforms her appearance for the ball. She transforms the mice into stallions, Bruno the dog into a footman, Major the horse into a coachman, a pumpkin into a white coach, and transforms her torn dress into a beautiful silvery-blue dress with comfortable glass slippers. Cinderella departs for the ball after the Fairy Godmother warns her that the spell will expire at the stroke of midnight. With her work done, she vanishes into thin air.\n\n''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'' begins with the Fairy Godmother reading the story of Cinderella to the animals until Gus and Jaq arrive. The three of them set off to make a new book to narrate what happens after the \"Happily Ever After\" by stringing the three segments of the film together into one narrative. During one of the segments, the Fairy Godmother turns Jaq into a human six times taller than his height so that he can help Cinderella in the palace.\nIn ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', the Fairy Godmother's powerful magic wand is stolen by Anastasia, who accidentally turns her into a stone statue, and her wand is misused by the venomously evil Lady Termaine. The Fairy Godmother is turned back to her normal form at the end of the film. She offers to return Cinderella and Prince Charming to their former lives, but allows the two lovers be live happily ever after...again.\n\nThe Fairy Godmother also appears in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series. After the destruction of her world, Castle of Dreams, by [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], she manages to safely escape. She lives in Traverse Town with [[Merlin (Disney)|Merlin]], and every time [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] gives her summon gem, she restores that being's spirit, allowing Sora to summon them in battle. She eventually gives Donald Duck the Lord Fortune staff. She also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' in her own world, reprising the same role as in the film and also shrinking Ventus and Aqua to the size of mice in order to avoid Lady Tremaine spotting them. She also makes a brief appearance in the Re Mind DLC of ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' where she appears in Radiant Garden, having been asked by Merlin and Yen Sid to assist in the search for Sora by looking into Riku's dreams.\n\nThe Fairy Godmother is one of the many guests in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. She also is the host in the ''[[Magic, Music and Mayhem]]'' live show. She was voiced by [[Verna Felton]] in the first film and its sequels voiced by [[Russi Taylor]].\n\nIn Italian dub the fairy is called ''Smemorina'', for the scene in first film where she didn't find her magic wand.\n\nShe is portrayed by [[Helena Bonham Carter]] in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 remake live-action version]] of the [[Cinderella (1950 film)|original Disney movie]], and also serves as the narrator of the story. As well as casting the spells to create Cinderella's coach, gown, and slippers, she also casts a quick spell to prevent Cinderella's step-family from recognizing her at the ball.\n\n==Other characters==\n===The King===\nThe King is Prince Charming's father who desperately wants his son to marry and have children because he wants to see his grandchildren before he dies as shown in the first film.

He was voiced by [[Luis Van Rooten]] in the first film and by [[Andre Stojka]] in the sequels. [[Derek Jacobi]] played the character in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 live-action film]], where he becomes ill and dies in the movie, although he has a brief conversation with Cinderella at the ball that inspires him to accept her as Kit's wife despite his initial plans for Kit to marry a real princess.\n\n===The Grand Duke=== \nThe Duke is The King's right-hand man who organized the ball for Prince Charming to find him a wife. He later visited the Tremaine manor to find the glass slipper's owner. He appears a few times in the second film, more than the King. In the third film, the Grand Duke is responsible for organizing the wedding between Prince Charming and Anastasia. The Grand Duke also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', playing out the same role as in the film with some differences.

The ''Lion Brand'' was adopted as the company logo in 1910.<ref name=ashmolean />  Subsidiaries were then formed in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere (thirteen countries in all).\n\n=== Basildon Bond ===\n[[File:Basildon Bond stationery.jpg|thumb|Basildon Bond stationery]]\nThe '''Basildon Bond''' brand of stationery was created by Millington and Sons in 1911.<ref name=\"Room 1983 37\">{{cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Dictionary of trade name origins|year=1983|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-7102-0174-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoftrad00room/page/37 37]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoftrad00room/page/37}}</ref> The brand is named after [[Basildon Park]], where some of Millington's directors were staying,<ref>{{cite web|author=Basildon Bond|title=History|url=http://www.basildonbond.com/history|publisher=Basildon Bond|accessdate=5 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213728/http://www.basildonbond.com/history|archivedate=7 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and they liked the alliteration of \"Basildon\" and \"[[Bond paper|bond]]\".<ref name=\"Room 1983 37\" /> The Millington & Sons company was acquired by John Dickinson in 1918, who then took over the Basildon Bond brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildonbond.com/history|title=Basildon Bond History|date=2012|accessdate=27 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213728/http://www.basildonbond.com/history|archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref> The name \"Basildon Bond\" was used by comedian [[Russ Abbot]] for one of his characters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherrie Hewson|title=Behind the Laughter|publisher=HarperCollins |date=4 Mar 2011|pages=77|chapter=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfVMeVfDtdgC&pg=PT77#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780007412631}}</ref>\n\n=== Innovations ===\nJohn Dickinson patented a method of paper-making in June 1807, that rendered his rivals' techniques (principally the [[Fourdrinier machine]]) obsolete. In 1850, the company started mechanical envelope manufacturing, with gummed envelopes for the first time. The production of fine rag paper on electrically driven machines was a successful innovation at Nash Mill. The company pioneered the production of window envelopes in 1929.\n\n=== Second World War ===\nThe company produced various paper and cardboard products for the war effort, and also branched out into engineering, producing items such as fuel tanks for long range fighter aircraft, 20 mm cannon shells, aircraft fuel pumps, magnetos and spark plugs. The company made the foil strips codenamed ''[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]'' used by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] to blind enemy radar.<ref>http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/article/dickinsons-at-war/</ref>\n\n=== Dickinson Robinson Group ===\n\u2033[[Dickinson Robinson Group|Dickinson Robinson Group Ltd]]\u2033 (DRG) was formed out of [[E. S. & A. Robinson]] Packaging of [[Bristol]] and [[John Dickinson (inventor)|John Dickinson]] & Co Ltd. in 1966, creating one of the world's largest stationery and packaging companies. In 1989, the [[Asset stripping|asset-stripper]] [[Roland Franklin]] (Pembridge Investments) acquired DRG (by now including the Royal Sovereign group acquired in 1978) in a leveraged buyout worth \u00a3900 million.\n\n=== Fate ===\n\u2033Pembridge Investments\u2033 carved the \u2033Dickinson Robinson Group\u2033 up and sold its parts for a profit to various other companies:\n\n* In 1990 it sold the paper mills in the group, Nash Mills, Keynsham Paper Mill and Fife Paper Mills, to [[Sappi]] of [[South Africa]]. These mills were subsequently closed by Sappi as were all other acquisitions (Kymmini Oy, Blackburn Mill and Wolvercote Mill) they had made in the UK. \n\n* Also in 1990 \u2033DRG Stationery\u2033 was acquired by \u00b0Biber Holding AG\u00b0 of [[Switzerland]] and renamed \u2033John Dickinson Stationery\u2033. After Biber got insolvent in 1996, \u2033John Dickinson Stationery\u2033 was sold in the same year to \u2033[[James Spicer & Sons|Spicers Ltd]]\u2033, then a subsidiary of \u2033[[DS Smith]]\u2033, and moved from Apsley to the village of [[Sawston]], south of [[Cambridge]]. In 2005, \u2033John Dickinson Stationery\u2033 was purchased by the French stationery manufacturer \u2033[[:fr:Groupe Hamelin|Hamelin Group]]\u2033. Rebranded in 2008 as ''Hamelin Brands'', the company moved to [[Red Lodge, Suffolk]].<ref name=\"Hamelin\" />\n\n* In 1992 \u2033DRG Packaging\u2033 was acquired by \u2033[[Rexam|Bowater plc]]\u2033. \n\n== Frogmore Paper Mill ==\nJust north of the former Apsley Mill site in [[Hemel Hempstead]] is [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], the world's oldest mechanised paper mill. It was here that Bryan Donkin first demonstrated the paper machine he developed for the Fourdrinier brothers. Now operated by a conservation and education charitable trust, Frogmore Mill is open to the public and incorporates a visitor centre, museum exhibition hall and art gallery as well as continuing to make paper on machine and by hand.\n\n== Black n' Red ==\n[[Image:Black n' red notepad.JPG|thumb|'Black n' Red' book with side binding]]\nBlack n' Red, a brand of books and pads of paper produced by John Dickinson Stationery Limited, featured a striking black and red design. The front and back covers of such books are black, with the text \"Black n' Red\" written in red in the bottom right corner of the cover. The spine or bind is also red. \n\nThese books are now distributed by the Oxford brand within the Hamelin Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-oxford.com/gb-en/oxford-black-n-red-535|title=Oxford Black n' Red|last=|first=|date=|website=www.my-oxford.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[https://uk.hamelinbrands.com/ Hamelin]\n* [https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/John_Dickinson_and_Co History of John Dickinson & Co] at Grace's Guide\n* [http://www.thepapertrail.org.uk/ Frogmore Paper Mill] museum site\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1804]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies of England]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Dacorum]]\n[[Category:Museums in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Industry museums in England]]\n[[Category:Papermaking in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1804 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Stationers of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:British companies established in 1804]]\n", "name_user": "SDoderer", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickinson_Stationery"}

In 2011, the Band is a second section contesting Brass Band.\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:Tilbury Railwaymens Band 1919.jpg|thumb|Tilbury Railwaymens Band, Circa 1919]]\nOn 28 May 1919 a meeting of the [[Tilbury]] Branch of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] was held.  At this meeting it was proposed and agreed to form a brass band.  By 1 July the Tilbury Railwaymen's Band had called its first meeting and two delegates were appointed to travel to Shoeburyness (near Southend-on-Sea) to view a set of 24 instruments.  On the next meeting night 47 members were in attendance.  As only one bandsman (Mr H. Jones) could play an instrument he was appointed as Band Master.  As candidates stepped forward for instruments it was discovered that 30 wanted to play the big drum.\n\nIn August 1920 Mr. Snelling was appointed as Bandmaster, and Mr. Jones joined the playing ranks of the band.  At the band's AGM in January 1921 the decision was made to purchase the band their first set of new instruments from Hawkes & Sons (now [[Boosey & Hawkes]]) in London.  On these, it was said, the band made favourable progress.  At the half yearly meeting in July, owing to the repeated request of supporters in the town, it was decided to alter the name to The Tilbury Town Band.\n\nFebruary 1922 saw a contest for local bands held at [[Grays, Essex|Grays]].  Wishing to gain a conductor with contest experience, Mr. G Nicholls of Grays Temperance Band was engaged. After five weeks tuition the band mounted the contesting platform for the first time securing second prize and two medals. (Out of the five bands, all the others were over twenty years old). Following success at grays it was decided to pay a visit to what is now known as the National Brass Band Championship of Great Britain, held at [[The Crystal Palace]].  It was, however, not until 1923 that the band made a success at the Crystal Palace contest, securing third prize in the Junior section B, competing against twenty seven bands from all over the British Isles.\n\nDecember 1922 saw the band purchase their first set of 33 uniforms from The Uniform Clothing & Equipment Co.\n\n==WWII suspension and a new home==\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the Band's activities were suspended, but it was quickly reformed when peace 'broke out' in 1945. Four years later (on 24rd March, 1949) the band purchased an old [[Salvation Army]] hall (in Dock Road, Tilbury) for \u00a3225. This became the new band headquarters. In the 1960s the band changed name again, to the present name \"The Tilbury Band\".\n\nIn 1976 the original band hall was demolished to make way for a new purpose-built headquarters at the cost of \u00a322,000. This hall is the one still used by the band today.\n\n==Recent history==\n\nDuring the 1970s and '80s the band made the finals of the [[National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain]] three times, coming third in the second Section in 1978 (under the baton of Melvin White). The band were promoted to the Championship Section. The Youth Band under the direction of Michael Stroud, were the Butlins National Youth Champions and finalists in the Pontins National Youth Championship.\n\nOn St. Patrick's Day (17 March), 2001 the band went to the London & Southern Counties qualifying round of the second section at Stevenage. Under the direction of Robert Nunnery they walked away with first prize and an invitation to the national finals in Preston in September 2001.  In 2008, The Tilbury Band officially appointed a new conductor and director of music in Alan Duguid, who remained position until the appointment of Andrew Austin in 2011.  \n\nAs of Autumn 2016 the Musical Director in residence has been Benjamin Jones.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tilbury Band}}\n[[Category:Tilbury]]\n[[Category:Music in Essex]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1919]]\n[[Category:British brass bands]]\n", "text_old": "{{notability|Music|date=May 2012}}\n{{primary sources|date=May 2012}}\n{{About|English brass band|Icelandic band|Tilbury (band)}}  \n{{Infobox musical artist  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = The Tilbury Band\n| image               = Officiallogoofthetilburyband.png\n| image_size          = \n| background          = classical_ensemble\n| alias               = \n| origin              = {{flagicon|UK}} Tilbury, England, United Kingdom\n| Location            = RM18 7BX\n| genre               = [[classical music|Classical]]\n| occupation          = [[Brass Band]]\n| years_active        = June 1919\u2013''present''\n| Previous_Name       = {{ubl|Tilbury Railwaymens' Band|Tilbury Town Silver Band|Tilbury Silver Band}}\n| associated_acts     = Tilbury Brass Academy\n| website             = {{URL|www.tilburyband.co.uk}}\n| current_members     = '''Musical Director'''<br>Benjamin Jones\n| past_members        = \n}}\n'''The Tilbury Band''' is an English-based [[Brass Band]], founded in 1919 by the Tilbury Branch of the National Union of Railwaymen.
