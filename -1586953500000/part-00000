His real name is Trevion R. Ward but most of you may know him as Tre, or Moneybaby . Tre Moneybaby is 16 years old, born November 29th 2003. He started rapping when he was just 3 years old but started taking it serious when he was 13 when he was under Detroit native Kelo Yay\u2019s wing and \u201cSafebin Ballaz ent.\u201d When the released songs featuring Tre Moneybaby such as , \u201cLookin like money\u201d \u201cWhat it cost\u201d \u201cWe can do it\u201d \u201cMillionaire Mindset\u201d and \u201cFatcs\u201d. After a year and a half they stopped working and all went their separate ways. Tre Moneybaby started releasing music on his own with another local rapper known as Paidd Kj under Blockbrothas ent. 2019 Tre Moneybaby had gotten plenty of exposure when he recorded a song called \u201cNever\u201d with Veeze and Detroit native Babyface Ray, even before that he had songs with artist such as, lil beno, baby drego, rocky badd and etc that\u2019s unreleased. September of 2019 he lost his mother but that did not hold him from chasing any of his dreams. February of 2020 he released a E.P called \u201cWritten Dreams\u201d  and music video \u201cHorse Power\u201d that\u2019s really a Detroit hellcat and scatpack type of turn up song. Even tho he is 16 and an local artist I did a bit of research and his name holds a little wait through certain parts of the city. As an upcoming artist Moneybaby\u2019s net worth is estimated at around $60,000-80,000 dollars.\n\n==Recording and release==\n===Singles===\n\u201cWritten Dreams\u201d E.P\n\n==Music and composition==\nBillie Joe Armstrong had said the following about the trilogy: Each of the three albums has a totally different vibe. \"The first one is power pop. The second is more garage-y, ''Nuggets''-type rock. And the third is supposed to be epic. With the first album you're getting in the mood to party. On the second one, you're at the party.

His real name is Trevion R. Ward but most of you may know him as Tre, or Moneybaby . Tre Moneybaby is 16 years old, born November 29th 2003. He started rapping when he was just 3 years old but started taking it serious when he was 13 when he was under Detroit native Kelo Yay\u2019s wing and \u201cSafebin Ballaz ent.\u201d When the released songs featuring Tre Moneybaby such as , \u201cLookin like money\u201d \u201cWhat it cost\u201d \u201cWe can do it\u201d \u201cMillionaire Mindset\u201d and \u201cFatcs\u201d. After a year and a half they stopped working and all went their separate ways. Tre Moneybaby started releasing music on his own with another local rapper known as Paidd Kj under Blockbrothas ent. 2019 Tre Moneybaby had gotten plenty of exposure when he recorded a song called \u201cNever\u201d with Veeze and Detroit native Babyface Ray, even before that he had songs with artist such as, lil beno, baby drego, rocky badd and etc that\u2019s unreleased. September of 2019 he lost his mother but that did not hold him from chasing any of his dreams. February of 2020 he released a E.P called \u201cWritten Dreams\u201d  and music video \u201cHorse Power\u201d that\u2019s really a Detroit hellcat and scatpack type of turn up song. Even tho he is 16 and an local artist I did a bit of research and his name holds a little wait through certain parts of the city. As an upcoming artist Moneybaby\u2019s net worth is estimated at around $60,000-80,000 dollars.\n\n==Recording and release==\nOn April 11, 2012, Green Day announced that they would be releasing a trilogy of albums titled ''\u00a1Uno!'', ''\u00a1Dos!'', and ''\u00a1Tr\u00e9!'' and stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013, respectively, through Reprise Records.<ref name=\"prrelease\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682949/green-day-uno-dos-tres-albums.jhtml|title=Green Day Recording a Trilogy of Albums|work=MTV News|publisher=MTV Networks|first=Katie|last=Byrne|date=April 11, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a386556/green-day-confirm-new-albums-uno-dos-tre-release-dates.html|title=Green Day confirm new albums '\u00a1Uno! \u00a1Dos! \u00a1Tr\u00e9!' release dates|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias]]|first=Lewis|last=Corner|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref> On August 22, Armstrong gave preview of some songs through his [[iPhone]] on Zane Lowe's show on BBC Radio 1 in the UK.
