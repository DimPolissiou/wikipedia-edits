Michele Faini, an expert in 3D print manufacturing and a research and development designer at Lonati SpA to join a 3D printing effort.<ref name=\":6\" /> When the supplier didn't wish to share the design's specifics, they reverse-engineered the valves and produced a limited not-for-profit series for local hospitals.<ref name=\":6\" /> To satisfy biomedical requirements that can withstand

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE).  The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.  This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staffs.<ref name=20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n====China====\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE).  The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.  This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staffs.<ref name=20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n====China====\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

Usually a flat disc appears just below the hook where information about the footwear is displayed.  The bottom end of the base terminates into a U-shape. Each arm of the U acts as an element where a shoe can be fitted. These arms often extend and loop back down on each other to create a wing, which offers more support for the shoe. In U-shaped and wing designs, each shoe of the pair is hung adjacent to each other. This design is most commonly used for flat soled footwear such as trainers, sandals, slippers and pumps.\n\nHook shoe hangers are more basic in their design and resemble small clothes hangers.

The clip displays boots side on as opposed to other shoe hanger designs that display footwear front on.\n\n==History==\n\nOne of the earliest patented shoe hangers was used for the purpose of hanging shoes in public service areas such as school, where it was important to be able to store shoes in an organised manner. It was also important to prominently display shoes so that the wearer would have easy access to them. Like modern shoe hangers in retail stores, its secondary function was to support shoes. The main difference between this design and modern shoe hangers was that the soles of the shoes would lie flat against the wall. This early shoe hanger, which was made from wire, was patented in 1926 by Jesse S. Harding.\n\nAs retail space became increasingly expensive it became necessary to display shoes and other clothing items in a more space efficient way. The first modern shoe hanger was filed by the Japanese Tsuneji Matsubara in 1970 and consisted of a base with an element for placing a pair of shoes adjacent to each other. Various improvements were made over the next few decades to accommodate the storage and display of different types of shoes, as seen in the wing, hook and clip designs.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Clothes hanger]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Harding, Jessie S (1926).

He also painted no portraits, the other mainstay of Netherlandish art.  After his training and travels to Italy, he returned in 1555 to settle in [[Antwerp]], where he worked mainly as a prolific designer of [[old master print|prints]] for the leading publisher of the day. Only towards the end of the decade did he switch to make painting his main medium, and all his famous paintings come from the following period of little more than a decade before his early death, when he was probably in his early forties, and at the height of his powers.\n\nAs well as looking forwards, his art reinvigorates medieval subjects such as marginal [[drollerie]]s of ordinary life in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and the calendar scenes of agricultural labours set in landscape backgrounds, and puts these on a much larger scale than before, and in the expensive medium of [[oil painting]]. He does the same with the fantastic and anarchic world developed in Renaissance prints and book illustrations.<ref>Gombrich, 295; Clark, 41\u201343, 27, 33, 57, also covering Gothic aspects of Bruegel's style</ref>\n\nHe is sometimes referred to as \"Peasant Bruegel\", to distinguish him from the many later painters in [[Brueghel family|his family]], including his son [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] (1564\u20131638). From 1559, he dropped the 'h' from his name and signed his paintings as ''Bruegel''; his relatives continued to use \"Brueghel\" or \"Breughel\".\n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder- The Seven Deadly Sins or the Seven Vices - Anger.JPG|thumb|[[Engraving]] designed by Bruegel and published by [[Hieronymus Cock]],  ''The Seven Deadly Sins or the Seven Vices \u2013 Anger'', 1558]]\nThe two main early sources for Bruegel's biography are [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s account of the Low Countries (1567) and [[Karel van Mander]]'s 1604 ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''.<ref>Grove; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0221.php van Mander's Bruegel biography in Dutch]; Wied, 15\u201318 gives a full English translation. Guicciardini was an Italian who had lived in Antwerp since at least 1542, and probably knew Bruegel, which Van Mander, born in 1648 on the [[Meulebeke|other side of Flanders]], is most unlikely to have done.</ref>  Guicciardini recorded that Bruegel was born in [[Breda]], but Van Mander specified that Bruegel was born in a village (''dorp'') near Breda called \"Brueghel\",<ref>\"den welcken is geboren niet wijt van Breda, op een Dorp geheeten Brueghel, welcks naem hy met hem ghedraghen heeft, en zijn naecomelinghen ghelaten.\"</ref> which does not fit any known place.<ref>Grove: \"none of the three Flemish villages of that name is close to Breda\".; Wied, 18, says two of the villages (Groot Bruegel and Cleyn Bruegel) are close to [[Bree, Belgium]], which is \"Breda\" in Latin, perhaps causing Van Mander confusion. [[Son en Breugel]] still has supporters but is 34 miles from Breda, though just outside [[Eindhoven]] \u2013 see [https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/13292 RKD].</ref>  Nothing at all is known of his family background. Van Mander seems to assume he came from a peasant background, in keeping with the over-emphasis on Bruegel's peasant genre scenes given by van Mander and many early art historians and critics.<ref>Orenstein, 57\u201358; Grove</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0447\u0430 \u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u044b\u0445.jpeg|thumb|''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]'', 1568]]\n\nIn contrast, scholars of the last sixty years have emphasized the intellectual content of his work, and conclude: \"There is, in fact, every reason to think that Pieter Bruegel was a townsman and a highly educated one, on friendly terms with the humanists of his time\",<ref>Grove</ref> ignoring Van Mander's ''dorp'' and just placing his childhood in Breda itself.<ref>Orenstein, 57\u201358; Grove</ref>  Breda was already a significant centre as the base of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], with a population of some 8,000,<ref>Wied, 19\u201320</ref> although 90% of the 1300 houses were destroyed in a fire in 1534.  However, this reversal can be taken to excess; although Bruegel moved in highly educated [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] circles, it seems \"he had not mastered Latin\", and had others add the Latin captions in some of his drawings.<ref>Orenstein, 64</ref>\n\nFrom the fact that Bruegel entered the Antwerp painters' guild in 1551, it is inferred that he was born between 1525 and 1530.<ref>Orenstein, 5; Grove</ref> His master, according to Van Mander, was the Antwerp painter [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]], whose daughter [[Mayken Coecke]] Bruegel married in 1563.<ref>Orenstein, 5</ref>\n\nBetween 1545 and 1550 he was a pupil of Pieter Coecke, who died on 6 December 1550.<ref>This is according to Van Mander; although there is no documentation and little evident stylistic influence from his future father-in-law, modern scholars generally accept this.</ref>  However, before this, Bruegel was already working in [[Mechelen]], where he is documented between September 1550 and October 1551 assisting [[Peeter Baltens]] on an altarpiece (now lost), painting the wings in ''[[grisaille]]''.<ref>Grove</ref> Bruegel possibly got this work via the connections of [[Mayken Verhulst]], the wife of Pieter Coecke.

He set off for Italy soon after, probably by way of France.  He visited Rome and, rather adventurously for the period, by 1552 he had reached [[Reggio Calabria]] at the southern tip of the mainland, where a drawing records the city in flames after a Turkish raid.<ref>Grove; Orenstein, 204 for the drawing</ref> He probably continued to [[Sicily]], but by 1553 was back in Rome.  There he met the miniaturist [[Giulio Clovio]], whose will of 1578 lists paintings by Bruegel; in one case a joint work. These works, apparently landscapes, have not survived, but marginal miniatures in manuscripts by Clovio are attributed to Bruegel.<ref>Orenstein, 5\u20136; Grove</ref>\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Big Fish Eat Little Fish, 1556 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Big Fish Eat the Little Fish'', Bruegel's drawing for a print, 1556.<ref>Orenstein, 140\u2013142</ref>]]\n\nHe left Italy by 1554, and had reached Antwerp by 1555, when the set of prints to his designs known as the ''Large Landscapes'' were published by [[Hieronymus Cock]], the most important print publisher of northern Europe.

He moved in the lively [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] circles of the city, and his change of name (or at least its spelling) in 1559 can be seen as an attempt to Latinize it; at the same time he changed the script he signed in from the Gothic [[blackletter]] to Roman capitals.<ref>Grove</ref>\n\nIn 1563 he was married in Brussels, where he lived for the remainder of his short life. While Antwerp was the capital of Netherlandish commerce as well as the art market,<ref>Wied, 9\u201310</ref> Brussels was the centre of government. Van Mander tells a story that his mother-in-law pushed for the move to distance him from his established servant girl mistress.<ref>Van Mander, quoted in Wied, 16; Orenstein, 7; Hagens, 15</ref>  By now painting had become his main activity, and his most famous works come from these years. His paintings were much sought after, with patrons including wealthy Flemish collectors and [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|Cardinal Granvelle]], in effect the [[Habsburg]] chief minister, who was based in Mechelen. Bruegel had two sons, both well known as painters, and a daughter about whom nothing is known. These were [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] (1564\u20131638) and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] (1568\u20131625); he died too early to train either of them. He died in Brussels on 9 September 1569 and was buried in the [[Kapellekerk]].<ref>Grove; Orenstein, 8\u20139</ref>\n\nVan Mander records that before he died he told his wife to burn some drawings, perhaps designs for prints, carrying inscriptions \"which were too sharp or sarcastic...either out of remorse or for fear that she might come to harm or in some way be held responsible for them\", which has led to much speculation that they were politically or doctrinally provocative, in a climate of sharp tension in both these areas.<ref>Grove</ref>  <!-- He received the nickname \"Peasant Bruegel\" or \"Bruegel the Peasant\" for his alleged practice of dressing up like a peasant in order to socialize at weddings and other celebrations, thereby gaining inspiration and authentic details for his genre paintings. - Really??? Boere Breugel -->\n\n==Historical background==\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. \u00c4. 007.jpg|thumb|''[[The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)|The Procession to Calvary]]'', 1564, Bruegel's second largest painting at 124 cm \u00d7 170 cm (49 in \u00d7 67 in)]]\n\nBruegel was born at a time of extensive change in Western Europe. [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] ideals from the previous century influenced artists and scholars. Italy was at the end of its High Renaissance of arts and culture, when artists such as [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] painted their masterpieces. In 1517, about eight years before Bruegel's birth, [[Martin Luther]] created his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' and began the [[Protestant Reformation]] in neighboring Germany. Reformation was accompanied by [[Iconoclasm#Protestant Reformation|iconoclasm]] and widespread [[Beeldenstorm|destruction of art]], including in the [[Low Countries]]. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and its iconoclasm as a threat to the Church. The [[Council of Trent]], which concluded in 1563, [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|determined]] that religious art should be more focused on religious subject-matter and less on material things and decorative qualities.\n\nAt this time, the Low Countries were divided into [[Seventeen Provinces]], some of which wanted separation from the [[Habsburg]] rule based in Spain. The Reformation meanwhile produced a number of Protestant denominations that gained followers in the Seventeen Provinces, influenced by the newly Lutheran German states to the east and the newly Anglican England to the west. The Habsburg monarchs of Spain attempted a policy of strict religious uniformity for the Catholic Church within their domains and enforced it with the [[Inquisition]]. Increasing religious antagonisms and riots, political manoeuvrings, and executions eventually resulted in the outbreak of [[Eighty Years' War]].\n\nIn this atmosphere Bruegel reached the height of his career as a painter. Two years before his death, the Eighty Years' War began between the United Provinces and Spain. Although Bruegel did not live to see it, seven provinces became independent and formed the [[Dutch Republic]], while the other ten remained under Habsburg control at the end of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library of Art|location=Library of Congress|pages=18\u201327}}</ref>\n\n==Subjects==\n===Peasants===\n[[File:Pieter Brueghel the Elder - The Dutch Proverbs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'', 1559, oil on oak wood]]\n[[File:Pieter brueghel the elder-children playing-detail.jpeg|thumb|A detail of ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', 1560]]\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Peasant Wedding - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|''[[The Peasant Wedding]]'', 1566\u201369, oil on panel. A late peasant subject, with a more monumental treatment.]]\n\nPieter Bruegel specialized in [[genre painting]]s populated by peasants, often with a landscape element, though he also painted religious works. Making the life and manners of peasants the main focus of a work was rare in painting in Bruegel's time, and he was a pioneer of the genre painting. Many of his peasant paintings fall into two groups in terms of scale and composition, both of which were original and influential on later painting. His earlier style shows dozens of small figures, seen from a high viewpoint, and spread fairly evenly across the central picture space. The setting is typically an urban space surrounded by buildings, within which the figures have a \"fundamentally disconnected manner of portrayal\", with individuals or small groups engaged in their own distinct activity, while ignoring all the others.<ref>Franits, 203</ref>\n\nHis earthy, unsentimental but vivid depiction of the rituals of village life\u2014including agriculture, hunts, meals, festivals, dances, and games\u2014are unique windows on a vanished folk culture, though still characteristic of Belgian life and culture today, and a prime source of [[iconography|iconographic]] evidence about both physical and social aspects of 16th-century life. For example, his famous painting ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'', originally ''[[The Blue Cloak]]'', illustrates dozens of then-contemporary [[aphorism]]s, many of which still are in use in current Flemish, French, English and Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stokstad, Cothren|first=Marilyn, Michael|title=Art History- Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art|year=2010}}</ref> The Flemish environment provided a large artistic audience for proverb-filled paintings because proverbs were well known and recognizable as well as entertaining. ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' shows the variety of amusements enjoyed by young people. His winter landscapes of 1565, like ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', are taken as corroborative evidence of the severity of winters during the [[Little Ice Age]]. Bruegel often painted community events, as in ''[[The Peasant Wedding]]'' and ''[[The Fight Between Carnival and Lent]]''. In paintings like ''The Peasant Wedding'', Bruegel painted individual, identifiable people, while the people in ''The Fight Between Carnival and Lent'' are unidentifiable, muffin-faced allegories of greed or gluttony.\n\nBruegel also painted religious scenes in a wide Flemish landscape setting, as in the ''[[Conversion of Paul (Bruegel)|Conversion of Paul]]'' and ''The Sermon of St. John the Baptist''. Even if Bruegel's subject matter was unconventional, the religious ideals and proverbs driving his paintings were typical of the Northern Renaissance. He accurately depicted people with disabilities, such as in ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]'', which depicted a quote from the Bible: \"If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch\" (Matthew 15:14). Using the Bible to interpret this painting, the six blind men are symbols of the blindness of mankind in pursuing earthly goals instead of focusing on Christ's teachings.\n\nUsing abundant spirit and comic power, Bruegel created some of the very early images of acute social protest in art history. Examples include paintings such as ''[[The Fight Between Carnival and Lent]]'' (a satire of the conflicts of the [[Protestant Reformation]]) and engravings like ''The Ass in the School'' and ''Strongboxes Battling Piggybanks''.<ref>Mayor, A. Hyatt (1971). ''Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 426.</ref>\n\nOver the 1560s Bruegel moved to a style showing only a few large figures, typically in a landscape background without a distant view. His paintings dominated by their landscapes take a middle course as regards both the number and size of figures.\n\n; Late monumental peasant figures\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Pieter Bruegel d. \u00c4. 037.jpg|''[[The Land of Cockaigne (Bruegel)|The Land of Cockaigne]]'' (1567), [[Alte Pinakothek]], an illustration of the medieval mythical land of plenty called [[Cockaigne]]\nFile:The Peasant and the Birdnester Pieter Bruegel the Elder 1568.jpeg|''[[The Peasant and the Nest Robber]]'' (1568), [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna\nFile:Pieter Bruegel The Peasant Dance.jpg|''[[The Peasant Dance]]'' (1568), [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna, oil on oak panel\nFile:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Cripples.JPG|''[[The Beggars (Bruegel)|The Beggars (The Cripples)]]'' (1568), [[Louvre]], Paris, oil on panel\n</gallery>\n\n===Landscape elements===\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel der \u00c4ltere - Landschaft mit der Flucht nach \u00c4gypten.jpg|thumb|''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'', 1563, 37.1 \u00d7 55.6 cm (14.6 \u00d7 21.9 in), owned by [[Cardinal Granvelle]]]]\n\nBruegel adapted and made more natural the [[world landscape]] style, which shows small figures in an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint that includes mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings.  Back in Antwerp from Italy he was commissioned in the 1550s by the publisher [[Hieronymus Cock]] to make drawings for a series of [[engraving]]s, the ''Large Landscapes'', to meet what was now a growing demand for landscape images.\n\nSome of his earlier paintings, such as his ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'' ([[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld]], 1563), are fully within the Patinir conventions, but his ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' (known from two copies) had a Patinir-style landscape, in which already the largest figure was a [[genre painting|genre figure]] who was only a bystander for the supposed narrative subject, and may not even be aware of it.  The date of Bruegel's lost original is unclear,<ref>about 1558 has been suggested</ref> but it is probably relatively early, and if so, foreshadows the trend of his later works.  During the 1560s the early scenes crowded with multitudes of very small figures, whether peasant genre figures or figures in religious narratives, give way to a small number of much larger figures.\n\n====Months of the year====\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', 1565, oil on wood]]\n\nHis famous set of landscapes with genre figures depicting the seasons are the culmination of his landscape style; the five surviving paintings use the basic elements of the world landscape (only one lacks craggy mountains) but transform them into his own style.  They are larger than most previous works, with a [[genre scene]] with several figures in the foreground, and the panoramic view seen past or through trees.<ref>Silver, 39\u201352; Snyder, 502\u2013510; Harbison, 140\u2013142; Schama, 431\u2013433</ref>  Bruegel was also aware of the [[Danube School]]'s landscape style through [[old master print|prints]].<ref>Wood, Chapter 5, especially 275\u2013278</ref>\n\nThe series on the months of the year includes several of Bruegel's best-known works. In 1565, a wealthy patron in Antwerp, [[Niclaes Jonghelinck]], commissioned him to paint a series of paintings of each month of the year. There has been disagreement among art historians as to whether the series originally included six or twelve works.<ref>Gibson, Walter S. (1977) . Bruegel. The World of Art Library. Thames and Hudson pp 147\u2013148.</ref> Today, only five of these paintings survive and some of the months are paired to form a general season. Traditional Flemish luxury [[book of hours|books of hours]] (e.g., the [[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]];<ref>{{cite book|last=Stokstad, Cothren|first=Marilyn, Michael|title=Art History- Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art|year=2010}}</ref> 1416) had calendar pages that included the [[Labours of the Months]], depictions set in landscapes of the agricultural tasks, weather, and social life typical for that month.\n\nBruegel's paintings were on a far larger scale than a typical calendar page painting, each one approximately three feet by five feet. For Bruegel, this was a large commission (the size of a commission was based on how large the painting was) and an important one. In 1565, the Calvinist riots began and it was only two years before the Eighty Years' War broke out. Bruegel may have felt safer with a secular commission so as to not offend Calvinist or Catholic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library|location=Library of Congress}}</ref> Some of the most famous paintings from this series included ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'' (December\u2013January) and ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]'' (August).\n\n==Prints and drawings==\n[[File:Die Bienenz\u00fcchter (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|''Beekeepers'', c. 1568]]\nOn his return from Italy to Antwerp, Bruegel earned his living producing drawings to be turned into prints for the leading print publisher of the city, and indeed northern Europe, [[Hieronymus Cock]].  At his \"House of the Four Winds\" Cock ran a well-oiled production and distribution operation efficiently turning out prints of many sorts that was more concerned with sales than the finest artistic achievement.  Most of Bruegel's prints come from this period, but he continued to produce drawn designs for prints until the end of his life, leaving only two completed out of a series of the ''Four Seasons''.<ref>Orenstein, 236\u2013238, and following pages</ref>  The prints were popular and it is reasonable to assume that all those published have survived.  In many cases we also have Bruegel's drawings.  Although the subject matter of his graphic work was often continued in his paintings, there are considerable differences in emphases between the two ''oeuvres''.  To his contemporaries and for long after, until public museums and good reproductions of the paintings made these better known, Bruegel was much better known through his prints than his paintings, which largely explains the critical assessment of him as merely the creator of comic peasant scenes.<ref>Wied, 36</ref>\n\nThe prints are mostly engravings, though from about 1559 onwards some are [[etching]]s or mixtures of both techniques.<ref>Orenstein catalogues the prints in chronological order, as far as it is known</ref>  Only one complete [[woodcut]] was made from a Bruegel design, with another left incomplete.  This, ''The Dirty Wife'', is a most unusual survival (now [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) of a drawing on the wooden block intended for printing.  For some reason, the specialist [[Woodcut#Division of labour|block-cutter]] who carved away the block, following the drawing while also destroying it, had only done one corner of the design before stopping work. The design then appears as an engraving, perhaps soon after Bruegel's death.<ref>Orenstein, 241\u2013242, 246\u2013248; [http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/338710 Metropolitan page]</ref>\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Spring, 1565 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''Spring'', 1565, a drawing made to be engraved. It was apparently never painted by Bruegel himself, but after his death came dozens of versions in paint by his son and others.]]\n\nAmong his greatest successes were a series of allegories, among several designs adopting many of the very individual mannerisms of his compatriot [[Hieronymus Bosch]]: ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' and ''The Virtues''. The sinners are grotesque and unidentifiable while the allegories of virtue often wear odd headgear.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library|location=Library of Congress}}</ref>  That imitations of Bosch sold well is demonstrated by his drawing ''Big Fish Eat Little Fish'' (now [[Albertina]]), which Bruegel signed but Cock shamelessly attributed to Bosch in the print version.<ref>Orenstein, 140\u2013142</ref>\n\nAlthough Bruegel presumably made them, no drawings that are clearly preparatory studies for paintings survive.  Most surviving drawings are finished designs for prints, or landscape drawings that are fairly finished.  After a considerable purge of attributions in recent decades, led by [[Hans Mielke]],<ref>Grove</ref> sixty-one sheets of drawings are now generally agreed to be by Bruegel.<ref>Orenstein, vii gives the total; fifty-four were in the exhibition and are catalogued, and most others illustrated.  These included all those from the largest collections, Berlin (10), London (8) and Vienna (6). Sellink in 2012 lists 70.</ref>  A new \"Master of the Mountain Landscapes\" has emerged from the carnage.  Mielke's key observation was that the lily watermark on the paper of several sheets was only found from around 1580 onwards, which led to the rapid acceptance of his proposal.<ref>Orenstein, 266\u2013267, and following catalogue pages for individual works.</ref>  Another group of about twenty-five pen drawings of landscapes, many signed and dated as by Bruegel, are now given to [[Jacob Savery]], probably from the decade of so before Savery's death in 1603. A giveaway was that two drawings including the walls of [[Amsterdam]] were dated 1563 but included elements only built in the 1590s.  This group appears to have been made as deliberate forgeries.<ref>Orenstein, 276\u2013277, and following catalogue pages for individual works.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nAround 1563 Bruegel moved from [[Antwerp]] to [[Brussels]], in Brussels he married [[Mayken Coecke]], the daughter of the painter [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]] and [[Mayken Verhulst]]. As registered in the archives of the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Antwerp]], their [[Ondertrouw|deposition for marriage]] was registered 25 July, 1563. The marriage itself was concluded in the [[Chapel Church]], Brussels in 1563.<ref>Jean Bastiaensen, \u201cDe verloving van Pieter Bruegel de Oude.

Their grandmother, [[Mayken Verhulst]], trained the sons because \"the Elder\" died when both were very small children. The older brother, Pieter Brueghel copied his father's style and compositions with competence and considerable commercial success. Jan was much more original, and very versatile.  He was an important figure in the transition to the Baroque style in [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] in a number of its genres.  He was often a collaborator with other leading artists, including with [[Peter Paul Rubens]] on many works including the ''Allegory of Sight''.\n\nOther members of the family include [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]] and [[Mayken Verhulst]] (father-in-law and mother-in-law to Pieter Bruegel the Elder), [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]] (grandson of Jan Bruegel the Elder) and [[Jan van Kessel the Younger]]. Through David Teniers, the family is also related to the whole Teniers family of painters and the Quellinus family of painters and sculptors, since [[Jan-Erasmus Quellinus]] married Cornelia, daughter of David Teniers the Younger.\n\n{{Brueghel}}\n\n==Reception history==\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Massacre of the Innocents - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Massacre of the Innocents (Bruegel)|Massacre of the Innocents]]'', (c. 1565\u20131567), British [[Royal Collection]].

His friend [[Abraham Ortelius]] described him in a friendship album in 1574 as \"the most perfect painter of his century\", but both [[Vasari]] and Van Mander see him as essentially a comic successor to [[Hieronymus Bosch]].<ref>Snyder, 484; Orenstein, 9-11, 59</ref>\n\nBut Bruegel's work was, as far as we know, always keenly collected.  The banker Nicolaes Jonghelinck owned sixteen paintings; his brother [[Jacques Jonghelinck]] was a gentleman-sculptor and medallist, who also had significant business interests.  He made medals and tombs in an international style for the Brussels elite, especially [[Cardinal Granvelle]], who was also a keen patron of Bruegel.<ref>Snyder, 484\u2013485</ref>  Granvelle owned at least two Bruegels, including the [[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Courtauld ''Flight into Egypt'']], but we do not know if he bought them directly from the artist.<ref>Orenstein, 9\u201310; [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98029502.pdf p. 30]</ref>  Granvelle's nephew and heir was strong-armed out of his Bruegels by [[Rudolf II]], the very acquisitive Austrian Habsburg Emperor. <!-- check -->  The series of the ''Months'' entered the [[Habsburg]] collections in 1594, given to Rudolf's brother and later taken by the emperor himself.

The most frequently copied works were generally not the ones that are most famous today, though this may reflect the availability of the full-scale detailed drawings that were evidently used.  The most-copied painting is the ''Winter Landscape with (Skaters and) a Bird Trap'' (1565), of which the original is in Brussels; 127 copies are recorded.<ref>[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l14033/lot.10.html Sotheby's: Catalogue note on a good copy], sold London, Lot 10 9 July 2014</ref> They include paintings after some of Bruegel's drawn print designs, especially ''Spring''.<ref>Orenstein, 67\u201384</ref>\n\nThe next century's artists of peasant genre scenes were heavily influenced by Brueghel.<ref>Orenstein, 67\u201384</ref>  Outside the Brueghel family, early figures were [[Adriaen Brouwer]] (c. 1605/6-1638) and [[David Vinckboons]] (1576\u2013c.1632), both Flemish-born but spending much of their time in the northern Netherlands.  As well as the general conception of such ''kermis'' subjects, Vinckboons and other artists took from Bruegel \"such stylistic devices as the bird's-eye perspective, ornamentalized vegetation, bright palette, and stocky, odious figures.<ref>Franits, 35, 53\u201354</ref>  Forty years after their deaths, and over a century after Bruegel's, [[Jan Steen]] (1626\u201379) continued to show a particular interest in Bruegelian treatments.<ref>Franits, 203</ref>\n\nThe critical treatment of Bruegel as essentially an artist of comic peasant scenes persisted until the late 19th century, even after his best paintings became widely visible as royal and aristocratic collections were turned into museums.  This had been partly explicable when his work was mainly known from copies, prints and reproductions.<ref>Grove</ref>  Even Henri Hymans, whose work of 1890/91 was the first important contribution to modern Bruegel scholarship, could describe him thus: \"His field of enquiry is certainly not of the most extensive; his ambition, too, is modest. He confines himself to a knowledge of mankind and the most immediate objects\", a line no modern scholar is likely to take.<ref>Grove</ref>  As his landscape paintings, in good colour reproduction, have become his best-loved works, so his importance in the history of [[landscape art]] has become understood.<ref>Grove</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThere are about forty generally accepted surviving paintings, twelve of which are in the  [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]].<ref>Grove; Manfred Sellink in 2012 listed forty paintings, seventy drawings and seventy-five prints, the latter slightly higher numbers than other sources.</ref>   A number of others are known to have been lost, including what, according to van Mander, Bruegel himself thought his best work, \"a picture in which Truth triumphs\".<ref>Wied, 17</ref>\n\nBruegel only etched one plate himself, ''The Rabbit Hunt,'' but designed some forty prints, both [[engraving]]s and [[etching]]s, mostly for the [[Hieronymus Cock|Cock publishing house]].

poem \"[[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts (poem)|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts]]\" by [[W. H. Auden]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nIn Brueghel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away\nQuite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman\nHave heard the splash, the forsaken cry,\nBut for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone\nAs it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green\nWater, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen\nSomething amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,\nHad somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIt also was the subject of a 1960 [[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|poem]] by [[William Carlos Williams]] and was referenced in [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s 1976 science fiction film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''. Further, Williams' final collection of poetry references a number of Bruegel's work.\n\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel de Oude - Twee geketend apen.jpg|thumb|''Two Monkeys'', 1562, oil on panel]]\n\nBruegel's painting ''[[Two Monkeys (Bruegel)|Two Monkeys]]'' was the subject of [[Wis\u0142awa Szymborska]]'s 1957 poem, \"Brueghel's Two Monkeys\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Szymborska|first=Wislawa|title=View With a Grain of Sand|year=1995|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page=3}}</ref>\n\nRussian film director [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] referenced Bruegel's paintings in his films several times, notably in ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975).\n\nDirector [[Lars von Trier]] also uses Bruegel's paintings in his film ''[[Melancholia]]'' (2011). This was used as a reference to Tarkovsky's ''Solaris'', a movie with related themes.\n\nHis 1564 painting ''[[The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)|The Procession to Calvary]]'' inspired the 2011 Polish-Swedish film co-production ''[[The Mill and the Cross]]'', in which Bruegel is played by [[Rutger Hauer]].  Bruegel's paintings in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] are shown in the 2012 film, ''[[Museum Hours]]'', where his work is discussed at length by a guide.\n\n[[Seamus Heaney]] referenced Brueghel in his poem \"[[The Seed Cutters]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Heaney |first=Seamus |authorlink=Seamus Heaney |title=Opened Ground: Poems 1966\u20131996 |publisher=Faber & Faber |page=60 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hPvJn4dSIqwC&pg=PA60 |isbn=978-0-571-26279-3}}</ref>  David Jones references the painting ''The Blind Leading the Blind'' in his World War One prose-poem ''[[In Parenthesis]]'': \"the stumbling dark of the blind, that Breughel knew about - ditch circumscribed\".\n\n[[Michael Frayn]], in his novel ''[[Headlong (Frayn novel)|Headlong]]'', imagines a lost panel from the 1565 ''Months'' series resurfacing unrecognized, which triggers a mad conflict between an art (and money) lover and the boor who possesses it.  Much thought is spent on Bruegel's secret motives for painting it.\n\nIn his book ''American Barricade'', Danniel Schoonebeek references several Brueghel paintings in his poem \"Poem for a Seven-Hour Flight\", notably in the lines: \"I am the hounds in Brueghel / do you know the hounds // here is the single fox I have killed will you wear it around your shoulders are you ashamed.\"\n\nAuthor [[Don Delillo]] references Bruegel's painting ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' in his novel ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' and his short story \"[[Pafko at the Wall]]\". It is believed that the painting ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'' influenced the classic [[Hunters in the Snow (short story)|short story with the same title]] written by [[Tobias Wolff]] and featured in ''In the Garden of the North American Martyrs''.\n\nIn the foreword to his novel ''The Folly of the World'', author [[Jesse Bullington]] explains that Bruegel's painting [[Netherlandish Proverbs]] not only inspired the title but also the plot to some extent. Various sections are introduced with a proverb depicted in the painting that alludes to a plot element.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]\n* [[Early Netherlandish painting]]\n* [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''Landscape into Art'', 1949, page refs to Penguin edn of 1961\n*Franits, Wayne, ''Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting'', Yale UP, 2004, {{ISBN|0300102372}}\n*[[Ernst Gombrich|Gombrich, E.H.]], ''[[The Story of Art]]'', Phaidon, 13th edn. 1982. {{ISBN|0 7148 1841 0}}\n*\"Grove\": Wied, Alexander and Van Miegroet, Hans J.  \"Bruegel.\" [[Grove Art Online]].

He also painted no portraits, the other mainstay of Netherlandish art.  After his training and travels to Italy, he returned in 1555 to settle in [[Antwerp]], where he worked mainly as a prolific designer of [[old master print|prints]] for the leading publisher of the day. Only towards the end of the decade did he switch to make painting his main medium, and all his famous paintings come from the following period of little more than a decade before his early death, when he was probably in his early forties, and at the height of his powers.\n\nAs well as looking forwards, his art reinvigorates medieval subjects such as marginal [[drollerie]]s of ordinary life in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and the calendar scenes of agricultural labours set in landscape backgrounds, and puts these on a much larger scale than before, and in the expensive medium of [[oil painting]]. He does the same with the fantastic and anarchic world developed in Renaissance prints and book illustrations.<ref>Gombrich, 295; Clark, 41\u201343, 27, 33, 57, also covering Gothic aspects of Bruegel's style</ref>\n\nHe is sometimes referred to as \"Peasant Bruegel\", to distinguish him from the many later painters in [[Brueghel family|his family]], including his son [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] (1564\u20131638). From 1559, he dropped the 'h' from his name and signed his paintings as ''Bruegel''; his relatives continued to use \"Brueghel\" or \"Breughel\".\n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder- The Seven Deadly Sins or the Seven Vices - Anger.JPG|thumb|[[Engraving]] designed by Bruegel and published by [[Hieronymus Cock]],  ''The Seven Deadly Sins or the Seven Vices \u2013 Anger'', 1558]]\nThe two main early sources for Bruegel's biography are [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s account of the Low Countries (1567) and [[Karel van Mander]]'s 1604 ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''.<ref>Grove; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0221.php van Mander's Bruegel biography in Dutch]; Wied, 15\u201318 gives a full English translation. Guicciardini was an Italian who had lived in Antwerp since at least 1542, and probably knew Bruegel, which Van Mander, born in 1648 on the [[Meulebeke|other side of Flanders]], is most unlikely to have done.</ref>  Guicciardini recorded that Bruegel was born in [[Breda]], but Van Mander specified that Bruegel was born in a village (''dorp'') near Breda called \"Brueghel\",<ref>\"den welcken is geboren niet wijt van Breda, op een Dorp geheeten Brueghel, welcks naem hy met hem ghedraghen heeft, en zijn naecomelinghen ghelaten.\"</ref> which does not fit any known place.<ref>Grove: \"none of the three Flemish villages of that name is close to Breda\".; Wied, 18, says two of the villages (Groot Bruegel and Cleyn Bruegel) are close to [[Bree, Belgium]], which is \"Breda\" in Latin, perhaps causing Van Mander confusion. [[Son en Breugel]] still has supporters but is 34 miles from Breda, though just outside [[Eindhoven]] \u2013 see [https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/13292 RKD].</ref>  Nothing at all is known of his family background. Van Mander seems to assume he came from a peasant background, in keeping with the over-emphasis on Bruegel's peasant genre scenes given by van Mander and many early art historians and critics.<ref>Orenstein, 57\u201358; Grove</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0447\u0430 \u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u044b\u0445.jpeg|thumb|''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]'', 1568]]\n\nIn contrast, scholars of the last sixty years have emphasized the intellectual content of his work, and conclude: \"There is, in fact, every reason to think that Pieter Bruegel was a townsman and a highly educated one, on friendly terms with the humanists of his time\",<ref>Grove</ref> ignoring Van Mander's ''dorp'' and just placing his childhood in Breda itself.<ref>Orenstein, 57\u201358; Grove</ref>  Breda was already a significant centre as the base of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], with a population of some 8,000,<ref>Wied, 19\u201320</ref> although 90% of the 1300 houses were destroyed in a fire in 1534.  However, this reversal cExample: The formula for finding the volume of a box is:\nV = lwh\n\nV stands for volume, l for length, w for width, and h for height.\n\n\ncuboid\nWhen l=10, w=4, and h=5, then:\n\nV = 10 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 = 200an be taken to excess; although Bruegel moved in highly educated [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] circles, it seems \"he had not mastered Latin\", and had others add the Latin captions in some of his drawings.<ref>Orenstein, 64</ref>\n\nFrom the fact that Bruegel entered the Antwerp painters' guild in 1551, it is inferred that he was born between 1525 and 1530.<ref>Orenstein, 5; Grove</ref> His master, according to Van Mander, was the Antwerp painter [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]], whose daughter [[Mayken Coecke]] Bruegel married in 1563.<ref>Orenstein, 5</ref>\n\nBetween 1545 and 1550 he was a pupil of Pieter Coecke, who died on 6 December 1550.<ref>This is according to Van Mander; although there is no documentation and little evident stylistic influence from his future father-in-law, modern scholars generally accept this.</ref>  However, before this, Bruegel was already working in [[Mechelen]], where he is documented between September 1550 and October 1551 assisting [[Peeter Baltens]] on an altarpiece (now lost), painting the wings in ''[[grisaille]]''.<ref>Grove</ref> Bruegel possibly got this work via the connections of [[Mayken Verhulst]], the wife of Pieter Coecke. Mayken's father and eight siblings were all artists or married an artist, and lived in Mechelen.<ref>Orenstein, 5, 7</ref>\n\n===Travel===\nIn 1551 Bruegel became a free master in the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] of Antwerp.  He set off for Italy soon after, probably by way of France.

There he met the miniaturist [[Giulio Clovio]], whose will of 1578 lists paintings by Bruegel; in one case a joint work.

He moved in the lively [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] circles of the city, and his change of name (or at least its spelling) in 1559 can be seen as an attempt to Latinize it; at the same time he changed the script he signed in from the Gothic [[blackletter]] to Roman capitals.<ref>Grove</ref>\n\nIn 1563 he was married in Brussels, where he lived for the remainder of his short life. While Antwerp was the capital of Netherlandish commerce as well as the art market,<ref>Wied, 9\u201310</ref> Brussels was the centre of government.

His paintings were much sought after, with patrons including wealthy Flemish collectors and [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|Cardinal Granvelle]], in effect the [[Habsburg]] chief minister, who was based in Mechelen. Bruegel had two sons, both well known as painters, and a daughter about whom nothing is known. These were [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] (1564\u20131638) and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] (1568\u20131625); he died too early to train either of them.

Boere Breugel -->\n\n==Historical background==\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. \u00c4. 007.jpg|thumb|''[[The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)|The Procession to Calvary]]'', 1564, Bruegel's second largest painting at 124 cm \u00d7 170 cm (49 in \u00d7 67 in)]]\n\nBruegel was born at a time of extensive change in Western Europe. [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] ideals from the previous century influenced artists and scholars. Italy was at the end of its High Renaissance of arts and culture, when artists such as [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] painted their masterpieces. In 1517, about eight years before Bruegel's birth, [[Martin Luther]] created his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' and began the [[Protestant Reformation]] in neighboring Germany. Reformation was accompanied by [[Iconoclasm#Protestant Reformation|iconoclasm]] and widespread [[Beeldenstorm|destruction of art]], including in the [[Low Countries]]. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and its iconoclasm as a threat to the Church. The [[Council of Trent]], which concluded in 1563, [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|determined]] that religious art should be more focused on religious subject-matter and less on material things and decorative qualities.\n\nAt this time, the Low Countries were divided into [[Seventeen Provinces]], some of which wanted separation from the [[Habsburg]] rule based in Spain. The Reformation meanwhile produced a number of Protestant denominations that gained followers in the Seventeen Provinces, influenced by the newly Lutheran German states to the east and the newly Anglican England to the west. The Habsburg monarchs of Spain attempted a policy of strict religious uniformity for the Catholic Church within their domains and enforced it with the [[Inquisition]]. Increasing religious antagonisms and riots, political manoeuvrings, and executions eventually resulted in the outbreak of [[Eighty Years' War]].\n\nIn this atmosphere Bruegel reached the height of his career as a painter. Two years before his death, the Eighty Years' War began between the United Provinces and Spain. Although Bruegel did not live to see it, seven provinces became independent and formed the [[Dutch Republic]], while the other ten remained under Habsburg control at the end of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library of Art|location=Library of Congress|pages=18\u201327}}</ref>\n\n==Subjects==\n===Peasants===\n[[File:Pieter Brueghel the Elder - The Dutch Proverbs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'', 1559, oil on oak wood]]\n[[File:Pieter brueghel the elder-children playing-detail.jpeg|thumb|A detail of ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', 1560]]\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Peasant Wedding - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|''[[The Peasant Wedding]]'', 1566\u201369, oil on panel. A late peasant subject, with a more monumental treatment.]]\n\nPieter Bruegel specialized in [[genre painting]]s populated by peasants, often with a landscape element, though he also painted religious works. Making the life and manners of peasants the main focus of a work was rare in painting in Bruegel's time, and he was a pioneer of the genre painting. Many of his peasant paintings fall into two groups in terms of scale and composition, both of which were original and influential on later painting. His earlier style shows dozens of small figures, seen from a high viewpoint, and spread fairly evenly across the central picture space. The setting is typically an urban space surrounded by buildings, within which the figures have a \"fundamentally disconnected manner of portrayal\", with individuals or small groups engaged in their own distinct activity, while ignoring all the others.<ref>Franits, 203</ref>\n\nHis earthy, unsentimental but vivid depiction of the rituals of village life\u2014including agriculture, hunts, meals, festivals, dances, and games\u2014are unique windows on a vanished folk culture, though still characteristic of Belgian life and culture today, and a prime source of [[iconography|iconographic]] evidence about both physical and social aspects of 16th-century life. For example, his famous painting ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'', originally ''[[The Blue Cloak]]'', illustrates dozens of then-contemporary [[aphorism]]s, many of which still are in use in current Flemish, French, English and Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stokstad, Cothren|first=Marilyn, Michael|title=Art History- Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art|year=2010}}</ref> The Flemish environment provided a large artistic audience for proverb-filled paintings because proverbs were well known and recognizable as well as entertaining. ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' shows the variety of amusements enjoyed by young people. His winter landscapes of 1565, like ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', are taken as corroborative evidence of the severity of winters during the [[Little Ice Age]]. Bruegel often painted community events, as in ''[[The Peasant Wedding]]'' and ''[[The Fight Between Carnival and Lent]]''. In paintings like ''The Peasant Wedding'', Bruegel painted individual, identifiable people, while the people in ''The Fight Between Carnival and Lent'' are unidentifiable, muffin-faced allegories of greed or gluttony.\n\nBruegel also painted religious scenes in a wide Flemish landscape setting, as in the ''[[Conversion of Paul (Bruegel)|Conversion of Paul]]'' and ''The Sermon of St. John the Baptist''. Even if Bruegel's subject matter was unconventional, the religious ideals and proverbs driving his paintings were typical of the Northern Renaissance. He accurately depicted people with disabilities, such as in ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]'', which depicted a quote from the Bible: \"If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch\" (Matthew 15:14). Using the Bible to interpret this painting, the six blind men are symbols of the blindness of mankind in pursuing earthly goals instead of focusing on Christ's teachings.\n\nUsing abundant spirit and comic power, Bruegel created some of the very early images of acute social protest in art history. Examples include paintings such as ''[[The Fight Between Carnival and Lent]]'' (a satire of the conflicts of the [[Protestant Reformation]]) and engravings like ''The Ass in the School'' and ''Strongboxes Battling Piggybanks''.<ref>Mayor, A. Hyatt (1971). ''Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 426.</ref>\n\nOver the 1560s Bruegel moved to a style showing only a few large figures, typically in a landscape background without a distant view. His paintings dominated by their landscapes take a middle course as regards both the number and size of figures.\n\n; Late monumental peasant figures\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Pieter Bruegel d. \u00c4. 037.jpg|''[[The Land of Cockaigne (Bruegel)|The Land of Cockaigne]]'' (1567), [[Alte Pinakothek]], an illustration of the medieval mythical land of plenty called [[Cockaigne]]\nFile:The Peasant and the Birdnester Pieter Bruegel the Elder 1568.jpeg|''[[The Peasant and the Nest Robber]]'' (1568), [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna\nFile:Pieter Bruegel The Peasant Dance.jpg|''[[The Peasant Dance]]'' (1568), [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna, oil on oak panel\nFile:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Cripples.JPG|''[[The Beggars (Bruegel)|The Beggars (The Cripples)]]'' (1568), [[Louvre]], Paris, oil on panel\n</gallery>\n\n===Landscape elements===\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel der \u00c4ltere - Landschaft mit der Flucht nach \u00c4gypten.jpg|thumb|''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'', 1563, 37.1 \u00d7 55.6 cm (14.6 \u00d7 21.9 in), owned by [[Cardinal Granvelle]]]]\n\nBruegel adapted and made more natural the [[world landscape]] style, which shows small figures in an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint that includes mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings.  Back in Antwerp from Italy he was commissioned in the 1550s by the publisher [[Hieronymus Cock]] to make drawings for a series of [[engraving]]s, the ''Large Landscapes'', to meet what was now a growing demand for landscape images.\n\nSome of his earlier paintings, such as his ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'' ([[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld]], 1563), are fully within the Patinir conventions, but his ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' (known from two copies) had a Patinir-style landscape, in which already the largest figure was a [[genre painting|genre figure]] who was only a bystander for the supposed narrative subject, and may not even be aware of it.  The date of Bruegel's lost original is unclear,<ref>about 1558 has been suggested</ref> but it is probably relatively early, and if so, foreshadows the trend of his later works.  During the 1560s the early scenes crowded with multitudes of very small figures, whether peasant genre figures or figures in religious narratives, give way to a small number of much larger figures.\n\n====Months of the year====\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', 1565, oil on wood]]\n\nHis famous set of landscapes with genre figures depicting the seasons are the culmination of his landscape style; the five surviving paintings use the basic elements of the world landscape (only one lacks craggy mountains) but transform them into his own style.  They are larger than most previous works, with a [[genre scene]] with several figures in the foreground, and the panoramic view seen past or through trees.<ref>Silver, 39\u201352; Snyder, 502\u2013510; Harbison, 140\u2013142; Schama, 431\u2013433</ref>  Bruegel was also aware of the [[Danube School]]'s landscape style through [[old master print|prints]].<ref>Wood, Chapter 5, especially 275\u2013278</ref>\n\nThe series on the months of the year includes several of Bruegel's best-known works. In 1565, a wealthy patron in Antwerp, [[Niclaes Jonghelinck]], commissioned him to paint a series of paintings of each month of the year. There has been disagreement among art historians as to whether the series originally included six or twelve works.<ref>Gibson, Walter S. (1977) . Bruegel. The World of Art Library. Thames and Hudson pp 147\u2013148.</ref> Today, only five of these paintings survive and some of the months are paired to form a general season. Traditional Flemish luxury [[book of hours|books of hours]] (e.g., the [[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]];<ref>{{cite book|last=Stokstad, Cothren|first=Marilyn, Michael|title=Art History- Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art|year=2010}}</ref> 1416) had calendar pages that included the [[Labours of the Months]], depictions set in landscapes of the agricultural tasks, weather, and social life typical for that month.\n\nBruegel's paintings were on a far larger scale than a typical calendar page painting, each one approximately three feet by five feet. For Bruegel, this was a large commission (the size of a commission was based on how large the painting was) and an important one. In 1565, the Calvinist riots began and it was only two years before the Eighty Years' War broke out. Bruegel may have felt safer with a secular commission so as to not offend Calvinist or Catholic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library|location=Library of Congress}}</ref> Some of the most famous paintings from this series included ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'' (December\u2013January) and ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]'' (August).\n\n==Prints and drawings==\n[[File:Die Bienenz\u00fcchter (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|''Beekeepers'', c. 1568]]\nOn his return from Italy to Antwerp, Bruegel earned his living producing drawings to be turned into prints for the leading print publisher of the city, and indeed northern Europe, [[Hieronymus Cock]].  At his \"House of the Four Winds\" Cock ran a well-oiled production and distribution operation efficiently turning out prints of many sorts that was more concerned with sales than the finest artistic achievement.  Most of Bruegel's prints come from this period, but he continued to produce drawn designs for prints until the end of his life, leaving only two completed out of a series of the ''Four Seasons''.<ref>Orenstein, 236\u2013238, and following pages</ref>  The prints were popular and it is reasonable to assume that all those published have survived.  In many cases we also have Bruegel's drawings.  Although the subject matter of his graphic work was often continued in his paintings, there are considerable differences in emphases between the two ''oeuvres''.  To his contemporaries and for long after, until public museums and good reproductions of the paintings made these better known, Bruegel was much better known through his prints than his paintings, which largely explains the critical assessment of him as merely the creator of comic peasant scenes.<ref>Wied, 36</ref>\n\nThe prints are mostly engravings, though from about 1559 onwards some are [[etching]]s or mixtures of both techniques.<ref>Orenstein catalogues the prints in chronological order, as far as it is known</ref>  Only one complete [[woodcut]] was made from a Bruegel design, with another left incomplete.  This, ''The Dirty Wife'', is a most unusual survival (now [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) of a drawing on the wooden block intended for printing.  For some reason, the specialist [[Woodcut#Division of labour|block-cutter]] who carved away the block, following the drawing while also destroying it, had only done one corner of the design before stopping work. The design then appears as an engraving, perhaps soon after Bruegel's death.<ref>Orenstein, 241\u2013242, 246\u2013248; [http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/338710 Metropolitan page]</ref>\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Spring, 1565 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''Spring'', 1565, a drawing made to be engraved. It was apparently never painted by Bruegel himself, but after his death came dozens of versions in paint by his son and others.]]\n\nAmong his greatest successes were a series of allegories, among several designs adopting many of the very individual mannerisms of his compatriot [[Hieronymus Bosch]]: ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' and ''The Virtues''. The sinners are grotesque and unidentifiable while the allegories of virtue often wear odd headgear.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library|location=Library of Congress}}</ref>  That imitations of Bosch sold well is demonstrated by his drawing ''Big Fish Eat Little Fish'' (now [[Albertina]]), which Bruegel signed but Cock shamelessly attributed to Bosch in the print version.<ref>Orenstein, 140\u2013142</ref>\n\nAlthough Bruegel presumably made them, no drawings that are clearly preparatory studies for paintings survive.  Most surviving drawings are finished designs for prints, or landscape drawings that are fairly finished.  After a considerable purge of attributions in recent decades, led by [[Hans Mielke]],<ref>Grove</ref> sixty-one sheets of drawings are now generally agreed to be by Bruegel.<ref>Orenstein, vii gives the total; fifty-four were in the exhibition and are catalogued, and most others illustrated.  These included all those from the largest collections, Berlin (10), London (8) and Vienna (6). Sellink in 2012 lists 70.</ref>  A new \"Master of the Mountain Landscapes\" has emerged from the carnage.  Mielke's key observation was that the lily watermark on the paper of several sheets was only found from around 1580 onwards, which led to the rapid acceptance of his proposal.<ref>Orenstein, 266\u2013267, and following catalogue pages for individual works.</ref>  Another group of about twenty-five pen drawings of landscapes, many signed and dated as by Bruegel, are now given to [[Jacob Savery]], probably from the decade of so before Savery's death in 1603. A giveaway was that two drawings including the walls of [[Amsterdam]] were dated 1563 but included elements only built in the 1590s.  This group appears to have been made as deliberate forgeries.<ref>Orenstein, 276\u2013277, and following catalogue pages for individual works.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nAround 1563 Bruegel moved from [[Antwerp]] to [[Brussels]], in Brussels he married [[Mayken Coecke]], the daughter of the painter [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]] and [[Mayken Verhulst]]. As registered in the archives of the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Antwerp]], their [[Ondertrouw|deposition for marriage]] was registered 25 July, 1563. The marriage itself was concluded in the [[Chapel Church]], Brussels in 1563.<ref>Jean Bastiaensen, \u201cDe verloving van Pieter Bruegel de Oude.

Their grandmother, [[Mayken Verhulst]], trained the sons because \"the Elder\" died when both were very small children. The older brother, Pieter Brueghel copied his father's style and compositions with competence and considerable commercial success. Jan was much more original, and very versatile.  He was an important figure in the transition to the Baroque style in [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] in a number of its genres.  He was often a collaborator with other leading artists, including with [[Peter Paul Rubens]] on many works including the ''Allegory of Sight''.\n\nOther members of the family include [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]] and [[Mayken Verhulst]] (father-in-law and mother-in-law to Pieter Bruegel the Elder), [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]] (grandson of Jan Bruegel the Elder) and [[Jan van Kessel the Younger]]. Through David Teniers, the family is also related to the whole Teniers family of painters and the Quellinus family of painters and sculptors, since [[Jan-Erasmus Quellinus]] married Cornelia, daughter of David Teniers the Younger.\n\n{{Brueghel}}\n\n==Reception history==\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Massacre of the Innocents - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Massacre of the Innocents (Bruegel)|Massacre of the Innocents]]'', (c. 1565\u20131567), British [[Royal Collection]]. A much-copied painting]]\n\nBruegel's art was long more highly valued by collectors than critics.  His friend [[Abraham Ortelius]] described him in a friendship album in 1574 as \"the most perfect painter of his century\", but both [[Vasari]] and Van Mander see him as essentially a comic successor to [[Hieronymus Bosch]].<ref>Snyder, 484; Orenstein, 9-11, 59</ref>\n\nBut Bruegel's work was, as far as we know, always keenly collected.  The banker Nicolaes Jonghelinck owned sixteen paintings; his brother [[Jacques Jonghelinck]] was a gentleman-sculptor and medallist, who also had significant business interests.  He made medals and tombs in an international style for the Brussels elite, especially [[Cardinal Granvelle]], who was also a keen patron of Bruegel.<ref>Snyder, 484\u2013485</ref>  Granvelle owned at least two Bruegels, including the [[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Courtauld ''Flight into Egypt'']], but we do not know if he bought them directly from the artist.<ref>Orenstein, 9\u201310; [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98029502.pdf p. 30]</ref>  Granvelle's nephew and heir was strong-armed out of his Bruegels by [[Rudolf II]], the very acquisitive Austrian Habsburg Emperor. <!-- check -->  The series of the ''Months'' entered the [[Habsburg]] collections in 1594, given to Rudolf's brother and later taken by the emperor himself.

The most frequently copied works were generally not the ones that are most famous today, though this may reflect the availability of the full-scale detailed drawings that were evidently used.  The most-copied painting is the ''Winter Landscape with (Skaters and) a Bird Trap'' (1565), of which the original is in Brussels; 127 copies are recorded.<ref>[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l14033/lot.10.html Sotheby's: Catalogue note on a good copy], sold London, Lot 10 9 July 2014</ref> They include paintings after some of Bruegel's drawn print designs, especially ''Spring''.<ref>Orenstein, 67\u201384</ref>\n\nThe next century's artists of peasant genre scenes were heavily influenced by Brueghel.<ref>Orenstein, 67\u201384</ref>  Outside the Brueghel family, early figures were [[Adriaen Brouwer]] (c. 1605/6-1638) and [[David Vinckboons]] (1576\u2013c.1632), both Flemish-born but spending much of their time in the northern Netherlands.  As well as the general conception of such ''kermis'' subjects, Vinckboons and other artists took from Bruegel \"such stylistic devices as the bird's-eye perspective, ornamentalized vegetation, bright palette, and stocky, odious figures.<ref>Franits, 35, 53\u201354</ref>  Forty years after their deaths, and over a century after Bruegel's, [[Jan Steen]] (1626\u201379) continued to show a particular interest in Bruegelian treatments.<ref>Franits, 203</ref>\n\nThe critical treatment of Bruegel as essentially an artist of comic peasant scenes persisted until the late 19th century, even after his best paintings became widely visible as royal and aristocratic collections were turned into museums.  This had been partly explicable when his work was mainly known from copies, prints and reproductions.<ref>Grove</ref>  Even Henri Hymans, whose work of 1890/91 was the first important contribution to modern Bruegel scholarship, could describe him thus: \"His field of enquiry is certainly not of the most extensive; his ambition, too, is modest. He confines himself to a knowledge of mankind and the most immediate objects\", a line no modern scholar is likely to take.<ref>Grove</ref>  As his landscape paintings, in good colour reproduction, have become his best-loved works, so his importance in the history of [[landscape art]] has become understood.<ref>Grove</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThere are about forty generally accepted surviving paintings, twelve of which are in the  [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]].<ref>Grove; Manfred Sellink in 2012 listed forty paintings, seventy drawings and seventy-five prints, the latter slightly higher numbers than other sources.</ref>   A number of others are known to have been lost, including what, according to van Mander, Bruegel himself thought his best work, \"a picture in which Truth triumphs\".<ref>Wied, 17</ref>\n\nBruegel only etched one plate himself, ''The Rabbit Hunt,'' but designed some forty prints, both [[engraving]]s and [[etching]]s, mostly for the [[Hieronymus Cock|Cock publishing house]].

of Icarus]]'', probably an early copy of Bruegel's lost original, c. 1558.]]\nHis painting ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', now thought only to survive in copies, is the subject of the 1938 poem \"[[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts (poem)|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts]]\" by [[W. H. Auden]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nIn Brueghel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away\nQuite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman\nHave heard the splash, the forsaken cry,\nBut for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone\nAs it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green\nWater, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen\nSomething amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,\nHad somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIt also was the subject of a 1960 [[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|poem]] by [[William Carlos Williams]] and was referenced in [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s 1976 science fiction film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''. Further, Williams' final collection of poetry references a number of Bruegel's work.\n\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel de Oude - Twee geketend apen.jpg|thumb|''Two Monkeys'', 1562, oil on panel]]\n\nBruegel's painting ''[[Two Monkeys (Bruegel)|Two Monkeys]]'' was the subject of [[Wis\u0142awa Szymborska]]'s 1957 poem, \"Brueghel's Two Monkeys\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Szymborska|first=Wislawa|title=View With a Grain of Sand|year=1995|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page=3}}</ref>\n\nRussian film director [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] referenced Bruegel's paintings in his films several times, notably in ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975).\n\nDirector [[Lars von Trier]] also uses Bruegel's paintings in his film ''[[Melancholia]]'' (2011). This was used as a reference to Tarkovsky's ''Solaris'', a movie with related themes.\n\nHis 1564 painting ''[[The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)|The Procession to Calvary]]'' inspired the 2011 Polish-Swedish film co-production ''[[The Mill and the Cross]]'', in which Bruegel is played by [[Rutger Hauer]].  Bruegel's paintings in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] are shown in the 2012 film, ''[[Museum Hours]]'', where his work is discussed at length by a guide.\n\n[[Seamus Heaney]] referenced Brueghel in his poem \"[[The Seed Cutters]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Heaney |first=Seamus |authorlink=Seamus Heaney |title=Opened Ground: Poems 1966\u20131996 |publisher=Faber & Faber |page=60 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hPvJn4dSIqwC&pg=PA60 |isbn=978-0-571-26279-3}}</ref>  David Jones references the painting ''The Blind Leading the Blind'' in his World War One prose-poem ''[[In Parenthesis]]'': \"the stumbling dark of the blind, that Breughel knew about - ditch circumscribed\".\n\n[[Michael Frayn]], in his novel ''[[Headlong (Frayn novel)|Headlong]]'', imagines a lost panel from the 1565 ''Months'' series resurfacing unrecognized, which triggers a mad conflict between an art (and money) lover and the boor who possesses it.  Much thought is spent on Bruegel's secret motives for painting it.\n\nIn his book ''American Barricade'', Danniel Schoonebeek references several Brueghel paintings in his poem \"Poem for a Seven-Hour Flight\", notably in the lines: \"I am the hounds in Brueghel / do you know the hounds // here is the single fox I have killed will you wear it around your shoulders are you ashamed.\"\n\nAuthor [[Don Delillo]] references Bruegel's painting ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' in his novel ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' and his short story \"[[Pafko at the Wall]]\". It is believed that the painting ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'' influenced the classic [[Hunters in the Snow (short story)|short story with the same title]] written by [[Tobias Wolff]] and featured in ''In the Garden of the North American Martyrs''.\n\nIn the foreword to his novel ''The Folly of the World'', author [[Jesse Bullington]] explains that Bruegel's painting [[Netherlandish Proverbs]] not only inspired the title but also the plot to some extent. Various sections are introduced with a proverb depicted in the painting that alludes to a plot element.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]\n* [[Early Netherlandish painting]]\n* [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''Landscape into Art'', 1949, page refs to Penguin edn of 1961\n*Franits, Wayne, ''Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting'', Yale UP, 2004, {{ISBN|0300102372}}\n*[[Ernst Gombrich|Gombrich, E.H.]], ''[[The Story of Art]]'', Phaidon, 13th edn. 1982. {{ISBN|0 7148 1841 0}}\n*\"Grove\": Wied, Alexander and Van Miegroet, Hans J.  \"Bruegel.\" [[Grove Art Online]].
