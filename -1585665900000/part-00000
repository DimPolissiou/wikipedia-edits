Manchester City are 2 points behind in second. Leicester City, Crystal Palace and West Ham United have made good starts to the season and occupy third to fifth, ahead of Arsenal (with a game in hand) and Manchester United. Newly-promoted Aston Villa and Norwich City are having a tough time on their return to the top flight, tied on 3 points apiece with Wolverhampton Wanderers (who have played 9 games already en route to the Europa League group stage, and have a game in hand), and only above Watford, the only Premier League team without a win so far. Swansea City are having a good start under Steve Cooper's management to lead the Championship, 2 points ahead of newly-promoted Charlton Athletic. Leeds United stand third and look to be contending for another attempt at promotion. West Bromwich Albion and Bristol City stand in fourth and fifth; newly-relegated Fulham, Preston North End, Queens Park Rangers, and managerless Birmingham City tussle for the sixth play-off spot. Another newly-relegated team, Huddersfield Town, are having a torrid start on their return to the second tier and stand in 23rd on 1 point, with manager Jan Siewert sacked a fortnight earlier. Stoke City prop up the table with 1 point also, 3 points behind 22nd-placed Wigan Athletic.\n* 30 September 2019: September ends with Liverpool now 5 points clear of second-placed Manchester City. Leicester and West Ham continue their good starts to the season and stand third and fifth, sandwiching Arsenal; Tottenham and Chelsea are sixth and seventh. Watford, still without a win, prop up the table, 3 points behind Aston Villa (18th) and Newcastle United. West Brom now lead the Championship, 1 point ahead of Swansea and Nottingham Forest and 2 ahead of Leeds, Preston, and Charlton. Wigan has climbed to 21st at the expense of Barnsley; the Championship relegation zone is otherwise unchanged.\n* 25 October 2019: Leicester break the record for the biggest away win in top-flight history with a 9\u20130 victory at Southampton.\n* 31 October 2019: Liverpool end October six points ahead of Manchester City, though they have lost their 100% record due to a 1\u20131 draw at Old Trafford. Leicester remain third, ahead of Chelsea on goal difference, largely thanks to that 9\u20130 victory over Southampton. Arsenal are 4 points adrift of the Champions League places in fifth, Crystal Palace's good start sees them sixth after 3 months played, and Manchester United, Sheffield United, Bournemouth, and West Ham share seventh with only goal difference separating them. Watford remain winless and bottom, now joined by Norwich and Southampton. West Brom continue to lead the Championship, two points ahead of Preston, Leeds, and Swansea. Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol City complete the top six. Barnsley (24th) and Stoke are joint bottom, joined in the Championship's bottom three by Middlesbrough.\n* 30 November 2019: Liverpool remain top of the league at the end of November, 11 points clear of Manchester City and Leicester (the latter of whom has a game in hand). Chelsea remain fourth. Spurs have jumped to fifth following Jose Mourinho's appointment, a point ahead of Wolves and two ahead of Sheffield United; however, the congested nature of the table below fourth is emphasised by the fact that the gap between Chelsea and Spurs (6 points) is the same as the gap between Spurs and 17th-placed Everton. The relegation zone remains unchanged from the end of October. Leeds lead the Championship, though second-placed West Brom have a game in hand. Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Bristol City and Preston make up the play-off zone. Barnsley and Stoke remain in the same places as last month, with Wigan replacing Middlesbrough in 22nd.\n* 31 December 2019: The new decade begins with Liverpool's lead extended to 16 points, Leicester and Manchester City swapping places, and Chelsea remaining fourth. Manchester United, Spurs, and Wolves are hot on the West London side's tails in the race for fourth. Watford have climbed off the bottom of the table at Norwich's expense, but remain in the bottom three, now joined by Aston Villa (18th). In the Championship, Leeds and West Brom hold a comfortable 9-point lead on Fulham, joined in the play-off places by Forest, Brentford, and Sheffield Wednesday. Stoke are now out of the drop zone on goal difference ahead of Barnsley and Luton, and Wigan a point behind.\n* 31 January 2020: Liverpool end January 19 points clear; it is increasingly a question of when, not if, the Merseysiders end their 30-year title drought. Manchester City have moved 3 points ahead of Leicester but the top 7 is otherwise unchanged from the end of December. Norwich and Watford remain 20th and 19th, but the relegation battle is heating up as only 2 goals separate West Ham (18th), Bournemouth and Watford, and Brighton and Villa only 2 points away from relegation. A difficult January has seen Leeds and West Brom's lead on third-placed Forest cut to 4 and 2 points respectively. Fulham are fourth, Brentford stay fifth, and Bristol City have taken sixth place from Sheffield Wednesday. Luton (24th) and Barnsley are 2 points behind 22nd-placed Wigan and 6 points from 21st-placed Charlton.\n* 29 February 2020: February ends with Watford ending Liverpool's unbeaten run; regardless, Liverpool are 22 points clear of Manchester City and need only 4 wins from 10 games to confirm the title. The only change to the top seven is with Sheffield United jumping above Wolves to seventh; however, the race for the Champions League is still far from decided as only 5 points separate Manchester United in fifth with Crystal Palace in 12th. The win over Liverpool has propelled Watford to 17th, above Bournemouth but below West Ham on goal difference. Villa are 2 points behind and Norwich 6 - it is not inconceivable that for only the second time in the Premier League's history, the final day could arrive with no team certain of the drop. With 10 games left in the Championship, West Brom and Leeds remain in the top 2, now 6 and 5 points away from third-placed Fulham. Forest (with a game in hand), Brentford and Preston complete the top 6. A run of 10 points from 6 games has seen Wigan rise to 19th, with Middlesbrough taking their place in the bottom three, although the Teesiders have a game in hand on their nearest rivals, Stoke (21st) and Charlton. Barnsley and Luton remain joint bottom.\n*13 March 2020: League Football is postponed for the foreseeable future due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus Pandemic]], leaving Liverpool just shy of claiming their first top flight title in 29 years. Some National League and lower fixtures go ahead, but many choose not to play for the safety of fans, staff and players. It is unknown how long the league will be out of action or how long until all fixtures get postponed.\n*26 March 2020: The FA rule that every league below National League [[National League North|North]]/[[National League South|South]], from Step 3 to Step 7, have been voided, and results expunged.

Manchester City are 2 points behind in second. Leicester City, Crystal Palace and West Ham United have made good starts to the season and occupy third to fifth, ahead of Arsenal (with a game in hand) and Manchester United. Newly-promoted Aston Villa and Norwich City are having a tough time on their return to the top flight, tied on 3 points apiece with Wolverhampton Wanderers (who have played 9 games already en route to the Europa League group stage, and have a game in hand), and only above Watford, the only Premier League team without a win so far. Swansea City are having a good start under Steve Cooper's management to lead the Championship, 2 points ahead of newly-promoted Charlton Athletic. Leeds United stand third and look to be contending for another attempt at promotion. West Bromwich Albion and Bristol City stand in fourth and fifth; newly-relegated Fulham, Preston North End, Queens Park Rangers, and managerless Birmingham City tussle for the sixth play-off spot. Another newly-relegated team, Huddersfield Town, are having a torrid start on their return to the second tier and stand in 23rd on 1 point, with manager Jan Siewert sacked a fortnight earlier. Stoke City prop up the table with 1 point also, 3 points behind 22nd-placed Wigan Athletic.\n* 30 September 2019: September ends with Liverpool now 5 points clear of second-placed Manchester City. Leicester and West Ham continue their good starts to the season and stand third and fifth, sandwiching Arsenal; Tottenham and Chelsea are sixth and seventh. Watford, still without a win, prop up the table, 3 points behind Aston Villa (18th) and Newcastle United. West Brom now lead the Championship, 1 point ahead of Swansea and Nottingham Forest and 2 ahead of Leeds, Preston, and Charlton. Wigan has climbed to 21st at the expense of Barnsley; the Championship relegation zone is otherwise unchanged.\n* 25 October 2019: Leicester break the record for the biggest away win in top-flight history with a 9\u20130 victory at Southampton.\n* 31 October 2019: Liverpool end October six points ahead of Manchester City, though they have lost their 100% record due to a 1\u20131 draw at Old Trafford. Leicester remain third, ahead of Chelsea on goal difference, largely thanks to that 9\u20130 victory over Southampton. Arsenal are 4 points adrift of the Champions League places in fifth, Crystal Palace's good start sees them sixth after 3 months played, and Manchester United, Sheffield United, Bournemouth, and West Ham share seventh with only goal difference separating them. Watford remain winless and bottom, now joined by Norwich and Southampton. West Brom continue to lead the Championship, two points ahead of Preston, Leeds, and Swansea. Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol City complete the top six. Barnsley (24th) and Stoke are joint bottom, joined in the Championship's bottom three by Middlesbrough.\n* 30 November 2019: Liverpool remain top of the league at the end of November, 11 points clear of Manchester City and Leicester (the latter of whom has a game in hand). Chelsea remain fourth. Spurs have jumped to fifth following Jose Mourinho's appointment, a point ahead of Wolves and two ahead of Sheffield United; however, the congested nature of the table below fourth is emphasised by the fact that the gap between Chelsea and Spurs (6 points) is the same as the gap between Spurs and 17th-placed Everton. The relegation zone remains unchanged from the end of October. Leeds lead the Championship, though second-placed West Brom have a game in hand. Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Bristol City and Preston make up the play-off zone. Barnsley and Stoke remain in the same places as last month, with Wigan replacing Middlesbrough in 22nd.\n* 31 December 2019: The new decade begins with Liverpool's lead extended to 16 points, Leicester and Manchester City swapping places, and Chelsea remaining fourth. Manchester United, Spurs, and Wolves are hot on the West London side's tails in the race for fourth. Watford have climbed off the bottom of the table at Norwich's expense, but remain in the bottom three, now joined by Aston Villa (18th). In the Championship, Leeds and West Brom hold a comfortable 9-point lead on Fulham, joined in the play-off places by Forest, Brentford, and Sheffield Wednesday. Stoke are now out of the drop zone on goal difference ahead of Barnsley and Luton, and Wigan a point behind.\n* 31 January 2020: Liverpool end January 19 points clear; it is increasingly a question of when, not if, the Merseysiders end their 30-year title drought. Manchester City have moved 3 points ahead of Leicester but the top 7 is otherwise unchanged from the end of December. Norwich and Watford remain 20th and 19th, but the relegation battle is heating up as only 2 goals separate West Ham (18th), Bournemouth and Watford, and Brighton and Villa only 2 points away from relegation. A difficult January has seen Leeds and West Brom's lead on third-placed Forest cut to 4 and 2 points respectively. Fulham are fourth, Brentford stay fifth, and Bristol City have taken sixth place from Sheffield Wednesday. Luton (24th) and Barnsley are 2 points behind 22nd-placed Wigan and 6 points from 21st-placed Charlton.\n* 29 February 2020: February ends with Watford ending Liverpool's unbeaten run; regardless, Liverpool are 22 points clear of Manchester City and need only 4 wins from 10 games to confirm the title. The only change to the top seven is with Sheffield United jumping above Wolves to seventh; however, the race for the Champions League is still far from decided as only 5 points separate Manchester United in fifth with Crystal Palace in 12th. The win over Liverpool has propelled Watford to 17th, above Bournemouth but below West Ham on goal difference. Villa are 2 points behind and Norwich 6 - it is not inconceivable that for only the second time in the Premier League's history, the final day could arrive with no team certain of the drop. With 10 games left in the Championship, West Brom and Leeds remain in the top 2, now 6 and 5 points away from third-placed Fulham. Forest (with a game in hand), Brentford and Preston complete the top 6. A run of 10 points from 6 games has seen Wigan rise to 19th, with Middlesbrough taking their place in the bottom three, although the Teesiders have a game in hand on their nearest rivals, Stoke (21st) and Charlton. Barnsley and Luton remain joint bottom.\n*13 March 2020: League Football is postponed for the foreseeable future due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus Pandemic]], leaving Liverpool just shy of claiming their first top flight title in 29 years. Some National League and lower fixtures go ahead, but many choose not to play for the safety of fans, staff and players. It is unknown how long the league will be out of action or how long until all fixtures get postponed.\n*26 March 2020: The FA rule that every league below National League [[National League North|North]]/[[National League South|South]], from Step 3 to Step 7, have been voided, and results expunged. No promotions or relegations will take place.

The starting point for each programme is something with which children may already be familiar, such as: wood, paper, boots, spiders, buses, soap and lampposts. Sean smith \n\nThe two main characters are Auntie Mabel (played by [[Lynda Baron]]), and her [[dog]] Pippin, who was initially played by a female dog called Pippin, and later by the dog's grandson, Mr. Higgins. A feature of ''Come Outside'' is Auntie Mabel's unusual mode of transport: a small aeroplane (a [[Slingsby T67 Firefly]]) with multi-coloured [[polka dots]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Come Outside episodes}}\n\n===Transmissions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

She lives with her dog, Pippin. In some episodes a close up of Auntie Mabel's hand can be seen, revealing a wedding ring. Auntie Mabel never talks of her husband, but rather about her sister Edie. Played by [[Lynda Baron]].\n*'''Pippin''' \u2013 Auntie Mabel's pet dog and the main animal character of the show. Pippin often has a comedy sub-plot during each episode, where she gets up to mischief without Auntie Mabel knowing. For example, in the episode \"A carton drink\", she eats the sausages from her lunchbox, in the episode \"Soap\", she hides the bar of soap to avoid having a bath, and the episode \"A Woolly Jumper\" ends with Pippin finding a jumper knitted by Auntie Mabel, and then pulling on it and causing it to unravel. Played by Pippin and Mr. Higgins.\n*'''Edie Featherstone''' \u2013 Auntie Mabel's sister, who is often referred to but [[Unseen character|never seen]] on screen. However, her voice was heard in the episode \"A Woolly Jumper\".\n*'''Great Aunt Edna''' \u2013 Auntie Mabel's great aunt, who is also never seen on screen, but is referred to by Auntie Mabel in the episode \"Toothpaste\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVbm2R2eahg&nohtml5=False|title=Come Outside - Toothpaste|first=|last=ComeOutsideTV|date=21 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Animals==\nPippin was a mixed-breed dog, half [[Tibetan Terrier]], half [[Bearded Collie]], roughly third generation descended from the famous American acting dog [[Benji]] and was owned and trained by the award-winning animal trainer Ann Head. Pippin was quite old at the start of the first series in 1993 and so she performed the slower but complex moves while her grandson, Mr. Higgins, performed any physically demanding actions.\n\nPippin retired at the end of Series 1 and Mr. Higgins took over the role of 'Pippin' entirely for Series 2 and 3. Mr. Higgins also starred as the Bakers dog for Bakers Complete pet food commercials and is still pictured on the products. He died in 2008 of old age while his grandmother, the original Pippin, died in the late 1990s. \n\nMany other animals took part in ''Come Outside''. Specially-shot footage included snails from [[London Zoo]], frogs at [[Chester Zoo]], geese at Folly Farm in Gloucestershire, rabbits at [[Tilgate Nature Centre]] in West Sussex, butterflies in the Butterfly Centre, Eastbourne, hedgehogs supplied by [[Tiggywinkles|St. Tiggywinkles Animal Hospita]]l and spiders from a private collection. In addition archive shots were provided by the BBC's Natural History Film Library in Bristol.\n\n==Production details==\nElizabeth Bennett created the format and characters, wrote the scripts, directed many of the programmes and produced all three series.\n\nTwo different production companies were involved. Series 1 was made by ''Spelthorne Productions'', which has since closed. Series 2 and 3 were made by Elizabeth Bennett's production company ''Tricorn Associates''.\n\nAerial views of the various locations visited by Auntie Mabel were shot by Jeremy Braben.\n\n'''Series 1''' was set in a cottage on the corner of [[Denham Aerodrome|Denham Airfield]] in Buckinghamshire, and was used to provide the exterior shots of Auntie Mabel's house. She would come out of the house, walk through the back garden and on to the airfield to climb into her aeroplane (registered G-RAFG). The interiors were shot at Capital Studios in Wandsworth, South West London.\n\n'''Series 2'''  was shot entirely on location, including the interiors of Auntie Mabel's house, with the exception of the bathroom in the Spiders episode which was shot in a studio. The cottage at Denham Airfield was occupied and so a new location had to be found. An empty cottage on some farmland in [[Harefield, Middlesex]] was rented. To allow for the change of location to be incorporated into the show's continuity, a programme about moving house was shot to link the two locations. The plane (now registered G-BOCM) was kept in a field nearby\n\n'''Series 3''' was commissioned two years later and was also shot at the cottage in Harefield, with the plane updated with a new spiraled propeller and registration G-SFTZ\n\nIn every episode Auntie Mabel ventures outside and this involved shooting in many locations in the United Kingdom, such as a pencil factory in Keswick, the manufacture of Wellington boots in Dumfries, a pottery in Stoke, growing bulbs in Spalding, Lincolnshire and making brushes in Portsmouth.\n\nSometimes Auntie Mabel's adventures stayed closer to home. Some of the episodes were filmed in the Middlesex area, for example in the episode \"Buses\" Auntie Mabel boards a bus bound for Uxbridge and is later seen exiting the public library at Ruislip Manor. Scenes were also shot in Woodley, in the precinct and in the veterinary clinic.\n\nIn the episode \"Marmalade\" Auntie Mabel flies to Seville to visit an orange grove. Shooting was restricted to the one day on which the oranges were ready for harvesting. This was only known with very short notice and consequently arrangements to fly out were made at the last minute. It happened well outside the main production period by which time Lynda Baron was committed to other work and was not free to travel to Seville. To make it appear that Auntie Mabel had visited the orange grove, she was recorded in the studio against a Chroma key background while a body double was used for reverse angle shots of her in Spain.\n\nAnimation Sequences for Stories, Songs and Skits was done by Penny Holten, Touch Animation, Really Animated Pictures and Eailing Animation (Occasionally)\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nThe episode entitled ''Bricks'' won the [[Royal Television Society]] Educational Television Award 1997 in the Pre-school and Infants category.<ref name=\"RTS 1997\">{{cite web |url= https://rts.org.uk/award/educational-television-awards-1997|title= Educational Television Awards 1997: Pre School & Infants: Winner|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= rts.org.uk|publisher= [[Royal Television Society]] | accessdate= 12 October 2017 }}</ref>\n\n== Home video ==\nThe BBC issued a collection on VHS tapes in the early 2000s, later released on DVD.

He was the first [[Defence Minister of Armenia]] from 1991 to 1992 and then from 1995 to 1999. He served as Armenia's [[Prime Minister of Armenia|Prime Minister]] from 11 June 1999 until his [[Armenian parliament shooting|assassination]] on 27 October of that year. He rose to prominence during the [[Karabakh movement|mass movement]] for the unification of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|Nagorno-Karabakh]] with Armenia in the late 1980s and led Armenian volunteer groups during the early clashes with Azerbaijani forces. Appointed Defence Minister by President [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] soon after Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union in late 1991, Sargsyan became the most prominent commander of Armenian forces during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=257}} In different positions, he regulated the military operations in the war area until 1994, when a ceasefire was reached ending the war with the ''de facto'' unification of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] with Armenia.\n\nIn the post-war years, Sargsyan tightened his grip on the [[Armed Forces of Armenia|Armed Forces]], establishing himself as a virtual [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Corley |first=Felix |title=Vazgen Sarkissian |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vazgen-sarkissian-740258.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=29 October 1999|accessdate=16 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616041630/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vazgen-sarkissian-740258.html |archivedate=16 June 2014 }}</ref> After strongly supporting Ter-Petrosyan to retain power, he forced the president out of office in 1998 due to his support for concessions in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement negotiations, and helped Prime Minister [[Robert Kocharyan]] to be elected president. With their relations deteriorated, Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group [[Yerkrapah]] into the [[Republican Party of Armenia|Republican Party]] and joined forces with Armenia's ex-communist leader [[Karen Demirchyan]]. In the [[1999 Armenian parliamentary election|May 1999 elections]], their reform-minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the [[National Assembly (Armenia)|National Assembly]]. Sargsyan became prime minister, emerging as the ''de facto'' decision-maker in Armenia with effective control of the military and the legislature.<ref name=\"Horowitz\"/>\n\nSargsyan, along with Demirchyan and several others, was assassinated in the [[Armenian parliament shooting]] of 27 October 1999. The perpetrators were sentenced to life in prison. However, the distrust toward the trial process gave birth to a number of conspiracy theories. Some experts and politicians argue that their assassination was masterminded by Kocharyan and National Security Minister [[Serzh Sargsyan]]. Others have suspected the possible involvement of foreign powers in the shooting.\n\nDespite his mixed legacy, Sargsyan is now widely recognized as a national hero across the political spectrum and by the public. Given the [[honorific]] '''[[Sparapet]]''', he made significant contributions to the establishment of Armenia as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the [[Armenian Army]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Armenian Commander Vazgen Sargsyan would have become 53|url=http://armenpress.am/eng/news/682591/|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=[[Armenpress]]|date=5 March 2012|quote=Vazgen Sargsyan had invaluable contribution to the formation of the Armenian Army and State}}</ref> He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections.

In Armenia, the [[Karabakh movement]] gained widespread public support. Armenians demanded the Soviet authorities unify the mostly Armenian-populated [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of Azerbaijan with Armenia. In February 1988, the NKAO regional legislature requested the transfer of the region from the jurisdiction of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] to [[Armenian SSR]], but it was rejected by the Politburo. Tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis further escalated with the [[Sumgait pogrom|pogrom in Sumgait]].{{sfn|de Waal|2003|pp=10\u201313, 34}} With both groups arming themselves, clashes became frequent, especially in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh and the border areas of the two Soviet republics.

The majority of the COVID-19 cases in January and early February originated from the headquarters of a car parts manufacturer there. Later, new clusters were introduced by travellers from Italy, China and Iran, from where passenger flights were stopped on 18 March. On 25 and 26 February, following the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy|COVID-19 outbreak in Italy]], multiple cases related to the Italian outbreak were detected in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Other cases, which were not related to the Italian clusters, occurred in multiple regions including Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. A specific cluster formed in [[Heinsberg (district)|Heinsberg]] was linked to the [[Carnival]] in [[Gangelt]].<ref name=\":5\" />  The first deaths, an 89-year-old woman in [[Essen]] and a 78-year-old man in [[Heinsberg]], were reported on 9 March 2020.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.abendblatt.de/vermischtes/article228637475/Coronavirus-Corona-News-Live-Ticker-Covid-19-Tote-in-Deutschland-1164-Infektionen.html|title=Coronavirus: Zwei Tote in Deutschland - Italien sperrt das ganze Land|first=Hamburger Abendblatt-|last=Hamburg|date=9 March 2020|website=www.abendblatt.de|accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/coronakrise-kanzlerin-merkel-in-haeuslicher-quarantaene-a-bcde5f71-4c0e-468d-ae28-bce71dc5a9e8|title=Coronakrise: Kanzlerin Merkel in h\u00e4uslicher Quarant\u00e4ne - DER SPIEGEL - Politik|last=SPIEGEL|first=DER|website=www.spiegel.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nGerman disease and epidemic control is advised by the [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) according to a national pandemic plan.

The German government and several health officials stated that the country was well prepared and at first saw no need in taking special measures to stock up or to limit public freedom. Since 13 March, the pandemic has been managed in the protection stage with German states mandating school and kindergarten closures, postponing academic semesters and prohibiting visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly. Two days later, borders to neighbouring countries were closed. On 22 March, the government announced a national curfew, almost identical to those in to Austria and Bavaria, where it had been initially implemented for seven days and three days respectively. Individuals are only allowed to leave their living quarters for certain activities e.g. commuting to work, doing sports or for groceries, and not in groups of more than two people if they do not share the same household.\n\n{{As of|2020|03|30|df=yes|post=,}} 68,179 cases have been reported with 662 deaths and 13,500 recoveries.<ref name=\"counter3\">{{Cite web|url=https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/karte-sars-cov-2-in-deutschland-landkreise/|title=Alle 62.435 best\u00e4tigten Coronavirus-Infektionen nach Landkreisen und Bundesl\u00e4ndern|date=30 March 2020|work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref><ref name=\"counter2\"/> The relatively low death rate in comparison to other European countries, such as Italy or Spain, led to a [[#Data discussion|discussion]] on the numbers of recorded and unrecorded cases, including their age distributions, and international differences in the number of intensive care beds with respiratory support.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{cite web\n   |author=[[Robert Koch-Institut]]\n   |title=Erg\u00e4nzung zum Nationalen Pandemieplan \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 neuartige Coronaviruserkrankung\n   |date=2020-03-04\n   |access-date=2020-03-02\n   |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Ergaenzung_Pandemieplan_Covid.pdf\n   |language=de}}</ref> Four major targets are included in this plan:\n\n* reduce morbidity and mortality\n* ensure treatment of infected persons\n* upkeep of essential public services\n* short and accurate information for decision-makers, media and public\n\nThe plan has three stages which might eventually overlap:\n* containment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)\n* protection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)\n* mitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)\n\nIn the ''containment stage'' health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children (...)have(...)minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\"-all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". It is unclear why the Federal Office for Civil Protection never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |last=Andreas Halbach, Thomas M\u00fcnten, Heiko Rahms  |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge  |date=2020-03-24 |work=ZDF Frontal 21  }}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days.

The majority of the COVID-19 cases in January and early February originated from the headquarters of a car parts manufacturer there. Later, new clusters were introduced by travellers from Italy, China and Iran, from where passenger flights were stopped on 18 March. On 25 and 26 February, following the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy|COVID-19 outbreak in Italy]], multiple cases related to the Italian outbreak were detected in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Other cases, which were not related to the Italian clusters, occurred in multiple regions including Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. A specific cluster formed in [[Heinsberg (district)|Heinsberg]] was linked to the [[Carnival]] in [[Gangelt]].<ref name=\":5\" />  The first deaths, an 89-year-old woman in [[Essen]] and a 78-year-old man in [[Heinsberg]], were reported on 9 March 2020.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.abendblatt.de/vermischtes/article228637475/Coronavirus-Corona-News-Live-Ticker-Covid-19-Tote-in-Deutschland-1164-Infektionen.html|title=Coronavirus: Zwei Tote in Deutschland - Italien sperrt das ganze Land|first=Hamburger Abendblatt-|last=Hamburg|date=9 March 2020|website=www.abendblatt.de|accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/coronakrise-kanzlerin-merkel-in-haeuslicher-quarantaene-a-bcde5f71-4c0e-468d-ae28-bce71dc5a9e8|title=Coronakrise: Kanzlerin Merkel in h\u00e4uslicher Quarant\u00e4ne - DER SPIEGEL - Politik|last=SPIEGEL|first=DER|website=www.spiegel.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nGerman disease and epidemic control is advised by the [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) according to a national pandemic plan.

The German government and several health officials stated that the country was well prepared and at first saw no need in taking special measures to stock up or to limit public freedom. Since 13 March, the pandemic has been managed in the protection stage with German states mandating school and kindergarten closures, postponing academic semesters and prohibiting visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly. Two days later, borders to neighbouring countries were closed. On 22 March, the government announced a national curfew, almost identical to those in to Austria and Bavaria, where it had been initially implemented for seven days and three days respectively. Individuals are only allowed to leave their living quarters for certain activities e.g. commuting to work, doing sports or for groceries, and not in groups of more than two people if they do not share the same household.\n\n{{As of|2020|03|30|df=yes|post=,}} 68,179 cases have been reported with 662 deaths and 13,500 recoveries.<ref name=\"counter3\">{{Cite web|url=https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/karte-sars-cov-2-in-deutschland-landkreise/|title=Alle 62.435 best\u00e4tigten Coronavirus-Infektionen nach Landkreisen und Bundesl\u00e4ndern|date=30 March 2020|work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref><ref name=\"counter2\"/> The relatively low death rate in comparison to other European countries, such as Italy or Spain, led to a [[#Data discussion|discussion]] on the numbers of recorded and unrecorded cases, including their age distributions, and international differences in the number of intensive care beds with respiratory support.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{cite web\n   |author=[[Robert Koch-Institut]]\n   |title=Erg\u00e4nzung zum Nationalen Pandemieplan \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 neuartige Coronaviruserkrankung\n   |date=2020-03-04\n   |access-date=2020-03-02\n   |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Ergaenzung_Pandemieplan_Covid.pdf\n   |language=de}}</ref> Four major targets are included in this plan:\n\n* reduce morbidity and mortality\n* ensure treatment of infected persons\n* upkeep of essential public services\n* short and accurate information for decision-makers, media and public\n\nThe plan has three stages which might eventually overlap:\n* containment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)\n* protection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)\n* mitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)\n\nIn the ''containment stage'' health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children (...)have(...)minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\"-all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". It is unclear why the Federal Office for Civil Protection never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |last=Andreas Halbach, Thomas M\u00fcnten, Heiko Rahms  |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge  |date=2020-03-24 |work=ZDF Frontal 21  }}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Welt |date=25 March 2020 |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.

Or the  process of dividing work into sections and departments.\n\n==History==\nThe [[information organization|organizing of information]] could be seen since humans began to [[write]]. Prior to that, history was passed down only through song and word.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As can be seen with religion, books and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history but also supports the communication of history. organizing involves coordinating and arranging people in order to meet up a set planned objective.\nImplementing the monitoring process correctly, finishing the tasks given, determining the time period of each day in the total time period of one week, if required.\n\nIf you keep a list of all the tasks, the tasks which have been started by the employees, then be sure to thoroughly review the entire list.\nDetermine the criteria to look at different roles, and the difference between these roles is duly detailed.\nMake sure that there is a difference between your competitive organization\u2019s job description and your organization\u2019s job description, whether you have made a list of tasks that are very useful to you but did not include them in your initial analysis.\n\nFor the betterment of your organization, make sure that all the old job descriptions and new job descriptions are changed.\nJob analysis can be extremely important for any one role, which is why many organizations keep the option of putting it on a schedule without wasting much time. They follow the same procedure even if they have to fill the only vacant position. Therefore, you should also keep a clear description of the employees\u2019 job in time for your organization\u2019s job analysis.\n<ref>http://[http://www.bollynewshindi.com/job-analysis-news management]/</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe following are the important characteristics of organization.\n\n*'''Specialization and division of work.''' The entire philosophy of organization is centered on the concepts of specialization and [[division of work]]. The division of work is assigning responsibility for each organizational component to a specific individual or group thereof. It becomes specialization when the responsibility for a specific task lies with a designated expert in that field. The efforts of the operatives are coordinated to allow the process at hand to function correctly. Certain operatives occupy positions of [[management]] at various points in the process to ensure coordination.\n*'''Orientation towards goals.''' Every organization has its own purposes and objectives. Organizing is the function employed to achieve the overall goals of the organization. Organization harmonizes the individual goals of the employees with overall objectives of the firm.\n*'''Composition of individuals and groups.''' Individuals form a group and the groups form an organization. Thus, organization is the composition of individual and groups. Individuals are grouped into departments and their work is coordinated and directed towards organizational goals.\n*'''Continuity.''' An organization is a group of people with a defined relationship in which they work together to achieve the goals of that organization. This relationship does not come to end after completing each task. Organization is a never ending process.\n*'''Flexibility.''' The organizing process should be flexible so that any change can be incorporated easily.  It ensures the ability to adapt and adjust the activities in response to the change taking place in the external environment. The programs, policies and strategies can be changed as and when required if the provision for flexibility is made in the organizing process.\n\n== Objectives ==\n\n*'''Helps to achieve organizational goal.''' Organization is employed to achieve the overall objectives of business firms. Organization focuses attention of individual\u2019s objectives towards overall objectives.\n*'''Optimum use of resources.''' To make optimum use of resources such as men, material, money, machine and method, it is necessary to design an organization properly. Work should be divided and right people should be given right jobs to reduce the wastage of resources in an organization.\n*'''To perform managerial function.''' Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing and Controlling cannot be implemented without proper organization.\n*'''Facilitates growth and diversification.''' A good organization structure is essential for expanding business activity. Organization structure determines the input resources needed for expansion of a business activity similarly organization is essential for product diversification such as establishing a new product line. it also stimulates creativity in managers by organizing.\n*'''Humane treatment of employees.''' Organization has to operate for the betterment of employees and must not encourage monotony of work due to higher degree of specialization. Now, organization has adapted the modern concept of systems approach based on human relations and it discards the traditional productivity and specialization approach.\n\n==Applications==\n'''Organizing''', in [[company|companies]] point of view, is the management function that usually follows after planning. And it involves the assignment of tasks, the grouping of tasks into departments and the assignment of authority with adequate responsibility and allocation of resources across the organization to achieve common goals. Organizing involves the establishment of an intentional structures of roles through determination and enumeration of the activities required to achieve the goals of an enterprise and each part of it,the grouping of these activities, the assignments of such groups of activities to managers,the delegation of authority to carry them out,and provision for coordination of authority and informal relationships,horizontally and vertically,in the organisation .\n\n===Structure===\n\nThe framework in which the organization defines how tasks are divided, resources are deployed, and departments are coordinated.\n\n#A set of formal tasks assigned to individuals and departments.\n#Formal reporting relationships, including lines of authority, decision responsibility, number of hierarchical levels and span of managers control.\n#The design of systems to ensure effective coordination of employees across departments.\n\n=== Work specialization===\n\nWork specialization (also called [[division of labor]] or job specialization) is the degree to which organizational tasks are sub-divided into individual jobs. It may increase the efficiency of workers, but with too much specialization, employees may feel isolated and bored. Many organizations enlarge jobs or rotate assigned tasks to provide greater challenges.\n\n===Chain of command===\n[[Command hierarchy|Chain of command]] is the vertical lines of a command structure that is used for the purposes of overall responsibility and accountability in the achieving of stated goals and objectives through the use of orders one direction and reports of compliance in the other direction.  Chain of command differs from horizontal lines in an organization which are basically the communication and coordinating lines of the organization.\nChain of command (also referred to as 'scalar principle') states that a clear , unbroken chain of command should link every employee with someone at a higher level, all the way to the top of the organisation.\n\n===Authority, responsibility, and accountability===\n\n*'''Authority''' is a manager's formal and legitimate right to make decisions, issue orders, and allocate resources to achieve organizationally desired outcomes.\n*'''Responsibility''' means an employee's duty to perform assigned task or activities.\n*'''Accountability''' means that those with authority and responsibility must report and justify task outcomes to those above them in the chain of command.\n\n===Delegation===\n\nDelegation is the transfer of authority and/or responsibility to others, often lower in position. Delegation can improve flexibility to meet customers\u2019 needs and adapt to competitive environments.\nPossible reasons for delegation:\n1. Efficiency - many people can complete a task faster than one/few\n2. Specialization - delegating simple tasks allows more important/complex tasks to be completed by the most qualified\n3. Training - delegating a task to a trainee so that they may learn from experience\n\n===Types of authority (and responsibility)===\n\n'''Line authority''' managers have the formal power to direct and control immediate subordinates. The superior issues orders and is responsible for the result and the subordinate obeys and is responsible only for executing the order according to instructions.\n\n'''Functional authority''' is where managers have formal power over a specific subset of activities. For instance, the Production Manager may have the line authority to decide whether and when a new machine is needed but the Controller demands that a Capital Expenditure Proposal is submitted first, showing that the investment will have a yield of at least x%; or, a legal department may have functional authority to interfere in any activity that could have legal consequences. This authority would not be functional but it would rather be staff authority if such interference is \"advice\" rather than \"order\".\n\n'''Staff authority''' is granted to staff specialists in their areas of expertise. It is not a real authority in the sense that a staff manager does not order or instruct but simply advises,  recommends, and counsels in the staff specialists' area of expertise and is responsible only for the quality of the advice (to be in line with the respective professional standards etc.) It is a communication relationship with [[management]].  It has an influence that derives indirectly from line authority at a higher level.\n\n''' Line and Staff Authority''' is the combination of Line organization and Staff organization.  Such organization follows both the principles of scalar chain of command and there is a provision for specialized activities  to be performed by staff officers who act in an advisory capacity\n\n===Span of management===\nCategories:\n*Direct single relationship.\n*Direct group relationships.\n*Cross relationship.\nFactors influencing larger span of management.\n#Work performed by subordinates is stable and routine.\n#Subordinates perform similar work tasks.\n#Subordinates are concentrated in a single location.\n#Subordinates are highly trained and need little direction in performing tasks.\n#Rules and procedures defining task activities are available.\n#Support systems and personnel are available for the managers.\n#Little time is required in non-supervisory activities such as coordination with other departments or planning.\n#Managers' personal preferences and styles favor a large span.\n\n===Tall versus flat structure===\n\n*'''Tall''' - A management structure characterized by an overall narrow span of management and a relatively large number of hierarchical levels. Tight control. [[Hierarchical organization|Reduced communication overhead]].\n*'''Flat''' - A management structure characterized by a wide span of control and relatively few hierarchical levels. Loose control. Facilitates delegation.\n\n===Centralization, decentralization, and formalization===\n\n*'''Centralization''' - The location of decision-making authority near top organizational levels.\n*'''Decentralization''' - The location of decision-making authority near lower organizational levels.\n*'''Formalization''' - The written documentation used to direct and control employees.\n\n===Departmentalization===\n\n[[Departmentalization]] is the basis on which individuals are grouped into departments and departments into total organizations. Approach options include:\n#'''Functional''' - by common skills and work task\n#'''Divisional''' - common product, program or geographical location\n#'''Matrix'''     - combination of Functional and Divisional\n#'''Team'''       - to accomplish specific tasks\n#'''Network'''    - departments are independent providing functions for a central core breaker\n\n===Importance of organizing===\n\n*Organizations are often troubled by how to organize, particularly when a new strategy is developed\n*Changing market conditions or new technology requires a change\n*Organizations seek efficiencies through improvements in organizing\n*it ensures that objectives are accomplished.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Order theory]]\n* [[Sorting]]\n* [[Community organizing]]\n* [[Union organizer]]\n* [[Professional organizer]]\n* [[The organization of the artist]]\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|organize}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Ordering]]\n[[Category:Management]]\nCoase, Ronald (1937). \"The Nature of the Firm\" Economica, 4(16), pp. 386\u2013405.\nHandy, Charles (1990).
