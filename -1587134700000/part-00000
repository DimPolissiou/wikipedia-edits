In July 1942, having just completed the first two of the series, N\u00e9mirovsky was arrested as a Jew and detained at [[Pithiviers]] and then [[Auschwitz]], where she was murdered, a victim of the [[Holocaust]]. The notebook containing the two novels was preserved by her daughters but not examined until 1998. They were published in a single volume entitled ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' in 2004.\n\n==Background==\nThe sequence was to portray life in France in the period following June 1940, the month in which the German army rapidly defeated the French and fought the British; Paris and northern France came under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]] on 14 June. The first novel, ''Temp\u00eate en juin'' (''Storm in June'') depicts the flight of citizens from Paris in the hours preceding the German advance and in the days following it. The second, ''Dolce'' (''Sweet''), shows life in a small French country town, Bussy (in the suburbs just east of Paris), in the first, strangely peaceful, months of the German occupation. These first two novels seem able to exist independently from each other{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} on first reading. The links between them are rather tenuous; as N\u00e9mirovsky observes in her notebook, it is the history and not the characters, that unite them.\n\nThe third novel, ''Captivit\u00e9'' (''Captivity''), for which N\u00e9mirovsky left a plot outline, would have shown the coalescing of a resistance, with some characters introduced in ''Temp\u00eate en juin'' and ''Dolce'' having been arrested and put under threat of death, in Paris. The fourth and fifth novels would perhaps have been called ''Batailles'' (''Battles'') and ''La Paix'' (''Peace'') but these exist only as titles in N\u00e9mirovsky's notebook, against which she had placed question marks. Nothing can be said about the plots of ''Batailles'' and ''La Paix''. To quote N\u00e9mirovsky's notes, they are \"in limbo, and what limbo! It's really in the lap of the gods since it depends on what happens\".\n\n==Books==\n\n===''Temp\u00eate en juin''===\n\nThe narrative follows several groups of characters who encounter one another rarely if at all. All are impelled to flee from Paris in advance of the German entry into the city. As transport and distribution collapse under German bombardment, all have to change their plans and nearly all lose the veneer of civilization.\n\nThe P\u00e9ricands are making for [[N\u00eemes]], where they have property. They reach the city but in the course of the journey, Charlotte P\u00e9ricand's senile father-in-law is left behind (forgotten) while her second son, Hubert, runs away to join the army and shares in its collapse. Her elder son, Philippe, is a priest and is shepherding a party of orphans, who eventually kill him (in a death scene perhaps in need of revision, N\u00e9mirovsky comments in her notebook, because it is ''melo'' [melodramatic]). Gabriel Corte, a well-known writer, flees with his mistress and makes for [[Vichy]], where he may or may not find refuge and employment. Charles Langelet, an aesthete, flees alone in his car, filching petrol from trusting acquaintances in order to get as far as the [[Loire]]; he returns to Paris and is killed, accidentally and memorably.\n\nMaurice and Jeanne Michaud, minor employees at a bank, are instructed to go to [[Tours]] though deprived at the last minute of the transport promised by their employer. Their son, Jean-Marie is with the army and they have no word of his fate. They cannot get to Tours and eventually return to Paris, unemployed and almost destitute but destined to survive. Jean-Marie is in fact wounded; he is being tended by the Sabarie family at their small farm near Bussy, where he is nursed back to health by Madeleine, the Sabaries' foster daughter. At the end of the novel as postal services are restored, Jean-Marie is able to contact his family and return to Paris. The Michauds, alone among major characters, grow in moral stature as chaos spreads.\n\n===''Dolce''===\nThe small town of Bussy and its neighbouring farms are the scene throughout. The German occupation seems sweetly peaceful but there is no doubt over the balance of power. The Germans get whatever they ask for; official notices promise the death penalty for those who disobey their regulations, and French collaborators, including the P\u00e9ricands, make their own settlement with their German overlords.\n\nThe main plot concerns Lucile Angellier, whose unfaithful husband is a prisoner of war. She lives uneasily, with her mother-in-law. Theirs being the best house in the village, it is where the German commander, Bruno von Falk, an accomplished musician, is billeted. Unwillingly Lucile finds herself falling in love with him. In this and several parallel strands, the novel explores the deep, perhaps unbridgeable, differences and the perhaps superficial sympathies, between military Germans and rural French.\n\nThe minor plot concerns the family of Beno\u00eet Sabarie, a prisoner of war who escapes from German captivity, returns home to the family farm near Bussy, marries his fianc\u00e9e Madeleine and believes (with some justification) that she still pines for Jean-Marie Michaud, whom she nursed during his recovery. Jealous by nature, Beno\u00eet also believes that Madeleine risks being seduced by the German interpreter, Bonnet, who is billeted in their house. Caught poaching, arrested for possessing a gun, Beno\u00eet struggles free and shoots Bonnet dead. (In her notebook, N\u00e9mirovsky mentions a possible revision where Bonnet is wounded, not killed.)\n\nThe stories come together when, at Madeleine's request, Lucile conceals Beno\u00eet in her house. It is widely assumed that Bruno's presence in the house and his liking for Lucile, will protect her against searches. The need to conceal Beno\u00eet brings Lucile and her mother-in-law closer; it drives her apart from Bruno, though he never knows why.\n\nAfter an astonishing and powerful scene in which German troops celebrate the first anniversary of their entry into Paris, ''Dolce'' ends in July 1941, when Germany begins its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The troops occupying Bussy are posted to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Lucile and Bruno fear that he will not survive and she has no difficulty in persuading him to give her a travel document and petrol coupon, which (unknown to him) will enable her to drive Beno\u00eet to a new refuge. The title of ''Dolce'', like that of the whole sequence, intentionally recalls musical terminology, ''dolce'' means \"sweet\" or \"soft\" in musicians' Italian. This title is truthful but also ironic, since bitterness exists under the surface, and a far less peaceful sequel was to follow.\n\n===''Captivit\u00e9''===\n\nThe plot of N\u00e9mirovsky's third novel exists as a plot outline, with some contradictions, in her notebook. Beno\u00eet has \"friends\" (the nascent Communist resistance) in Paris. Lucile drives him to the city, where he is concealed by the Michauds, whom the Angelliers met briefly in ''Temp\u00eate en juin''. In Paris, Beno\u00eet and Jean-Marie Michaud are denounced and arrested, and in prison, they meet Hubert. Jean-Marie is pardoned by the Germans, when Lucile contacts Bruno von Falk on his behalf. Beno\u00eet and his friends organize an escape and release Jean-Marie and Hubert. Jean-Marie and Lucile meet and fall in love but after learning that she is still in love with Bruno, he leaves to fight against the Germans and dies heroically. On the Eastern Front, Bruno is also killed, Lucile losing her French and German beloveds. In a sub-plot, the writer Gabriel Corte, a relatively minor and unsympathetic character in ''Temp\u00eate en juin'', emerges as a propagandist and politician, initially collaborating with the Germans, later perhaps disaffected; Beno\u00eet dies brutally and full of hope.\n\n==The manuscript and its rediscovery==\n\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'', so far as it was completed, was written in microscopic handwriting in a single notebook; ''Temp\u00eate'' and ''Dolce'' together filled 140 pages, corresponding to 516 published pages. It would possibly be the earliest work of literary fiction about [[the Second World War]], and is remarkable as a historical [[novel sequence]] written during the period that it depicts, transformed far beyond the level of a journal of events such as might be expected to emerge from the turmoil and tragedy N\u00e9mirovsky experienced.\n\nIt is extraordinary that the manuscript should have survived in such extreme circumstances, having been taken by Irene N\u00e9mirovsky's daughter Denise as she was being helped to flee from hiding place to hiding place during wartime.\n\nDenise, however, kept the notebooks containing the nearly indecipherable manuscript of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' unread in an old suitcase for more than sixty years, convinced that it would indeed be a painful diary reminding her of the war that would not be beneficial to read. In the late 1990s, having made arrangements to contribute these manuscripts to a French archive, Denise decided to decipher the notebooks first, which resulted in the rediscovery of the original manuscripts of the fictional work ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' which she had published in association with publisher Olivier Rubinstein in France in 2004.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===French publication===\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' was published by Deno\u00ebl, Paris, in 2004. {{ISBN|2-207-25645-6}}; pocket edition (Folio) {{ISBN|2-07-033676-X}}. The edition includes a preface by {{ill|Myriam Anissimov|fr}}, notes by N\u00e9mirovsky about the revision and planned continuation of the sequence, and correspondence between N\u00e9mirovsky herself, her husband Michel Epstein, her publisher [[Albin Michel]] and others in the period before and after her deportation.\n\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' won the [[Prix Renaudot]] for 2004. This is the first time that the prize has been awarded posthumously.\n\n===Translations===\nAn English translation by Sandra Smith was published by Chatto & Windus, London, 2004, and by Knopf, New York, in 2006. {{ISBN|1-4000-4473-1}}.

Both works have protagonists who work in finance, Marshall's [[protagonist]] is an accountant while N\u00e9mirovsky's work has several characters who work for a bank.  Both books were written during and/or immediately after the event but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works but fiction featuring invented characters.  The stories cover the prelude of the [[Battle of France|Nazi invasion]] and its aftermath but the events in the stories are much different.  Marshall's ends before the [[Military occupation|occupation]], while N\u00e9mirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it. \"Dolce,\" the second part of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise,'' is similar to ''[[Le Silence de la mer]]'', a novella by the French author ''Vercors'' (pseudonym of [[Jean Bruller]]). Both stories deal with a German officer, who in civilian life was a composer, who is quartered in the house of a young French woman. ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' and ''Le Silence de la Mer'' were finished in early 1942.\n\n===Controversy===\nSeveral reviewers and commentators<ref name=\"Nextbook: Behind the Legend\">[http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 Nextbook: Behind the Legend<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713004528/http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 |date=13 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2018357,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Truth, lies and anti-semitism | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | date=22 February 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> have raised questions regarding N\u00e9mirovsky's attitude toward Jews, her generally negative depiction of Jews in her writing and her use of anti-semitic publications in advancing her career.  A review of her work published in ''The New Republic'' states:<blockquote>\nN\u00e9mirovsky was the very definition of a [[self-hating Jew]]. Does that sound too strong? Well, here is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France ''entre deux guerres'' in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right. N\u00e9mirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews\u2014some of them even have hooked noses, no less!\u2014appeared in right-wing periodicals and won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power in extreme-right political circles. When the racial laws in 1940 and 1941 cut off her ability to publish, she turned to those connections to seek special favors for herself, and even went so far as to write a personal plea to Marshal P\u00e9tain.<ref>[http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=1ed87cd1-0944-455f-9219-1fb5d1ff77be Scandale Fran\u00e7aise<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Film adaptation==\n{{Main|Suite Fran\u00e7aise (film)}}\nThe film rights to ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' were purchased by [[NBC Universal|Universal]] in 2006.<ref name=\"Fleming\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/news/checking-into-suite-2-1117953690/|title=Checking into 'Suite'|last=Fleming|first=Michael|date=9 November 2006|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref> [[Ronald Harwood]], who wrote the script for ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'', was set to write the screenplay, with [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] producing the film.<ref name=\"Fleming\"/> In 2007, [[TF1 Group|TF1 Droits Audiovisuels]] acquired the rights to the novel from publisher [[\u00c9ditions Deno\u00ebl]].<ref name=\"Rosser\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/suite-francaise-shoot-begins/5057839.article|title=Suite Francaise shoot begins|last=Rosser|first=Michael|date=27 June 2013|publisher=[[Screendaily]]|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref> The novel was then adapted for the screen by [[Saul Dibb]] and [[Matt Charman]], with Dibb directing.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> Production began to move forward in 2012, with [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] starring as Lucille Angellier alongside [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as her mother-in-law, and [[Matthias Schoenaerts]] as Bruno von Falk.

Caught poaching, arrested for possessing a gun, Beno\u00eet struggles free and shoots Bonnet dead. (In her notebook, N\u00e9mirovsky mentions a possible revision where Bonnet is wounded, not killed.)\n\nThe stories come together when, at Madeleine's request, Lucile conceals Beno\u00eet in her house. It is widely assumed that Bruno's presence in the house and his liking for Lucile, will protect her against searches. The need to conceal Beno\u00eet brings Lucile and her mother-in-law closer; it drives her apart from Bruno, though he never knows why.\n\nAfter an astonishing and powerful scene in which German troops celebrate the first anniversary of their entry into Paris, ''Dolce'' ends in July 1941, when Germany begins its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The troops occupying Bussy are posted to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Lucile and Bruno fear that he will not survive and she has no difficulty in persuading him to give her a travel document and petrol coupon, which (unknown to him) will enable her to drive Beno\u00eet to a new refuge. The title of ''Dolce'', like that of the whole sequence, intentionally recalls musical terminology, ''dolce'' means \"sweet\" or \"soft\" in musicians' Italian. This title is truthful but also ironic, since bitterness exists under the surface, and a far less peaceful sequel was to follow.\n\n===''Captivit\u00e9''===\n\nThe plot of N\u00e9mirovsky's third novel exists as a plot outline, with some contradictions, in her notebook. Beno\u00eet has \"friends\" (the nascent Communist resistance) in Paris. Lucile drives him to the city, where he is concealed by the Michauds, whom the Angelliers met briefly in ''Temp\u00eate en juin''. In Paris, Beno\u00eet and Jean-Marie Michaud are denounced and arrested, and in prison, they meet Hubert. Jean-Marie is pardoned by the Germans, when Lucile contacts Bruno von Falk on his behalf. Beno\u00eet and his friends organize an escape and release Jean-Marie and Hubert. Jean-Marie and Lucile meet and fall in love but after learning that she is still in love with Bruno, he leaves to fight against the Germans and dies heroically. On the Eastern Front, Bruno is also killed, Lucile losing her French and German beloveds. In a sub-plot, the writer Gabriel Corte, a relatively minor and unsympathetic character in ''Temp\u00eate en juin'', emerges as a propagandist and politician, initially collaborating with the Germans, later perhaps disaffected; Beno\u00eet dies brutally and full of hope.\n\n==The manuscript and its rediscovery==\n\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'', so far as it was completed, was written in microscopic handwriting in a single notebook; ''Temp\u00eate'' and ''Dolce'' together filled 140 pages, corresponding to 516 published pages. It would possibly be the earliest work of literary fiction about [[the Second World War]], and is remarkable as a historical [[novel sequence]] written during the period that it depicts, transformed far beyond the level of a journal of events such as might be expected to emerge from the turmoil and tragedy N\u00e9mirovsky experienced.\n\nIt is extraordinary that the manuscript should have survived in such extreme circumstances, having been taken by Irene N\u00e9mirovsky's daughter Denise as she was being helped to flee from hiding place to hiding place during wartime.\n\nDenise, however, kept the notebooks containing the nearly indecipherable manuscript of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' unread in an old suitcase for more than sixty years, convinced that it would indeed be a painful diary reminding her of the war that would not be beneficial to read. In the late 1990s, having made arrangements to contribute these manuscripts to a French archive, Denise decided to decipher the notebooks first, which resulted in the rediscovery of the original manuscripts of the fictional work ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' which she had published in association with publisher Olivier Rubinstein in France in 2004.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===French publication===\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' was published by Deno\u00ebl, Paris, in 2004. {{ISBN|2-207-25645-6}}; pocket edition (Folio) {{ISBN|2-07-033676-X}}. The edition includes a preface by {{ill|Myriam Anissimov|fr}}, notes by N\u00e9mirovsky about the revision and planned continuation of the sequence, and correspondence between N\u00e9mirovsky herself, her husband Michel Epstein, her publisher [[Albin Michel]] and others in the period before and after her deportation.\n\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' won the [[Prix Renaudot]] for 2004. This is the first time that the prize has been awarded posthumously.\n\n===Translations===\nAn English translation by Sandra Smith was published by Chatto & Windus, London, 2004, and by Knopf, New York, in 2006. {{ISBN|1-4000-4473-1}}.

Both works have protagonists who work in finance, Marshall's [[protagonist]] is an accountant while N\u00e9mirovsky's work has several characters who work for a bank.  Both books were written during and/or immediately after the event but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works but fiction featuring invented characters.  The stories cover the prelude of the [[Battle of France|Nazi invasion]] and its aftermath but the events in the stories are much different.  Marshall's ends before the [[Military occupation|occupation]], while N\u00e9mirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it. \"Dolce,\" the second part of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise,'' is similar to ''[[Le Silence de la mer]]'', a novella by the French author ''Vercors'' (pseudonym of [[Jean Bruller]]). Both stories deal with a German officer, who in civilian life was a composer, who is quartered in the house of a young French woman. ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' and ''Le Silence de la Mer'' were finished in early 1942.\n\n===Controversy===\nSeveral reviewers and commentators<ref name=\"Nextbook: Behind the Legend\">[http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 Nextbook: Behind the Legend<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713004528/http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 |date=13 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2018357,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Truth, lies and anti-semitism | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | date=22 February 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> have raised questions regarding N\u00e9mirovsky's attitude toward Jews, her generally negative depiction of Jews in her writing and her use of anti-semitic publications in advancing her career.  A review of her work published in ''The New Republic'' states:<blockquote>\nN\u00e9mirovsky was the very definition of a [[self-hating Jew]]. Does that sound too strong? Well, here is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France ''entre deux guerres'' in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right. N\u00e9mirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews\u2014some of them even have hooked noses, no less!\u2014appeared in right-wing periodicals and won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power in extreme-right political circles.

Nilakanta Sastri|1976|p=424}} The legend is considered as an expression of the historical consciousness (signifying the loss of Jain political influence in the Tamil coutry).{{sfn|Paul Dundas|2002|p=127}}\n\nAccording to this legend, Kun Pandya had married the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] princess [[Mangayarkkarasiyar|Mangayarkkarasi]].{{sfn|K.

The subsequent political turmoil of late 2013 and early 2014 caused even more delay. Thereafter, the coup of May 2014 resulted in a new military administration and the tender being deferred for 2014. The MRTA tender was subsequently not released until mid-2016. In early December 2016, BSR Joint Venture (comprising [[BTS Group Holdings]] which owns 75%, Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction - STEC, and Ratchaburi Electricity Generation Holding - RATCH), won the bid for the line. The BSR also won the bid for the Pink Line.\n<ref>{{cite news |title=BSR Joint venture wins rights for Bangkok\u2019s Yellow, Pink line MRTA construction|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/joint-venture-wins-rights-for-yellow-pink-line-construction/1153213 |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=7 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn June 16 2017, a contract was signed for the line with the [[Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand]] and a consortium including [[BTS Group Holdings]], Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction, and Ratchaburi Electricity Generation Holding.

The subsequent political turmoil of late 2013 and early 2014 caused even more delay. Thereafter, the coup of May 2014 resulted in a new military administration and the tender being deferred for 2014. The MRTA tender was subsequently not released until mid-2016. In early December 2016, BSR Joint Venture (comprising [[BTS Group Holdings]] which owns 75%, Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction - STEC, and Ratchaburi Electricity Generation Holding - RATCH), won the bid for the line. The BSR also won the bid for the Pink Line.\n<ref>{{cite news |title=BSR Joint venture wins rights for Bangkok\u2019s Yellow, Pink line MRTA construction|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/joint-venture-wins-rights-for-yellow-pink-line-construction/1153213 |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=7 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn June 16 2017, a contract was signed for the line with the [[Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand]] and a consortium including [[BTS Group Holdings]], Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction, and Ratchaburi Electricity Generation Holding. BSR has also established Eastern Bangkok Monorail Company Limited to operate the monorail. A proposed 2 station extension of the route north from the current Ratchada terminus to link to [[Sukhumvit Line]] Extension at Ratchayothin station is awaiting approval from the government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/business/EconomyAndTourism/30318283|title=Junta to call bids for most infra projects  - The Nation|work=The Nation|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Construction Progress==\nConstruction of the MRT Yellow Line began in March 2018 with the BSR consortium establishing a number of preparation work sites along the Lat Phrao rd with the closure of lanes along this traffic dense east-west corridor.

It is defined as [[neoplasia]] of [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissue that has [[gland]]ular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of [[carcinoma]]s, but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word, where these exist. Thus [[invasive ductal carcinoma]], the most common form of [[breast cancer]], is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its name\u2014however, esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of [[esophageal cancer]], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas, and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects, so that few useful generalizations can be made about them.\n\nIn the most specific [[usage]] (narrowest [[word sense|sense]]), the glandular origin or traits are [[exocrine gland|exocrine]]; [[endocrine system|endocrine gland]] tumors, such as a [[VIPoma]], an [[insulinoma]], or a [[pheochromocytoma]], are typically not referred to as adenocarcinomas but rather are often called [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s. Epithelial tissue sometimes includes, but is not limited to, the surface layer of skin, glands, and a variety of other tissue that lines the cavities and organs of the body. Epithelial tissue can be derived embryologically from any of the [[germ layer]]s ([[ectoderm]], [[endoderm]], or [[mesoderm]]). To be classified as adenocarcinoma, the cells do not necessarily need to be part of a [[gland]], as long as they have secretory properties. Adenocarcinoma is the [[malignancy|malignant]] counterpart to [[adenoma]], which is the [[benignity|benign]] form of such [[neoplasm|tumors]]. Sometimes adenomas [[malignant transformation|transform]] into adenocarcinomas, but most do not.\n\nWell [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] adenocarcinomas tend to resemble the glandular tissue that they are derived from, while poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas may not. By [[staining]] the cells from a [[biopsy]], a [[pathologist]] can determine whether the tumor is an adenocarcinoma or some other type of cancer. Adenocarcinomas can arise in many tissues of the body owing to the ubiquitous nature of glands within the body, and, more fundamentally, to the [[cell potency|potency]] of epithelial cells. While each gland may not be secreting the same substance, as long as there is an exocrine function to the cell, it is considered glandular and its malignant form is therefore named adenocarcinoma.\n\n==Histopathology==\n[[File:Seborrheic keratosis on human back.jpg|thumb|upright|Many [[seborrheic keratoses]] on back of person with [[Leser\u2013Tr\u00e9lat sign]] due to [[colon cancer]].]]\n\nExamples of cancers where adenocarcinomas are a common form:\n\n* [[esophageal cancer]]; most cases in the [[developed world]] are adenocarcinomas.<ref name=WCR2014>{{cite book|title=World Cancer Report 2014.|date=2014|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-832-0429-9|pages=Chapter 5.3}}</ref>\n* [[pancreas]]; over 80% of [[pancreatic cancer]]s are ductal adenocarcinomas.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bond-Smith|first1=G|last2=Banga|first2=N|last3=Hammond|first3=TM|last4=Imber|first4=CJ|title=Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.|journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)|date=May 16, 2012|volume=344|pages=e2476|pmid=22592847|doi=10.1136/bmj.e2476}}</ref>\n* [[prostate cancer]] is nearly always adenocarcinoma\n* [[cervical cancer]]: most is [[squamous cell cancer]], but 10\u201315% of cervical cancers are adenocarcinomas<ref>{{cite book|title=World Cancer Report 2014.|date=2014|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-832-0429-9|pages=473\u2013474}}</ref>\n* [[stomach cancer]]: is almost always an adenocarcinoma but in rare cases are [[Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma#extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma|extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas]] (also termed MALT lymphomas).<ref name=\"pmid28151409\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Burkitt MD, Duckworth CA, Williams JM, Pritchard DM | title = Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric pathology: insights from in vivo and ex vivo models | journal = Disease Models & Mechanisms | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 89\u2013104 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28151409 | pmc = 5312008 | doi = 10.1242/dmm.027649 | url = }}</ref>\n\n===Breast===\nMost [[breast cancer]]s start in the ducts or [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobules]], and are adenocarcinomas.

It is defined as  [[neoplasia]] of [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissue that has [[gland]]ular origin, glandular characteristics, or both.  Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of [[carcinoma]]s, but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word, where these exist. Thus [[invasive ductal carcinoma]], the most common form of [[breast cancer]], is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its name\u2014however, esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of [[esophageal cancer]], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas, and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects, so that few useful generalizations can be made about them.\n\nIn the most specific [[usage]] (narrowest [[word sense|sense]]), the glandular origin or traits are [[exocrine gland|exocrine]]; [[endocrine system|endocrine gland]] tumors, such as a [[VIPoma]], an [[insulinoma]], or a [[pheochromocytoma]], are typically not referred to as adenocarcinomas but rather are often called [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s. Epithelial tissue sometimes includes, but is not limited to, the surface layer of skin, glands, and a variety of other tissue that lines the cavities and organs of the body. Epithelial tissue can be derived embryologically from any of the [[germ layer]]s ([[ectoderm]], [[endoderm]], or [[mesoderm]]). To be classified as adenocarcinoma, the cells do not necessarily need to be part of a [[gland]], as long as they have secretory properties. Adenocarcinoma is the [[malignancy|malignant]] counterpart to [[adenoma]], which is the [[benignity|benign]] form of such [[neoplasm|tumors]]. Sometimes adenomas [[malignant transformation|transform]] into adenocarcinomas, but most do not.\n\nWell [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] adenocarcinomas tend to resemble the glandular tissue that they are derived from, while poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas may not.  By [[staining]] the cells from a [[biopsy]], a [[pathologist]] can determine whether the tumor is an adenocarcinoma or some other type of cancer.  Adenocarcinomas can arise in many tissues of the body owing to the ubiquitous nature of glands within the body, and, more fundamentally, to the [[cell potency|potency]] of epithelial cells.
