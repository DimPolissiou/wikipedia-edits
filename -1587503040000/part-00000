His scientific career, however, was interrupted in 1957 when he was labelled a \"rightist\" during the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]].

According to his method, the demarcation line between [[Holarctic]] and [[Indomalayan realm]]s in China, as far as freshwater fishes are concerned, lies largely along the [[Himalayas]] and [[Nanling Mountains]] ranges.

[[ichthyologist]] with the Institute of Zoology ({{lang|zh|\u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u52a8\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u6240}}) at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].

He translated and helped publication of the Chinese editions of ''[[Fishes of the World]]'' (2nd edition, by [[Joseph S.

Li was the major author of two published volumes in the [[:zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u52a8\u7269\u5fd7|Fauna Sinica]] monograph series, systematically reviewing and describing [[order (biology)|orders]] of [[bony fishes]] that include [[flat fish]], [[cod]], [[Atheriniformes|silverside]], [[pearlfish]], [[killifish]], [[flying fish]], etc. in or near China.<ref>Li, S.Z., Wang, H.M.: ''Fauna Sinica, Osteichthyes: '''Pleuronectiformes''''', Science Press, Beijing, 1995</ref><ref name=\"FaunaSinica2011\">Li, S.Z., Zhang, C.G.: ''Fauna Sinica, Osteichthyes: '''Atheriniformes, Cyprinodontiformes, Beloniformes, Ophidiiformes, Gadiformes''''', Science Press, Beijing, 2011. {{ISBN|9787030200952}}</ref> He had written over 40 [[popular science]] articles about [[fish]] on Chinese newspapers and magazines, and been responsible for compiling and editing fish-related entries in several standard reference books (including [[Encyclopedia of China]]).\n\nStarting from the early 1950s, Li helped to initiate and participated in China's systematic surveys of [[marine fish]]es in [[Bohai Sea]], [[Yellow Sea]] and [[South China Sea]], along China's coast. His scientific career, however, was interrupted in 1957 when he was labelled a \"rightist\" during the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]]. From then until the mid-1970s, while his research and publication capacity had been severely impacted by whims of political campaigns and turmoils, he managed to conduct surveys of [[freshwater fish]]es in the [[Yellow River]],<ref name=\"Fishes_YR2015\"/><ref name=\"Fishes_YR2017\"/><ref name=xie2018>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ece3.3890 |pmid=29721289|title=Fish assemblage changes over half a century in the Yellow River, China|journal=Ecology and Evolution |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=4173\u20134182 |year=2018 |last1=Xie |first1=Jia Yan |last2=Tang |first2=Wen Jia |last3=Yang |first3=Yu Hui|pmc=5916296 }}</ref> [[Ou River (Zhejiang)|Ou River]] and [[Jiao River (Zhejiang)|Ling River]], as well as in interior regions such as [[Xinjiang]]<ref>{{Citation\n |publisher = Xinjiang People's Press\n |location = Urumchi, China\n |title = Fishes of Xinjiang\n |author = \u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u52a8\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u6240,\u65b0\u7586\u751f\u7269\u571f\u58e4\u6c99\u6f20\u7814\u7a76\u6240,\u65b0\u7586\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u6c34\u4ea7\u5c40\n |editor = Li, Sizhong\n |date = 1979\n |oclc = 20265480\n |ol = 25882356M\n }}</ref> \nand [[Gansu]] provinces.  Only until after the [[Cultural Revolution]], he was able to resume normal research activities.\n\nIn his book ''Studies on zoogeographical divisions for fresh water fishes of China''<ref name=\"Li1981\"/>, Li divided the fauna of freshwater fishes in China into five major regions based on characteristics of fish species distributions, geographic environments and geological histories of these regions. According to his method, the demarcation line between [[Holarctic]] and [[Indomalayan realm]]s in China, as far as freshwater fishes are concerned, lies largely along the [[Himalayas]] and [[Nanling Mountains]] ranges. This contrasts with the prevalent view of demarcation line between Holarctic and Indomalaya regions along the [[Qinling Mountains]], even though the latter does not extend into Eastern part of

She went to Hollywood in 1930 and became a popular film actress. Two of her best-known performances are in the films ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' and ''[[Destry Rides Again]]''. She won a [[Tony Award]] in 1956 and was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1961.\n\n==Life and career==\nMerkel was born in [[Covington, Kentucky]], to Bessie (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Phares) and Arno Merkel, <ref>Kentucky. Birth Records, 1847-1911</ref>but in her early childhood, she lived in many of the [[Southern United States]] due to her father's job as a traveling salesman. At the age of 15, she and her parents moved to [[Philadelphia]]. They stayed there a year or so before settling in [[New York City]], where she began attending the Alviene School of Dramatic Art.\n\nBecause of her strong resemblance to actress [[Lillian Gish]], Merkel was offered a part as Gish's youngest sister in a silent film called ''World Shadows''. Unfortunately, the public never saw the film because funding for it dried up, and it was never completed. Merkel went on to appear in a few [[silent movies]], several of them for the Lee Bradford Corporation. She also appeared in the two-reel ''[[Love's Old Sweet Song (1923 film)|Love's Old Sweet Song]]'' (1923), which was made by [[Lee DeForest]] in his [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process and starred [[Louis Wolheim]] and Helen Weir. Not making much of a mark in films, Merkel turned her attention to the theater and found work in several important plays on Broadway. Her biggest triumph was in ''Coquette'' (1927), which starred her idol, [[Helen Hayes]].\n\n[[File:42nd-Street-Merkel-Keeler-Rogers.jpg|thumb|Una Merkel, [[Ruby Keeler]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933)]]\n[[File:Gary Cooper Phyllis Brooks Una Merkel, Brisbane 1943 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Una Merkel (right) with [[Phyllis Brooks]] and [[Gary Cooper]] at a [[Brisbane]] press conference on their way to entertain the troops (1943)]]\n[[File:Una Merkel in I Love Melvin trailer.jpg|thumb|right|As Mom Schneider in ''[[I Love Melvin]]'' (1953)]]\n\nInvited to Hollywood by famous director [[D.W. Griffith]] to play [[Ann Rutledge]] in his film ''[[Abraham Lincoln (1930 film)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' (1930), Merkel became a big success in sound films. During the 1930s, she became a popular second lead in a number of films, usually playing the wisecracking best friend of the heroine, supporting actresses such as [[Jean Harlow]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[Loretta Young]], and [[Eleanor Powell]].<ref name=\"nytimesobit\">{{cite news |last=Reid |first=Alexander |title=Una Merket Dies at Age of 82; From Silent Films to a Tony |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 January 1986 |page=24 }}</ref>\n\nWith her Kewpie-doll looks, strong Southern accent, and wry line delivery, Merkel left her mark on scores of films in the 1930s. She played [[Sam Spade]]'s secretary in the original 1931 version of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1931 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. Merkel was a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player from 1932 to 1938, appearing in as many as 12 films in a year, often on loan-out to other studios. She was also often cast as leading lady opposite [[Jack Benny]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Franchot Tone]], and [[Charles Butterworth (actor)|Charles Butterworth]], among others.\n\nIn ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933), Merkel played a streetwise show girl who was [[Ginger Rogers]]' character's buddy. In the famous \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\" number, Merkel and Rogers sang the verse: \"Matrimony is baloney. She'll be wanting alimony in a year or so./Still they go and shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo.\" Merkel appeared in both the [[The Merry Widow (1934 film)|1934]] and the [[The Merry Widow (1952 film)|1952]] film versions of ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', playing different roles.\n\nOne of her most famous roles was in the Western comedy ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939), in which her character, Lily Belle, gets into a famous \"cat-fight\" with Frenchie ([[Marlene Dietrich]]) over the possession of her husband's trousers, won by Frenchie in a crooked card game. She played the elder daughter to the [[W. C. Fields]] character, Egbert Sous\u00e9, in the 1940 film ''[[The Bank Dick]]''. Her film career went into decline during the 1940s, although she continued working in smaller productions. In 1950, she starred with [[William Bendix]] in the baseball comedy ''[[Kill the Umpire]]'', which was a surprise hit.\n\nShe made a comeback as a middle-aged woman playing mothers and maiden aunts, and in 1956 won a [[Tony Award]] for her role on Broadway in ''The Ponder Heart'', adapted from the [[The Ponder Heart|novella of the same name]]. She had a major part in the MGM 1959 film ''[[The Mating Game (film)|The Mating Game]]'' as [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]]'s character's wife and [[Debbie Reynolds]]' character's mother, and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in ''[[Summer and Smoke (film)|Summer and Smoke]]'' (1961). She was also featured as [[Brian Keith]]'s character's housekeeper, Verbena, in the [[Walt Disney]] comedy ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' in 1961. Her final film role was opposite [[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[Spinout (film)|Spinout]]'' (1966).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn March 5, 1945, Merkel was nearly killed when her mother Bessie, with whom she shared an apartment in New York City, committed suicide by gassing herself. Merkel was overcome by the five gas jets her mother had turned on in their kitchen and was found unconscious in her bedroom.<ref name=\"starnews\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19520304&id=X29gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LXINAAAAIBAJ&pg=3526,445324&hl=en |title=Una Merkel Lies In Coma After Pill Overdose |date=March 4, 1952 |newspaper=Star-News |page=4 |accessdate=March 22, 2015 |location=Wilmington, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19450306&id=5fVeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QFQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4457,3137762&hl=en |title=Una Merkel in Death Escape |date=March 6, 1945 |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |page=8 |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 1952, seven years almost to the day after her mother committed suicide, Merkel overdosed on sleeping pills.<ref name=\"starnews\"/> She was found unconscious by a nurse who was caring for her at the time and remained in a coma for a day before recovering.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19520306&id=W_NjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5rADAAAAIBAJ&pg=1537,727712&hl=en |title=Una Merkel Recovering |date=March 6, 1952 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |page=3 |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMerkel was a lifelong [[Methodist]].<ref>kyumc.org/events/detail/1806</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fumceunice.org/About.html |title=About FUMC |website=First United Methodist Church, Eunice, Louisiana |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115123221/http://www.fumceunice.org/About.html |archivedate=November 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nMerkel was married once and had no children.<ref name=\"folkart\">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-04/local/me-24219_1_individual-films |title=Una Merkel, Movie, Stage Actress, Dies |last=Folkart |first=Burt A. |date=January 4, 1986 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref> She married [[North American Aviation]] executive Ronald L.

She went to Hollywood in 1930 and became a popular film actress. Two of her best-known performances are in the films ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' and ''[[Destry Rides Again]]''. She won a [[Tony Award]] in 1956 and was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1961.\n\n==Life and career==\nMerkel was born in [[Covington, Kentucky]], to Bessie (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Phares) and Arno Merkel,<ref>Kentucky. Birth Records, 1847-1911</ref>but in her early childhood, she lived in many of the [[Southern United States]] due to her father's job as a traveling salesman. At the age of 15, she and her parents moved to [[Philadelphia]]. They stayed there a year or so before settling in [[New York City]], where she began attending the Alviene School of Dramatic Art.\n\nBecause of her strong resemblance to actress [[Lillian Gish]], Merkel was offered a part as Gish's youngest sister in a silent film called ''World Shadows''. Unfortunately, the public never saw the film because funding for it dried up, and it was never completed. Merkel went on to appear in a few [[silent movies]], several of them for the Lee Bradford Corporation. She also appeared in the two-reel ''[[Love's Old Sweet Song (1923 film)|Love's Old Sweet Song]]'' (1923), which was made by [[Lee DeForest]] in his [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process and starred [[Louis Wolheim]] and Helen Weir. Not making much of a mark in films, Merkel turned her attention to the theater and found work in several important plays on Broadway. Her biggest triumph was in ''Coquette'' (1927), which starred her idol, [[Helen Hayes]].\n\n[[File:42nd-Street-Merkel-Keeler-Rogers.jpg|thumb|Una Merkel, [[Ruby Keeler]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933)]]\n[[File:Gary Cooper Phyllis Brooks Una Merkel, Brisbane 1943 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Una Merkel (right) with [[Phyllis Brooks]] and [[Gary Cooper]] at a [[Brisbane]] press conference on their way to entertain the troops (1943)]]\n[[File:Una Merkel in I Love Melvin trailer.jpg|thumb|right|As Mom Schneider in ''[[I Love Melvin]]'' (1953)]]\n\nInvited to Hollywood by famous director [[D.W. Griffith]] to play [[Ann Rutledge]] in his film ''[[Abraham Lincoln (1930 film)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' (1930), Merkel became a big success in sound films. During the 1930s, she became a popular second lead in a number of films, usually playing the wisecracking best friend of the heroine, supporting actresses such as [[Jean Harlow]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[Loretta Young]], and [[Eleanor Powell]].<ref name=\"nytimesobit\">{{cite news |last=Reid |first=Alexander |title=Una Merket Dies at Age of 82; From Silent Films to a Tony |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 January 1986 |page=24 }}</ref>\n\nWith her Kewpie-doll looks, strong Southern accent, and wry line delivery, Merkel left her mark on scores of films in the 1930s. She played [[Sam Spade]]'s secretary in the original 1931 version of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1931 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. Merkel was a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player from 1932 to 1938, appearing in as many as 12 films in a year, often on loan-out to other studios. She was also often cast as leading lady opposite [[Jack Benny]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Franchot Tone]], and [[Charles Butterworth (actor)|Charles Butterworth]], among others.\n\nIn ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933), Merkel played a streetwise show girl who was [[Ginger Rogers]]' character's buddy. In the famous \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\" number, Merkel and Rogers sang the verse: \"Matrimony is baloney. She'll be wanting alimony in a year or so./Still they go and shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo.\" Merkel appeared in both the [[The Merry Widow (1934 film)|1934]] and the [[The Merry Widow (1952 film)|1952]] film versions of ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', playing different roles.\n\nOne of her most famous roles was in the Western comedy ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939), in which her character, Lily Belle, gets into a famous \"cat-fight\" with Frenchie ([[Marlene Dietrich]]) over the possession of her husband's trousers, won by Frenchie in a crooked card game. She played the elder daughter to the [[W. C. Fields]] character, Egbert Sous\u00e9, in the 1940 film ''[[The Bank Dick]]''. Her film career went into decline during the 1940s, although she continued working in smaller productions. In 1950, she starred with [[William Bendix]] in the baseball comedy ''[[Kill the Umpire]]'', which was a surprise hit.\n\nShe made a comeback as a middle-aged woman playing mothers and maiden aunts, and in 1956 won a [[Tony Award]] for her role on Broadway in ''The Ponder Heart'', adapted from the [[The Ponder Heart|novella of the same name]]. She had a major part in the MGM 1959 film ''[[The Mating Game (film)|The Mating Game]]'' as [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]]'s character's wife and [[Debbie Reynolds]]' character's mother, and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in ''[[Summer and Smoke (film)|Summer and Smoke]]'' (1961). She was also featured as [[Brian Keith]]'s character's housekeeper, Verbena, in the [[Walt Disney]] comedy ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' in 1961. Her final film role was opposite [[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[Spinout (film)|Spinout]]'' (1966).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn March 5, 1945, Merkel was nearly killed when her mother Bessie, with whom she shared an apartment in New York City, committed suicide by gassing herself. Merkel was overcome by the five gas jets her mother had turned on in their kitchen and was found unconscious in her bedroom.<ref name=\"starnews\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19520304&id=X29gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LXINAAAAIBAJ&pg=3526,445324&hl=en |title=Una Merkel Lies In Coma After Pill Overdose |date=March 4, 1952 |newspaper=Star-News |page=4 |accessdate=March 22, 2015 |location=Wilmington, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19450306&id=5fVeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QFQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4457,3137762&hl=en |title=Una Merkel in Death Escape |date=March 6, 1945 |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |page=8 |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 1952, seven years almost to the day after her mother committed suicide, Merkel overdosed on sleeping pills.<ref name=\"starnews\"/> She was found unconscious by a nurse who was caring for her at the time and remained in a coma for a day before recovering.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19520306&id=W_NjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5rADAAAAIBAJ&pg=1537,727712&hl=en |title=Una Merkel Recovering |date=March 6, 1952 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |page=3 |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMerkel was a lifelong [[Methodist]].<ref>kyumc.org/events/detail/1806</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fumceunice.org/About.html |title=About FUMC |website=First United Methodist Church, Eunice, Louisiana |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115123221/http://www.fumceunice.org/About.html |archivedate=November 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nMerkel was married once and had no children.<ref name=\"folkart\">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-04/local/me-24219_1_individual-films |title=Una Merkel, Movie, Stage Actress, Dies |last=Folkart |first=Burt A. |date=January 4, 1986 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref> She married [[North American Aviation]] executive Ronald L.

While her tableaus are fantastic and futuristic, the role played by the female characters she portrayed were often traditional, gendered roles such as a waitress in ''Tea Ceremony'' (1995), a futuristic version of the female Buddhist deity [[Kissh\u014dten|Kichijoten]] in ''Pure Land'' (1996-1998), or a female Japanese pop star in ''Birth of a Star.'' \n\nMori attributes her fascination with consciousness and death to experiencing [[sleep paralysis]] in her early-twenties for several hours which left her unsure if she was alive or dead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyotojournal.org/the-journal/culture-arts/synthetic-dreams-the-art-of-mariko-mori/|title=The Art of Mariko Mori {{!}} Kyoto Journal|website=www.kyotojournal.org|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref>\n\nThe juxtaposition of Eastern mythology with Western culture is a common theme in Mori's works, often through layering photography and digital imaging,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1998/julaug/feat5.htm|title=Mariko Mori and Salvador Dali|last=Wilson|first=Ellen S.|date=July 1998|website=Carnegie Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618000008/http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1998/julaug/feat5.htm|archive-date=2008-06-18|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> such as in her 1995 installation ''Birth of a Star.'' Later works, such as ''Nirvana'' show her as a goddess, transcending her early roles via technology and image, and abandoning realistic urban scenes for more alien landscapes.\n\nAt the [[47th Venice Biennale]] (1997), Mori had two works exhibited at two different places, a photo collage titled, Empty Dream (1995) shown in the Japanese Pavillon, and the 3-D video installation, Nirvana (1997) which was shown in the Nordic Pavillon.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hz-journal.org/n4/borggreen.html|title=Hz #4 - Japan in Scandinavia|last=Borggreen|first=Gunhild|date=|website=www.hz-journal.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nMori's work is featured in many public museum collections, including [[Solomon R.

While her tableaus are fantastic and futuristic, the role played by the female characters she portrayed were often traditional, gendered roles such as a waitress in ''Tea Ceremony'' (1995), a futuristic version of the female Buddhist deity [[Kissh\u014dten|Kichijoten]] in ''Pure Land'' (1996-1998), or a female Japanese pop star in ''Birth of a Star.'' \n\nMori attributes her fascination with consciousness and death to experiencing [[sleep paralysis]] in her early-twenties for several hours which left her unsure if she was alive or dead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyotojournal.org/the-journal/culture-arts/synthetic-dreams-the-art-of-mariko-mori/|title=The Art of Mariko Mori {{!}} Kyoto Journal|website=www.kyotojournal.org|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref>\n\nThe juxtaposition of Eastern mythology with Western culture is a common theme in Mori's works, often through layering photography and digital imaging,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1998/julaug/feat5.htm|title=Mariko Mori and Salvador Dali|last=Wilson|first=Ellen S.|date=July 1998|website=Carnegie Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618000008/http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1998/julaug/feat5.htm|archive-date=2008-06-18|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> such as in her 1995 installation ''Birth of a Star.''
