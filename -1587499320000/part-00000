{"title_page": "R. Austin Freeman", "text_new": "{{other uses|Austin Freeman}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''Richard Austin Freeman''' (11 April 1862 \u2013 28 September 1943) was a British writer of [[detective stories]], mostly featuring the medico-legal [[forensic]] [[detective|investigator]] [[Dr. Thorndyke]]. He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical College, qualifying in 1887.  He specialized in ear, nose, and throat.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons.  He was house physician for a short time<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>, then entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as an assistant surgeon<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>.\n\n<blockquote>At this time the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) was a group of semi-independent kingdoms, still unacculturated, subject to incursions by the European colonial powers who were eager to annex them.  The French had been attempting to buy the favor of the native kings, and a British expedition, including Freeman, set out to investigate.  It was mostly through Freeman's intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred, and his future seemed assured in the colonial service.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref> and an immigration examiner at the Port of London<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref> but was unable to find a permanent medical position, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first stories were written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".  His first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as an induction physician <ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref> and a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.  Norman Donaldson wrote a full biography, ''In Search of Dr. Throndyke'', [[Bowling Green University]] Popular Press, Bowling Green, Ohio, 1971.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E. F. Bleiler.</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nFreeman held conservative political views.<ref name=\"am\">{{cite book |first=Angus |last=McLaren |title=Reproduction by Design: Sex, Robots, Trees, and Test-Tube Babies in Interwar Britain |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |isbn=0-226-56069-4 |pages=64\u20135}}</ref> In his 1921 book ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' Freeman put forth the view that [[mechanization]] had flooded Britain with poor-quality goods and created a \"homogenized, restless, unionized working class\".<ref name=\"am\"/> Freeman supported the [[eugenics]] movement and argued that people with \"undesirable\" biological traits should be prevented from breeding through \"segregation, marriage restriction, and\n[[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]\".<ref>McLaren, 2012, (p. 71).</ref> The book also attacked the British [[Labour movement]] and criticised the British government for permitting immigrants (whom Freeman referred to as \"Sub-Man\") to settle in Britain.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R.

Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ... There is even a gaslight charm about his Victorian love affairs, and those wonderful walks across London ...'

He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical College, qualifying in 1887.  He specialized in ear, nose, and throat.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons.  He was house physician for a short time<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>, then entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as an assistant surgeon<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>.\n\n<blockquote>At this time the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) was a group of semi-independent kingdoms, still unacculturated, subject to incursions by the European colonial powers who were eager to annex them.  The French had been attempting to buy the favor of the native kings, and a British expedition, including Freeman, set out to investigate.  It was mostly through Freeman's intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred, and his future seemed assured in the colonial service.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>, but was unable to find a permanent medical position, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first stories were written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".  His first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.  [[Norman Donaldson]] wrote a full biography, ''In Search of Dr. Throndyke'', [[Bowling Green University]] Popular Press, Bowling Green, Ohio, 1971.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E. F. Bleiler.</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nFreeman held conservative political views.<ref name=\"am\">{{cite book |first=Angus |last=McLaren |title=Reproduction by Design: Sex, Robots, Trees, and Test-Tube Babies in Interwar Britain |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |isbn=0-226-56069-4 |pages=64\u20135}}</ref> In his 1921 book ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' Freeman put forth the view that [[mechanization]] had flooded Britain with poor-quality goods and created a \"homogenized, restless, unionized working class\".<ref name=\"am\"/> Freeman supported the [[eugenics]] movement and argued that people with \"undesirable\" biological traits should be prevented from breeding through \"segregation, marriage restriction, and\n[[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]\".<ref>McLaren, 2012, (p. 71).</ref> The book also attacked the British [[Labour movement]] and criticised the British government for permitting immigrants (whom Freeman referred to as \"Sub-Man\") to settle in Britain. ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' referred to the [[Russian Revolution]] as \"the Russian catastrophe\" and argued society needed to protected from \"  degenerates of the destructive or \" Bolshevik \" type.\" <ref>R.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R. Austin Freeman, ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'', 1973, Dover (New York), {{ISBN|0-486-20388-3}}, from the introduction by E. F. Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ...

One of the pioneers of motion pictures, he founded [[Vitagraph Studios]] in 1897. He was one of the first filmmakers to use the techniques of stop-motion and drawn animation, is considered a father of American animation, and was the first to bring many classic plays and books to the screen. Blackton was also the commodore of the Motorboat Club of America<ref name=VarietyObit/> and the [[Atlantic Yacht Club]].<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Biography==\nJames Stuart Blackton was born on January 5, 1875, in [[Sheffield|Sheffield, Yorkshire, England]], to Henry Blacktin and Jessie Stuart. He emigrated with his family to the United States in 1885 and changed the family name to Blackton.<ref name=obit/>\n\nHe worked as a reporter and illustrator for the ''[[New York Evening World]]'', and performed regularly on stage with conjuror [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert Smith]].<ref name=\"Victorian Cinema\">{{cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/blackton|title=James Stuart Blackton|last=Gifford|first=Denis|website=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>  In 1896, [[Thomas Edison]] publicly demonstrated the [[Vitascope]], one of the first film projectors, and Blackton was sent to interview Edison and provide drawings of how his films were made. Eager for good publicity, Edison took Blackton to his [[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]], the special cabin he used to do his filming, and created a film on the spot of Blackton doing a lightning portrait of Edison. The inventor did such a good job selling the art of moviemaking that he talked Blackton and partner Smith into buying a print of the new film, as well as prints of nine other films, plus a Vitascope to show them to paying audiences.\n\n[[File:Vitagraph founders.jpg|thumb|left|Vitagraph Studios founders William T. Rock, [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert E. Smith]] and J. Stuart Blackton (1916)]]\nThe new act was a great success, despite the various things Blackton and Smith were doing between the Edison films. The next step was to start making films of their own. In this way the [[Vitagraph Studios|American Vitagraph Company]] was born.<ref name=obit/>\n\nDuring this period, J. Stuart Blackton ran the Vitagraph studio, and produced, directed, and wrote its films. He even starred in some of his films, playing the [[comic strip]] character \"[[Happy Hooligan]]\" in a series of shorts. Since profits were constantly increasing, Blackton felt that he could try any idea that sprang to his head, and in a series of films Blackton developed the concepts of animation.\n\n===Animated films===\nThe first of his animation films is ''[[The Enchanted Drawing]]'', with a copyright date of 1900 but probably made at least a year earlier.<ref name=obit/> In this film, Blackton sketches a face, a bottle of wine and a glass, a top hat, and a cigar. During the film he appears to remove the wine, glass, hat, and cigar as real objects, and the face appears to react. The \"animation\" here is of the stop-action variety, where the camera is stopped, a single change is made, and the camera is then started again. The process was first used by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] and others.\n\nThe transition to stop-motion was apparently accidental, and occurred around 1905. According to Albert Smith, one day the crew was filming a complex series of stop-action effects on the roof while steam from the building's generator was billowing in the background. On playing the film back, Smith noticed the odd effect created by the steam puffs scooting across the screen and decided to reproduce it deliberately. A few films (some of which are lost) use this effect to represent invisible ghosts, or to have toys come to life. In 1906, Blackton directed ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'', which uses stop-motion as well as stick puppetry to produce a series of effects. After Blackton's hand draws two faces on a chalkboard, they appear to come to life and engage in antics. Most of the film uses live action effects instead of animation, but nevertheless this film had a huge effect in stimulating the creation of animated films in America. In Europe, the same effect was had from ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907), another Vitagraph short directed by Blackton. ''The Haunted Hotel'' was mostly live-action, about a tourist spending the night in an inn run by invisible spirits. Most of the effects are also live-action (wires and such), but one scene of a dinner making itself was done using stop-motion, and was presented in a tight close-up that allowed budding animators to study it for technique.\n\nBlackton made another animated film that has survived, 1907's ''Lightning Sketches'', but it has nothing to add to the art of animation.

One of the pioneers of motion pictures, he founded [[Vitagraph Studios]] in 1897. He was one of the first filmmakers to use the techniques of stop-motion and drawn animation, is considered a father of American animation, and was the first to bring many classic plays and books to the screen. Blackton was also the commodore of the motormouth  Club of America<ref name=VarietyObit/> and the [[Atlantic Yacht Club]].<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Biography==\nJames Stuart Blackton was born on January 5, 1875, in [[Sheffield|Sheffield, Yorkshire, England]], to Henry Blacktin and Jessie Stuart. He emigrated with his family to the United States in 1885 and changed the family name to Blackton.<ref name=obit/>\n\nHe worked as a reporter and illustrator for the ''[[New York Evening World]]'', and performed regularly on stage with conjuror [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert Smith]].<ref name=\"Victorian Cinema\">{{cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/blackton|title=James Stuart Blackton|last=Gifford|first=Denis|website=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>  In 1896, [[Thomas Edison]] publicly demonstrated the [[Vitascope]], one of the first film projectors, and Blackton was sent to interview Edison and provide drawings of how his films were made. Eager for good publicity, Edison took Blackton to his [[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]], the special cabin he used to do his filming, and created a film on the spot of Blackton doing a lightning portrait of Edison. The inventor did such a good job selling the art of moviemaking that he talked Blackton and partner Smith into buying a print of the new film, as well as prints of nine other films, plus a Vitascope to show them to paying audiences.\n\n[[File:Vitagraph founders.jpg|thumb|left|Vitagraph Studios founders William T. Rock, [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert E. Smith]] and J. Stuart Blackton (1916)]]\nThe new act was a great success, despite the various things Blackton and Smith were doing between the Edison films. The next step was to start making films of their own. In this way the [[Vitagraph Studios|American Vitagraph Company]] was born.<ref name=obit/>\n\nDuring this period, J. Stuart Blackton ran the Vitagraph studio, and produced, directed, and wrote its films. He even starred in some of his films, playing the [[comic strip]] character \"[[Happy Hooligan]]\" in a series of shorts. Since profits were constantly increasing, Blackton felt that he could try any idea that sprang to his head, and in a series of films Blackton developed the concepts of animation.\n\n===Animated films===\nThe first of his animation films is ''[[The Enchanted Drawing]]'', with a copyright date of 1900 but probably made at least a year earlier.<ref name=obit/> In this film, Blackton sketches a face, a bottle of wine and a glass, a top hat, and a cigar. During the film he appears to remove the wine, glass, hat, and cigar as real objects, and the face appears to react. The \"animation\" here is of the stop-action variety, where the camera is stopped, a single change is made, and the camera is then started again. The process was first used by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] and others.\n\nThe transition to stop-motion was apparently accidental, and occurred around 1905. According to Albert Smith, one day the crew was filming a complex series of stop-action effects on the roof while steam from the building's generator was billowing in the background. On playing the film back, Smith noticed the odd effect created by the steam puffs scooting across the screen and decided to reproduce it deliberately. A few films (some of which are lost) use this effect to represent invisible ghosts, or to have toys come to life. In 1906, Blackton directed ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'', which uses stop-motion as well as stick puppetry to produce a series of effects. After Blackton's hand draws two faces on a chalkboard, they appear to come to life and engage in antics. Most of the film uses live action effects instead of animation, but nevertheless this film had a huge effect in stimulating the creation of animated films in America. In Europe, the same effect was had from ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907), another Vitagraph short directed by Blackton. ''The Haunted Hotel'' was mostly live-action, about a tourist spending the night in an inn run by invisible spirits. Most of the effects are also live-action (wires and such), but one scene of a dinner making itself was done using stop-motion, and was presented in a tight close-up that allowed budding animators to study it for technique.\n\nBlackton made another animated film that has survived, 1907's ''Lightning Sketches'', but it has nothing to add to the art of animation. In 1908 he made the first American film version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1908 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', filmed in New York City's [[Central Park]] and ''[[The Thieving Hand]]'', filmed in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]]. By 1909, Blackton was too absorbed in the business of running Vitagraph to have time for filmmaking. He came to regard his animation experiments in particular as being rather juvenile (they receive no mention in his unpublished autobiography).\n\n===Dramatic films and later life===\n[[File:Marian-and-JS-Blackton-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Blackton and daughter Marian Blackton Trimble (1901\u20131993), author of a personal biography of her father that was edited by film historian [[Anthony Slide]]<ref name=\"Howard\">{{cite web |url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-marian-constance-blackton/ |title=Marian Constance Blackton |last1=Howard |first1=Cameron |last2= |first2= |date=September 27, 2013 |website=Women Film Pioneers Project |publisher=Center for Digital Research and Scholarship, [[Columbia University Libraries]] |access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref>]]\nStuart Blackton believed that the US should join the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] involved in [[World War I]] overseas and in 1915 produced ''[[The Battle Cry of Peace]]''.
