The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at the Sarantaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarantaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127\u2013131}} The disastrous Greek defeat in the short [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first postwar Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by rearming and retraining the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reservists]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbo]]-[[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Bulgaria. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Divisions]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000\u201340,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7\u20138|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans had been methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the [[Pyli|Porta Pass]], and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]] River, with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which granted the League's members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as Crete.

Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by rearming and retraining the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reservists]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbo]]-[[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Bulgaria. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Divisions]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000\u201340,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7\u20138|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans had been methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the [[Pyli|Porta Pass]], and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]] River, with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which granted the League's members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as Crete. The fate of [[Independent Albania|Albania]] and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great Powers]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=330\u2013332}}\n\n==Notes==\n;Footnotes\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Apostolidis |first=Dimitrios |title=\u039f \u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1912-1913|trans-title=The Victorious Greco-Turkish War of 1912-1913|volume=I|publisher=Estia|location=Athens|language=Greek|year=1913|url=https://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/8/d/1/metadata-9272bd94229998ed96a378ab0f986a22_1270023610.tkl|accessdate=13 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Blackburn|first1=Bonnie|last2=Holford-Strevens|first2=Leofranc|title=The Oxford Companion to the Year|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214231-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Georgios|last1=Christopoulos|first2=Ioannis|last2=Bastias|title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2: \u039d\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf 1881 \u03c9\u03c2 1913|trans-title=History of the Greek Nation: Modern Greece from 1881 until 1913 |volume=XIV |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon|language=Greek|location=Athens|year=1977 |isbn=960-213-110-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dimitracopoulos |first=Anastasios |title=The First Balkan War Through the Pages of Review L'Illustration |year=1992 |publisher=Hellenic Committee of Military History|location=Athens |oclc= 37043754| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Edward |title=Defeat in Detail: The Ottoman Army in the Balkans, 1912-1913 |year=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport | isbn =978-0-275-97888-4| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hooton |first=Edward|title=Prelude to the First World War: The Balkan Wars 1912-1913 |year=2014|publisher=Fonthill Media|location=Stroud | isbn =978-1781551806  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kargakos |first=Sarandos| title=\u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (1912-1913)|trans-title=Greece in the Balkan Wars (1912-1913)| publisher=Peritechnon|location=Athens| year = 2012 | isbn =978-960-8411-26-5|language=Greek| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Katsikostas |first=Dimitrios |title=\u0397 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 Eydoux|trans-title=The Reorganization of the Armed Forces and the Efforts of the French Military Mission of Eydoux|publisher= Hellenic Army History Directorate |language=Greek|year= 2014 |url=https://dis.army.gr/sites/dis.army.gr/files/unmanaged/pdf/Articles_June14/Greek_French/ANADIORG_ED_APOST_EYDOUX.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2019 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Klapsis |first=Antonis |date=2009 |title=Between the Hammer and the Anvil.

[[Toy Biz]]:\n| 2002\u20132006\n|-\n! [[Hasbro]]:\n| 2006\u2013Present\n|}\n'''Marvel Legends''' is an [[action figure]] line based on the characters of [[Marvel Comics]], initially produced by [[Toy Biz]], then by [[Hasbro]]. This line is in the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} scale, with spin-off lines in the {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}, and {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} scale.\n\nThe line initially began as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line, which were also produced by Toy Biz. At its inception in 2002, the Marvel Legends line copied the clam-shell packaging and the included comic book that had shipped with the Spider-Man Classics line. Beginning January 1, 2007, Hasbro became the new license holder to the rights to produce toys and games based upon the Marvel Universe. The new Hasbro packaging did not include a comic book and the new molds eliminated finger joints, which were a mainstay during the Toy Biz era, but the company did continue with the theme of Build-A-Figure pieces. During the late 2000s, production on the Marvel Legends line slowed down to the point where it was rumored that it may be cancelled, but Hasbro revealed (at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]) that due to fan requests and the upcoming movies based on Marvel characters, the line would be making a comeback in 2012, and in January 2012, Marvel Legends returned to store shelves.\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Hasbro announced that Marvel Legends would be given a new start as the ''Marvel Legends Infinite Series'' starting with the [[Mandroid]] series. Initially, the Marvel Legends line has used the \"chase\" concept to introduce figures based on less popular or recognisable characters. These got their nickname by being shipped in fewer quantities than the rest of the figures, thus causing collectors to ''chase'' after them. Eventually, rather than entirely new figures, the chase concept evolved into variants (such as an alternate head or a different colour scheme) of a figure released in that same series. These figures retained being sought-after by collectors. A Marvel Legends [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]] \"figure\" was included as a joke cut-out in the GLX-Mas Special (2005). It featured \"infinite\" points of articulation and three action phrases (to be said with one's own voice).\n\n==Toy Biz==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=5%|'''Series'''\n!width=5%|'''Release'''\n!width=15%|'''Figure'''\n!width=25%|'''Accessories'''\n!width=25%|'''Description'''\n!width=25%|'''Comic'''\n|-\n|rowspan=7|1\n|rowspan=7|May 2002\n|[[Captain America]]\n|destroyed building and American flag display\n|\n|Captain America (1968) #109\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Hulk]]\n|rowspan=2|destroyed wall stand\n|bendable fingers\n|rowspan=2|Incredible Hulk (1968) #314\n|-\n|straight fingers and white shirt variant\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[Iron Man]]\n|rowspan=3|[[Stark Industries]] sign stand\n|Model 3 armor\n|rowspan=3|Iron Man (1968) #149\n|-\n|Model 2 (horned) gold\n|-\n|Stealth armor\n|-\n|[[Toad (comics)|Toad]]\n|swamp stand\n|frog permanently in hand, from the unreleased \"Evolution of X\" two-pack from ''[[X-Men (2000 film)]]''\n|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #4\n|-\n|rowspan=8|2\n|rowspan=8|September 2002\n|-\n|[[Doctor Doom]]\n|rowspan=2|castle tower stand\n|\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #247\n|-\n|[[Doombot]]\n|removable mask\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Human Torch]]\n|rowspan=2|Flame stand from pre-Legends ''Marvel's Most Wanted'' [[Nate Grey|X-Man]] figure\n|''4'' on chest\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #233\n|-\n|no \"4\"\n|-\n|[[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner\n|trident and water stand\n|\n|The Sub-Mariner (1968) #67\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]\n|Yancy Street wall display\n|\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #263\n|-\n|Trenchcoat, sunglasses, Yancy Street wall display\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=6|3\n|rowspan=6|December 2002\n|[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]\n|church window stand\n|[[Daredevil (film)]] version\n|Daredevil (1964) #164\n|-\n|[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)]]\n|Motorcycle\n|\n|Ghost Rider (1973) #2\n|-\n|[[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]\n|disembodied Sentinel head base\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #2\n|-\n|[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\n|stand\n|\n|Thor (1966) #39\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]\n|rowspan=2|[[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] guards stand\n|Masked<br />Retool of \"Evolution of X\" two-pack from ''[[X-Men (2000 film)]]''\n|rowspan=2|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #133\n|-\n|unmasked\n|-\n|rowspan=6|4\n|rowspan=6|June 2003\n|[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]\n|pull up bar base\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #3\n|-\n|[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]\n|2 swords, 2 sai, back scabbards and samurai stand\n|\n|Daredevil (1964) #176\n|-\n|[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]\n|flaming cards, staff and Sentinel right hand stand\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #4\n|-\n|[[Hank Pym|Goliath (Pym)]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man (Lang)]], and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]\n|\n|repaint of ''Avengers'' #1 (Non-Legends) Giant-Man, Ant-Man and Wasp mini-figures\n|The Avengers (1963) #28\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Punisher]]\n|rowspan=2|guns and War Zone stand\n|white belt\n|rowspan=2|Punisher War Zone (1992) #1\n|-\n|black belt\n|-\n|rowspan=7|5\n|rowspan=7|November 2003\n|[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]\n|sword, gun and motorcycle\n|[[Blade II]] version\n|originally ''Tomb of Dracula'' (1972) #45, then poster book of ''Blade II''\n|-\n|[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]\n|disembodied Sentinel torso stand\n|\n|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #129\n|-\n|[[Mr. Fantastic]]\n|interchangeable arms and [[Fantasticar]] stand\n|\n|Fantastic Four (1961) #489\n|-\n|[[Nick Fury]]\n|gun and flaming jetpack stand\n|\n|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

[[Hasbro]]:\n| 2006\u2013Present\n|}\n'''Marvel Legends''' is an [[action figure]] line based on the characters of [[Marvel Comics]], initially produced by [[Toy Biz]], then by [[Hasbro]]. This line is in the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} scale, with spin-off lines in the {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}, and {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} scale.\n\nThe line initially began as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line, which were also produced by Toy Biz. At its inception in 2002, the Marvel Legends line copied the clam-shell packaging and the included comic book that had shipped with the Spider-Man Classics line. Beginning January 1, 2007, Hasbro became the new license holder to the rights to produce toys and games based upon the Marvel Universe. The new Hasbro packaging did not include a comic book and the new molds eliminated finger joints, which were a mainstay during the Toy Biz era, but the company did continue with the theme of Build-A-Figure pieces. During the late 2000s, production on the Marvel Legends line slowed down to the point where it was rumored that it may be cancelled, but Hasbro revealed (at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]) that due to fan requests and the upcoming movies based on Marvel characters, the line would be making a comeback in 2012, and in January 2012, Marvel Legends returned to store shelves.\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Hasbro announced that Marvel Legends would be given a new start as the ''Marvel Legends Infinite Series'' starting with the [[Mandroid]] series. Initially, the Marvel Legends line has used the \"chase\" concept to introduce figures based on less popular or recognisable characters. These got their nickname by being shipped in fewer quantities than the rest of the figures, thus causing collectors to ''chase'' after them. Eventually, rather than entirely new figures, the chase concept evolved into variants (such as an alternate head or a different colour scheme) of a figure released in that same series.

Similarly, anything having energy exhibits a corresponding mass {{math|''m''}} given by its energy {{math|''E''}} divided by the speed of light squared {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. Because the speed of light is a large number in everyday units, the formula implies that even an everyday object at rest with a modest amount of mass has a very large amount of energy intrinsically. [[Chemical reaction]]s, [[nuclear reaction]]s, and other [[energy transformation]]s may cause a [[Physical system|system]] to lose some of its energy content to the environment (and thus some corresponding mass), releasing it as the [[radiant energy]] of [[light]] or as [[thermal energy]] for example.\n\nMass\u2013energy equivalence arose originally from [[special relativity]] as a paradox described by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]].<ref name=action>{{Citation\n| author=Poincar\u00e9, H. | year=1900 | title=La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action | journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles | volume =5  | pages =252\u2013278| title-link=s:fr:La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action }}.

When the body is in motion, its total energy is greater than its rest energy, and equivalently its ''total mass'' (also called [[relativistic mass]] in this context) is greater than its rest mass.  This rest mass is also called the intrinsic or [[invariant mass]] because it remains the same regardless of this motion, even for the extreme speeds or gravity considered in special and [[general relativity]].\n\nThe mass\u2013energy formula also serves to [[Conversion of units|convert]] [[:Category:Units of mass|units of mass]] to [[:Category:Units of energy|units of energy]] (and vice versa), no matter what [[Systems of measurement|system of measurement units]] is used.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe formula was initially written in many different notations, and its interpretation and justification was further developed in several steps.<ref name=jammer2 /><ref name=hecht>{{Citation | author=Hecht, Eugene | date=2011 | title=How Einstein confirmed E0=mc2 | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume =79 | issue=6 | pages =591\u2013600 | doi=10.1119/1.3549223|bibcode = 2011AmJPh..79..591H }}</ref>\nIn \"Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?\" (1905), Einstein used {{math|''V''}} to mean the speed of light in a vacuum and {{math|''L''}} to mean the [[energy]] lost by a body in the form of [[radiation]].<ref name=\"inertia\"/> Consequently, the equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} was not originally written as a formula but as a sentence in German saying that \"if a body gives off the energy {{math|''L''}} in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by {{math|{{sfrac|''L''|''V''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.\" A remark placed above it informed that the equation was approximated by neglecting \"magnitudes of fourth and higher orders\" of a [[Series (mathematics)|series expansion]].<ref>See the sentence on the last page 641 of the original German edition, above the equation \n{{math|1=''K''<sub>0</sub> \u2212 ''K''<sub>1</sub> = {{sfrac|''L''|''V''<sup>2</sup>}} {{sfrac|''v''<sup>2</sup>|2}}}}.

Similarly, kinetic or radiant energy can be converted to other kinds of particles that have rest energy (rest mass).  In the transformation process, neither the total amount of mass nor the total amount of energy changes, since both properties are connected via a simple constant.<ref>In F. Fernflores.

Its momentum and energy continue to increase without bounds, whereas its speed approaches (but never reaches) a constant value\u2014the speed of light. This implies that in relativity the momentum of an object cannot be a constant times the [[velocity]], nor can the [[Kinetic energy#Kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy]] be a constant times the square of the velocity.\n\nA property called the [[relativistic mass]] is defined as the ratio of the momentum of an object to its velocity.<ref>Note that the relativistic mass, in contrast to the rest mass {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>}}, is not a relativistic invariant, and that the velocity <math>\\,v=dx^{(4)}/dt</math> is not a Minkowski four-vector, in contrast to the quantity <math>\\tilde v=dx^{(4)}/d\\tau</math>, where <math> d\\tau =dt\\cdot\\sqrt{1-(v^2/c^2)}</math> is the differential of the [[proper time]]. However, the energy\u2013momentum four-vector <math> p^{(4)}=m_0\\cdot dx^{(4)}/d\\tau</math> is a genuine Minkowski four-vector, and the intrinsic origin of the square root in the definition of the relativistic mass is the distinction between {{mvar|d\u03c4}} and {{mvar|dt}}.</ref> Relativistic mass depends on the motion of the object, so that different observers in relative motion see different values for it. If the object is moving slowly, the relativistic mass is nearly equal to the [[rest mass]] and both are nearly equal to the usual Newtonian mass. If the object is moving quickly, the relativistic mass is greater than the rest mass by an amount equal to the mass associated with the [[kinetic energy]] of the object. As the object approaches the speed of light, the relativistic mass grows infinitely, because the kinetic energy grows infinitely and this energy is associated with mass.\n\nThe relativistic mass is always equal to the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic energy) divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref name=\"tipler\">{{citation |title=Modern Physics |author1=Paul Allen Tipler |author2=Ralph A.

Freeman and Company |date=January 2003}}</ref> Because the relativistic mass is exactly proportional to the energy, relativistic mass and relativistic energy are nearly synonyms; the only difference between them is the [[unit of measurement|units]]. If length and time are measured in [[natural units]], the speed of light is equal to 1, and even this difference disappears. Then mass and energy have the same units and are always equal, so it is redundant to speak about relativistic mass, because it is just another name for the energy. This is why physicists usually reserve the useful short word \"mass\" to mean rest mass, or [[invariant mass]], and not relativistic mass.\n\nThe relativistic mass of a moving object is larger than the relativistic mass of an object that is not moving, because a moving object has extra kinetic energy. The ''rest mass'' of an object is defined as the mass of an object when it is at rest, so that the rest mass is always the same, independent of the motion of the observer: it is the same in all [[inertial frame]]s.\n\nFor things and systems made up of many parts, like an [[atomic nucleus]], [[planet]], or [[star]], the relativistic mass is the sum of the relativistic masses (or energies) of the parts, because energies are additive in isolated systems. This is not true in open systems, however, if energy is subtracted. For example, if a system is [[Binding energy#Mass-energy relation|''bound'']] by attractive forces, and the energy gained due to the forces of attraction in excess of the work done is removed from the system, then mass is lost with this removed energy. For example, the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the total mass of the protons and neutrons that make it up, but this is only true after this energy from binding has been removed in the form of a gamma ray (which in this system, carries away the mass of the energy of binding). This mass decrease is also equivalent to the energy required to break up the nucleus into individual protons and neutrons (in this case, work and mass would need to be supplied). Similarly, the mass of the solar system is slightly less than the sum of the individual masses of the sun and planets.\n\nFor a system of particles going off in different directions, the [[invariant mass]] of the system is the analog of the rest mass, and is the same for all observers, even those in relative motion. It is defined as the total energy (divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}) in the [[center of mass frame]] (where by definition, the system total momentum is zero). A simple example of an object with moving parts but zero total momentum is a container of gas. In this case, the mass of the container is given by its total energy (including the kinetic energy of the gas molecules), since the system total energy and invariant mass are the same in any reference frame where the momentum is zero, and such a reference frame is also the only frame in which the object can be weighed. In a similar way, the theory of special relativity posits that the thermal energy in all objects (including solids) contributes to their total masses and weights, even though this energy is present as the kinetic and potential energies of the atoms in the object, and it (in a similar way to the gas) is not seen in the rest masses of the atoms that make up the object.\n\nIn a similar manner, even photons (light quanta), if trapped in a container space (as a [[photon gas]] or [[thermal radiation]]), would contribute a mass associated with their energy to the container. Such an extra mass, in theory, could be weighed in the same way as any other type of rest mass. This is true in special relativity theory, even though individually photons have no rest mass. The property that trapped energy ''in any form'' adds weighable mass to systems that have no net momentum is one of the characteristic and notable consequences of relativity. It has no counterpart in classical Newtonian physics, in which radiation, light, heat, and kinetic energy never exhibit weighable mass under any circumstances.\n\nJust as the relativistic mass of an isolated system is conserved through time, so also is its invariant mass.This property allows the conservation of all types of mass in systems, and also conservation of all types of mass in reactions where matter is destroyed (annihilated), leaving behind the energy that was associated with it (which is now in non-material form, rather than material form). Matter may appear and disappear in various reactions, but mass and energy are both unchanged in this process.\n\n==Applicability of the strict formula==\n\nAs is noted above, two different definitions of mass have been used in special relativity, and also two different definitions of energy. The simple equation <math>E = mc^2</math> is not generally applicable to all these types of mass and energy, except in the special  case that the total additive momentum is zero for the system under consideration. In such a case, which is always guaranteed when observing the system from either its [[center of mass frame]] or its [[center of momentum frame]], <math>E = mc^2</math> is always true for any type of mass and energy that are chosen. Thus, for example, in the center of mass frame, the total energy of an object or system is equal to its rest mass times <math>c^2</math>, a useful equality. This is the relationship used for the container of gas in the previous example. It is ''not'' true in other reference frames where the center of mass is in motion. In these systems or for such an object, its total energy depends on both its rest (or invariant) mass, and its (total) momentum.<ref>Relativity DeMystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145545-0}}</ref>\n\nIn inertial reference frames other than the rest frame or center of mass frame, the equation <math>E = mc^2</math> remains true if the energy is the relativistic energy ''and'' the mass is the relativistic mass. It is also correct if the energy is the rest or invariant energy (also the minimum energy), ''and'' the mass is the rest mass, or the invariant mass. However, connection of the '''total or relativistic energy''' (<math>E_r</math>) with the '''rest or invariant mass''' (<math>m_0</math>) requires consideration of the system's total momentum, in systems and reference frames where the total momentum (of [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude]] {{math|''p''}}) has a non-zero value. The formula then required to connect the two different kinds of mass and energy, is the extended version of Einstein's equation, called the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]:<ref>Dynamics and Relativity, J.R.

For photons where <math>m_0 = 0</math>, the equation reduces to <math>E_r = pc</math>.\n\n==Meanings of the strict formula==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2016}}\n[[File:E equals m plus c square at Taipei101.jpg|thumb|right|The mass\u2013energy equivalence formula was displayed on [[Taipei 101]] during the event of the [[World Year of Physics 2005]].]]\n\nMass\u2013energy equivalence states that any object has a certain energy, even when it is stationary. In [[Newtonian mechanics]], a motionless body has no [[kinetic energy]], and it may or may not have other amounts of internal stored energy, like [[chemical energy]] or [[thermal energy]], in addition to any [[potential energy]] it may have from its position in a [[field (physics)|field of force]]. In Newtonian mechanics, all of these energies are much smaller than the mass of the object times the speed of light squared.\n\nIn relativity, all the energy that moves with an object (that is, all the energy present in the object's rest frame) contributes to the total mass of the body, which measures how much it resists acceleration. Each bit of potential and kinetic energy makes a proportional contribution to the mass. As noted above, even if a box of ideal mirrors \"contains\" light, then the individually massless photons still contribute to the total mass of the box, by the amount of their energy divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |title=Mechanics\n |edition=2\n |first1=H.

In a nuclear reaction, the mass of the atoms that come out is less than the mass of the atoms that go in, and the difference in mass shows up as heat and light with the same relativistic mass as the difference (and also the same [[invariant mass]] in the center of mass frame of the system). In this case, the {{mvar|E}} in the formula is the energy released and removed, and the mass {{mvar|m}} is how much the mass decreases. In the same way, when any sort of energy is added to an isolated system, the increase in the mass is equal to the added energy divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. For example, when water is heated it gains about {{val|1.11|e=-17|u=kg}} of mass for every joule of heat added to the water.\n\nAn object moves with different speed in different frames, depending on the motion of the observer, so the kinetic energy in both Newtonian mechanics and relativity is ''frame dependent''. This means that the amount of relativistic energy, and therefore the amount of relativistic mass, that an object is measured to have depends on the observer. The ''rest mass'' is defined as the mass that an object has when it is not moving (or when an inertial frame is chosen such that it is not moving). The term also applies to the invariant mass of systems when the system as a whole is not \"moving\" (has no net momentum). The rest and invariant masses are the smallest possible value of the mass of the object or system. They also are conserved quantities, so long as the system is isolated. Because of the way they are calculated, the effects of moving observers are subtracted, so these quantities do not change with the motion of the observer.\n\nThe rest mass is almost never additive: the rest mass of an object is not the sum of the rest masses of its parts. The rest mass of an object is the total energy of all the parts, including kinetic energy, as measured by an observer that sees the center of the mass of the object to be standing still. The rest mass adds up only if the parts are standing still and do not attract or repel, so that they do not have any extra kinetic or potential energy. The other possibility is that they have a positive kinetic energy and a negative potential energy that exactly cancels.\n\n===Binding energy and the \"mass defect\"===\n{{main|Binding energy|Mass defect}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\n\nWhenever any type of energy is removed from a system, the mass associated with the energy is also removed, and the system therefore loses mass. This mass defect in the system may be simply calculated as {{math|1=\u0394''m'' = {{sfrac|\u0394''E''|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}}}, and this was the form of the equation historically first presented by Einstein in 1905. However, use of this formula in such circumstances has led to the false idea that mass has been \"converted\" to energy. This may be particularly the case when the energy (and mass) removed from the system is associated with the ''binding energy'' of the system. In such cases, the binding energy is observed as a \"mass defect\" or deficit in the new system.\n\nThe fact that the released energy is not easily weighed in many such cases, may cause its mass to be neglected as though it no longer existed. This circumstance has encouraged the false idea of conversion of ''mass'' to energy, rather than the correct idea that the binding energy of such systems is relatively large, and exhibits a measurable mass, which is removed when the binding energy is removed. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.\n\nThe difference between the rest mass of a bound system and of the unbound parts is the [[binding energy]] of the system, if this energy has been removed after binding. For example, a water molecule weighs a little less than two free hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. The minuscule mass difference is the energy needed to split the molecule into three individual atoms (divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}), which was given off as heat when the molecule formed (this heat had mass). Likewise, a stick of dynamite in theory weighs a little bit more than the fragments after the explosion, but this is true only so long as the fragments are cooled and the heat removed. In this case the mass difference is the energy/heat that is released when the dynamite explodes, and when this heat escapes, the mass associated with it escapes, only to be deposited in the surroundings, which absorb the heat (so that total mass is conserved).\n\nSuch a change in mass may only happen when the system is open, and the energy and mass escapes. Thus, if a stick of dynamite is blown up in a hermetically sealed chamber, the mass of the chamber and fragments, the heat, sound, and light would still be equal to the original mass of the chamber and dynamite. If sitting on a scale, the weight and mass would not change. This would in theory also happen even with a nuclear bomb, if it could be kept in an ideal box of infinite strength, which did not rupture or pass radiation.<ref name=\"A. Wheeler, 1992. pp. 248\"/> Thus, a 21.5&nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|kiloton]] ({{val|9|e=13|u=joule}}) nuclear bomb produces about one gram of heat and electromagnetic radiation, but the mass of this energy would not be detectable in an exploded bomb in an ideal box sitting on a scale; instead, the contents of the box would be heated to millions of degrees without changing total mass and weight. If then, however, a transparent window (passing only electromagnetic radiation) were opened in such an ideal box after the explosion, and a beam of X-rays and other lower-energy light allowed to escape the box, it would eventually be found to weigh one gram less than it had before the explosion. This weight loss and mass loss would happen as the box was cooled by this process, to room temperature. However, any surrounding mass that absorbed the X-rays (and other \"heat\") would ''gain'' this gram of mass from the resulting heating, so the mass \"loss\" would represent merely its relocation. Thus, no mass (or, in the case of a nuclear bomb, no matter) would be \"converted\" to energy in such a process. Mass and energy, as always, would both be separately conserved.\n\n===Massless particles===\nMassless particles have zero rest mass. Their relativistic mass is simply their relativistic energy, divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}, or {{math|1=''m''{{ssub|rel}} = {{Sfrac|''E''|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |title=Basic relativity\n |edition=2\n |first1=Richard A.\n |last1=Mould\n |publisher=Springer\n |date=2002\n |isbn=0-387-95210-1\n |page=126\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC\n}},\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC&pg=PA126 Chapter 5 page 126]\n</ref><ref>\n{{Citation\n |title=Introduction to electromagnetic theory: a modern perspective\n |first1=Tail L.\n |last1=Chow\n |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning\n |date=2006\n |isbn=0-7637-3827-1\n |page=392\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C\n}},\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&pg=PA392 Chapter 10 page 392]\n</ref> The energy for photons is {{math|1=''E'' = ''hf''}}, where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]] and {{mvar|f}} is the photon frequency. This frequency and thus the relativistic energy are frame-dependent.\n\nIf an observer runs away from a photon in the direction the photon travels from a source, and it catches up with the observer\u2014when the photon catches up, the observer sees it as having less energy than it had at the source. The faster the observer is traveling with regard to the source when the photon catches up, the less energy the photon has. As an observer approaches the speed of light with regard to the source, the photon looks redder and redder, by [[relativistic Doppler effect]] (the Doppler shift is the relativistic formula), and the energy of a very long-wavelength photon approaches zero. This is because the photon is ''massless''\u2014the rest mass of a photon is zero.\n\n===Massless particles contribute rest mass and invariant mass to systems===\nTwo photons moving in different directions cannot both be made to have arbitrarily small total energy by changing frames, or by moving toward or away from them. The reason is that in a two-photon system, the energy of one photon is decreased by chasing after it, but the energy of the other increases with the same shift in observer motion. Two photons not moving in the same direction comprise an [[inertial frame]] where the combined energy is smallest, but not zero. This is called the [[center of mass]] frame or the [[center of momentum]] frame; these terms are almost synonyms (the center of mass frame is the special case of a center of momentum frame where the center of mass is put at the origin). The most that chasing a pair of photons can accomplish to decrease their energy is to put the observer in a frame where the photons have equal energy and are moving directly away from each other. In this frame, the observer is now moving in the same direction and speed as the center of mass of the two photons. The total momentum of the photons is now zero, since their momenta are equal and opposite. In this frame the two photons, as a system, have a mass equal to their total energy divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. This mass is called the [[invariant mass]] of the pair of photons together. It is the smallest mass and energy the system may be seen to have, by any observer. It is only the invariant mass of a two-photon system that can be used to make a single particle with the same rest mass.\n\nIf the photons are formed by the collision of a particle and an antiparticle, the invariant mass is the same as the total energy of the particle and antiparticle (their rest energy plus the kinetic energy), in the center of mass frame, where they automatically move in equal and opposite directions (since they have equal momentum in this frame). If the photons are formed by the disintegration of a ''single'' particle with a well-defined rest mass, like the neutral [[pion]], the invariant mass of the photons is equal to rest mass of the pion. In this case, the center of mass frame for the pion is just the frame where the pion is at rest, and the center of mass does not change after it disintegrates into two photons. After the two photons are formed, their center of mass is still moving the same way the pion did, and their total energy in this frame adds up to the mass energy of the pion. Thus, by calculating the [[invariant mass]] of pairs of photons in a particle detector, pairs can be identified that were probably produced by pion disintegration.\n\nA similar calculation illustrates that the invariant mass of systems is conserved, even when massive particles (particles with rest mass) within the system are converted to massless particles (such as photons). In such cases, the photons contribute invariant mass to the system, even though they individually have no invariant mass or rest mass. Thus, an electron and positron (each of which has rest mass) may undergo [[electron\u2013positron annihilation|annihilation]] with each other to produce two photons, each of which is massless (has no rest mass). However, in such circumstances, no system mass is lost. Instead, the system of both photons moving away from each other has an invariant mass, which acts like a rest mass for any system in which the photons are trapped, or that can be weighed. Thus, not only the quantity of relativistic mass, but also the quantity of invariant mass does not change in transformations between \"matter\" (electrons and positrons) and energy (photons).\n\n===Relation to gravity===\nIn physics, there are two distinct concepts of [[mass]]: the gravitational mass and the inertial mass. The gravitational mass is the quantity that determines the strength of the [[gravitational field]] generated by an object, as well as the gravitational force acting on the object when it is immersed in a gravitational field produced by other bodies. The inertial mass, on the other hand, quantifies how much an object accelerates if a given force is applied to it. The mass\u2013energy equivalence in special relativity refers to the inertial mass. However, already in the context of Newton gravity, the Weak [[Equivalence Principle]] is postulated: the gravitational and the inertial mass of every object are the same. Thus, the mass\u2013energy equivalence, combined with the Weak Equivalence Principle, results in the prediction that all forms of energy contribute to the gravitational field generated by an object. This observation is one of the pillars of the [[general theory of relativity]].\n\nThe above prediction, that all forms of energy interact gravitationally, has been subject to experimental tests. The first observation testing this prediction was made in 1919.<ref>{{Citation |last=Dyson|first =F.W. |author2= Eddington, A.S. |author3=Davidson, C.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil.

Another seminal experiment, the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]], was performed in 1960.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pound| first=R. V.| author2 = Rebka Jr. G.

The frequency of the light detected was higher than the light emitted. This result confirms that the energy of photons increases when they fall in the gravitational field of the Earth. The energy, and therefore the gravitational mass, of photons is proportional to their frequency as stated by the [[Planck constant|Planck's relation]].\n\n==Application to nuclear physics==\n[[File:USS Enterprise (CVAN-65), USS Long Beach (CGN-9) and USS Bainbridge (DLGN-25) underway in the Mediterranean Sea during Operation Sea Orbit, in 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Task Force One, the world's first nuclear-powered task force. {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|2}}, {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|2}} and {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}} in formation in the Mediterranean, 18 June 1964.

However, Planck was thinking about chemical reactions, where the binding energy is too small to measure. Einstein suggested that radioactive materials such as [[radium]] would provide a test of the theory, but even though a large amount of energy is released per atom in radium, due to the [[half-life]] of the substance (1602 years), only a small fraction of radium atoms decay over an experimentally measurable period of time.\n\nOnce the nucleus was discovered, experimenters realized that the very high binding energies of the atomic nuclei should allow calculation of their binding energies, simply from mass differences. But it was not until the discovery of the [[neutron]] in 1932, and the measurement of the neutron mass, that this calculation could actually be performed (see [[nuclear binding energy]] for example calculation). A little while later, the [[Cockcroft\u2013Walton accelerator]] produced the first [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] reaction ({{nowrap|{{su|p=7|b=3}}Li + {{su|p=1|b=1}}p \u2192 2 {{su|p=4|b=2}}He}}), verifying Einstein's formula to an accuracy of \u00b10.5%.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\nIn 2005, Rainville et al. published a direct test of the energy-equivalence of mass lost in the binding energy of a neutron to atoms of particular isotopes of silicon and sulfur, by comparing the mass lost to the energy of the emitted gamma ray associated with the neutron capture.

By measuring the mass of different [[atomic nuclei]] and subtracting from that number the total mass of the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] as they would weigh separately, one gets the exact [[binding energy]] available in an [[atomic nucleus]]. This is used to calculate the energy released in any [[nuclear reaction]], as the difference in the total mass of the nuclei that enter and exit the reaction.\n\n==Practical examples==\nEinstein used the [[Centimeter gram second system of units|CGS]] system of units (centimeters, grams, seconds, dynes, and ergs), but the formula is independent of the system of units.

For instance, the \"[[Fat Man|Gadget]]\"-style bomb used in the [[Trinity test]] and the [[bombing of Nagasaki]] had an explosive yield equivalent to 21&nbsp;kt of TNT. About 1&nbsp;kg of the approximately 6.15&nbsp;kg of plutonium in each of these bombs fissioned into lighter elements totaling almost exactly one gram less, after cooling. The electromagnetic radiation and kinetic energy (thermal and blast energy) released in this explosion carried the missing one gram of mass.<ref>The 6.2&nbsp;kg core comprised 0.8% gallium by weight. Also, about 20% of the Gadget's yield was due to fast fissioning in its natural uranium tamper. This resulted in 4.1&nbsp;moles of plutonium fissioning with 180&nbsp;MeV per atom actually contributing prompt kinetic energy to the explosion. Note too that the term ''\"Gadget\"-style'' is used here instead of \"Fat Man\" because this general design of bomb was very rapidly upgraded to a more efficient one requiring only 5&nbsp;kg of the plutonium\u2013gallium alloy.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> This occurs because nuclear [[binding energy]] is released whenever elements with more than 62 nucleons fission.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAnother example is [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generation]]. The electrical energy produced by [[Grand Coulee Dam]]'s [[Water turbine|turbines]] every 3.7&nbsp;hours represents one gram of mass. This mass passes to electrical devices (such as lights in cities) powered by the generators, where it appears as a gram of heat and light.<ref>Assuming the dam is generating at its peak capacity of 6,809&nbsp;MW.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> Turbine designers look at their equations in terms of pressure, torque, and RPM. However, Einstein's equations show that all energy has mass, and thus the electrical energy produced by a dam's generators, and the resulting heat and light, all retain their mass\u2014which is equivalent to the energy. The potential energy\u2014and equivalent mass\u2014represented by the waters of the [[Columbia River]] as it descends to the Pacific Ocean would be converted to heat due to [[viscous friction]] and the [[turbulence]] of white water rapids and waterfalls were it not for the dam and its generators. This heat would remain as mass on site at the water, were it not for the equipment that converted some of this potential and kinetic energy into electrical energy, which can move from place to place (taking mass with it).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nWhenever energy is added to a system, the system gains mass, as shown when the equation is rearranged:\n* A spring's mass increases whenever it is put into compression or tension. Its added mass arises from the added potential energy stored within it, which is bound in the stretched chemical (electron) bonds linking the atoms within the spring.\n* Raising the temperature of an object (increasing its heat energy) increases its mass. For example, consider the world's primary mass standard for the kilogram, made of platinum/iridium. If its temperature is allowed to change by 1&nbsp;\u00b0C, its mass changes by 1.5 picograms (1&nbsp;pg = {{val|1|e=-12|u=g}}).<ref>Assuming a 90/10 alloy of Pt/Ir by weight, a {{math|''C<sub>p</sub>''}} of 25.9 for Pt and 25.1 for Ir, a Pt-dominated average {{math|''C<sub>p</sub>''}} of 25.8, 5.134&nbsp;moles of metal, and 132&nbsp;J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> for the prototype.

Its increase of mass is exactly the equivalent of the mass of energy of rotation, which is itself the sum of the kinetic energies of all the moving parts of the ball. For example, [[the Earth]] itself is more massive due to its rotation, than it would be with no rotation. This [[rotational energy]] ({{val|2.14|e=29|u=J}}) represents 2.38 billion metric tons of added mass.<ref>InfraNet Lab (2008-12-07). Harnessing the Energy from the Earth's Rotation.

Mass/energy simply moves from one place to another. These are some examples of the ''transfer'' of energy and mass in accordance with the ''principle of mass\u2013energy conservation''.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Efficiency==\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2019}}\nAlthough mass cannot be converted to energy,<ref name=\"A. Wheeler, 1992. pp. 248\"/> in some reactions matter particles (which contain a form of rest energy) can be destroyed and the energy released can be converted to other types of energy that are more usable and obvious as forms of energy\u2014such as light and energy of motion (heat, etc.). However, the total amount of energy and mass does not change in such a transformation. Even when particles are not destroyed, a certain fraction of the ill-defined \"matter\" in ordinary objects can be destroyed, and its associated energy liberated and made available as the more dramatic energies of light and heat, even though no identifiable real particles are destroyed, and even though (again) the total energy is unchanged (as also the total mass). Such conversions between types of energy (resting to active energy) happen in nuclear weapons, in which the protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei lose a small fraction of their average mass, but this mass loss is not due to the destruction of any protons or neutrons (or even, in general, lighter particles like electrons). Also the mass is not destroyed, but simply removed from the system in the form of heat and light from the reaction.\n\nIn nuclear reactions, typically only a small fraction of the total mass\u2013energy of the bomb converts into the mass\u2013energy of heat, light, radiation, and motion\u2014which are \"active\" forms that can be used. When an atom fissions, it loses only about 0.1% of its mass (which escapes from the system and does not disappear), and additionally, in a bomb or reactor not all the atoms can fission. In a modern fission-based atomic bomb, the efficiency is only about 40%, so only 40% of the fissionable atoms actually fission, and only about 0.03% of the fissile core mass appears as energy in the end. In nuclear fusion, more of the mass is released as usable energy, roughly 0.3%. But in a fusion bomb, the bomb mass is partly casing and non-reacting components, so that in practicality, again (coincidentally) no more than about 0.03% of the total mass of the entire weapon is released as usable energy (which, again, retains the \"missing\" mass). See [[nuclear weapon yield]] for practical details of this ratio in modern nuclear weapons.\n\nIn theory, it should be possible to destroy matter and convert all of the rest-energy associated with matter into heat and light (which would of course have the same mass), but none of the theoretically known methods are practical. One way to convert all the energy within matter into usable energy is to annihilate matter with [[antimatter]]. But [[baryon asymmetry|antimatter is rare in our universe]], and must be made first. Due to inefficient mechanisms of production, making antimatter always requires far more usable energy than would be released when it was annihilated.\n\nSince most of the mass of ordinary objects resides in protons and neutrons, converting all the energy of ordinary matter into more useful energy requires that the protons and neutrons be converted to lighter particles, or particles with no rest-mass at all. In the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the [[baryon number|number of protons plus neutrons]] is nearly exactly conserved. Still, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] showed that there is a process that converts protons and neutrons to antielectrons and neutrinos.<ref>G. 't Hooft, \"Computation of the quantum effects due to a four-dimensional pseudoparticle\", Physical Review D14:3432\u20133450 (1976).</ref> This is the weak SU(2) [[instanton]] proposed by Belavin Polyakov Schwarz and Tyupkin.<ref>A. Belavin, A. M. Polyakov, A. Schwarz, Yu. Tyupkin, \"Pseudoparticle Solutions to Yang Mills Equations\", Physics Letters 59B:85 (1975).</ref> This process, can in principle destroy matter and convert all the energy of matter into neutrinos and usable energy, but it is normally extraordinarily slow. Later it became clear that this process happens at a fast rate at very high temperatures,<ref>F. Klinkhammer, [[Nicholas Manton|N. Manton]], \"A Saddle Point Solution in the Weinberg Salam Theory\", Physical Review D 30:2212.</ref> since then, instanton-like configurations are copiously produced from [[statistical mechanics|thermal fluctuations]]. The temperature required is so high that it would only have been reached shortly after the [[Big Bang]].\n\nMany extensions of the standard model contain [[magnetic monopole]]s, and in some models of [[grand unification theory|grand unification]], these monopoles catalyze [[proton decay]], a process known as the [[Callan-Rubakov effect]].<ref>Rubakov V. A. \"Monopole Catalysis of Proton Decay\", Reports on Progress in Physics 51:189\u2013241 (1988).</ref> This process would be an efficient mass\u2013energy conversion at ordinary temperatures, but it requires making [[Magnetic monopole|monopoles]] and anti-monopoles first. The energy required to produce monopoles is believed to be enormous, but magnetic charge is conserved, so that the lightest monopole is stable. All these properties are deduced in theoretical models\u2014magnetic monopoles have never been observed, nor have they been produced in any experiment so far.\n\nA third known method of total matter\u2013energy \"conversion\" (which again in practice only means conversion of one type of energy into a different type of energy), is using gravity, specifically black holes. [[Stephen Hawking]] theorized<ref>S.W. Hawking \"Black Holes Explosions?\" ''Nature'' 248:30 (1974).</ref> that black holes radiate thermally with no regard to how they are formed. So, it is theoretically possible to throw matter into a black hole and use the emitted heat to generate power. According to the theory of [[Hawking radiation]], however, the black hole used radiates at a higher rate the smaller it is, producing usable powers at only small black hole masses, where usable may for example be something greater than the local background radiation. It is also worth noting that the ambient irradiated power would change with the mass of the black hole, increasing as the mass of the black hole decreases, or decreasing as the mass increases, at a rate where power is proportional to the inverse square of the mass. In a \"practical\" scenario, mass and energy could be dumped into the black hole to regulate this growth, or keep its size, and thus power output, near constant. This could result from the fact that mass and energy are lost from the hole with its thermal radiation.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Mass\u2013velocity relationship===\nIn developing [[special relativity]], Einstein found that the [[kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy]] of a moving body is\n:<math>E_k =  m_0 c^2( \\gamma -1 ) = m_0 c^2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - 1\\right),</math>\n\nwith {{math|''v''}} the [[velocity]], {{math|''m''{{sub|0}}}} the rest mass, and {{math|''\u03b3''}} the [[Lorentz factor]].\n\nHe included the second term on the right to make sure that for small velocities the energy would be the same as in classical mechanics, thus satisfying the [[correspondence principle]]:\n:<math>E_k = \\frac{1}{2}m_0 v^2 + \\cdots </math>\n\nWithout this second term, there would be an additional contribution in the energy when the particle is not moving.\n\nEinstein found that the [[Momentum#Modern definitions of momentum|total momentum]] of a moving particle is:\n:<math>P = \\frac{m_0 v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}. </math>\n\nIt is this quantity that is conserved in collisions. The ratio of the momentum to the velocity is the [[relativistic mass]], {{mvar|m}}.\n:<math>m = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}</math>\n\nAnd the relativistic mass and the relativistic kinetic energy are related by the formula:\n:<math>E_k = m c^2 - m_0 c^2. \\,</math>\n\nEinstein wanted to omit the unnatural second term on the right-hand side, whose only purpose is to make the energy at rest zero, and to declare that the particle has a total energy, which obeys:\n:<math> E = m c^2 \\,</math>\n\nwhich is a sum of the rest energy {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} and the kinetic energy. This total energy is mathematically more elegant, and fits better with the momentum in relativity. But to come to this conclusion, Einstein needed to think carefully about collisions. This expression for the energy implied that matter at rest has a huge amount of energy, and it is not clear whether this energy is physically real, or just a mathematical artifact with no physical meaning.\n\nIn a collision process where all the rest-masses are the same at the beginning as at the end, either expression for the energy is conserved. The two expressions only differ by a constant that is the same at the beginning and at the end of the collision. Still, by analyzing the situation where particles are thrown off a heavy central particle, it is easy to see that the inertia of the central particle is reduced by the total energy emitted. This allowed Einstein to conclude that the inertia of a heavy particle is increased or diminished according to the energy it absorbs or emits.\n\n===Relativistic mass===\n{{Main|Mass in special relativity}}\n\nAfter Einstein first made his proposal, it became clear that the word mass can have two different meanings. Some denote the ''relativistic mass'' with an explicit index:\n:<math>m_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} .</math>\n\nThis mass is the ratio of momentum to velocity, and it is also the relativistic energy divided by {{math|1=''c''<sup>2</sup>}} (it is not Lorentz-invariant, in contrast to <math>m_0</math>). The equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''<sub>rel</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} holds for moving objects. When the velocity is small, the relativistic mass and the rest mass are almost exactly the same.\n* {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} either means {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} for an object at rest, or {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''<sub>rel</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} when the object is moving.\n\nAlso Einstein (following [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Max Abraham]]) used velocity- and direction-dependent mass concepts ([[Mass in special relativity#Early developments: transverse and longitudinal mass|longitudinal and transverse mass]]) in his 1905 electrodynamics paper and in another paper in 1906.<ref>{{Citation | author=Einstein, A. | date=1905 | title=Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=17 | pages=891\u2013921 | doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004 | url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_17_891-921.pdf | bibcode=1905AnP...322..891E | issue=10 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227120546/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_17_891-921.pdf | archivedate=2008-02-27 }}.

For example, one view is that only rest mass is a viable concept and is a property of the particle; while relativistic mass is a conglomeration of particle properties and properties of spacetime. A perspective that avoids this debate, due to Kjell V\u00f8yenli, is that the Newtonian concept of mass as a particle property and the relativistic concept of mass have to be viewed as embedded in their own theories and as having no precise connection.<ref name=\"Jammer\">{{Citation |title=Concepts of mass in contemporary physics and philosophy |author=Max Jammer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jujK1bn4QUQC&pg=PA51 |page=51 |isbn=0-691-01017-X |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1999 }}</ref><ref name=\"V\u00f8yenli\">\n\n{{Citation |journal=Foundations of Physics |doi=10.1007/BF00708670 |title= The classical and relativistic concepts of mass |date=1976 |author1= Eriksen, Erik |author2=V\u00f8yenli, Kjell |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=115\u2013124 |publisher=Springer |bibcode=1976FoPh....6..115E}}</ref>\n\n===Low speed expansion===\nWe can rewrite the expression {{math|1=''E'' = ''\u03b3m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} as a [[Taylor series]]:\n:<math>E = m_0 c^2 \\left[1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{8} \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^4 + \\frac{5}{16} \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^6 + \\ldots \\right]. </math>\n\nFor speeds much smaller than the speed of light, higher-order terms in this expression get smaller and smaller because {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} is small. For low speeds we can ignore all but the first two terms:\n:<math>E \\approx m_0 c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_0 v^2 . </math>\n\nThe total energy is a sum of the rest energy and the [[classical mechanics|Newtonian]] [[kinetic energy]].\n\nThe classical energy equation ignores both the {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} part, and the high-speed corrections. This is appropriate, because all the high-order corrections are small. Since only ''changes'' in energy affect the behavior of objects, whether we include the {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} part makes no difference, since it is constant. For the same reason, it is possible to subtract the rest energy from the total energy in relativity. By considering the emission of energy in different frames, Einstein could show that the rest energy has a real physical meaning.\n\nThe higher-order terms are extra corrections to Newtonian mechanics, and become important at higher speeds. The Newtonian equation is only a low-speed approximation, but an extraordinarily good one. All of the calculations used in putting astronauts on the moon, for example, could have been done using Newton's equations without any of the higher-order corrections.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\nThe total mass energy equivalence should also include the rotational and vibrational kinetic energies as well as the linear kinetic energy at low speeds.\n\n==History==\nWhile Einstein was the first to have correctly deduced the mass\u2013energy equivalence formula, he was not the first to have related energy with mass.

Lorentz (1904) gave the following expressions for longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic mass:\n:<math>m_{L}=\\frac{m_{0}}{\\left(\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\\right)^{3}},\\quad m_{T}=\\frac{m_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} </math>,\n\nwhere\n:<math>m_{0}=\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{E_{em}}{c^{2}}</math>\n\n===Radiation pressure and inertia===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic mass#Inertia of energy and radiation paradoxes}}\nAnother way of deriving some sort of electromagnetic mass was based on the concept of [[radiation pressure]].

(Here, \"radiation\" means [[electromagnetic radiation]], or light, and mass means the ordinary Newtonian mass of a slow-moving object.) This formulation relates only a change {{math|\u0394''m''}} in mass to a change {{mvar|L}} in energy without requiring the absolute relationship.\n\nObjects with zero mass presumably have zero energy, so the extension that all mass is proportional to energy is obvious from this result. In 1905, even the hypothesis that changes in energy are accompanied by changes in mass was untested. Not until the discovery of the first type of antimatter (the [[positron]] in 1932) was it found that all of the mass of pairs of resting particles could be converted to radiation.\n\n====The first derivation by Einstein (1905)====\nAlready in his relativity paper \"On the electrodynamics of moving bodies\", Einstein derived the correct expression for the kinetic energy of particles:\n:<math>E_{k}=mc^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}-1\\right)</math>.\n\nNow the question remained open as to which formulation applies to bodies at rest. This was tackled by Einstein in his paper \"Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?\", where he used a body emitting two light pulses in opposite directions, having energies of {{math|''E''<sub>0</sub>}} before and {{math|''E''<sub>1</sub>}} after the emission as seen in its rest frame. As seen from a moving frame, this becomes {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''H''<sub>1</sub>}}.

If the body is examined in a frame moving with nonrelativistic velocity {{mvar|v}}, it is no longer at rest and in the moving frame it has momentum {{math|1=''P'' = ''Mv''}}. Then he supposed the body emits two pulses of light to the left and to the right, each carrying an equal amount of energy {{math|{{sfrac|''E''|2}}}}. In its rest frame, the object remains at rest after the emission since the two beams are equal in strength and carry opposite momentum.\n\nHowever, if the same process is considered in a frame that moves with velocity {{math|''v''}} to the left, the pulse moving to the left is [[redshift]]ed, while the pulse moving to the right is [[blue shift]]ed. The blue light carries more momentum than the red light, so that the momentum of the light in the moving frame is not balanced: the light is carrying some net momentum to the right.\n\nThe object has not changed its velocity before or after the emission. Yet in this frame it has lost some right-momentum to the light. The only way it could have lost momentum is by losing mass. This also solves Poincar\u00e9's radiation paradox, discussed above.\n\nThe velocity is small, so the right-moving light is blueshifted by an amount equal to the nonrelativistic [[Doppler shift]] factor {{math|1 \u2212 {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}}. The momentum of the light is its energy divided by {{mvar|c}}, and it is increased by a factor of {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}}. So the right-moving light is carrying an extra momentum {{math|\u0394''P''}} given by:\n:<math> \\Delta P = {v \\over c}{E \\over 2c} .</math>\n\nThe left-moving light carries a little less momentum, by the same amount {{math|\u0394''P''}}. So the total right-momentum in the light is twice {{math|\u0394''P''}}. This is the right-momentum that the object lost.\n:<math> 2\\Delta P = v {E\\over c^2} .</math>\n\nThe momentum of the object in the moving frame after the emission is reduced to this amount:\n:<math> P' = Mv - 2\\Delta P = \\left(M - {E\\over c^2}\\right)v .</math>\n\nSo the change in the object's mass is equal to the total energy lost divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. Since any emission of energy can be carried out by a two step process, where first the energy is emitted as light and then the light is converted to some other form of energy, any emission of energy is accompanied by a loss of mass. Similarly, by considering absorption, a gain in energy is accompanied by a gain in mass.\n\n====Relativistic center-of-mass theorem (1906)====\nLike Poincar\u00e9, Einstein concluded in 1906 that the inertia of electromagnetic energy is a necessary condition for the center-of-mass theorem to hold. On this occasion, Einstein referred to Poincar\u00e9's 1900 paper and wrote:<ref>{{Citation|author=Einstein, A. |date=1906 |title=Das Prinzip von der Erhaltung der Schwerpunktsbewegung und die Tr\u00e4gheit der Energie |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=20 |pages=627\u2013633 |doi=10.1002/andp.19063250814 |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1906_20_627-633.pdf |bibcode=1906AnP...325..627E |issue=8 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318060830/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1906_20_627-633.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-18 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Although the merely formal considerations, which we will need for the proof, are already mostly contained in a work by H.

However, it raised the question where this energy is coming from. After eliminating the idea of absorption and emission of some sort of [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Lesagian ether particles]], the existence of a huge amount of latent energy, stored within matter, was proposed by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] in 1903. Rutherford also suggested that this internal energy is stored within normal matter as well. He went on to speculate in 1904:<ref>{{Citation|last=Rutherford|first= Ernest |date=1904|title=Radioactivity |publisher=University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=336\u2013338|url=https://archive.org/details/radioactivity00ruthrich}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Heisenberg|first= Werner |date=1958|title=Physics And Philosophy: The Revolution In Modern Science |publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|pages=118\u2013119|url=https://archive.org/details/physicsandphilos010613mbp}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|If it were ever found possible to control at will the rate of disintegration of the radio-elements, an enormous amount of energy could be obtained from a small quantity of matter.}}\n\nEinstein's equation is in no way an explanation of the large energies released in radioactive decay (this comes from the powerful [[nuclear force]]s involved; forces that were still unknown in 1905). In any case, the enormous energy released from radioactive decay (which had been measured by Rutherford) was much more easily measured than the (still small) change in the gross mass of materials as a result. Einstein's equation, by theory, can give these energies by measuring mass differences before and after reactions, but in practice, these mass differences in 1905 were still too small to be measured in bulk. Prior to this, the ease of measuring radioactive decay energies with a calorimeter was thought possibly likely to allow measurement of changes in mass difference, as a check on Einstein's equation itself. Einstein mentions in his 1905 paper that mass\u2013energy equivalence might perhaps be tested with radioactive decay, which releases enough energy (the quantitative amount known roughly by 1905) to possibly be \"weighed,\" when missing from the system (having been given off as heat). However, radioactivity seemed to proceed at its own unalterable (and quite slow, for radioactives known then) pace, and even when simple nuclear reactions became possible using proton bombardment, the idea that these great amounts of usable energy could be liberated at will with any practicality, proved difficult to substantiate. Rutherford was reported in 1933 to have declared that this energy could not be exploited efficiently: \"Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of the atom is talking [[moonshine]].\"<ref>\"We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.\" [http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/ ''The Times'' archives], September 12, 1933, \"The British association\u2014breaking down the atom\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Einstein - Time Magazine - July 1, 1946.jpg|right|thumb|The popular connection between Einstein, {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}, and the [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] was prominently indicated on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in July 1946 by the writing of the equation on the [[mushroom cloud]].]]\n\nThis situation changed dramatically in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron and its mass, allowing mass differences for single [[nuclide]]s and their reactions to be calculated directly, and compared with the sum of masses for the particles that made up their composition. In 1933, the energy released from the reaction of lithium-7 plus protons giving rise to 2 alpha particles (as noted above by Rutherford), allowed Einstein's equation to be tested to an error of \u00b10.5%. However, scientists still did not see such reactions as a practical source of power, due to the energy cost of accelerating reaction particles.\n\nAfter the very public demonstration of huge energies released from [[nuclear fission]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945, the equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} became directly linked in the public eye with the power and peril of [[nuclear weapon]]s. The equation was featured as early as page 2 of the [[Smyth Report]], the official 1945 release by the US government on the development of the atomic bomb, and by 1946 the equation was linked closely enough with Einstein's work that the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine prominently featured a picture of Einstein next to an image of a [[mushroom cloud]] emblazoned with the equation.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19460701,00.html Cover.] ''Time'' magazine, July 1, 1946.</ref> Einstein himself had only a minor role in the [[Manhattan Project]]: he had [[Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter|cosigned a letter]] to the U.S. President in 1939 urging funding for research into atomic energy, warning that an atomic bomb was theoretically possible. The letter persuaded Roosevelt to devote a significant portion of the wartime budget to atomic research. Without a security clearance, Einstein's only scientific contribution was an analysis of an [[isotope separation]] method in theoretical terms. It was inconsequential, on account of Einstein not being given sufficient information (for security reasons) to fully work on the problem.<ref>Isaacson, ''Einstein: His Life and Universe''.</ref>\n\nWhile {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} is useful for understanding the amount of energy potentially released in a fission reaction, it was not strictly necessary to develop the weapon, once the fission process was known, and its energy measured at 200&nbsp;MeV (which was directly possible, using a quantitative Geiger counter, at that time). As the physicist and Manhattan Project participant [[Robert Serber]] put it: \"Somehow the popular notion took hold long ago that Einstein's theory of relativity, in particular his famous equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}, plays some essential role in the theory of fission. Albert Einstein had a part in alerting the United States government to the possibility of building an atomic bomb, but his theory of relativity is not required in discussing fission. The theory of fission is what physicists call a non-relativistic theory, meaning that relativistic effects are too small to affect the dynamics of the fission process significantly.\"<ref>Robert Serber, ''The Los Alamos Primer: The First Lectures on How to Build an Atomic Bomb'' (University of California Press, 1992), page 7.

In late 1938, [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch]]\u2014while on a winter walk during which they solved the meaning of Hahn's experimental results and introduced the idea that would be called atomic fission\u2014directly used Einstein's equation to help them understand the quantitative energetics of the reaction that overcame the \"surface tension-like\" forces that hold the nucleus together, and allowed the fission fragments to separate to a configuration from which their charges could force them into an energetic ''fission''. To do this, they used ''packing fraction'', or nuclear [[binding energy]] values for elements, which Meitner had memorized. These, together with use of {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} allowed them to realize on the spot that the basic fission process was energetically possible:\n\n<blockquote> ...We walked up and down in the snow, I on skis and she on foot. ...and gradually the idea took shape... explained by Bohr's idea that the nucleus is like a liquid drop; such a drop might elongate and divide itself... We knew there were strong forces that would resist, ..just as surface tension. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops. At this point we both sat down on a tree trunk and started to calculate on scraps of paper. ...the Uranium nucleus might indeed be a very wobbly, unstable drop, ready to divide itself... But, ...when the two drops separated they would be driven apart by electrical repulsion, about 200 MeV in all. Fortunately Lise Meitner remembered how to compute the masses of nuclei... and worked out that the two nuclei formed... would be lighter by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}, and... the mass was just equivalent to 200 MeV; it all fitted!<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/dtrapp/people/Meitnerium.html A quote from Frisch about the discovery day.

Similarly, anything having energy exhibits a corresponding mass {{math|''m''}} given by its energy {{math|''E''}} divided by the speed of light squared {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. Because the speed of light is a large number in everyday units, the formula implies that even an everyday object at rest with a modest amount of mass has a very large amount of energy intrinsically. [[Chemical reaction]]s, [[nuclear reaction]]s, and other [[energy transformation]]s may cause a [[Physical system|system]] to lose some of its energy content to the environment (and thus some corresponding mass), releasing it as the [[radiant energy]] of [[light]] or as [[thermal energy]] for example.\n\nMass\u2013energy equivalence arose originally from [[special relativity]] as a paradox described by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]].<ref name=action>{{Citation\n| author=Poincar\u00e9, H. | year=1900 | title=La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action | journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles | volume =5  | pages =252\u2013278| title-link=s:fr:La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action }}.

The ''rest'' energy (equivalently, rest mass) of a particle can be converted, not \"to energy\" (it already ''is'' energy (mass)), but rather to ''other'' forms of energy (mass) that require motion, such as [[kinetic energy]], [[thermal energy]], or [[radiant energy]]. Similarly, kinetic or radiant energy can be converted to other kinds of particles that have rest energy (rest mass).  In the transformation process, neither the total amount of mass nor the total amount of energy changes, since both properties are connected via a simple constant.<ref>In F. Fernflores.

Its momentum and energy continue to increase without bounds, whereas its speed approaches (but never reaches) a constant value\u2014the speed of light. This implies that in relativity the momentum of an object cannot be a constant times the [[velocity]], nor can the [[Kinetic energy#Kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy]] be a constant times the square of the velocity.\n\nA property called the [[relativistic mass]] is defined as the ratio of the momentum of an object to its velocity.<ref>Note that the relativistic mass, in contrast to the rest mass {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>}}, is not a relativistic invariant, and that the velocity <math>\\,v=dx^{(4)}/dt</math> is not a Minkowski four-vector, in contrast to the quantity <math>\\tilde v=dx^{(4)}/d\\tau</math>, where <math> d\\tau =dt\\cdot\\sqrt{1-(v^2/c^2)}</math> is the differential of the [[proper time]]. However, the energy\u2013momentum four-vector <math> p^{(4)}=m_0\\cdot dx^{(4)}/d\\tau</math> is a genuine Minkowski four-vector, and the intrinsic origin of the square root in the definition of the relativistic mass is the distinction between {{mvar|d\u03c4}} and {{mvar|dt}}.</ref> Relativistic mass depends on the motion of the object, so that different observers in relative motion see different values for it. If the object is moving slowly, the relativistic mass is nearly equal to the [[rest mass]] and both are nearly equal to the usual Newtonian mass. If the object is moving quickly, the relativistic mass is greater than the rest mass by an amount equal to the mass associated with the [[kinetic energy]] of the object. As the object approaches the speed of light, the relativistic mass grows infinitely, because the kinetic energy grows infinitely and this energy is associated with mass.\n\nThe relativistic mass is always equal to the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic energy) divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref name=\"tipler\">{{citation |title=Modern Physics |author1=Paul Allen Tipler |author2=Ralph A.

Freeman and Company |date=January 2003}}</ref> Because the relativistic mass is exactly proportional to the energy, relativistic mass and relativistic energy are nearly synonyms; the only difference between them is the [[unit of measurement|units]]. If length and time are measured in [[natural units]], the speed of light is equal to 1, and even this difference disappears. Then mass and energy have the same units and are always equal, so it is redundant to speak about relativistic mass, because it is just another name for the energy. This is why physicists usually reserve the useful short word \"mass\" to mean rest mass, or [[invariant mass]], and not relativistic mass.\n\nThe relativistic mass of a moving object is larger than the relativistic mass of an object that is not moving, because a moving object has extra kinetic energy. The ''rest mass'' of an object is defined as the mass of an object when it is at rest, so that the rest mass is always the same, independent of the motion of the observer: it is the same in all [[inertial frame]]s.\n\nFor things and systems made up of many parts, like an [[atomic nucleus]], [[planet]], or [[star]], the relativistic mass is the sum of the relativistic masses (or energies) of the parts, because energies are additive in isolated systems. This is not true in open systems, however, if energy is subtracted. For example, if a system is [[Binding energy#Mass-energy relation|''bound'']] by attractive forces, and the energy gained due to the forces of attraction in excess of the work done is removed from the system, then mass is lost with this removed energy. For example, the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the total mass of the protons and neutrons that make it up, but this is only true after this energy from binding has been removed in the form of a gamma ray (which in this system, carries away the mass of the energy of binding). This mass decrease is also equivalent to the energy required to break up the nucleus into individual protons and neutrons (in this case, work and mass would need to be supplied). Similarly, the mass of the solar system is slightly less than the sum of the individual masses of the sun and planets.\n\nFor a system of particles going off in different directions, the [[invariant mass]] of the system is the analog of the rest mass, and is the same for all observers, even those in relative motion. It is defined as the total energy (divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}) in the [[center of mass frame]] (where by definition, the system total momentum is zero). A simple example of an object with moving parts but zero total momentum is a container of gas. In this case, the mass of the container is given by its total energy (including the kinetic energy of the gas molecules), since the system total energy and invariant mass are the same in any reference frame where the momentum is zero, and such a reference frame is also the only frame in which the object can be weighed. In a similar way, the theory of special relativity posits that the thermal energy in all objects (including solids) contributes to their total masses and weights, even though this energy is present as the kinetic and potential energies of the atoms in the object, and it (in a similar way to the gas) is not seen in the rest masses of the atoms that make up the object.\n\nIn a similar manner, even photons (light quanta), if trapped in a container space (as a [[photon gas]] or [[thermal radiation]]), would contribute a mass associated with their energy to the container. Such an extra mass, in theory, could be weighed in the same way as any other type of rest mass. This is true in special relativity theory, even though individually photons have no rest mass. The property that trapped energy ''in any form'' adds weighable mass to systems that have no net momentum is one of the characteristic and notable consequences of relativity. It has no counterpart in classical Newtonian physics, in which radiation, light, heat, and kinetic energy never exhibit weighable mass under any circumstances.\n\nJust as the relativistic mass of an isolated system is conserved through time, so also is its invariant mass.This property allows the conservation of all types of mass in systems, and also conservation of all types of mass in reactions where matter is destroyed (annihilated), leaving behind the energy that was associated with it (which is now in non-material form, rather than material form). Matter may appear and disappear in various reactions, but mass and energy are both unchanged in this process.\n\n==Applicability of the strict formula==\n\nAs is noted above, two different definitions of mass have been used in special relativity, and also two different definitions of energy. The simple equation <math>E = mc^2</math> is not generally applicable to all these types of mass and energy, except in the special  case that the total additive momentum is zero for the system under consideration. In such a case, which is always guaranteed when observing the system from either its [[center of mass frame]] or its [[center of momentum frame]], <math>E = mc^2</math> is always true for any type of mass and energy that are chosen. Thus, for example, in the center of mass frame, the total energy of an object or system is equal to its rest mass times <math>c^2</math>, a useful equality. This is the relationship used for the container of gas in the previous example. It is ''not'' true in other reference frames where the center of mass is in motion. In these systems or for such an object, its total energy depends on both its rest (or invariant) mass, and its (total) momentum.<ref>Relativity DeMystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145545-0}}</ref>\n\nIn inertial reference frames other than the rest frame or center of mass frame, the equation <math>E = mc^2</math> remains true if the energy is the relativistic energy ''and'' the mass is the relativistic mass. It is also correct if the energy is the rest or invariant energy (also the minimum energy), ''and'' the mass is the rest mass, or the invariant mass. However, connection of the '''total or relativistic energy''' (<math>E_r</math>) with the '''rest or invariant mass''' (<math>m_0</math>) requires consideration of the system's total momentum, in systems and reference frames where the total momentum (of [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude]] {{math|''p''}}) has a non-zero value. The formula then required to connect the two different kinds of mass and energy, is the extended version of Einstein's equation, called the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]:<ref>Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, A.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01460-8}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  E_r^2 - |\\vec{p} \\,|^2 c^2 &= m_0^2 c^4 \\\\\n              E_r^2 - (pc)^2 &= (m_0 c^2)^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>E_r = \\sqrt{ (m_0 c^2)^2 + (pc)^2 } \\,\\!</math>\n\nHere the <math>(pc)^2</math> term represents the square of the [[Euclidean norm]] (total vector length) of the various momentum vectors in the system, which reduces to the square of the simple momentum magnitude, if only a single particle is considered. This equation reduces to <math>E = mc^2</math> when the momentum term is zero. For photons where <math>m_0 = 0</math>, the equation reduces to <math>E_r = pc</math>.\n\n==Meanings of the strict formula==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2016}}\n[[File:E equals m plus c square at Taipei101.jpg|thumb|right|The mass\u2013energy equivalence formula was displayed on [[Taipei 101]] during the event of the [[World Year of Physics 2005]].]]\n\nMass\u2013energy equivalence states that any object has a certain energy, even when it is stationary. In [[Newtonian mechanics]], a motionless body has no [[kinetic energy]], and it may or may not have other amounts of internal stored energy, like [[chemical energy]] or [[thermal energy]], in addition to any [[potential energy]] it may have from its position in a [[field (physics)|field of force]]. In Newtonian mechanics, all of these energies are much smaller than the mass of the object times the speed of light squared.\n\nIn relativity, all the energy that moves with an object (that is, all the energy present in the object's rest frame) contributes to the total mass of the body, which measures how much it resists acceleration. Each bit of potential and kinetic energy makes a proportional contribution to the mass. As noted above, even if a box of ideal mirrors \"contains\" light, then the individually massless photons still contribute to the total mass of the box, by the amount of their energy divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |title=Mechanics\n |edition=2\n |first1=H.

In a nuclear reaction, the mass of the atoms that come out is less than the mass of the atoms that go in, and the difference in mass shows up as heat and light with the same relativistic mass as the difference (and also the same [[invariant mass]] in the center of mass frame of the system). In this case, the {{mvar|E}} in the formula is the energy released and removed, and the mass {{mvar|m}} is how much the mass decreases. In the same way, when any sort of energy is added to an isolated system, the increase in the mass is equal to the added energy divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. For example, when water is heated it gains about {{val|1.11|e=-17|u=kg}} of mass for every joule of heat added to the water.\n\nAn object moves with different speed in different frames, depending on the motion of the observer, so the kinetic energy in both Newtonian mechanics and relativity is ''frame dependent''. This means that the amount of relativistic energy, and therefore the amount of relativistic mass, that an object is measured to have depends on the observer. The ''rest mass'' is defined as the mass that an object has when it is not moving (or when an inertial frame is chosen such that it is not moving). The term also applies to the invariant mass of systems when the system as a whole is not \"moving\" (has no net momentum). The rest and invariant masses are the smallest possible value of the mass of the object or system. They also are conserved quantities, so long as the system is isolated. Because of the way they are calculated, the effects of moving observers are subtracted, so these quantities do not change with the motion of the observer.\n\nThe rest mass is almost never additive: the rest mass of an object is not the sum of the rest masses of its parts. The rest mass of an object is the total energy of all the parts, including kinetic energy, as measured by an observer that sees the center of the mass of the object to be standing still. The rest mass adds up only if the parts are standing still and do not attract or repel, so that they do not have any extra kinetic or potential energy. The other possibility is that they have a positive kinetic energy and a negative potential energy that exactly cancels.\n\n===Binding energy and the \"mass defect\"===\n{{main|Binding energy|Mass defect}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\n\nWhenever any type of energy is removed from a system, the mass associated with the energy is also removed, and the system therefore loses mass. This mass defect in the system may be simply calculated as {{math|1=\u0394''m'' = {{sfrac|\u0394''E''|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}}}, and this was the form of the equation historically first presented by Einstein in 1905. However, use of this formula in such circumstances has led to the false idea that mass has been \"converted\" to energy. This may be particularly the case when the energy (and mass) removed from the system is associated with the ''binding energy'' of the system. In such cases, the binding energy is observed as a \"mass defect\" or deficit in the new system.\n\nThe fact that the released energy is not easily weighed in many such cases, may cause its mass to be neglected as though it no longer existed. This circumstance has encouraged the false idea of conversion of ''mass'' to energy, rather than the correct idea that the binding energy of such systems is relatively large, and exhibits a measurable mass, which is removed when the binding energy is removed. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.\n\nThe difference between the rest mass of a bound system and of the unbound parts is the [[binding energy]] of the system, if this energy has been removed after binding. For example, a water molecule weighs a little less than two free hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. The minuscule mass difference is the energy needed to split the molecule into three individual atoms (divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}), which was given off as heat when the molecule formed (this heat had mass). Likewise, a stick of dynamite in theory weighs a little bit more than the fragments after the explosion, but this is true only so long as the fragments are cooled and the heat removed. In this case the mass difference is the energy/heat that is released when the dynamite explodes, and when this heat escapes, the mass associated with it escapes, only to be deposited in the surroundings, which absorb the heat (so that total mass is conserved).\n\nSuch a change in mass may only happen when the system is open, and the energy and mass escapes. Thus, if a stick of dynamite is blown up in a hermetically sealed chamber, the mass of the chamber and fragments, the heat, sound, and light would still be equal to the original mass of the chamber and dynamite. If sitting on a scale, the weight and mass would not change. This would in theory also happen even with a nuclear bomb, if it could be kept in an ideal box of infinite strength, which did not rupture or pass radiation.<ref name=\"A. Wheeler, 1992. pp. 248\"/> Thus, a 21.5&nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|kiloton]] ({{val|9|e=13|u=joule}}) nuclear bomb produces about one gram of heat and electromagnetic radiation, but the mass of this energy would not be detectable in an exploded bomb in an ideal box sitting on a scale; instead, the contents of the box would be heated to millions of degrees without changing total mass and weight. If then, however, a transparent window (passing only electromagnetic radiation) were opened in such an ideal box after the explosion, and a beam of X-rays and other lower-energy light allowed to escape the box, it would eventually be found to weigh one gram less than it had before the explosion. This weight loss and mass loss would happen as the box was cooled by this process, to room temperature. However, any surrounding mass that absorbed the X-rays (and other \"heat\") would ''gain'' this gram of mass from the resulting heating, so the mass \"loss\" would represent merely its relocation. Thus, no mass (or, in the case of a nuclear bomb, no matter) would be \"converted\" to energy in such a process. Mass and energy, as always, would both be separately conserved.\n\n===Massless particles===\nMassless particles have zero rest mass. Their relativistic mass is simply their relativistic energy, divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}, or {{math|1=''m''{{ssub|rel}} = {{Sfrac|''E''|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |title=Basic relativity\n |edition=2\n |first1=Richard A.\n |last1=Mould\n |publisher=Springer\n |date=2002\n |isbn=0-387-95210-1\n |page=126\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC\n}},\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC&pg=PA126 Chapter 5 page 126]\n</ref><ref>\n{{Citation\n |title=Introduction to electromagnetic theory: a modern perspective\n |first1=Tail L.\n |last1=Chow\n |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning\n |date=2006\n |isbn=0-7637-3827-1\n |page=392\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C\n}},\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&pg=PA392 Chapter 10 page 392]\n</ref> The energy for photons is {{math|1=''E'' = ''hf''}}, where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]] and {{mvar|f}} is the photon frequency. This frequency and thus the relativistic energy are frame-dependent.\n\nIf an observer runs away from a photon in the direction the photon travels from a source, and it catches up with the observer\u2014when the photon catches up, the observer sees it as having less energy than it had at the source. The faster the observer is traveling with regard to the source when the photon catches up, the less energy the photon has. As an observer approaches the speed of light with regard to the source, the photon looks redder and redder, by [[relativistic Doppler effect]] (the Doppler shift is the relativistic formula), and the energy of a very long-wavelength photon approaches zero. This is because the photon is ''massless''\u2014the rest mass of a photon is zero.\n\n===Massless particles contribute rest mass and invariant mass to systems===\nTwo photons moving in different directions cannot both be made to have arbitrarily small total energy by changing frames, or by moving toward or away from them. The reason is that in a two-photon system, the energy of one photon is decreased by chasing after it, but the energy of the other increases with the same shift in observer motion. Two photons not moving in the same direction comprise an [[inertial frame]] where the combined energy is smallest, but not zero. This is called the [[center of mass]] frame or the [[center of momentum]] frame; these terms are almost synonyms (the center of mass frame is the special case of a center of momentum frame where the center of mass is put at the origin). The most that chasing a pair of photons can accomplish to decrease their energy is to put the observer in a frame where the photons have equal energy and are moving directly away from each other. In this frame, the observer is now moving in the same direction and speed as the center of mass of the two photons. The total momentum of the photons is now zero, since their momenta are equal and opposite. In this frame the two photons, as a system, have a mass equal to their total energy divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. This mass is called the [[invariant mass]] of the pair of photons together. It is the smallest mass and energy the system may be seen to have, by any observer. It is only the invariant mass of a two-photon system that can be used to make a single particle with the same rest mass.\n\nIf the photons are formed by the collision of a particle and an antiparticle, the invariant mass is the same as the total energy of the particle and antiparticle (their rest energy plus the kinetic energy), in the center of mass frame, where they automatically move in equal and opposite directions (since they have equal momentum in this frame). If the photons are formed by the disintegration of a ''single'' particle with a well-defined rest mass, like the neutral [[pion]], the invariant mass of the photons is equal to rest mass of the pion. In this case, the center of mass frame for the pion is just the frame where the pion is at rest, and the center of mass does not change after it disintegrates into two photons. After the two photons are formed, their center of mass is still moving the same way the pion did, and their total energy in this frame adds up to the mass energy of the pion. Thus, by calculating the [[invariant mass]] of pairs of photons in a particle detector, pairs can be identified that were probably produced by pion disintegration.\n\nA similar calculation illustrates that the invariant mass of systems is conserved, even when massive particles (particles with rest mass) within the system are converted to massless particles (such as photons). In such cases, the photons contribute invariant mass to the system, even though they individually have no invariant mass or rest mass. Thus, an electron and positron (each of which has rest mass) may undergo [[electron\u2013positron annihilation|annihilation]] with each other to produce two photons, each of which is massless (has no rest mass). However, in such circumstances, no system mass is lost. Instead, the system of both photons moving away from each other has an invariant mass, which acts like a rest mass for any system in which the photons are trapped, or that can be weighed. Thus, not only the quantity of relativistic mass, but also the quantity of invariant mass does not change in transformations between \"matter\" (electrons and positrons) and energy (photons).\n\n===Relation to gravity===\nIn physics, there are two distinct concepts of [[mass]]: the gravitational mass and the inertial mass. The gravitational mass is the quantity that determines the strength of the [[gravitational field]] generated by an object, as well as the gravitational force acting on the object when it is immersed in a gravitational field produced by other bodies. The inertial mass, on the other hand, quantifies how much an object accelerates if a given force is applied to it. The mass\u2013energy equivalence in special relativity refers to the inertial mass. However, already in the context of Newton gravity, the Weak [[Equivalence Principle]] is postulated: the gravitational and the inertial mass of every object are the same. Thus, the mass\u2013energy equivalence, combined with the Weak Equivalence Principle, results in the prediction that all forms of energy contribute to the gravitational field generated by an object. This observation is one of the pillars of the [[general theory of relativity]].\n\nThe above prediction, that all forms of energy interact gravitationally, has been subject to experimental tests. The first observation testing this prediction was made in 1919.<ref>{{Citation |last=Dyson|first =F.W. |author2= Eddington, A.S. |author3=Davidson, C.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil.

However, Planck was thinking about chemical reactions, where the binding energy is too small to measure. Einstein suggested that radioactive materials such as [[radium]] would provide a test of the theory, but even though a large amount of energy is released per atom in radium, due to the [[half-life]] of the substance (1602 years), only a small fraction of radium atoms decay over an experimentally measurable period of time.\n\nOnce the nucleus was discovered, experimenters realized that the very high binding energies of the atomic nuclei should allow calculation of their binding energies, simply from mass differences. But it was not until the discovery of the [[neutron]] in 1932, and the measurement of the neutron mass, that this calculation could actually be performed (see [[nuclear binding energy]] for example calculation). A little while later, the [[Cockcroft\u2013Walton accelerator]] produced the first [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] reaction ({{nowrap|{{su|p=7|b=3}}Li + {{su|p=1|b=1}}p \u2192 2 {{su|p=4|b=2}}He}}), verifying Einstein's formula to an accuracy of \u00b10.5%.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\nIn 2005, Rainville et al. published a direct test of the energy-equivalence of mass lost in the binding energy of a neutron to atoms of particular isotopes of silicon and sulfur, by comparing the mass lost to the energy of the emitted gamma ray associated with the neutron capture.

For instance, the \"[[Fat Man|Gadget]]\"-style bomb used in the [[Trinity test]] and the [[bombing of Nagasaki]] had an explosive yield equivalent to 21&nbsp;kt of TNT. About 1&nbsp;kg of the approximately 6.15&nbsp;kg of plutonium in each of these bombs fissioned into lighter elements totaling almost exactly one gram less, after cooling. The electromagnetic radiation and kinetic energy (thermal and blast energy) released in this explosion carried the missing one gram of mass.<ref>The 6.2&nbsp;kg core comprised 0.8% gallium by weight. Also, about 20% of the Gadget's yield was due to fast fissioning in its natural uranium tamper. This resulted in 4.1&nbsp;moles of plutonium fissioning with 180&nbsp;MeV per atom actually contributing prompt kinetic energy to the explosion. Note too that the term ''\"Gadget\"-style'' is used here instead of \"Fat Man\" because this general design of bomb was very rapidly upgraded to a more efficient one requiring only 5&nbsp;kg of the plutonium\u2013gallium alloy.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> This occurs because nuclear [[binding energy]] is released whenever elements with more than 62 nucleons fission.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAnother example is [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generation]]. The electrical energy produced by [[Grand Coulee Dam]]'s [[Water turbine|turbines]] every 3.7&nbsp;hours represents one gram of mass. This mass passes to electrical devices (such as lights in cities) powered by the generators, where it appears as a gram of heat and light.<ref>Assuming the dam is generating at its peak capacity of 6,809&nbsp;MW.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> Turbine designers look at their equations in terms of pressure, torque, and RPM. However, Einstein's equations show that all energy has mass, and thus the electrical energy produced by a dam's generators, and the resulting heat and light, all retain their mass\u2014which is equivalent to the energy. The potential energy\u2014and equivalent mass\u2014represented by the waters of the [[Columbia River]] as it descends to the Pacific Ocean would be converted to heat due to [[viscous friction]] and the [[turbulence]] of white water rapids and waterfalls were it not for the dam and its generators. This heat would remain as mass on site at the water, were it not for the equipment that converted some of this potential and kinetic energy into electrical energy, which can move from place to place (taking mass with it).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nWhenever energy is added to a system, the system gains mass, as shown when the equation is rearranged:\n* A spring's mass increases whenever it is put into compression or tension. Its added mass arises from the added potential energy stored within it, which is bound in the stretched chemical (electron) bonds linking the atoms within the spring.\n* Raising the temperature of an object (increasing its heat energy) increases its mass. For example, consider the world's primary mass standard for the kilogram, made of platinum/iridium. If its temperature is allowed to change by 1&nbsp;\u00b0C, its mass changes by 1.5 picograms (1&nbsp;pg = {{val|1|e=-12|u=g}}).<ref>Assuming a 90/10 alloy of Pt/Ir by weight, a {{math|''C<sub>p</sub>''}} of 25.9 for Pt and 25.1 for Ir, a Pt-dominated average {{math|''C<sub>p</sub>''}} of 25.8, 5.134&nbsp;moles of metal, and 132&nbsp;J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> for the prototype.

Its increase of mass is exactly the equivalent of the mass of energy of rotation, which is itself the sum of the kinetic energies of all the moving parts of the ball. For example, [[the Earth]] itself is more massive due to its rotation, than it would be with no rotation. This [[rotational energy]] ({{val|2.14|e=29|u=J}}) represents 2.38 billion metric tons of added mass.<ref>InfraNet Lab (2008-12-07). Harnessing the Energy from the Earth's Rotation.

Mass/energy simply moves from one place to another. These are some examples of the ''transfer'' of energy and mass in accordance with the ''principle of mass\u2013energy conservation''.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Efficiency==\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2019}}\nAlthough mass cannot be converted to energy,<ref name=\"A. Wheeler, 1992. pp. 248\"/> in some reactions matter particles (which contain a form of rest energy) can be destroyed and the energy released can be converted to other types of energy that are more usable and obvious as forms of energy\u2014such as light and energy of motion (heat, etc.). However, the total amount of energy and mass does not change in such a transformation. Even when particles are not destroyed, a certain fraction of the ill-defined \"matter\" in ordinary objects can be destroyed, and its associated energy liberated and made available as the more dramatic energies of light and heat, even though no identifiable real particles are destroyed, and even though (again) the total energy is unchanged (as also the total mass). Such conversions between types of energy (resting to active energy) happen in nuclear weapons, in which the protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei lose a small fraction of their average mass, but this mass loss is not due to the destruction of any protons or neutrons (or even, in general, lighter particles like electrons). Also the mass is not destroyed, but simply removed from the system in the form of heat and light from the reaction.\n\nIn nuclear reactions, typically only a small fraction of the total mass\u2013energy of the bomb converts into the mass\u2013energy of heat, light, radiation, and motion\u2014which are \"active\" forms that can be used. When an atom fissions, it loses only about 0.1% of its mass (which escapes from the system and does not disappear), and additionally, in a bomb or reactor not all the atoms can fission. In a modern fission-based atomic bomb, the efficiency is only about 40%, so only 40% of the fissionable atoms actually fission, and only about 0.03% of the fissile core mass appears as energy in the end. In nuclear fusion, more of the mass is released as usable energy, roughly 0.3%. But in a fusion bomb, the bomb mass is partly casing and non-reacting components, so that in practicality, again (coincidentally) no more than about 0.03% of the total mass of the entire weapon is released as usable energy (which, again, retains the \"missing\" mass). See [[nuclear weapon yield]] for practical details of this ratio in modern nuclear weapons.\n\nIn theory, it should be possible to destroy matter and convert all of the rest-energy associated with matter into heat and light (which would of course have the same mass), but none of the theoretically known methods are practical. One way to convert all the energy within matter into usable energy is to annihilate matter with [[antimatter]]. But [[baryon asymmetry|antimatter is rare in our universe]], and must be made first. Due to inefficient mechanisms of production, making antimatter always requires far more usable energy than would be released when it was annihilated.\n\nSince most of the mass of ordinary objects resides in protons and neutrons, converting all the energy of ordinary matter into more useful energy requires that the protons and neutrons be converted to lighter particles, or particles with no rest-mass at all. In the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the [[baryon number|number of protons plus neutrons]] is nearly exactly conserved. Still, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] showed that there is a process that converts protons and neutrons to antielectrons and neutrinos.<ref>G. 't Hooft, \"Computation of the quantum effects due to a four-dimensional pseudoparticle\", Physical Review D14:3432\u20133450 (1976).</ref> This is the weak SU(2) [[instanton]] proposed by Belavin Polyakov Schwarz and Tyupkin.<ref>A. Belavin, A. M. Polyakov, A. Schwarz, Yu. Tyupkin, \"Pseudoparticle Solutions to Yang Mills Equations\", Physics Letters 59B:85 (1975).</ref> This process, can in principle destroy matter and convert all the energy of matter into neutrinos and usable energy, but it is normally extraordinarily slow. Later it became clear that this process happens at a fast rate at very high temperatures,<ref>F. Klinkhammer, [[Nicholas Manton|N. Manton]], \"A Saddle Point Solution in the Weinberg Salam Theory\", Physical Review D 30:2212.</ref> since then, instanton-like configurations are copiously produced from [[statistical mechanics|thermal fluctuations]]. The temperature required is so high that it would only have been reached shortly after the [[Big Bang]].\n\nMany extensions of the standard model contain [[magnetic monopole]]s, and in some models of [[grand unification theory|grand unification]], these monopoles catalyze [[proton decay]], a process known as the [[Callan-Rubakov effect]].<ref>Rubakov V. A. \"Monopole Catalysis of Proton Decay\", Reports on Progress in Physics 51:189\u2013241 (1988).</ref> This process would be an efficient mass\u2013energy conversion at ordinary temperatures, but it requires making [[Magnetic monopole|monopoles]] and anti-monopoles first. The energy required to produce monopoles is believed to be enormous, but magnetic charge is conserved, so that the lightest monopole is stable. All these properties are deduced in theoretical models\u2014magnetic monopoles have never been observed, nor have they been produced in any experiment so far.\n\nA third known method of total matter\u2013energy \"conversion\" (which again in practice only means conversion of one type of energy into a different type of energy), is using gravity, specifically black holes. [[Stephen Hawking]] theorized<ref>S.W. Hawking \"Black Holes Explosions?\" ''Nature'' 248:30 (1974).</ref> that black holes radiate thermally with no regard to how they are formed. So, it is theoretically possible to throw matter into a black hole and use the emitted heat to generate power. According to the theory of [[Hawking radiation]], however, the black hole used radiates at a higher rate the smaller it is, producing usable powers at only small black hole masses, where usable may for example be something greater than the local background radiation. It is also worth noting that the ambient irradiated power would change with the mass of the black hole, increasing as the mass of the black hole decreases, or decreasing as the mass increases, at a rate where power is proportional to the inverse square of the mass. In a \"practical\" scenario, mass and energy could be dumped into the black hole to regulate this growth, or keep its size, and thus power output, near constant. This could result from the fact that mass and energy are lost from the hole with its thermal radiation.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Mass\u2013velocity relationship===\nIn developing [[special relativity]], Einstein found that the [[kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy]] of a moving body is\n:<math>E_k =  m_0 c^2( \\gamma -1 ) = m_0 c^2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - 1\\right),</math>\n\nwith {{math|''v''}} the [[velocity]], {{math|''m''{{sub|0}}}} the rest mass, and {{math|''\u03b3''}} the [[Lorentz factor]].\n\nHe included the second term on the right to make sure that for small velocities the energy would be the same as in classical mechanics, thus satisfying the [[correspondence principle]]:\n:<math>E_k = \\frac{1}{2}m_0 v^2 + \\cdots </math>\n\nWithout this second term, there would be an additional contribution in the energy when the particle is not moving.\n\nEinstein found that the [[Momentum#Modern definitions of momentum|total momentum]] of a moving particle is:\n:<math>P = \\frac{m_0 v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}. </math>\n\nIt is this quantity that is conserved in collisions. The ratio of the momentum to the velocity is the [[relativistic mass]], {{mvar|m}}.\n:<math>m = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}</math>\n\nAnd the relativistic mass and the relativistic kinetic energy are related by the formula:\n:<math>E_k = m c^2 - m_0 c^2. \\,</math>\n\nEinstein wanted to omit the unnatural second term on the right-hand side, whose only purpose is to make the energy at rest zero, and to declare that the particle has a total energy, which obeys:\n:<math> E = m c^2 \\,</math>\n\nwhich is a sum of the rest energy {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} and the kinetic energy. This total energy is mathematically more elegant, and fits better with the momentum in relativity. But to come to this conclusion, Einstein needed to think carefully about collisions. This expression for the energy implied that matter at rest has a huge amount of energy, and it is not clear whether this energy is physically real, or just a mathematical artifact with no physical meaning.\n\nIn a collision process where all the rest-masses are the same at the beginning as at the end, either expression for the energy is conserved. The two expressions only differ by a constant that is the same at the beginning and at the end of the collision. Still, by analyzing the situation where particles are thrown off a heavy central particle, it is easy to see that the inertia of the central particle is reduced by the total energy emitted. This allowed Einstein to conclude that the inertia of a heavy particle is increased or diminished according to the energy it absorbs or emits.\n\n===Relativistic mass===\n{{Main|Mass in special relativity}}\n\nAfter Einstein first made his proposal, it became clear that the word mass can have two different meanings. Some denote the ''relativistic mass'' with an explicit index:\n:<math>m_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} .</math>\n\nThis mass is the ratio of momentum to velocity, and it is also the relativistic energy divided by {{math|1=''c''<sup>2</sup>}} (it is not Lorentz-invariant, in contrast to <math>m_0</math>). The equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''<sub>rel</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} holds for moving objects. When the velocity is small, the relativistic mass and the rest mass are almost exactly the same.\n* {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} either means {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} for an object at rest, or {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''<sub>rel</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} when the object is moving.\n\nAlso Einstein (following [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Max Abraham]]) used velocity- and direction-dependent mass concepts ([[Mass in special relativity#Early developments: transverse and longitudinal mass|longitudinal and transverse mass]]) in his 1905 electrodynamics paper and in another paper in 1906.<ref>{{Citation | author=Einstein, A. | date=1905 | title=Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=17 | pages=891\u2013921 | doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004 | url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_17_891-921.pdf | bibcode=1905AnP...322..891E | issue=10 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227120546/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_17_891-921.pdf | archivedate=2008-02-27 }}.

For example, one view is that only rest mass is a viable concept and is a property of the particle; while relativistic mass is a conglomeration of particle properties and properties of spacetime. A perspective that avoids this debate, due to Kjell V\u00f8yenli, is that the Newtonian concept of mass as a particle property and the relativistic concept of mass have to be viewed as embedded in their own theories and as having no precise connection.<ref name=\"Jammer\">{{Citation |title=Concepts of mass in contemporary physics and philosophy |author=Max Jammer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jujK1bn4QUQC&pg=PA51 |page=51 |isbn=0-691-01017-X |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1999 }}</ref><ref name=\"V\u00f8yenli\">\n\n{{Citation |journal=Foundations of Physics |doi=10.1007/BF00708670 |title= The classical and relativistic concepts of mass |date=1976 |author1= Eriksen, Erik |author2=V\u00f8yenli, Kjell |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=115\u2013124 |publisher=Springer |bibcode=1976FoPh....6..115E}}</ref>\n\n===Low speed expansion===\nWe can rewrite the expression {{math|1=''E'' = ''\u03b3m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} as a [[Taylor series]]:\n:<math>E = m_0 c^2 \\left[1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{8} \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^4 + \\frac{5}{16} \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^6 + \\ldots \\right]. </math>\n\nFor speeds much smaller than the speed of light, higher-order terms in this expression get smaller and smaller because {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} is small.

This is appropriate, because all the high-order corrections are small. Since only ''changes'' in energy affect the behavior of objects, whether we include the {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>''c''<sup>2</sup>}} part makes no difference, since it is constant. For the same reason, it is possible to subtract the rest energy from the total energy in relativity. By considering the emission of energy in different frames, Einstein could show that the rest energy has a real physical meaning.\n\nThe higher-order terms are extra corrections to Newtonian mechanics, and become important at higher speeds. The Newtonian equation is only a low-speed approximation, but an extraordinarily good one. All of the calculations used in putting astronauts on the moon, for example, could have been done using Newton's equations without any of the higher-order corrections.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\nThe total mass energy equivalence should also include the rotational and vibrational kinetic energies as well as the linear kinetic energy at low speeds.\n\n==History==\nWhile Einstein was the first to have correctly deduced the mass\u2013energy equivalence formula, he was not the first to have related energy with mass.

J. Thomson]] (1881), [[Oliver Heaviside]] (1888), and [[George Frederick Charles Searle]] (1897), [[Wilhelm Wien]] (1900), [[Max Abraham]] (1902), [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] (1904) \u2014 to understand how the mass of a charged object depends on the electrostatic field.<ref name=\"jann\"/><ref name=\"whit\"/> This concept was called [[electromagnetic mass]], and was considered as being dependent on velocity and direction as well. Lorentz (1904) gave the following expressions for longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic mass:\n:<math>m_{L}=\\frac{m_{0}}{\\left(\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\\right)^{3}},\\quad m_{T}=\\frac{m_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} </math>,\n\nwhere\n:<math>m_{0}=\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{E_{em}}{c^{2}}</math>\n\n===Radiation pressure and inertia===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic mass#Inertia of energy and radiation paradoxes}}\nAnother way of deriving some sort of electromagnetic mass was based on the concept of [[radiation pressure]].

He argued that this implies mass dependence on temperature as well.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Philip Ball|title=Did Einstein discover {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}?|publisher=[[Physics World]]|date=Aug 23, 2011|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/46941}}</ref>\n\n===Einstein: mass\u2013energy equivalence===\n[[Albert Einstein]] did not formulate exactly the formula {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} in his 1905 [[Annus Mirabilis Papers|''Annus Mirabilis'' paper]] \"Does the Inertia of an object Depend Upon Its Energy Content?\";<ref name=\"inertia\" /> rather, the paper states that if a body gives off the energy {{mvar|L}} in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by {{math|{{sfrac|''L''|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}}}. (Here, \"radiation\" means [[electromagnetic radiation]], or light, and mass means the ordinary Newtonian mass of a slow-moving object.) This formulation relates only a change {{math|\u0394''m''}} in mass to a change {{mvar|L}} in energy without requiring the absolute relationship.\n\nObjects with zero mass presumably have zero energy, so the extension that all mass is proportional to energy is obvious from this result. In 1905, even the hypothesis that changes in energy are accompanied by changes in mass was untested. Not until the discovery of the first type of antimatter (the [[positron]] in 1932) was it found that all of the mass of pairs of resting particles could be converted to radiation.\n\n====The first derivation by Einstein (1905)====\nAlready in his relativity paper \"On the electrodynamics of moving bodies\", Einstein derived the correct expression for the kinetic energy of particles:\n:<math>E_{k}=mc^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}-1\\right)</math>.\n\nNow the question remained open as to which formulation applies to bodies at rest. This was tackled by Einstein in his paper \"Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?\", where he used a body emitting two light pulses in opposite directions, having energies of {{math|''E''<sub>0</sub>}} before and {{math|''E''<sub>1</sub>}} after the emission as seen in its rest frame. As seen from a moving frame, this becomes {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''H''<sub>1</sub>}}. Einstein obtained:\n:<math>\\left(H_{0}-E_{0}\\right)-\\left(H_{1}-E_{1}\\right)=E\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}-1\\right)</math>\n\nthen he argued that {{math|''H'' \u2212 ''E''}} can only differ from the kinetic energy {{math|''K''}} by an additive constant, which gives\n:<math>K_{0}-K_{1}=E\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}-1\\right)</math>\n\nNeglecting effects higher than third order in {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} after a [[Taylor series]] expansion of the right side of this gives:\n:<math>K_{0}-K_{1}=\\frac{E}{c^{2}}\\frac{v^{2}}{2}.</math>\n\nEinstein concluded that the emission reduces the body's mass by {{math|{{sfrac|''E''|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}}}, and that the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content.\n\nThe correctness of Einstein's 1905 derivation of {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} was criticized by [[Max Planck]] (1907), who argued that it is only valid to first approximation. Another criticism was formulated by [[Herbert Ives]] (1952) and [[Max Jammer]] (1961), asserting that Einstein's derivation is based on [[begging the question]].<ref name=jammer2>{{Citation|author=Jammer, Max|title=Concepts of Mass in Classical and Modern Physics|location=New York|publisher=Dover|origyear=1961|year=1997|isbn=0-486-29998-8}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author=Ives, Herbert E. | date=1952 | title=Derivation of the mass\u2013energy relation | journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume= 42 | issue=8 | pages =540\u2013543 | doi=10.1364/JOSA.42.000540}}</ref>\nOn the other hand, [[John Stachel]] and [[Roberto Torretti]] (1982) argued that Ives' criticism was wrong, and that Einstein's derivation was correct.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Stachel, John |author2=Torretti, Roberto | date=1982 | title=Einstein's first derivation of mass\u2013energy equivalence | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume =50 | issue=8 | pages =760\u2013763 | doi=10.1119/1.12764|bibcode = 1982AmJPh..50..760S }}</ref>\nHans Ohanian (2008) agreed with Stachel/Torretti's criticism of Ives, though he argued that Einstein's derivation was wrong for other reasons.<ref>{{Citation | author=Ohanian, Hans | date=2008 | title=Did Einstein prove E=mc2? | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B | volume =40 | issue=2 | pages =167\u2013173 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.03.002|arxiv=0805.1400| bibcode=2009SHPMP..40..167O }}</ref> For a recent review, see Hecht (2011).<ref name=hecht />\n\n====Alternative version====\nAn alternative version of Einstein's [[thought experiment]] was proposed by [[Fritz Rohrlich]] (1990), who based his reasoning on the [[Doppler effect]].<ref>{{Citation | author=Rohrlich, Fritz | date=1990 | title=An elementary derivation of {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume= 58 | issue=4 | pages =348\u2013349 | doi=10.1119/1.16168|bibcode = 1990AmJPh..58..348R }}</ref>\nLike Einstein, he considered a body at rest with mass {{mvar|M}}. If the body is examined in a frame moving with nonrelativistic velocity {{mvar|v}}, it is no longer at rest and in the moving frame it has momentum {{math|1=''P'' = ''Mv''}}. Then he supposed the body emits two pulses of light to the left and to the right, each carrying an equal amount of energy {{math|{{sfrac|''E''|2}}}}. In its rest frame, the object remains at rest after the emission since the two beams are equal in strength and carry opposite momentum.\n\nHowever, if the same process is considered in a frame that moves with velocity {{math|''v''}} to the left, the pulse moving to the left is [[redshift]]ed, while the pulse moving to the right is [[blue shift]]ed. The blue light carries more momentum than the red light, so that the momentum of the light in the moving frame is not balanced: the light is carrying some net momentum to the right.\n\nThe object has not changed its velocity before or after the emission. Yet in this frame it has lost some right-momentum to the light. The only way it could have lost momentum is by losing mass. This also solves Poincar\u00e9's radiation paradox, discussed above.\n\nThe velocity is small, so the right-moving light is blueshifted by an amount equal to the nonrelativistic [[Doppler shift]] factor {{math|1 \u2212 {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}}. The momentum of the light is its energy divided by {{mvar|c}}, and it is increased by a factor of {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}}. So the right-moving light is carrying an extra momentum {{math|\u0394''P''}} given by:\n:<math> \\Delta P = {v \\over c}{E \\over 2c} .</math>\n\nThe left-moving light carries a little less momentum, by the same amount {{math|\u0394''P''}}. So the total right-momentum in the light is twice {{math|\u0394''P''}}. This is the right-momentum that the object lost.\n:<math> 2\\Delta P = v {E\\over c^2} .</math>\n\nThe momentum of the object in the moving frame after the emission is reduced to this amount:\n:<math> P' = Mv - 2\\Delta P = \\left(M - {E\\over c^2}\\right)v .</math>\n\nSo the change in the object's mass is equal to the total energy lost divided by {{math|''c''<sup>2</sup>}}. Since any emission of energy can be carried out by a two step process, where first the energy is emitted as light and then the light is converted to some other form of energy, any emission of energy is accompanied by a loss of mass. Similarly, by considering absorption, a gain in energy is accompanied by a gain in mass.\n\n====Relativistic center-of-mass theorem (1906)====\nLike Poincar\u00e9, Einstein concluded in 1906 that the inertia of electromagnetic energy is a necessary condition for the center-of-mass theorem to hold. On this occasion, Einstein referred to Poincar\u00e9's 1900 paper and wrote:<ref>{{Citation|author=Einstein, A. |date=1906 |title=Das Prinzip von der Erhaltung der Schwerpunktsbewegung und die Tr\u00e4gheit der Energie |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=20 |pages=627\u2013633 |doi=10.1002/andp.19063250814 |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1906_20_627-633.pdf |bibcode=1906AnP...325..627E |issue=8 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318060830/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1906_20_627-633.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-18 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Although the merely formal considerations, which we will need for the proof, are already mostly contained in a work by H.

The nonrelativistic kinetic energy formula did not always include the traditional factor of {{sfrac|2}}, since [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] introduced kinetic energy without it, and the {{sfrac|2}} is largely conventional in prerelativistic physics.<ref>{{Citation| author=Prentiss, J.J.| title=Why is the energy of motion proportional to the square of the velocity? | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume=73| issue =  8 |date=August 2005 | page=705| doi=10.1119/1.1927550|bibcode = 2005AmJPh..73..701P }}</ref> By assuming that every particle has a mass that is the sum of the masses of the ether particles, the authors concluded that all matter contains an amount of kinetic energy either given by {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} or {{math|1=2''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} depending on the convention.

However, it raised the question where this energy is coming from. After eliminating the idea of absorption and emission of some sort of [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Lesagian ether particles]], the existence of a huge amount of latent energy, stored within matter, was proposed by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] in 1903. Rutherford also suggested that this internal energy is stored within normal matter as well. He went on to speculate in 1904:<ref>{{Citation|last=Rutherford|first= Ernest |date=1904|title=Radioactivity |publisher=University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=336\u2013338|url=https://archive.org/details/radioactivity00ruthrich}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Heisenberg|first= Werner |date=1958|title=Physics And Philosophy: The Revolution In Modern Science |publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|pages=118\u2013119|url=https://archive.org/details/physicsandphilos010613mbp}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|If it were ever found possible to control at will the rate of disintegration of the radio-elements, an enormous amount of energy could be obtained from a small quantity of matter.}}\n\nEinstein's equation is in no way an explanation of the large energies released in radioactive decay (this comes from the powerful [[nuclear force]]s involved; forces that were still unknown in 1905). In any case, the enormous energy released from radioactive decay (which had been measured by Rutherford) was much more easily measured than the (still small) change in the gross mass of materials as a result. Einstein's equation, by theory, can give these energies by measuring mass differences before and after reactions, but in practice, these mass differences in 1905 were still too small to be measured in bulk. Prior to this, the ease of measuring radioactive decay energies with a calorimeter was thought possibly likely to allow measurement of changes in mass difference, as a check on Einstein's equation itself. Einstein mentions in his 1905 paper that mass\u2013energy equivalence might perhaps be tested with radioactive decay, which releases enough energy (the quantitative amount known roughly by 1905) to possibly be \"weighed,\" when missing from the system (having been given off as heat). However, radioactivity seemed to proceed at its own unalterable (and quite slow, for radioactives known then) pace, and even when simple nuclear reactions became possible using proton bombardment, the idea that these great amounts of usable energy could be liberated at will with any practicality, proved difficult to substantiate. Rutherford was reported in 1933 to have declared that this energy could not be exploited efficiently: \"Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of the atom is talking [[moonshine]].\"<ref>\"We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.\" [http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/ ''The Times'' archives], September 12, 1933, \"The British association\u2014breaking down the atom\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Einstein - Time Magazine - July 1, 1946.jpg|right|thumb|The popular connection between Einstein, {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}, and the [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] was prominently indicated on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in July 1946 by the writing of the equation on the [[mushroom cloud]].]]\n\nThis situation changed dramatically in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron and its mass, allowing mass differences for single [[nuclide]]s and their reactions to be calculated directly, and compared with the sum of masses for the particles that made up their composition. In 1933, the energy released from the reaction of lithium-7 plus protons giving rise to 2 alpha particles (as noted above by Rutherford), allowed Einstein's equation to be tested to an error of \u00b10.5%. However, scientists still did not see such reactions as a practical source of power, due to the energy cost of accelerating reaction particles.\n\nAfter the very public demonstration of huge energies released from [[nuclear fission]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945, the equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} became directly linked in the public eye with the power and peril of [[nuclear weapon]]s. The equation was featured as early as page 2 of the [[Smyth Report]], the official 1945 release by the US government on the development of the atomic bomb, and by 1946 the equation was linked closely enough with Einstein's work that the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine prominently featured a picture of Einstein next to an image of a [[mushroom cloud]] emblazoned with the equation.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19460701,00.html Cover.] ''Time'' magazine, July 1, 1946.</ref> Einstein himself had only a minor role in the [[Manhattan Project]]: he had [[Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter|cosigned a letter]] to the U.S. President in 1939 urging funding for research into atomic energy, warning that an atomic bomb was theoretically possible. The letter persuaded Roosevelt to devote a significant portion of the wartime budget to atomic research. Without a security clearance, Einstein's only scientific contribution was an analysis of an [[isotope separation]] method in theoretical terms. It was inconsequential, on account of Einstein not being given sufficient information (for security reasons) to fully work on the problem.<ref>Isaacson, ''Einstein: His Life and Universe''.</ref>\n\nWhile {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} is useful for understanding the amount of energy potentially released in a fission reaction, it was not strictly necessary to develop the weapon, once the fission process was known, and its energy measured at 200&nbsp;MeV (which was directly possible, using a quantitative Geiger counter, at that time). As the physicist and Manhattan Project participant [[Robert Serber]] put it: \"Somehow the popular notion took hold long ago that Einstein's theory of relativity, in particular his famous equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}, plays some essential role in the theory of fission. Albert Einstein had a part in alerting the United States government to the possibility of building an atomic bomb, but his theory of relativity is not required in discussing fission. The theory of fission is what physicists call a non-relativistic theory, meaning that relativistic effects are too small to affect the dynamics of the fission process significantly.\"<ref>Robert Serber, ''The Los Alamos Primer: The First Lectures on How to Build an Atomic Bomb'' (University of California Press, 1992), page 7.

In late 1938, [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch]]\u2014while on a winter walk during which they solved the meaning of Hahn's experimental results and introduced the idea that would be called atomic fission\u2014directly used Einstein's equation to help them understand the quantitative energetics of the reaction that overcame the \"surface tension-like\" forces that hold the nucleus together, and allowed the fission fragments to separate to a configuration from which their charges could force them into an energetic ''fission''. To do this, they used ''packing fraction'', or nuclear [[binding energy]] values for elements, which Meitner had memorized. These, together with use of {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} allowed them to realize on the spot that the basic fission process was energetically possible:\n\n<blockquote> ...We walked up and down in the snow, I on skis and she on foot. ...and gradually the idea took shape... explained by Bohr's idea that the nucleus is like a liquid drop; such a drop might elongate and divide itself... We knew there were strong forces that would resist, ..just as surface tension. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops. At this point we both sat down on a tree trunk and started to calculate on scraps of paper. ...the Uranium nucleus might indeed be a very wobbly, unstable drop, ready to divide itself... But, ...when the two drops separated they would be driven apart by electrical repulsion, about 200 MeV in all. Fortunately Lise Meitner remembered how to compute the masses of nuclei... and worked out that the two nuclei formed... would be lighter by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}, and... the mass was just equivalent to 200 MeV; it all fitted!<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/dtrapp/people/Meitnerium.html A quote from Frisch about the discovery day.

{"title_page": "History of rail transportation in the United States", "text_new": "[[File:69workmen.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed in 1869.]]\n: ''This article is part of the [[history of rail transport by country]] series.''\n\nWooden railroads, called wagonways, were built in the [[History of the United States|United States]] starting from the 1720s. A railroad was reportedly used in the construction of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] fortress at [[Louisburg, Nova Scotia]], in [[New France]] (now [[Canada]]) in 1720. Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the [[French and Indian War]] (1756\u20131763), a [[gravity railroad]] ([[tramway (industrial)|mechanized tramway]]) ([[Montresor's Tramway]]) is built by [[British Army|British military engineers]] up the steep riverside terrain near the [[Niagara River]] waterfall's [[escarpment]] at the [[Niagara Portage]]  (which the local [[Seneca people|Seneca]]s called ''\"Crawl on All Fours.\"'') in [[Lewiston, New York]].\n\nRailroads played a large role in the development of the [[United States]] from the [[industrial revolution]] in the [[Northeastern United States|North-east]] (1810\u20131850) to the settlement of the West (1850\u20131890). The American railroad mania began with the founding of the first passenger and freight line in the nation of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1827 and the \"Laying of the First Stone\" ceremonies and beginning of its long construction heading westward over the obstacles of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] eastern chain the following year of 1828, and flourished with continuous railway building projects for the next 45 years until the financial  [[Panic of 1873]] followed by a major [[economic depression]] bankrupted many companies and temporarily stymied and ended growth.\n\nAlthough the antebellum South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports, and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860 before the war. In the heavily settled Midwestern [[Corn Belt]], over 80 percent of farms were within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs, and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on [[Wall Street]] and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.\n\nThe system was largely built by 1910, but then trucks arrived to eat away the freight traffic, and automobiles (and later airplanes) to devour the passenger traffic. After 1940, the use of diesel electric locomotives made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.\n\nA series of bankruptcies and consolidations left the rail system in the hands of a few large operations by the 1980s. Almost all long-distance passenger traffic was shifted to [[Amtrak]] in 1971, a government-owned operation. Commuter rail service is provided near a few major cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia. Computerization and improved equipment steadily reduced employment, which peaked at 2.1 million in 1920, falling to 1.2 million in 1950 and 215,000 in 2010. Route mileage peaked at {{convert|254251|mi|km}} in 1916 and fell to {{convert|139,679|mi|km}} in 2011.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970'' (1976) table Q398; ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012.''

Canals and rivers were unavailable in the winter season due to freezing, but the railroads ran year-round despite poor weather. And railroads were safer: the likelihood of a train crash was less than the likelihood of a boat sinking. The railroads provided cost-effective transportation because they allowed shippers to have a smaller inventory of goods, which reduced storage costs during winter, and to avoid insurance costs from the risk of losing goods during transit.<ref name=\"BFDC\">{{cite book|author=United States.

For the common person in the early 1800s, transportation was often traveled by horse or stagecoach. The network of trails along which coaches navigated were riddled with ditches, potholes, and stones. This made travel fairly uncomfortable. Adding to injury, coaches were cramped with little leg room. Travel by train offered a new style. Locomotives proved themselves a smooth, headache free ride with plenty of room to move around.

The canals and steamboats lost out because of the dramatic increases in efficiency and speed of the railroads, which could go almost anywhere year round. The railroads were faster and went to many places a canal would be impractical or too expensive to build or a natural river never went. Railroads also had better scheduling since they often could go year round, more or less ignoring the weather. Canals and river traffic were cheaper if you lived on or near a canal or river that wasn't frozen over part of the year, but only a few did. Long distance transport of goods by wagon to a canal or river was slow and expensive. A railroad to a city made it an inland \"port\" that often prospered or turned a town into a city.<ref>Albert W.

Most transports was by boat, not rail, and after the Union blockaded the ports in 1861 and seized the key rivers in 1862, long-distance travel was difficult.

Most U.S. roads discontinued use of steam locomotives by the 1950s. A diesel engine was expensive to build, but was less complex and easier to maintain than a steam locomotive, and required only one person to operate. This meant reduced costs and greater reliability for the railroads.<ref name=\"Stover\" />{{rp|213\u201314}} Several companies developed fast [[streamliner]] trains, such as the [[Super Chief]] and the [[California Zephyr]] during the 1930s and 1940s. Their locomotives used either diesel or similar [[internal combustion engine]] designs. ''See'' [[Dieselisation#North America|Dieselisation in North America]].\n\nThough [[electric railway]]s expanded in Europe, they never reached the same popularity in North America. They were built primarily in the [[North-western United States|north-west]] and the [[North-eastern United States|north-east]] beginning in the late 19th century. While some railroads used electric locomotives for both freight and passenger trains, by the end of the 20th century most freight trains were pulled only by diesel locomotives.

Lines with hundreds or thousands of employees developed systematic rules and procedures, not only for running the equipment but in hiring, promoting, paying and supervising employees. The railway system of management was adopted by all major business sectors. Railways offered a new type of work experience in enterprises vastly larger in size, complexity and management. At first workers were recruited from occupations where skills were roughly analogous and transferable, that is, workshop mechanics from the iron, machine and building trades; [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]] from [[stagecoach]] drivers, steamship stewards and mail boat captains; [[station master]]s from commerce and commission agencies; and clerks from government offices.<ref>{{cite book |last=Licht |first=Walter |date=1987 |title=Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691102214}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the strikes of the 1870s and 1880s, Congress passed the ''Arbitration Act of 1888,'' which authorized the creation of [[arbitration]] panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.<ref>Arbitration Act of 1888, {{USStat|25|501}}, October 1, 1888.</ref> The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 [[Pullman Strike]], issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a [[United States district court|federal court]] [[injunction]] backed by federal troops.\n\n[[File:Railroad Coupling (CMRR).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Janney coupler|Automatic couplers]] were required by the 1893 [[Railroad Safety Appliance Act|Safety Appliance Act]].]]\nCongress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the [[Erdman Act]], passed in 1898.<ref>Erdman Act of 1898, June 1, 1898, ch. 370, {{USStat|30|424}}.</ref> This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited \"yellow dog\" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used.

The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the Telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. For highly efficient Northern railroads played a major role in winning the Civil War, while the overburdened Southern lines collapsed in the face of an insurmountable challenge.<ref>John E.

The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts.   A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track.\n\nIn 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).<ref>Edward C.

However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route.  Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. The larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.<ref>Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age''  (1961) pp 57\u201368.</ref> The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market.

Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler and Stephen Salsbury. \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\" in Bruce Mazlish, ed., ''The Railroad and the Space Program'' (MIT Press, 1965)  pp 127\u201362</ref>\n\nAfter a serious accident, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers to keep track of all train movements. Discipline was essential\u2014everyone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.<ref>Chandler and Salsbury, \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\"  pp 130\u201334</ref> As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations.  The [[Erie Railroad]], faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]\u2014the largest in the world\u2014was making further advances in using bureaucracy under [[John Edgar Thomson]], president 1852\u20131874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., \"The Railroads: Pioneers in Modern Corporate Management\". ''Business History Review'' 1965 39(1): 16\u201340. {{JSTOR|3112463}}.</ref>\n\n=== Career paths===\nThe fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up to the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57.  Women were not hired.<ref>Walter Licht, ''working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983) p 289</ref>\n\nWhite-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level, they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care.  Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by the foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.<ref>Licht, ''Working for the Railroad'' pp 262\u201363. 269.</ref>  Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.<ref>Dora L. Costa, \"The evolution of retirement.\" in  Costa, ''The Evolution of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880\u20131990'' (U of Chicago Press, 1998), pp 6\u201331 [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6108.pdf online].</ref>\n\n===Early attitudes towards railroads===\nBoosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people would dress in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:\n:The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism.]] The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology....[Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime.<ref>{{cite book|author=David E. Nye|title=American Technological Sublime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrdbOJFxWIoC&pg=PR9|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|page=9|isbn=9780262640343}}</ref>\n\nTravel became much easier, cheaper and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores.  Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering.  Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\n: with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine the United States of continental proportions without the railroad.<ref>Gary S. Cross and Rick Szostak, ''Technology and American society: A history'' (2005) p 102.</ref>\n\nThe engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.<ref>Robert Zussman, ''Mechanics of the middle class: work and politics among American engineers'' (1985).</ref> By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910\u20131963)|Pennsylvania Station in New York City]], and the [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington DC]].<ref>Carl W. Condit, \"Cincinnati Passenger Stations Before 1930,\" ''Railroad History'' No. 132 (1975) pp. 5\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43520516 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAs early as the 1830s, novelists and poets began fretting that the railroads would destroy the rustic attractions of the American landscape. By the 1840s concerns were rising about terrible accidents when speeding trains crashed into helpless wooden carriages.<ref>George H. Douglas, ''All Aboard! The Railroad in American Life'' (1992), chapter 5</ref> By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger movement theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices. Local merchants and shippers supported the demand and got some \"Granger Laws\" passed.<ref>George H. Miller, \"Origins of the Iowa Granger Law,\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 40#4 (1954), pp. 657\u2013680 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1895862 in JSTOR]</ref> Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated  in late 19th century political rhetoric.<ref>Douglas, ''All Aboard!''

Railroads throughout the United States allowed quicker, more efficient transport of goods and people that were previously unavailable. Agriculture, animals, soldiers, goods, and natural resources were now able to move large distances in much shorter amounts of time. As a result, things that were not harvested before like certain tracts of arable land or animal populations were now being used.\n\n=== Galena and Chicago Union Railroad ===\n[[File:Illinois_regions_map.png|thumb|324x324px|A current map showing Chicago, Galena, Springfield,and St. Louis.]]\n[[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad|The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] was the first railway to be built from [[Chicago]]. It never reached Galena, Illinois, but it reached Clinton, Iowa, and Freeport, Illinois. This railroad marked the beginning of Chicago's economic dominance in the Midwest  though transportation of goods such as agriculture and bison hides. Railroads affected the American environment by opening up unexplored, immense tracts of the American wilderness for settlement commercialization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schivelbusch|first=Wolfgang|date=2014|title=The American Railroad|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nThe idea behind a railroad to Chicago was to steal Midwestern agricultural business from [[St. Louis]], Missouri and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin. The area around Chicago was ideal for a railroad because it was flat and grassy. Citizens of Chicago believed they could use their environment for commercial gain by actually buying goods grown from the land as well as increasing the value the value of adjacent land neighboring the railroad. The Galena and Chicago Union railroad underwent construction in March 1848 to have the railroad run through Chicago, a booming Midwest town. In order to fund this, local Illinoisans pledged together to build a railway because of the potential economic prosperity. William Cronon writes, \u201dBy the following April [1849], over twelve hundred people had pledged to buy stock hypothetically valued at about $350,000, though they had paid only about $20,000 in actual cash.\u201d Farmers were enamored with the idea of a railroad because transporting crops and goods became much easier and more effective than traveling on dirt roads that could easily become muddy or impassable, so they pledged a lot of their money towards the venture. The process of local funding was stock installments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Nature's Metropolis|last=Cronon|first=William|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=1991|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nBy 1852, the Galena and Chicago Union railroad supplied Chicago over half of its wheat. This statistic changed the way people thought about the environment and its railways because railways through the countryside provided Chicagoans with increased wealth; railways became a symbol of mastery over land by being able to transport anything across terrain. This mastery coupled with an aligning of railroads with prosperity and wealth changed the way Chicagoans saw railways. It was a beacon of hope and deliverer of goods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Impact on buffalo population ==\n[[File:\"Rath & Wright's buffalo hide yard in 1878, showing 40,000 buffalo hides, Dodge City, Kansas.\" - NARA - 520093.tif|thumb|323x323px|A buffalo hide yard in Dodge City, Kansas, in 1878.]]\n[[File:William_Temple_Hornaday.jpeg|thumb|236x236px|Willam Hornaday, a leading conservationist of the 19th century.]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, herds of [[American bison|buffalo]] were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4\u20136 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, \"as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began.\" Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcasses that were left behind by hunters. There were so many rotting, pungent, bison corpses that nature's scavengers did not have enough power to consume.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Railroaded|last=White|first=Richard|publisher=W.W.

He describes the pristine wilderness \"long before the white man and long before the wheel\" and before pioneers started to build mines, mills, and factories in the verdant land. Because of the optimism for wealth and adventure, Lightfoot claims, \"The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring.\" He also describes the cost this industry had on nature by penning the line, \"Open her heart let the life blood flow.\" He describes nature's heart as being bled by the workers' dreams, which could not be stopped, \"Into the muskeg and into the rain.\" Because man wants to be in control of nature and conquer it, he wants to be able to say,\n\n\"On the mountain tops we stand\n\nAll the world at our command\n\nWe have opened up the soil\n\nWith our teardrops and our toil\"\n\nThrough hard work technology, pioneers and businessmen adapted the environment for their own commercial needs and quest for power.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian Railway Trilogy|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Gordon|work=The Way I Feel}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThere is no question about the importance of railroads in American history.  Churella finds that back in the 1950s business and economic historians, led by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] and [[Robert Fogel]], made railroads the centerpiece of advanced historiography.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E. Woodworth|title=The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb3ANWoZt1YC&pg=PA567|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|page=567|isbn=9780313290190}}</ref>  That era has passed as graduate programs have faded away, courses on railroad history do not make the curriculum, and the historiography has shifted away from professional historian to the \"railfans\"\u2014very well informed amateur writers fascinated by the memorabilia, technology and locomotives of the steam era. Looking at the voluminous output of railfan authors, Klein says:\n\n:The vast bulk of this work is devoted to minute descriptions of power, rolling stock, obscure short lines, and technical subjects....  But few address the larger questions of railroad history or place their topic in broader contexts.<ref>Maury Klein, ''Unfinished Business: The Railroad in American Life'' (1994) p. 169</ref><ref>Albert J. Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" ''Enterprise & Society,'' (2006) 7#3, pp. 581\u2013591</ref>\n\nThe result is a multiplicity of histories of specific railroads, large and small. Typically they deal with standard topics: the builders and their organizational, legislative and financial dealings; colorful construction crews laying down wood ties and steel rail; the development of locomotives and passenger cars; boosters who sought a stop in their little town else it would die; the 1880\u20131920 golden age of the passenger long-distance travel and local excursions; the steady erosion of passenger service during the automobile age; the freight agent and the small-town depot. They end with the more recent saga of retrenchment, merger, and abandonment.<ref name=\"Churella pp. 581-591\">Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" pp. 581\u2013591</ref><ref>Wallace Farnham, \"Railroads in Western History: The View from the Union Pacific,\" ''University of Wyoming Publications'' (1966), Vol. 32, pp. 95\u2013112</ref> Klein, Churella, Roth, and Franham all find that the popular writers show little interest in the development of managerial and organizational complexity of the sort that Chandler studied, or the economic impact that concerned Fogel's cohort.<ref>Marty Roth, \"Review\" of \"Minneapolis and the Age of Railways,\" ''Pioneer America Society Transactions'' (2009) vol 32 pp 185\u20136 [http://www.pioneeramerica.org/currentpast/past2009contents.html online]</ref> From outside the field of railroad history, academic labor historians now deal with the culture of the workers, strikes, the careers for blue collar and white collar men, and racial discrimination.

A railroad was reportedly used in the construction of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] fortress at [[Louisburg, Nova Scotia]], in [[New France]] (now [[Canada]]) in 1720. Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the [[French and Indian War]] (1756\u20131763), a [[gravity railroad]] ([[tramway (industrial)|mechanized tramway]]) ([[Montresor's Tramway]]) is built by [[British Army|British military engineers]] up the steep riverside terrain near the [[Niagara River]] waterfall's [[escarpment]] at the [[Niagara Portage]]  (which the local [[Seneca people|Seneca]]s called ''\"Crawl on All Fours.\"'') in [[Lewiston, New York]].\n\nRailroads played a large role in the development of the [[United States]] from the [[industrial revolution]] in the [[Northeastern United States|North-east]] (1810\u20131850) to the settlement of the West (1850\u20131890). The American railroad mania began with the founding of the first passenger and freight line in the nation of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1827 and the \"Laying of the First Stone\" ceremonies and beginning of its long construction heading westward over the obstacles of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] eastern chain the following year of 1828, and flourished with continuous railway building projects for the next 45 years until the financial  [[Panic of 1873]] followed by a major [[economic depression]] bankrupted many companies and temporarily stymied and ended growth.\n\nAlthough the antebellum South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports, and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860 before the war. In the heavily settled Midwestern [[Corn Belt]], over 80 percent of farms were within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs, and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on [[Wall Street]] and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.\n\nThe system was largely built by 1910, but then trucks arrived to eat away the freight traffic, and automobiles (and later airplanes) to devour the passenger traffic. After 1940, the use of diesel electric locomotives made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.\n\nA series of bankruptcies and consolidations left the rail system in the hands of a few large operations by the 1980s. Almost all long-distance passenger traffic was shifted to [[Amtrak]] in 1971, a government-owned operation. Commuter rail service is provided near a few major cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia. Computerization and improved equipment steadily reduced employment, which peaked at 2.1 million in 1920, falling to 1.2 million in 1950 and 215,000 in 2010. Route mileage peaked at {{convert|254251|mi|km}} in 1916 and fell to {{convert|139,679|mi|km}} in 2011.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970'' (1976) table Q398; ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012.''

This became the Crum Creek Branch of the [[Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad]] (part of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]) in 1887. This is the first railroad meant to be permanent, and the first to evolve into trackage of a [[common carrier]] after an intervening closure.\n\nIn 1826 [[Massachusetts]] incorporated [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]]'s [[Granite Railway]] as a [[common carrier|common]] freight carrier<ref>Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1826).

To link the port of [[Baltimore, MD|Baltimore]] to the [[Ohio River]], the state of [[Maryland]] in 1827 chartered the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O), the first section of which opened in 1830. Similarly, the [[South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company]] was chartered in 1827 to connect [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]] to the [[Savannah River]], and [[Pennsylvania]] built the [[Main Line of Public Works]] between [[Philadelphia, PA|Philadelphia]] and the [[Ohio River]].\n\nThe Americans closely followed and copied [[History of rail transport#Britain|British railroad technology]].

This program enabled the opening of numerous western lines, especially the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific-Central Pacific]] with fast service from San Francisco to [[Omaha]] and east to [[Chicago]]. West of Chicago, many cities grew up as rail centers, with repair shops and a base of technically literate workers.<ref>James R.

Hunter, ''Steamboats on the Western rivers: An economic and technological history'' (1949) ch 15</ref> The railroads were superior to these alternative modes of transportation, particularly water routes because they lowered costs in two ways. Canals and rivers were unavailable in the winter season due to freezing, but the railroads ran year-round despite poor weather. And railroads were safer: the likelihood of a train crash was less than the likelihood of a boat sinking. The railroads provided cost-effective transportation because they allowed shippers to have a smaller inventory of goods, which reduced storage costs during winter, and to avoid insurance costs from the risk of losing goods during transit.<ref name=\"BFDC\">{{cite book|author=United States.

For the common person in the early 1800s, transportation was often traveled by horse or stagecoach. The network of trails along which coaches navigated were riddled with ditches, potholes, and stones. This made travel fairly uncomfortable. Adding to injury, coaches were cramped with little leg room. Travel by train offered a new style. Locomotives proved themselves a smooth, headache free ride with plenty of room to move around. Some passenger trains offered meals in the spacious dining car followed by a good night sleep in the private sleeping quarters.<ref name=\"Mark Twain\">{{cite book|author=Mark Twain|title=Roughing It|url=http://www.mtwain.com/roughing_it/5.html|year=1872|publisher=American Publishing Company|page=13}}</ref>\nRailroad companies in the North and Midwest constructed networks that linked nearly every major city by 1860.

Although the transcontinental railroads dominated the media, with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869 dramatically symbolizing the nation's unification after the divisiveness of the Civil War, most construction actually took place in the industrial Northeast and agricultural Midwest, and was designed to minimize shipping times and costs.<ref>{{Grant-Twilight|pages=1\u201320}}</ref> The railroads in the South were repaired and expanded and then, after a lot of preparation, changed from a 5-foot gauge to [[standard gauge]] of 4 foot 8 \u00bd inches in two days in May 1886.<ref>Southern railroad gauge change [http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1966/66-8/gauge.html] accessed 13 Mar 201.</ref>\n\nWith its extensive river system, the United States supported a large array of horse-drawn or mule-drawn barges on canals and [[paddle wheel]] steamboats on rivers that competed with railroads after 1815 until the 1870s.  The canals and steamboats lost out because of the dramatic increases in efficiency and speed of the railroads, which could go almost anywhere year round. The railroads were faster and went to many places a canal would be impractical or too expensive to build or a natural river never went. Railroads also had better scheduling since they often could go year round, more or less ignoring the weather. Canals and river traffic were cheaper if you lived on or near a canal or river that wasn't frozen over part of the year, but only a few did. Long distance transport of goods by wagon to a canal or river was slow and expensive. A railroad to a city made it an inland \"port\" that often prospered or turned a town into a city.<ref>Albert W.

Practically all the mills and factories supplying rails and equipment were in the North, and the Union blockade kept the South from getting new equipment or spare parts. The war was fought in the South, and Union raiders (and sometimes Confederates too) systematically destroyed bridges and [[rolling stock]] \u2014 and sometimes bent rails \u2014 to hinder the logistics of the enemy.<ref>See: Robert C.

Most transports was by boat, not rail, and after the Union blockaded the ports in 1861 and seized the key rivers in 1862, long-distance travel was difficult. The outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the railroad companies, for the hoarding of the cotton crop in an attempt to force European intervention left railroads bereft of their main source of income.<ref name=\"Ramsdell\">Charles W.

However, although England had early adopted a [[standard gauge]] of {{Track gauge|ussg|lk=on}}, once Americans started building locomotives, they experimented with different gauges, resulting in the standard gauge, or a close approximation, being adopted in the [[Northeast (U.S.)|Northeast]] and [[Midwest U.S.]], but a {{Track gauge|5ft|lk=on}} gauge in the [[South (U.S.)|South]], and a {{Track gauge|5ft6in|lk=on}} gauge in Canada. In addition, the [[Erie Railway]] was built to {{Track gauge|6ft|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]], and in the 1870s a widespread movement looked at the cheaper {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow-gauge railroads in the United States|narrow gauge]]. \n\nThe [[Pacific Railway Act]] of 1863 established the standard gauge for the [[first transcontinental railroad]]. Except for the narrow gauge, gauges were standardized across North America after the end of the [[Civil War (U.S.)|Civil War]] in 1865.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/railroadpromotio00clevuoft|title=Railroad Promotion and Capitalization in the United States|last1=Cleveland|first1=Frederick A.|last2=Powell|first2=Fred Wilbur|publisher=[[Longmans, Green, and Co.]]|year=1909|oclc=497309}}</ref>{{Rp|43; 63\u201382}}\n\n===Locomotives===\n[[File:Santa Fe FT locomotive 1941.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[EMD F-unit]] locomotives were widely used in the early years of dieselisation]]\nIn the early years American railroads imported many steam locomotives from England.

Most U.S. roads discontinued use of steam locomotives by the 1950s. A diesel engine was expensive to build, but was less complex and easier to maintain than a steam locomotive, and required only one person to operate. This meant reduced costs and greater reliability for the railroads.<ref name=\"Stover\" />{{rp|213\u201314}} Several companies developed fast [[streamliner]] trains, such as the [[Super Chief]] and the [[California Zephyr]] during the 1930s and 1940s. Their locomotives used either diesel or similar [[internal combustion engine]] designs. ''See'' [[Dieselisation#North America|Dieselisation in North America]].\n\nThough [[electric railway]]s expanded in Europe, they never reached the same popularity in North America. They were built primarily in the [[North-western United States|north-west]] and the [[North-eastern United States|north-east]] beginning in the late 19th century. While some railroads used electric locomotives for both freight and passenger trains, by the end of the 20th century most freight trains were pulled only by diesel locomotives. The Northeast Corridor, the most heavily traveled passenger line in the US, is one of few long lines currently operating with electrification. ''See'' [[Railroad electrification in the United States]].\n\n===Signalling and communications===\n[[File:Hall disc signal 1909.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Hall Signal Company|Hall disc signals]] were used in block signal systems beginning in the 1870s.]]\nEarly forms of American railroad signaling and communication were virtually non-existent.  Before [[Electrical telegraph#Morse telegraphs|telegraphs]], the American railroads initially managed their train operations using timetables.  However, there were no means of communication between drivers and dispatchers, and occasionally, two trains were sent on a collision course, or \"cornfield meets.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolmar|first=Christian|title=Blood, Iron, & Gold: How the Railroads Transformed the World|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9781586488345|page=75}}</ref> With the advent of the telegraph in the 1840s, a more sophisticated system was developed that allowed the dissemination of alterations to the timetable, known as [[train order]]s. These orders overrode the timetable, allowing the cancellation, rescheduling and addition of trains. The earliest recorded use of train orders was by the [[Erie Railroad]] in 1851.<ref>{{cite book |title=Trains Across the Continent: North American Railroad History |url=https://archive.org/details/trainsacrosscont00rudo |url-access=registration |last=Daniels |first=Rudolph |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21411-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/trainsacrosscont00rudo/page/223 223]}}</ref>\n\nThe development of the electrical [[track circuit]] in the 1870s led to the use of systems off [[North American railway signaling#Absolute or manual block|block signals]], which improved the railroads' speed, safety and efficiency.

Lines with hundreds or thousands of employees developed systematic rules and procedures, not only for running the equipment but in hiring, promoting, paying and supervising employees. The railway system of management was adopted by all major business sectors. Railways offered a new type of work experience in enterprises vastly larger in size, complexity and management. At first workers were recruited from occupations where skills were roughly analogous and transferable, that is, workshop mechanics from the iron, machine and building trades; [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]] from [[stagecoach]] drivers, steamship stewards and mail boat captains; [[station master]]s from commerce and commission agencies; and clerks from government offices.<ref>{{cite book |last=Licht |first=Walter |date=1987 |title=Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691102214}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the strikes of the 1870s and 1880s, Congress passed the ''Arbitration Act of 1888,'' which authorized the creation of [[arbitration]] panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.<ref>Arbitration Act of 1888, {{USStat|25|501}}, October 1, 1888.</ref> The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 [[Pullman Strike]], issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a [[United States district court|federal court]] [[injunction]] backed by federal troops.\n\n[[File:Railroad Coupling (CMRR).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Janney coupler|Automatic couplers]] were required by the 1893 [[Railroad Safety Appliance Act|Safety Appliance Act]].]]\nCongress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the [[Erdman Act]], passed in 1898.<ref>Erdman Act of 1898, June 1, 1898, ch. 370, {{USStat|30|424}}.</ref> This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited \"yellow dog\" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used. A successor statute, the [[Newlands Labor Act|Newlands Act]], was passed in 1913 and proved more effective,<ref>Newlands Act, July 15, 1913, ch. 6, {{USStat|38|103}}.</ref> but was largely superseded when the federal government [[nationalized]] the railroads in 1917.\n\nAs railroads expanded after the Civil War, so too did the rate of accidents among railroad personnel, especially [[Brakeman|brakemen]]. Many accidents were associated with the [[Railway coupling|coupling and uncoupling]] of railroad cars, and the operation of manually operated brakes ([[Parking brake#Railroad hand brakes|hand brakes]]). The rise in accidents led to calls for safety legislation, as early as the 1870s.<ref name=\"McDonald\">{{cite book |title=The Federal Railroad Safety Program |last=McDonald |first=Charles|year=1993 |publisher=U.S. Federal Railroad Administration |location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/safety/rail_safety_program_booklet_v2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731183723/http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/safety/rail_safety_program_booklet_v2.pdf |archive-date=2009-07-31}}</ref>{{rp|2\u20134}} In the 1880s, the number of on-the-job fatalities of railroad workers was second only to those of [[Coal mining|coal miners]].<ref name=\"McDonald\" />{{rp|5}} Through that decade, several [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] enacted safety laws.

The generation between 1865 and 1895 was already mortgaged to the railways, and no one knew it better than the generation itself.<ref>Henry Adams, ''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html The Education of Henry Adams'' (1918) p 240] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318035849/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html |date=2017-03-18 }}</ref> \nThe impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.<ref>George Rogers Taylor, ''The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860'' (New York, 1951).</ref>\n\n===Shipping freight and passengers===\nFirst they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the Telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. For highly efficient Northern railroads played a major role in winning the Civil War, while the overburdened Southern lines collapsed in the face of an insurmountable challenge.<ref>John E. Clark, Jr., ''Railroads in the Civil War: The Impact of Management on Victory and Defeat'' (2004)</ref>  In the late 19th century pipelines were built for the oil trade, and in the 20th century trucking and aviation emerged.<ref>Leland H.

Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories or canals.  The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts.   A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track.\n\nIn 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).<ref>Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age: Business, labor, and public policy, 1860\u20131897'' (1961) p 52, 68\u201374.</ref>\nFunding came from financiers throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain.<ref>Alfred D.

However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route.  Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. The larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.<ref>Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age''  (1961) pp 57\u201368.</ref> The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914.<ref>Leland H.

Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler and Stephen Salsbury. \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\" in Bruce Mazlish, ed., ''The Railroad and the Space Program'' (MIT Press, 1965)  pp 127\u201362</ref>\n\nAfter a serious accident, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers to keep track of all train movements. Discipline was essential\u2014everyone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.<ref>Chandler and Salsbury, \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\"  pp 130\u201334</ref> As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations.  The [[Erie Railroad]], faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]\u2014the largest in the world\u2014was making further advances in using bureaucracy under [[John Edgar Thomson]], president 1852\u20131874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., \"The Railroads: Pioneers in Modern Corporate Management\". ''Business History Review'' 1965 39(1): 16\u201340. {{JSTOR|3112463}}.</ref>\n\n=== Career paths===\nThe fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up to the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57.  Women were not hired.<ref>Walter Licht, ''working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983) p 289</ref>\n\nWhite-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level, they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care.  Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by the foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.<ref>Licht, ''Working for the Railroad'' pp 262\u201363. 269.</ref>  Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.<ref>Dora L. Costa, \"The evolution of retirement.\" in  Costa, ''The Evolution of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880\u20131990'' (U of Chicago Press, 1998), pp 6\u201331 [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6108.pdf online].</ref>\n\n===Early attitudes towards railroads===\nBoosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people would dress in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:\n:The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism.]] The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology....[Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime.<ref>{{cite book|author=David E.

Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores.  Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering.  Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\n: with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine the United States of continental proportions without the railroad.<ref>Gary S. Cross and Rick Szostak, ''Technology and American society: A history'' (2005) p 102.</ref>\n\nThe engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.<ref>Robert Zussman, ''Mechanics of the middle class: work and politics among American engineers'' (1985).</ref> By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910\u20131963)|Pennsylvania Station in New York City]], and the [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington DC]].<ref>Carl W.

Railroads throughout the United States allowed quicker, more efficient transport of goods and people that were previously unavailable. Agriculture, animals, soldiers, goods, and natural resources were now able to move large distances in much shorter amounts of time. As a result, things that were not harvested before like certain tracts of arable land or animal populations were now being used.\n\n=== Galena and Chicago Union Railroad ===\n[[File:Illinois_regions_map.png|thumb|324x324px|A current map showing Chicago, Galena, Springfield,and St. Louis.]]\n[[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad|The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] was the first railway to be built from [[Chicago]]. It never reached Galena, Illinois, but it reached Clinton, Iowa, and Freeport, Illinois. This railroad marked the beginning of Chicago's economic dominance in the Midwest  though transportation of goods such as agriculture and bison hides. Railroads affected the American environment by opening up unexplored, immense tracts of the American wilderness for settlement commercialization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schivelbusch|first=Wolfgang|date=2014|title=The American Railroad|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nThe idea behind a railroad to Chicago was to steal Midwestern agricultural business from [[St. Louis]], Missouri and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin. The area around Chicago was ideal for a railroad because it was flat and grassy. Citizens of Chicago believed they could use their environment for commercial gain by actually buying goods grown from the land as well as increasing the value the value of adjacent land neighboring the railroad. The Galena and Chicago Union railroad underwent construction in March 1848 to have the railroad run through Chicago, a booming Midwest town. In order to fund this, local Illinoisans pledged together to build a railway because of the potential economic prosperity. William Cronon writes, \u201dBy the following April [1849], over twelve hundred people had pledged to buy stock hypothetically valued at about $350,000, though they had paid only about $20,000 in actual cash.\u201d Farmers were enamored with the idea of a railroad because transporting crops and goods became much easier and more effective than traveling on dirt roads that could easily become muddy or impassable, so they pledged a lot of their money towards the venture. The process of local funding was stock installments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Nature's Metropolis|last=Cronon|first=William|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=1991|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nBy 1852, the Galena and Chicago Union railroad supplied Chicago over half of its wheat. This statistic changed the way people thought about the environment and its railways because railways through the countryside provided Chicagoans with increased wealth; railways became a symbol of mastery over land by being able to transport anything across terrain. This mastery coupled with an aligning of railroads with prosperity and wealth changed the way Chicagoans saw railways. It was a beacon of hope and deliverer of goods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Impact on buffalo population ==\n[[File:\"Rath & Wright's buffalo hide yard in 1878, showing 40,000 buffalo hides, Dodge City, Kansas.\" - NARA - 520093.tif|thumb|323x323px|A buffalo hide yard in Dodge City, Kansas, in 1878.]]\n[[File:William_Temple_Hornaday.jpeg|thumb|236x236px|Willam Hornaday, a leading conservationist of the 19th century.]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, herds of [[American bison|buffalo]] were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4\u20136 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, \"as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began.\" Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcasses that were left behind by hunters. There were so many rotting, pungent, bison corpses that nature's scavengers did not have enough power to consume.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Railroaded|last=White|first=Richard|publisher=W.W.

He describes the pristine wilderness \"long before the white man and long before the wheel\" and before pioneers started to build mines, mills, and factories in the verdant land. Because of the optimism for wealth and adventure, Lightfoot claims, \"The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring.\" He also describes the cost this industry had on nature by penning the line, \"Open her heart let the life blood flow.\" He describes nature's heart as being bled by the workers' dreams, which could not be stopped, \"Into the muskeg and into the rain.\" Because man wants to be in control of nature and conquer it, he wants to be able to say,\n\n\"On the mountain tops we stand\n\nAll the world at our command\n\nWe have opened up the soil\n\nWith our teardrops and our toil\"\n\nThrough hard work technology, pioneers and businessmen adapted the environment for their own commercial needs and quest for power.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian Railway Trilogy|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Gordon|work=The Way I Feel}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThere is no question about the importance of railroads in American history.  Churella finds that back in the 1950s business and economic historians, led by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] and [[Robert Fogel]], made railroads the centerpiece of advanced historiography.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E. Woodworth|title=The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb3ANWoZt1YC&pg=PA567|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|page=567|isbn=9780313290190}}</ref>  That era has passed as graduate programs have faded away, courses on railroad history do not make the curriculum, and the historiography has shifted away from professional historian to the \"railfans\"\u2014very well informed amateur writers fascinated by the memorabilia, technology and locomotives of the steam era. Looking at the voluminous output of railfan authors, Klein says:\n\n:The vast bulk of this work is devoted to minute descriptions of power, rolling stock, obscure short lines, and technical subjects....  But few address the larger questions of railroad history or place their topic in broader contexts.<ref>Maury Klein, ''Unfinished Business: The Railroad in American Life'' (1994) p. 169</ref><ref>Albert J. Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" ''Enterprise & Society,'' (2006) 7#3, pp. 581\u2013591</ref>\n\nThe result is a multiplicity of histories of specific railroads, large and small. Typically they deal with standard topics: the builders and their organizational, legislative and financial dealings; colorful construction crews laying down wood ties and steel rail; the development of locomotives and passenger cars; boosters who sought a stop in their little town else it would die; the 1880\u20131920 golden age of the passenger long-distance travel and local excursions; the steady erosion of passenger service during the automobile age; the freight agent and the small-town depot. They end with the more recent saga of retrenchment, merger, and abandonment.<ref name=\"Churella pp. 581-591\">Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" pp. 581\u2013591</ref><ref>Wallace Farnham, \"Railroads in Western History: The View from the Union Pacific,\" ''University of Wyoming Publications'' (1966), Vol. 32, pp. 95\u2013112</ref> Klein, Churella, Roth, and Franham all find that the popular writers show little interest in the development of managerial and organizational complexity of the sort that Chandler studied, or the economic impact that concerned Fogel's cohort.<ref>Marty Roth, \"Review\" of \"Minneapolis and the Age of Railways,\" ''Pioneer America Society Transactions'' (2009) vol 32 pp 185\u20136 [http://www.pioneeramerica.org/currentpast/past2009contents.html online]</ref> From outside the field of railroad history, academic labor historians now deal with the culture of the workers, strikes, the careers for blue collar and white collar men, and racial discrimination.
