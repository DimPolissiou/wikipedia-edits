It was later translated to English by [[Subodh Chunder Mitter]].<ref name=\"Mitter\">[https://openlibrary.org/b/OL6142452M/Devi_Chaudhurani Devi Chaudhurani] translated to English by Subodh Chunder Mitter</ref> Following closely after ''[[Anandamath]]'', Bankim Chandra renewed call for a resurgent India that fights against oppression of the [[British Empire]] with strength from within the common people, based on traditional Indian values of austerity, dedication and selflessness. It is another important novel in the history of Bengali and Indian literature. Since it fuelled the patriotic struggle for Indian independence from the [[British Empire]], the novel was banned by the British. The ban was lifted later by the government of India after independence. In this novel, Bankim Chandra reinforced his belief that armed face-to-face conflict with the Royal Army is the only way to win independence.\n\nVery importantly, Bankim Chandra saw the struggle being led by a woman, the protagonist, in a time when most women remained behind the purdah and did not even show their faces to men outside their immediate families. This was a tremendous inspiration to scores of women who gradually came out of their homes and actively joined the independence struggle in the decades to come. Some feminists, however, see the ending as disappointing because the protagonist prefers to build her home instead of continuing with the independence movement.\n\n==Plot summary== \n\nPrafulla is married but is shunned by her wealthy father-in-law, Haraballabh, because of a spat between him and her mother on the day of her wedding. By custom prevalent at that time, a girl, once married, could not be divorced or remarried. Heartbroken at the fate of her only child, her mother died after a few years.\n\nPrafulla takes the drastic step to flee in the middle of the night to find the house of her in-laws whom she has never known, without any money, with knowledge of only the name of the village and name of her father-in-law. Benevolent people, surprised to see her traveling alone, help her on the way. This is consistent with the custom in Bengal that all unknown women were to be treated as one's own mother. Her father in law rejects her and tells her to steal for a living. She goes back and through a lot of experiences meets the dacoit head Bhavani Thakur.  Bhavani Thakur adopts her, educates her with math, philosophy, science, literature and even wrestling.  Eventually she becomes the queen of the dacoits and her intelligence and prowess are known throughout Bengal.  Devi Chaudhurani as she's known, is the Bengali version of Robin Hood who regularly takes money from the rich and helps out the poor. Throughout she leads a very ascetic lifestyle and stays humble to her roots. In the climax, as Devi agrees to help out her father in law (he does not know who she is), he tells the British about her location.Royal Army surrounds the yacht, and the Major boards it with a few soldiers. A few rowers sit on the decks quietly, offering no resistance. Only three women and two men are found in the yacht &mdash; they all are quietly waiting for him in the royal room.\n\nWhen the men and women in the room recover, they are surrounded by a group of Queen's Guards who were quietly waiting disguised as sailors. In a single brilliant move, Devi has won the battle, captured the enemy leader, secured both her husband and father-in-law, and managed to do it with minimum loss of lives. The Major and other soldiers captured along with him are kept locked in. The women in the room agree to free Haraballabh and his son, if his son marries their sister. He agrees and Braja, Prafulla's husband is married to her again.\n\nAs they go back, Devi is accepted into the family and with her brains, training and leadership the family and the village thrive as never before. Devi won the battle.\n\n==<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sons and Lovers.|last=Lawrence, D. H.|date=2017|publisher=Dancing Unicorn Books|isbn=9781515413660|oclc=968727239}}</ref>Commentary bangla==\n\nIn this novel, Bankim Chandra emerged as a writer who is increasingly comfortable with weaving a complex story, and looked at all aspects of a novel. He wove together fun, family drama, a deep knowledge of local customs, with his message for independence from British. Unlike ''[[Anandamath]]'', he put together an alternate government in place, led by an ideal leader, steeped in Indian values, directly supported by the people.\n\nVery importantly, Bankim Chandra boldly portrayed the struggle being led by a woman, the protagonist, in a time when most women remained behind purdah and did not even show her face to men apart from her husband and siblings. He used the allegory of actual historical figures of valiant queens across India who had ably led their kingdoms and fought on battlefields. This was a tremendous inspiration to scores of women who gradually came out of their homes and actively joined the independence struggle in the decades to come. Some feminists see the ending as a disappointment however, because the protagonist preferred to build her home instead of continuing with the independence movement, and even asserted that to be the only fulfilment of a woman.<ref name=\"Ray\">{{cite book |last= Ray|first= Sangeeta|authorlink= |title= En-gendering India: woman and nation in colonial and postcolonial narratives |year= 2000|publisher= [[Duke University Press]], USA|location= India|isbn= 978-0-8223-2453-9 <!--(hardback)-->}}, Chapter 1: Gender and Nation: Woman Warriors in Chatterjee's Devi Chaudhurani and Anandamath</ref>\n\nStill Bankim Chandra's achievement was great and he knew that for his story to be accepted by the conservative society around him, he has to make compromises.

Women all across India in the next decades successfully handled their homes and still actively participated in the freedom struggle.\n\nBankim Chandra saw the need to defeat the Royal Army, but did not call for total destruction. He saw the conflict being waged with honor and compassion. Also, many of the Royal Army foot soldiers were Indians, and he possibly understood that such militant approach will be self-destructive. In the actual history of [[Indian independence movement]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] confronted the British with the weapon of [[nonviolence]], and he condemned armed militancy and terrorist tactics adopted by some freedom fighters like [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Surya Sen]].<ref name=\"Manini\">[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/charkha-gun-a-common-link/13937/0 Charkha, gun, a common link], by Manini Chatterjee</ref>\n\n==Film adaptation==\nThe novel was later adapted into a film, ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215711 Debi Chowdhurani]'' in 1974, directed by [[Dinen Gupta]], starring [[Suchitra Sen]] in the lead role, with [[Ranjit Mallick]] as Brajeswar, [[Kali Banerjee]] as Haraballabh, [[Basanta Choudhury|Basanta Chowdhury]] as Bhabani Pathak.\n\nIn [[Satyajit Ray]]'s 1966 movie ''[[Nayak (1966 film)|Nayak]]'', the plot involves a storyline where the protagonist gets snubbed by a senior actor while enacting Devi Chaudhurani.

It was later translated to English by Subodh Chunder Mitter.<ref name=\"Mitter\">[https://openlibrary.org/b/OL6142452M/Devi_Chaudhurani Devi Chaudhurani] translated to English by Subodh Chunder Mitter</ref> Following closely after ''[[Anandamath]]'', Bankim Chandra renewed call for a resurgent India that fights against oppression of the [[British Empire]] with strength from within the common people, based on traditional Indian values of austerity, dedication and selflessness. It is another important novel in the history of Bengali and Indian literature. Since it fuelled the patriotic struggle for Indian independence from the [[British Empire]], the novel was banned by the British. The ban was lifted later by the government of India after independence. In this novel, Bankim Chandra reinforced his belief that armed face-to-face conflict with the Royal Army is the only way to win independence.\n\nVery importantly, Bankim Chandra saw the struggle being led by a woman, the protagonist, in a time when most women remained behind the purdah and did not even show their faces to men outside their immediate families. This was a tremendous inspiration to scores of women who gradually came out of their homes and actively joined the independence struggle in the decades to come. Some feminists, however, see the ending as disappointing because the protagonist prefers to build her home instead of continuing with the independence movement.\n\n==Plot summary== \n\nPrafulla is married but is shunned by her wealthy father-in-law, Haraballabh, because of a spat between him and her mother on the day of her wedding. By custom prevalent at that time, a girl, once married, could not be divorced or remarried. Heartbroken at the fate of her only child, her mother died after a few years.\n\nPrafulla takes the drastic step to flee in the middle of the night to find the house of her in-laws whom she has never known, without any money, with knowledge of only the name of the village and name of her father-in-law. Benevolent people, surprised to see her traveling alone, help her on the way. This is consistent with the custom in Bengal that all unknown women were to be treated as one's own mother.\nHer father in law rejects her and tells her to steal for a living.\nShe goes back and through a lot of experiences meets the Dacoit head Bhavani Thakur.  BHavani Thakur adopts her, educates her with math, philosophy, science, literature and even wrestling.  Eventually she becomes the queen of the dacoits and her intelligence and prowess are known throughout Bengal.  Devi Chaudhurani as she's known, is the Bengali version of Robin Hood who regularly takes money from the rich and helps out the poor.  Throughout she leads a very ascetic lifestyle and stays humble to her roots.\nIn the climax, as Devi agrees to help out her father in law (he does not know who she is), he tells the British about her location.\nRoyal Army surrounds the yacht, and the Major boards it with a few soldiers. A few rowers sit on the decks quietly, offering no resistance. Only three women and two men are found in the yacht &mdash; they all are quietly waiting for him in the royal room.\n\nWhen the men and women in the room recover, they are surrounded by a group of Queen's Guards who were quietly waiting disguised as sailors. In a single brilliant move, Devi has won the battle, captured the enemy leader, secured both her husband and father-in-law, and managed to do it with minimum loss of lives. The Major and other soldiers captured along with him are kept locked in. The women in the room agree to free Haraballabh and his son, if his son marries their sister.  He agrees and Braja, Prafulla's hsband is married to her again.\n\nAs they go back, Devi is accepted into the family and with her brains, training and leadership the family and the village thrive as never before.  Devi won the battle.\n\n==<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sons and Lovers.|last=Lawrence, D. H.|date=2017|publisher=Dancing Unicorn Books|isbn=9781515413660|oclc=968727239}}</ref>Commentary bangla==\n\nIn this novel, Bankim Chandra emerged as a writer who is increasingly comfortable with weaving a complex story, and looked at all aspects of a novel. He wove together fun, family drama, a deep knowledge of local customs, with his message for independence from British. Unlike ''[[Anandamath]]'', he put together an alternate government in place, led by an ideal leader, steeped in Indian values, directly supported by the people.\n\nVery importantly, Bankim Chandra boldly portrayed the struggle being led by a woman, the protagonist, in a time when most women remained behind purdah and did not even show her face to men apart from her husband and siblings. He used the allegory of actual historical figures of valiant queens across India who had ably led their kingdoms and fought on battlefields. This was a tremendous inspiration to scores of women who gradually came out of their homes and actively joined the independence struggle in the decades to come. Some feminists see the ending as a disappointment however, because the protagonist preferred to build her home instead of continuing with the independence movement, and even asserted that to be the only fulfilment of a woman.<ref name=\"Ray\">{{cite book |last= Ray|first= Sangeeta|authorlink= |title= En-gendering India: woman and nation in colonial and postcolonial narratives |year= 2000|publisher= [[Duke University Press]], USA|location= India|isbn= 978-0-8223-2453-9 <!--(hardback)-->}}, Chapter 1: Gender and Nation: Woman Warriors in Chatterjee's Devi Chaudhurani and Anandamath</ref>\n\nStill Bankim Chandra's achievement was great and he knew that for his story to be accepted by the conservative society around him, he has to make compromises.

Women all across India in the next decades successfully handled their homes and still actively participated in the freedom struggle.\n\nBankim Chandra saw the need to defeat the Royal Army, but did not call for total destruction. He saw the conflict being waged with honor and compassion. Also, many of the Royal Army foot soldiers were Indians, and he possibly understood that such militant approach will be self-destructive. In the actual history of [[Indian independence movement]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] confronted the British with the weapon of [[nonviolence]], and he condemned armed militancy and terrorist tactics adopted by some freedom fighters like [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Surya Sen]].<ref name=\"Manini\">[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/charkha-gun-a-common-link/13937/0 Charkha, gun, a common link], by Manini Chatterjee</ref>\n\n==Film adaptation==\nThe novel was later adapted into a film, ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215711 Debi Chowdhurani]'' in 1974, directed by Dinen Gupta, starring [[Suchitra Sen]] in the lead role, with [[Ranjit Mallick]] as Brajeswar, [[Kali Banerjee]] as Haraballabh, Basanta Chowdhury as Bhabani Pathak.\n\nIn [[Satyajit Ray]]'s 1966 movie ''[[Nayak (1966 film)|Nayak]]'', the plot involves a storyline where the protagonist gets snubbed by a senior actor while enacting Devi Chaudhurani.

In May 1810, Commander Lino de Clemente, a veteran officer of the [[Spanish Navy]] who joined the April 1810 coup against the colonial government, was appointed the first Minister of Defense of the republic and began the long building of the armed forces including the formation of the navy. In April 1811 the Nautical School, with Ensign Vicente Parrado as its first superindentent, was opened by order of the national government in [[La Guaira]] to train future naval officers, months before the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, thus the Navy's origins start from this date, with its first vessels being those formerly used by the naval forces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, and participated in its first actions in the campaigns in Guayana in 1811-12, the baptism of fire for the fledgling naval service. Colonel Antonio Mendoza from the Venezuelan Army was its first commanding general.\n\nFor a long time their vessels, even if obsolete, were maintained properly by its sailors. In 1937 the Navy acquired from Italy two [[gunboat]]s of the {{sclass-|Azio|minelayer|4}} and rechristened them ''General Soublette'' and ''General Urdaneta''; these ships where retained in service until 1951<ref name=\"navyworld\">{{cite web|url=http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|title=\u0422\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0418\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110171837/http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|archive-date=10 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (for other sources in 1948<ref name=\"museocantieristica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |title=...:: Museo della Cantieristica ::... |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224205632/http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |archivedate=24 December 2014 }}</ref> or 1950<ref name=\"proflot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|title=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438, \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438, \u044f\u0445\u0442\u044b\u2026|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213907/http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 Battleships.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203050730/http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref>) and scrapped later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |title=Italian Dardanelli, ARV General Soublette - Warships 1900-1950 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006191857/http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|title=oceania / IN Ostia-1926|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027000807/http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Joint exercises===\n\nIn September, 2008, the [[Russian Navy|Russian Navy's]] nuclear-powered [[Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy|missile cruiser ''Pyotr Velikiy'']], accompanied by three other ships of Russia's [[Northern Fleet]], sailed from its base in [[Severomorsk]] on a cruise to the [[Caribbean Sea]] for a joint exercise with the Venezuelan Navy.

In May 1810, Commander Lino de Clemente, a veteran officer of the [[Spanish Navy]] who joined the April 1810 coup against the colonial government, was appointed the first Minister of Defense of the republic and began the long building of the armed forces including the formation of the navy. In April 1811 the Nautical School, with Ensign Vicente Parrado as its first superindentent, was opened by order of the national government in [[La Guaira]] to train future naval officers, months before the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, thus the Navy's origins start from this date, with its first vessels being those formerly used by the naval forces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, and participated in its first actions in the campaigns in Guayana in 1811-12, the baptism of fire for the fledgling naval service. Colonel Antonio Mendoza from the Venezuelan Army was its first commanding general.\n\nFor a long time their vessels, even if obsolete, were maintained properly by its sailors. In 1937 the Navy acquired from Italy two [[gunboat]]s of the {{sclass-|Azio|minelayer|4}} and rechristened them ''General Soublette'' and ''General Urdaneta''; these ships where retained in service until 1951<ref name=\"navyworld\">{{cite web|url=http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|title=\u0422\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0418\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110171837/http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|archive-date=10 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (for other sources in 1948<ref name=\"museocantieristica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |title=...:: Museo della Cantieristica ::... |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224205632/http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |archivedate=24 December 2014 }}</ref> or 1950<ref name=\"proflot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|title=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438, \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438, \u044f\u0445\u0442\u044b\u2026|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213907/http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 Battleships.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203050730/http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref>) and scrapped later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |title=Italian Dardanelli, ARV General Soublette - Warships 1900-1950 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006191857/http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|title=oceania / IN Ostia-1926|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027000807/http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Joint exercises===\n\nIn September, 2008, the [[Russian Navy|Russian Navy's]] nuclear-powered [[Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy|missile cruiser ''Pyotr Velikiy'']], accompanied by three other ships of Russia's [[Northern Fleet]], sailed from its base in [[Severomorsk]] on a cruise to the [[Caribbean Sea]] for a joint exercise with the Venezuelan Navy.

He appeared in the wake of the [[French New Wave]] alongside contemporaries like [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]. Demy's films are celebrated for their visual style. Demy's style drew upon diverse sources such as classic Hollywood musicals, the documentary realism of his New Wave colleagues, fairy tales, jazz, Japanese manga, and the opera. His films contain overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by [[Michel Legrand]]) and motifs like teenage love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality. He is best known for the two musicals he directed in the mid-1960s: ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Young Girls of Rochefort]]'' (1967).\n\n==Career==\nAfter working with the animator [[Paul Grimault]] and the filmmaker [[Georges Rouquier]], Demy directed ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'', his first feature film, in 1961, with [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] playing the eponymous cabaret singer. The Demy universe emerges here: Characters burst into song (courtesy of composer and lifelong Demy-collaborator [[Michel Legrand]]); iconic Hollywood imagery is appropriated, as in the opening scene with the man in a white Stetson in the Cadillac; plot is dictated by the director's fascination with fate and stock themes of chance encounters and long-lost love; and the setting, as with many of Demy's films, is the French Atlantic coast of his childhood, specifically the seaport town of Nantes.\n\n''[[La Baie des Anges]]'' (''The Bay of Angels'', 1963), starring [[Jeanne Moreau]], took the theme of fate further, with its story of love at the roulette tables.\n\nDemy is perhaps best known for his original musical ''[[Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]'' (''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'', 1964), with a score by Legrand. The whimsical concept of singing all the dialogue sets the tone for this tragedy of the everyday. The film also sees the emergence of Demy's trademark visual style, shot in saturated supercolour, with every detail\u2014neckties, wallpaper, [[Catherine Deneuve]]'s bleached-blonde hair\u2014selected for visual impact. Roland Cassard, the young man from ''Lola'' ([[Marc Michel]]) reappears here, marrying Deneuve's character. Such reappearances are typical of Demy's work. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] was a huge fan of ''Les Parapluies'', writing in private correspondence: \"I saw ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That's all right. I like to have my heart broken.\"\n\nDemy's subsequent films never quite captured audience and critical acclaim the way ''Les Parapluies'' did, although he continued to make ambitious and original dramas and musicals. ''[[Les Demoiselles de Rochefort]]'' (1967), another whimsical-yet-melancholic musical, features Deneuve and her sister [[Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac]] as sisters living in the seaside town of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], daughters of [[Danielle Darrieux]]. It was shot in color widescreen [[CinemaScope]] and featured an Oscar-nominated musical score as well as dance appearances by [[Gene Kelly]] and ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'''s [[George Chakiris]].\n\nIn 1968, after [[Columbia Pictures]] gave Demy a lucrative offer to shoot his first film in America, he and his wife, film director [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], moved to Los Angeles briefly. Demy's movie was a naturalistic drama: 1969's ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]''. Lola (Anouk Aim\u00e9e) reappears, her dreams shattered, her life having taken a turn for the worse. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre (Jeanne Moreau's character from ''Bay of Angels''), Lola is scrounging to make enough money to return to France and her child by working as a nude model in a backdoor model-shop on the [[Sunset Strip]]. She runs into an aimless, young architect ([[Gary Lockwood]]), who navigates the streets of Los Angeles; like Lola, he is looking for love and meaning in life.

He appeared in the wake of the [[French New Wave]] alongside contemporaries like [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]. Demy's films are celebrated for their visual style. Demy's style drew upon diverse sources such as classic Hollywood musicals, the documentary realism of his New Wave colleagues, fairy tales, jazz, Japanese manga, and the opera. His films contain overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by [[Michel Legrand]]) and motifs like teenage love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality. He is best known for the two musicals he directed in the mid-1960s: ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Young Girls of Rochefort]]'' (1967).\n\n==Career==\nAfter working with the animator [[Paul Grimault]] and the filmmaker [[Georges Rouquier]], Demy directed ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'', his first feature film, in 1961, with [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] playing the eponymous cabaret singer. The Demy universe emerges here: Characters burst into song (courtesy of composer and lifelong Demy-collaborator [[Michel Legrand]]); iconic Hollywood imagery is appropriated, as in the opening scene with the man in a white Stetson in the Cadillac; plot is dictated by the director's fascination with fate and stock themes of chance encounters and long-lost love; and the setting, as with many of Demy's films, is the French Atlantic coast of his childhood, specifically the seaport town of Nantes.\n\n''[[La Baie des Anges]]'' (''The Bay of Angels'', 1963), starring [[Jeanne Moreau]], took the theme of fate further, with its story of love at the roulette tables.\n\nDemy is perhaps best known for his original musical ''[[Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]'' (''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'', 1964), with a score by Legrand. The whimsical concept of singing all the dialogue sets the tone for this tragedy of the everyday. The film also sees the emergence of Demy's trademark visual style, shot in saturated supercolour, with every detail\u2014neckties, wallpaper, [[Catherine Deneuve]]'s bleached-blonde hair\u2014selected for visual impact. Roland Cassard, the young man from ''Lola'' ([[Marc Michel]]) reappears here, marrying Deneuve's character. Such reappearances are typical of Demy's work. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] was a huge fan of ''Les Parapluies'', writing in private correspondence: \"I saw ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That's all right. I like to have my heart broken.\"\n\nDemy's subsequent films never quite captured audience and critical acclaim the way ''Les Parapluies'' did, although he continued to make ambitious and original dramas and musicals. ''[[Les Demoiselles de Rochefort]]'' (1967), another whimsical-yet-melancholic musical, features Deneuve and her sister [[Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac]] as sisters living in the seaside town of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], daughters of [[Danielle Darrieux]]. It was shot in color widescreen [[CinemaScope]] and featured an Oscar-nominated musical score as well as dance appearances by [[Gene Kelly]] and ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'''s [[George Chakiris]].\n\nIn 1968, after [[Columbia Pictures]] gave Demy a lucrative offer to shoot his first film in America, he and his wife, film director [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], moved to Los Angeles briefly. Demy's movie was a naturalistic drama: 1969's ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]''. Lola (Anouk Aim\u00e9e) reappears, her dreams shattered, her life having taken a turn for the worse. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre (Jeanne Moreau's character from ''Bay of Angels''), Lola is scrounging to make enough money to return to France and her child by working as a nude model in a backdoor model-shop on the [[Sunset Strip]]. She runs into an aimless, young architect ([[Gary Lockwood]]), who navigates the streets of Los Angeles; like Lola, he is looking for love and meaning in life. ''Model Shop'' is a time capsule of late-1960s Los Angeles and documents the death of the hippie movement, the Vietnam draft, and the ennui and misery that results from broken relationships. This bleakness and decided lack of whimsy\u2014uncharacteristic for Demy\u2014had a large amount to do with ''Model Shop'''s critical and commercial failure.\n\n''[[Peau d'\u00c2ne]]'' (''Donkey Skin'', 1970) was a step in the opposite direction as a visually extravagant musical interpretation of a classic French fairy tale which highlights the tale's incestuous overtones, starring Deneuve, [[Jean Marais]], and [[Delphine Seyrig]]. It was Demy's first foray into the world of fairy tales and historical fantasia, which he explored in ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' and ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]].''\n\nAlthough none of Demy's subsequent films captured the contemporary success of his earlier work, some have been reappraised: [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote about \"the fascinating application of the operatic technique to an unusually dark story\" in ''[[Une chambre en ville]]'' (''A Room in Town'', 1982).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} ''[[L'\u00e9v\u00e9nement le plus important depuis que l'homme a march\u00e9 sur la lune]] (1973) (\"[[A Slightly Pregnant Man]]\")'' is a look back at the pressures of [[second-wave feminism]] in France and the fears it elicited in men. ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]]'' (1979), based on the Japanese manga series ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'', has been discussed and analyzed for its [[queer studies|queer]] and political subtext (the title character is born female, her father raises her as a male so she can get ahead in 18th-century French aristocracy, and she eventually falls in love with her surrogate brother, a working-class revolutionary).\n\n''Parapluies de Cherbourg'' has been color-restored twice from original prints by Demy. In 2014, [[The Criterion Collection]] released a boxed set of Demy's \"essential\" work, with hours of supplements, essays, and restored image and sound. The films include ''Lola'', ''Bay of Angels'', ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', ''The Young Girls of Rochefort'', ''Donkey Skin'', and ''Une Chambre en Ville'' as well as most of Demy's early short films.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAs a student, Demy did not learn any foreign languages.

It is an international co-production of the United States and Australia.\n\nThe development of a new [[Invisible Man (film series)|''Invisible Man'']] film began as early as 2006. The project was revived as part of Universal's shared cinematic universe in 2016, intended to consist of their classic monsters, with [[Johnny Depp]] attached to star in the title role. After ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was released in 2017 to critical and financial failure, development was halted on all projects. In early 2019, the studio changed their plans from a serialized universe to films based on individualized story-telling, and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from July to September 2019 in [[Sydney]], Australia.\n\n''The Invisible Man'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 28, 2020, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Moss' performance, its inventive modernization of the [[The Invisible Man|novel's]] plot, and the combination of scares with \"a smart narrative about how women can be manipulated and abused in harmful relationships\".<ref name=WrapProj/> The film also became a commercial success, grossing $124&nbsp;million worldwide against a $7&nbsp;million budget and it is currently the [[2020 in film|fifth highest-grossing film of 2020]]. However, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Universal announced the film would be made available digitally-on-demand just three weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n== Plot ==\nTrapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]], Cecilia Kass drugs him with [[Diazepam]] and escapes their home into the nearby woods to wait for her sister, Emily. After she arrives, Adrian nearly catches Cecilia, but the pair are able to escape.\n\nCecilia hides out with childhood friend James, and his teenage daughter Sydney. Two weeks later, Adrian seemingly commits [[suicide]] and leaves Cecilia $5&nbsp;million in his will, handled and organized by his lawyer brother, Tom. As Cecilia tries to move forward, she is plagued by several unexplained experiences. During a job interview, she faints after finding her portfolio's contents removed and is taken to the hospital. Later, the doctor calls and says they found high levels of Diazepam in her system. Shortly after returning home, Cecilia finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with, which she dropped during her escape, in her bathroom.\n\nShe arranges a meeting with Tom and James, insisting that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but gets rebuffed. Cecilia turns to her sister, but Emily refuses to acknowledge her after receiving an email from Cecilia's account stating she never wants to see her again. Later, she is comforted by Sydney, but Sydney is hit by an unseen force, leading her and James to assume Cecilia did it. While a furious James rushes his daughter out of the house, Cecilia tries a number of tactics to catch the figure. After finding Adrian's old phone in the attic and covering the figure with paint, she ends up in a violent struggle and escapes to Adrian's home to investigate. In his lab, she finds a suit that confirms her suspicions. After hiding it in a closet, the invisible figure attacks again, so Cecilia flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet in a restaurant, though as Cecilia begins to tell her what she found, the invisible figure slits Emily's throat with a knife and places it in Cecilia's hand, framing her for the crime.\n\nRemanded to a [[mental hospital]] while she awaits trial, the staff informs Cecilia that she is pregnant. Tom visits her and offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to \"return to him\" and raise the child, implying that he helped his brother stage his suicide while revealing Adrian tampered with her [[birth control]] to ensure she became pregnant. Cecilia refuses to take the deal and steals a pen from his briefcase. That night, she uses the pen to pretend to commit suicide to draw the invisible figure out. When the figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrive, but the invisible figure violently incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital, with Cecilia in pursuit. Promising not to harm her because of her pregnancy, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves.\n\nCecilia races to James' house, where she finds the invisible figure attacking him and Sydney. She manages to shoot the figure after spraying him with a fire extinguisher, but when she unmasks him, she finds Tom in the suit. Police find a captive Adrian alive at his house, tied up in his basement and claiming Tom held him prisoner. Cecilia quickly disagrees, insisting the brothers must have shared the suit, with Adrian sending Tom to the house knowing what would happen.\n\nIn an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house to discuss her pregnancy while James listens in on a wire. She agrees to mend their relationship, but only if he confesses to being the invisible figure. Adrian insists Tom did kidnap him, claiming that the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her in their relationship. When she begins to cry, Adrian alludes to former abuse using similar phrasing to that of the invisible figure. Smiling, Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the room's security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide. Cecilia returns and, apparently distraught, calls the police. Out of the camera's sight, however, she silently taunts Adrian, having retrieved the spare suit she hid earlier to kill him.\n\nWhen James arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. He spots the suit in her bag, but accepts her story and allows her to leave. Relieved and overjoyed, Cecilia leaves the house with the suit.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Cecilia \"Cee\" Kass\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]]\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as James Lanier, a San Francisco police detective, Emily\u2019s ex-husband, Sydney's father and Cee\u2019s childhood friend\n* [[Storm Reid]] as Sydney Lanier, James' teenage daughter\n* [[Harriet Dyer]] as Emily Kass, Cee\u2019s sister\n* [[Michael Dorman]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Tom Griffin]], Adrian's brother and lawyer\n*[[Benedict Hardie]] as Marc\n* Amali Golden as Annie\n* Sam Smith as Detective Reckley\n* [[Nash Edgerton]] as a Security Guard\n* Zara Michaels as a Nurse\n* Vivienne Greer as Screaming Woman\n* [[Anthony Brandon Wong]] as Accident Victim\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of a new ''The Invisible Man'' film began as early as 2006 when [[David S.

The project was revived as part of Universal's shared cinematic universe in 2016, intended to consist of their classic monsters, with [[Johnny Depp]] attached to star in the title role. After ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was released in 2017 to critical and financial failure, development was halted on all projects. In early 2019, the studio changed their plans from a serialized universe to films based on individualized story-telling, and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from July to September 2019 in [[Sydney]], Australia.\n\n''The Invisible Man'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 28, 2020, by [[Universal Pictures]].

However, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Universal announced the film would be made available digitally-on-demand just three weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n== Plot ==\nTrapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]], Cecilia Kass drugs him with [[Diazepam]] and escapes their home into the nearby woods to wait for her sister, Emily. After she arrives, Adrian nearly catches Cecilia, but the pair are able to escape.\n\nCecilia hides out with childhood friend James, and his teenage daughter Sydney. Two weeks later, Adrian seemingly commits [[suicide]] and leaves Cecilia $5&nbsp;million in his will, handled and organized by his lawyer brother, Tom. As Cecilia tries to move forward, she is plagued by several unexplained experiences. During a job interview, she faints after finding her portfolio's contents removed and is taken to the hospital. Later, the doctor calls and says they found high levels of Diazepam in her system. Shortly after returning home, Cecilia finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with, which she dropped during her escape, in her bathroom.\n\nShe arranges a meeting with Tom and James, insisting that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but gets rebuffed. Cecilia turns to her sister, but Emily refuses to acknowledge her after receiving an email from Cecilia's account stating she never wants to see her again. Later, she is comforted by Sydney, but Sydney is hit by an unseen force, leading her and James to assume Cecilia did it. While a furious James rushes his daughter out of the house, Cecilia tries a number of tactics to catch the figure. After finding Adrian's old phone in the attic and covering the figure with paint, she ends up in a violent struggle and escapes to Adrian's home to investigate. In his lab, she finds a suit that confirms her suspicions. After hiding it in a closet, the invisible figure attacks again, so Cecilia flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet in a restaurant, though as Cecilia begins to tell her what she found, the invisible figure slits Emily's throat with a knife and places it in Cecilia's hand, framing her for the crime.\n\nRemanded to a [[mental hospital]] while she awaits trial, the staff informs Cecilia that she is pregnant. Tom visits her and offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to \"return to him\" and raise the child, implying that he helped his brother stage his suicide while revealing Adrian tampered with her [[birth control]] to ensure she became pregnant. Cecilia refuses to take the deal and steals a pen from his briefcase. That night, she uses the pen to pretend to commit suicide to draw the invisible figure out. When the figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrive, but the invisible figure violently incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital, with Cecilia in pursuit. Promising not to harm her because of her pregnancy, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves.\n\nCecilia races to James' house, where she finds the invisible figure attacking him and Sydney. She manages to shoot the figure after spraying him with a fire extinguisher, but when she unmasks him, she finds Tom in the suit. Police find a captive Adrian alive at his house, tied up in his basement and claiming Tom held him prisoner. Cecilia quickly disagrees, insisting the brothers must have shared the suit, with Adrian sending Tom to the house knowing what would happen.\n\nIn an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house to discuss her pregnancy while James listens in on a wire. She agrees to mend their relationship, but only if he confesses to being the invisible figure. Adrian insists Tom did kidnap him, claiming that the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her in their relationship. When she begins to cry, Adrian alludes to former abuse using similar phrasing to that of the invisible figure. Smiling, Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the room's security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide. Cecilia returns and, apparently distraught, calls the police. Out of the camera's sight, however, she silently taunts Adrian, having retrieved the spare suit she hid earlier to kill him.\n\nWhen James arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. He spots the suit in her bag, but accepts her story and allows her to leave. Relieved and overjoyed, Cecilia leaves the house with the suit.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Cecilia \"Cee\" Kass\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]]\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as James Lanier, a San Francisco police detective, Emily\u2019s ex-husband, Sydney's father and Cee\u2019s childhood friend\n* [[Storm Reid]] as Sydney Lanier, James' teenage daughter\n* [[Harriet Dyer]] as Emily Kass, Cee\u2019s sister\n* [[Michael Dorman]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Tom Griffin]], Adrian's brother and lawyer\n* Benedict Hardie as Marc\n* Amali Golden as Annie\n* Sam Smith as Detective Reckley\n* [[Nash Edgerton]] as a Security Guard\n* Zara Michaels as a Nurse\n* Vivienne Greer as Screaming Woman\n* [[Anthony Brandon Wong]] as Accident Victim\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of a new ''The Invisible Man'' film began as early as 2006 when [[David S.
