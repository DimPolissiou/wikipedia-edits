Of the 4% of non-survivors, half were due to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatments. Another 4% of these patients suffered relapses, primarily in the local area of surgery rare cases of relapse due to lung or bone metastasis.. About 60% of these recurrent cases had a complete remission following further treatment. Recurrent disease was treated with a second surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy that often [[vincristine]] and [[actinomycin]] treatment.<ref name=\"pmid28124468\"/> Removal of the entire afflicted kidney plus the peri-renal fat appears critical to avoiding local recurrences. In general, patients who were older than 3 months of age at diagnosis or had the cellular form of the disease, stage III disease, or involvement of renal lymph nodes had a higher recurrence rate. Among patients with these risk factors, only those with lymph node involvement are recommended for further therapy.<ref name=\"pmid25295083\"/>\n\nIt has been suggested that mesoblastic nephroma patients with lymph node involvement or recurrent disease might benefit by adding the [[ALK inhibitor]], [[crizotinib]], or a [[tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor, either [[larotrectinib]] or [[entrectinib]], to surgical, radiation, and/or [[chemotherapy]] treatment regimens.

As of 2017, Australia has won the most Commonwealth Games gold medals with 852 and England sits second on the table with 669 gold medals.\n\n==Association football==\n[[Association football]] is the [[national sport]] in England. The [[English Premier League]] is widely considered to be one of the strongest and most popular football competitions in the world. Conversely, [[Soccer in Australia|Association football in Australia]] is often referred to as 'soccer' and the domestic [[A-League]] competition is considered to be one of the minor professional leagues in the country. Despite the major gulf in interest, the [[Australia national soccer team|Australian national team]] is very popular which has seen a rivalry develop with the [[England national football team|English national team]]. The two nations first played each other in 1980, which saw England defeat Australia 2-1 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. The two teams played each other another four times in the 1980s and 1990s which resulted in English victories or draws.\n\nAfter 12 years of absence, Australia and England scheduled a friendly match at [[Upton Park, London]] on 12 February 2003. The English were strong favourites going into the match as they fielded a near [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] strength team while Australia failed to even qualify for the previous year's World Cup. Despite entering the clash as the heavy underdogs, Australia pulled off a stunning upset over England with a 3-1 victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/13/1044927700559.html|title=Socceroos win 3-1 against England - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 March 2016 it was announced that the [[Stadium of Light]] would host England for a friendly against Australia on 27 May 2016 as part of their preparations for [[Euro 2016]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2016/feb/england-euro-preparation-games-announced-180216|title=England to play in Manchester and Sunderland as part of Euro 2016 preparation - England - The FA|first=The Football|last=Association|publisher=}}</ref> The sold-out match finished in a 2-1 victory for England, with goals from [[Marcus Rashford]] (on his international debut), [[Wayne Rooney]] and an [[own goal]] from [[Eric Dier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36339159.html|title=England win 2-1 against Socceroos}}</ref>\n\n==Cricket==\n{{main|The Ashes}}\n[[File:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest published photo of [[the Ashes urn]], from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 1921]]\nMany sports analysts consider a [[Test cricket]] competition (referred to as [[The Ashes]]) to be the most intense form of all sporting rivalries involving the two nations. The competition is officially contested between [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]] but the three nations of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] competed under the English flag up until 1992 when the [[Scotland national cricket team|Scots began to compete independently]]. Welsh cricket players continue to compete for England with [[Simon Jones (cricketer)|Simon Jones]] being a recent example of a Welsh player competing for England in the [[2005 Ashes series]]. The first Ashes series was contested in [[Australian cricket team in England in 1884|1884]].\n\nFollowing England's home Test defeat in 1882, English journalist [[Reginald Shirley Brooks]] wrote a mock obituary for ''[[The Sporting Times]]'' that notified the public of English cricket's death and stated \"''The body and contents will be cremated and the ashes sent to Australia''\". Later that year, during [[English cricket team in Australia in 1882\u201383|England's 1882-83 tour of Australia]], English captain [[Ivo Bligh]] declared he would \"recover those ashes\" and received a miniature [[urn]] which is believed to contain the ashes of a burnt bail. \n\n[[Bodyline]] was a tactic developed by the English cricket team for the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932\u201333|1932\u201333 Ashes tour of Australia]],  specifically to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's [[Donald Bradman]]. England's use of a tactic perceived by some as overly aggressive or even unfair ultimately threatened diplomatic relations between the two countries before the situation was calmed. A bodyline delivery was one where the cricket ball was bowled at the body of the batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, to the point of being unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.\n\nOn 9 June 2013, Australian [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] infamously punched English batsman [[Joe Root]] inside [[Birmingham]]'s [[Walkabout (pub chain)|Walkabout Pub]]. The incident was believed to have been triggered by Root's decision to wear an Australian wig around his chin in a manner that was perceived by Warner to have been a racial taunt. Warner was subsequently temporarily banished from the Australian national team and applied a self-imposed alcohol ban.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/03/david-warner-lifts-lid-walkabout-bar-jo-root-england-australia |title=David Warner lifts lid on Walkabout bar run-in with Joe Root |publisher=theguardian.com |date=4 July 2015 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe two nations have also met in other important cricket fixtures that weren't played at the Test level. One recent example being the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]] final that England won by 7 wickets.\n\n==Golf==\nOne of golf's greatest rivalries played out in the 1990s between Australian [[Greg Norman]] and Englishman [[Nick Faldo]].\n\n==Mixed Martial Arts==\nIn May 2012, it was announced that the upcoming series of [[The Ultimate Fighter]] would see UK fighters pitted against Australian fighters in what was labeled ''[[The Ultimate Fighter: The Smashes|The Smashes]]'', a play on the 130 year-old cricket rivalry between England and Australia called [[The Ashes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/UFC-Officially-Announces-The-Ultimate-Fighter-Australia-vs-UK-Tryouts-to-Be-Held-in-June-42597 |title=UFC Officially Announces 'The Ultimate Fighter: Australia vs. UK', Tryout to be held in June |publisher=sherdog.com |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref> The casting call was for Lightweight and Welterweight fighters who were at least 21 years old and had a minimum of two wins in three professional fights. Australia's [[Robert Whittaker (fighter)|Robert Whittaker]] came out victorious in the Welterweight tournament with a unanimous decision victory over Englishman [[Brad Scott (fighter)|Brad Scott]] in the tournament final.\n\nWhittaker would once again stir up the rivalry in July 2017 after capturing the interim UFC Middleweight Championship. In a post-fight interview, he told champion and Englishman [[Michael Bisping]] it was \"fate\" that they would be fighting for the championship. Bisping responded by storming the Octagon and telling Whittaker he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d with said interim belt. The two are expected to fight for the championship in the near future.\n\n==Rugby league==\nThe two nations have met in the final of the [[Rugby League World Cup]] eight times, with Australia winning six of their meetings.\n\n==Rugby union==\n{{main|History of rugby union matches between Australia and England}}\n[[File:Jonny Wilkinson Twickenham cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Johnny Wilkinson kicked the winning drop goal in extra time of the [[2003 Rugby World Cup Final]].]]\nThe [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian]] and [[England national rugby union team|English]] national rugby union teams first met in 1909 at Blackheath with the Australians coming out victorious 9-3. The win was considered something of a black eye at the time in a sport that epitomised a militaristic public schooled sense of athletic rectitude, and was dismissed as a product of outrageous good fortune in the English press, with the Manchester Guardian saying the Aussies\u2019 \u201cnippiness and grit got them through, but their football\u2026 was rarely removed from the commonplace\u201d.\n\nThe Battle of Ballymore between Australia and a majority-English British and Irish Lions in 1989<ref>{{cite web | url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/bodyline-ballymore-england-australias-long-sporting-rivalry-043908970--spt.html | title=From Bodyline to Ballymore: England, Australia's long sporting rivalry | publisher=Yahoo! News | date=October 2019 | accessdate=22 October 2019 | first=Julian  |last=Guyer}}</ref> was described by Mike Teague, who played in it, as \u201cthe most violent game of rugby that has ever been played\u201d.\n\nThe two nations met in the final of the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] and the highly fancied Australians had not lost a World Cup match in eight years leading into the match. Despite having home advantage, Australia would lose the final by three points in extra time as Englishman [[Jonny Wilkinson]] nailed a drop goal with 26 seconds remaining to break Australian hearts. \n\nAs of the conclusion of the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]], the ledger between the two nations stands at 25 wins apiece.\n\n==Tennis==\nThe two teams, then known as [[Australasia Davis Cup team|Australasia]] and the [[British Isles Davis Cup team|British Isles]], played off in the [[1907 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1907 Davis Cup]] final. Australia would win the encounter 3-2 and in doing so captured their first ever Davis Cup title. The most recent Davis Cup meeting between the two nations took place at the [[2015 Davis Cup World Group#Semifinals|2015 Davis Cup semifinals]]. Great Britain, led by Scot [[Andy Murray]], defeated Australia 3-2 in [[Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome|Glasgow]] and sealed their first finals appearance in 37 years. The Davis Cup ledger stands at 8-5 in Australia's favour.\n\nOutside of Davis Cup, countrymen of the two nations have competed in many Grand Slam finals with the most recent meeting occurring at the [[1997 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1997 US Open Men's Final]]. Australian [[Patrick Rafter]] defeated Brit [[Greg Rusedski]] 6\u20133, 6\u20132, 4\u20136, 7\u20135 to capture the 1997 US Open Championship. Another notable meeting between countrymen of the two nations played out in a [[2002 Wimbledon Championships|2002 Wimbledon]] semifinal between Australian [[Lleyton Hewitt]] and Englishman [[Tim Henman]]. Henman, who had reached the Wimbledon semifinals three of the previous four Championships, was considered Britain's best chance to break their 66-year drought at Wimbledon and received enormous coverage leading into the clash with Hewitt. Despite the vocal crowd in attendance, Hewitt defeated Henman and went on to claim the Wimbledon title with a straight sets victory in the final.\n\n==Supporters==\n===Barmy Army===\nThe [[Barmy Army]] is a semi-organised group of [[English people|English]] [[cricket]] [[fan (aficionado)|fan]]s which arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the [[English cricket team]] on overseas tours. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. The group was given its name by the Australian media during the 1994 - 1995 Test series in Australia, reportedly for the fans' audacity in travelling to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting even when England were losing quite badly.\n\n===Fanatics===\nFanatics officially began in 1997 with the aim of forming an organised, passionate & patriotic support group that would follow Australian Sport at home & around the world.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{National sports teams of Australia}}\n{{National sports teams of England}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Australia-England sports rivalries}}\n[[Category:Australia\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:Sports rivalries in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sports rivalries]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Bilateral relations|Australia\u2013England|Australia|England}}\n\nThe Australia\u2013England sporting rivalry is one which spreads across multiple sports and can be traced back as far as 1868.\n\n==History==\nIt is believed that the initial trigger of the [[Australia]]-[[England]] sporting rivalry began with an insulting article written in a local British Newspaper in the 19th century. \u201cNothing of interest comes from Australia except gold and black cricketers,\u201d proclaimed the [[The Daily Telegraph|British Daily Telegraph]] in 1868 with a mixture of colonial arrogance and paternal intrigue.\n\n==Commonwealth Games==\nAustralia and England have topped the medal tally in every edition of the Commonwealth Games, with the exception of the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]] where home nation [[Canada at the Commonwealth Games|Canada]] came out victorious.

Despite having home advantage, Australia would lose the final by three points in extra time as Englishman [[Jonny Wilkinson]] nailed a drop goal with 26 seconds remaining to break Australian hearts. \n\nAs of the conclusion of the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]], the ledger between the two nations stands at 25 wins apiece.\n\n==Tennis==\nThe two teams, then known as [[Australasia Davis Cup team|Australasia]] and the [[British Isles Davis Cup team|British Isles]], played off in the [[1907 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1907 Davis Cup]] final. Australia would win the encounter 3-2 and in doing so captured their first ever Davis Cup title. The most recent Davis Cup meeting between the two nations took place at the [[2015 Davis Cup World Group#Semifinals|2015 Davis Cup semifinals]]. Great Britain, led by Scot [[Andy Murray]], defeated Australia 3-2 in [[Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome|Glasgow]] and sealed their first finals appearance in 37 years. The Davis Cup ledger stands at 8-5 in Australia's favour.\n\nOutside of Davis Cup, countrymen of the two nations have competed in many Grand Slam finals with the most recent meeting occurring at the [[1997 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1997 US Open Men's Final]]. Australian [[Patrick Rafter]] defeated Brit [[Greg Rusedski]] 6\u20133, 6\u20132, 4\u20136, 7\u20135 to capture the 1997 US Open Championship. Another notable meeting between countrymen of the two nations played out in a [[2002 Wimbledon Championships|2002 Wimbledon]] semifinal between Australian [[Lleyton Hewitt]] and Englishman [[Tim Henman]]. Henman, who had reached the Wimbledon semifinals three of the previous four Championships, was considered Britain's best chance to break their 66-year drought at Wimbledon and received enormous coverage leading into the clash with Hewitt. Despite the vocal crowd in attendance, Hewitt defeated Henman and went on to claim the Wimbledon title with a straight sets victory in the final.\n\n==Supporters==\n===Barmy Army===\nThe [[Barmy Army]] is a semi-organised group of [[English people|English]] [[cricket]] [[fan (aficionado)|fan]]s which arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the [[English cricket team]] on overseas tours. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. The group was given its name by the Australian media during the 1994 - 1995 Test series in Australia, reportedly for the fans' audacity in travelling to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting even when England were losing quite badly.\n\n===Fanatics===\nFanatics officially began in 1997 with the aim of forming an organised, passionate & patriotic support group that would follow Australian Sport at home & around the world.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{National sports teams of Australia}}\n{{National sports teams of England}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Australia-England sports rivalries}}\n[[Category:Australia\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:Sports rivalries in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sports rivalries]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia%E2%80%93England_sports_rivalries"}

For a clock chiming mechanism, this has the advantage that the mechanism that trips the hammers need only store five sequences (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) instead of ten.  The mechanism then plays two complete sets of five sequences for each complete hour.  In musical terms, the first and third quarters finish on the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] (B), whilst the second and fourth quarters (the half and full hours) finish on the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] (E).  This produces the very satisfying musical effect that has contributed so much to the popularity of the chimes. Note that the pitch of the Big Ben clip is closer to F than E in modern [[concert pitch]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Big ben closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Big Ben]] (the Elizabeth Tower) at the [[Palace of Westminster]], the namesake of the chime]]\n\nIt was written in 1793 for a new clock in [[St Mary the Great with St Michael, Cambridge|St Mary the Great, the University Church]] in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. There is some doubt over exactly who composed it: Revd Dr [[Joseph Jowett]], [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Civil Law]], was given the job, but he was probably assisted by either [[John Randall (Cambridge)|Dr John Randall]] (1715\u201399), who was the [[Professor of Music, Cambridge University|Professor of Music]] from 1755, or his brilliant undergraduate pupil, [[William Crotch]] (1775\u20131847). This chime is traditionally, though without substantiation, believed to be a set of variations on the four notes that make up the fifth and sixth bars of \"[[Messiah Part III#45|I know that my Redeemer liveth]]\" from [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.<ref>Claimed for example by [http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.00.6.4/mto.00.6.4.harrison_essay.html Harrison, \"Tolling Time\", note 16] in Music Theory Online 6/4, October 2000.</ref> This is why the chime is also played by the bells of the so-called 'Red Tower' in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], the native town of Handel.\n\nIn 1851, the chime was adopted by [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Edmund Beckett Denison]] (an amateur [[horology|horologist]], and graduate of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], who was very familiar with the St Mary's chime) for the new clock at the [[Palace of Westminster]], where [[Big Ben]] hangs. From there its fame spread. It is now one of the most commonly used chimes for [[striking clock]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/what-tune-does-big-ben-chime/|title=What tune does Big Ben chime?

Howard & Co.]], Boston, MA. The clock and chime in Trinity's steeple base was dedicated in December 1875. It holds the distinction of being the first tower clock in the United States to sound the Cambridge Quarters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trinity-williamsport.diocpa.org/History/history.html|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=trinity-williamsport.diocpa.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2015}}\n{{example farm|date=September 2015}}\n}}\n*Many Football team fans use the supporter chant which were inspired by the Westminster Chimes.\n*The chime is also used in some [[doorbell]]s and [[bell (school)|school bells]].

For a clock chiming mechanism, this has the advantage that the mechanism that trips the hammers need only store five sequences (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) instead of ten.  The mechanism then plays two complete sets of five sequences for each complete hour.  In musical terms, the first and third quarters finish on the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] (B), whilst the second and fourth quarters (the half and full hours) finish on the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] (E).  This produces the very satisfying musical effect that has contributed so much to the popularity of the chimes. Note that the pitch of the Big Ben clip is closer to F than E in modern [[concert pitch]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Big ben closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Big Ben]] (the Elizabeth Tower) at the [[Palace of Westminster]], the namesake of the chime]]\n\nIt was written in 1793 for a new clock in [[St Mary the Great with St Michael, Cambridge|St Mary the Great, the University Church]] in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. There is some doubt over exactly who composed it: Revd Dr [[Joseph Jowett]], [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Civil Law]], was given the job, but he was probably assisted by either [[John Randall (Cambridge)|Dr John Randall]] (1715\u201399), who was the [[Professor of Music, Cambridge University|Professor of Music]] from 1755, or his brilliant undergraduate pupil, [[William Crotch]] (1775\u20131847). This chime is traditionally, though without substantiation, believed to be a set of variations on the four notes that make up the fifth and sixth bars of \"[[Messiah Part III#45|I know that my Redeemer liveth]]\" from [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.<ref>Claimed for example by [http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.00.6.4/mto.00.6.4.harrison_essay.html Harrison, \"Tolling Time\", note 16] in Music Theory Online 6/4, October 2000.</ref> This is why the chime is also played by the bells of the so-called 'Red Tower' in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], the native town of Handel.\n\nIn 1851, the chime was adopted by [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Edmund Beckett Denison]] (an amateur [[horology|horologist]], and graduate of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], who was very familiar with the St Mary's chime) for the new clock at the [[Palace of Westminster]], where [[Big Ben]] hangs. From there its fame spread. It is now one of the most commonly used chimes for [[striking clock]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/what-tune-does-big-ben-chime/|title=What tune does Big Ben chime?

Howard & Co.]], Boston, MA. The clock and chime in Trinity's steeple base was dedicated in December 1875. It holds the distinction of being the first tower clock in the United States to sound the Cambridge Quarters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trinity-williamsport.diocpa.org/History/history.html|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=trinity-williamsport.diocpa.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2015}}\n{{example farm|date=September 2015}}\n}}\n*Many Football team fans use the supporter chant which were inspired by the Westminster Chimes.\n*The chime is also used in some [[doorbell]]s and [[bell (school)|school bells]]. Most schools in [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], and [[South Korea]] play the chimes to signal the end and beginning of classes.\n*Some electronic [[civil defense siren]]s in the United States manufactured by [[Federal Signal Corporation]] such as the Electronic Outdoor Warning Siren ([[EOWS]]), [[Federal Signal Modulator|Modulator]], and the Directional Speaker Array (DSA) sound off the chimes on a daily basis. It is also used in Japan and the Philippines by some loudspeakers installed in public areas as a time signal.\n*On the Japanese game show ''[[Panel Quiz Attack 25]]'', which airs on [[TV Asahi]], the chimes signal the end of the game when there are any boxes left on the board.\n*In [[Indonesia]], train stations play the chimes as a sign of train departure and arrival.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Widiarini |title=Yang Kadang Terlupa dari Stasiun Terbesar di Semarang |url=https://travel.detik.com/dtravelers_stories/u-3390739/yang-kadang-terlupa-dari-stasiun-terbesar-di-semarang |accessdate=16 June 2019 |work=detikTravel |date=17 February 2017 |language=id}}</ref> Upon arrival of a train, the chimes will be looped continuously until it departs from the station, which may last up to 10\u201315 minutes. \n*In [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''[[A London Symphony]]'', the half hour (2/3) of the Westminster Quarters is heard near the beginning of the work and the first three phrases of the hour (2/3/4) near the end.\n*[[Louis Vierne]]'s organ piece ''[[Carillon de Westminster]]'' is a set of variations on one of the five chimes.\n*[[Cyrillus Kreek]]'s ''Requiem'' (1927) uses the chimes in the Introitus.\n*The rock band [[U2]] incorporated the Third Quarter chime as a guitar harmonic in the song \"[[11 O'Clock Tick Tock]]\" in 1980.\n*The ''[[Pikmin]]'' series uses the sound to signify the onset of sunset in any given day, encouraging the player to gather their Pikmin.\n*At [[Yankee Stadium]], the chimes are played whenever a member of the [[New York Yankees]] scores a run, a tradition that began at their original ballpark.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |title=New York Yankees say goodbye to cathedral of baseball |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/20/usa |date=19 September 2008 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n*A variation of the chime is played by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] [[NBA]] [[basketball]] team at home games whenever the Lakers make a three-point shot.\n*For the satirical TV series ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''Yes, Prime Minister'', about a British politician and his interactions with the civil servants who nominally serve him, the [[theme music]] was composed by [[Ronnie Hazlehurst]] and is largely based on the chimes (though with a longer duration for the first note of each quarter, which arguably makes the derivation less obvious).

He is the head coach of the [[Murray State University]] men's tennis team.\n\n==Early years==\nPurcell grew up in [[Murray, Kentucky]], and played in the Kentucky State Tennis Tournament as a fifth-grader, and won two state doubles crowns with older brother Del as a middle schooler. He made the state singles finals three straight years, winning as a senior.\n\nPurcell graduated [[Murray High School (Kentucky)|Murray High School]] and went on to Memphis State University (now the [[University of Memphis]]), where he played for one year. He transferred to the [[University of Tennessee]], where in 1980 he won an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] doubles championship with teammate [[Rodney Harmon]].\n\n==Pro career==\nPurcell made his debut on the professional circuit in the summer of 1980. As a wild card entrant at the Washington (D.C.) Star Tournament, he upset top-ranked [[Eddie Dibbs]]. Two weeks later, he qualified for a spot in the U.S. Clay Courts, where he beat [[Hank Pfister]] and top-10 ranked [[Harold Solomon]] before falling in the finals to [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc]]. Purcell saw his Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranking soar from the 300s to the top 40 and was crowned 1980 ATP Rookie of the Year.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mel card.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Intel Ad|From 2006 [[Ace Authentic]] Heroes & Legends series<ref name=\"cards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aceauthentic.com/item/2006-heroes-and-legends-series-box/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206173147/http://www.aceauthentic.com/item/2006-heroes-and-legends-series-box/ |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>]] -->\n\nThe next year he played at Wimbledon, the first of six appearances (1981\u201385, 1987).

He made the state singles finals three straight years, winning as a senior.\n\nPurcell graduated [[Murray High School (Kentucky)|Murray High School]] and went on to Memphis State University (now the [[University of Memphis]]), where he played for one year. He transferred to the [[University of Tennessee]], where in 1980 he won an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] doubles championship with teammate [[Rodney Harmon]].\n\n==Pro career==\nPurcell made his debut on the professional circuit in the summer of 1980. As a wild card entrant at the Washington (D.C.) Star Tournament, he upset top-ranked [[Eddie Dibbs]]. Two weeks later, he qualified for a spot in the U.S. Clay Courts, where he beat [[Hank Pfister]] and top-10 ranked [[Harold Solomon]] before falling in the finals to [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc]]. Purcell saw his Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranking soar from the 300s to the top 40 and was crowned 1980 ATP Rookie of the Year.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mel card.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Intel Ad|From 2006 [[Ace Authentic]] Heroes & Legends series<ref name=\"cards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aceauthentic.com/item/2006-heroes-and-legends-series-box/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206173147/http://www.aceauthentic.com/item/2006-heroes-and-legends-series-box/ |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>]] -->\n\nThe next year he played at Wimbledon, the first of six appearances (1981\u201385, 1987). He reached the quarterfinals in 1983, beating [[Tim Wilkison]], [[Stuart Bale]], [[Andreas Maurer]] and [[Brian Gottfried]] before falling to eventual runner-up [[New Zealand]]'s [[Chris Lewis (tennis)|Chris Lewis]] 6\u20137, 6\u20130, 6\u20134, 7\u20136 in the quarterfinals.\n\nPurcell played in the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] 10 times (1978\u201387) where he recorded victories over [[Stan Smith]], [[Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez]] and [[Ilie N\u0103stase]], among others. During this time, he was part of a rare match that saw the eventual loser win two sets 6\u20130. This occurred during his third round loss to [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc]] 6\u20133, 0\u20136, 0\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20133 in the [[1981 US Open (tennis)|1981 US Open]]. He competed in the [[French Open]] six times (1981\u201384, 1987\u201388) where he twice reached the round of 16 in singles and in 1981 reached the doubles quarterfinals with [[Vincent Van Patten]].\n\nAnother career highlight was beating [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Fernando Luna (tennis)|Fernando Luna]] at Boston in 1982 before falling in the final to [[Guillermo Vilas]].\n\nInjuries to his elbow from a car accident and a pulled stomach muscle slowed his career in 1985 but a year later, he beat [[Boris Becker]] in the German Open.\n\nPurcell won three ATP singles titles in 1981: at Atlanta, Tampa and Tel Aviv. He also teamed to claim four doubles titles: at Delray Beach (1982 with [[Chip Hooper]]), Munich (1982 with [[Eliot Teltscher]]) and Vienna (1983 with [[Stan Smith]] and 1987 with [[Tim Wilkison]]).\n\n==Career finals==\n===Singles (3 titles)===\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" \n!style=\"width:40px\"|Result\n!style=\"width:30px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W/L \n!style=\"width:60px\"|Date\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Tournament\n!style=\"width:50px\"|Surface\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Opponent\n!style=\"width:110px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1\u20130 || Mar 1981 || [[Tampa Open|Tampa]], U.S. || Hard || {{flagicon|USA}} [[Jeff Borowiak]] || 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20133\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 2\u20130 || Aug 1981 || [[Atlanta]], U.S. || Hard || {{flagicon|France}} [[Gilles Moretton]] || 6\u20134, 6\u20132\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 3\u20130 || Oct 1981 || [[ATP Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv]], Israel || Hard || {{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Per Hjertquist]] || 6\u20131, 6\u20131\n|}\n\n===Doubles (1 title)===\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" \n!style=\"width:40px\"|Result\n!style=\"width:30px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W/L \n!style=\"width:60px\"|Date\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Tournament\n!style=\"width:50px\"|Surface\n!style=\"width:160px\"|Partner\n!style=\"width:160px\"|Opponents\n!style=\"width:140px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win\n|1\u20130\n|May 1982\n|[[1982 Bavarian Tennis Championships|Munich]], Germany\n|Clay\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Chip Hooper]]\n|{{flagicon|RSA|1928}} [[Tian Viljoen]]<br>{{flagicon|RSA|1928}} [[Danie Visser]]\n|6\u20134, 7\u20136\n|}\n\n==Today==\nPurcell is the head tennis coach at Murray State University, a post he took in 1996 succeeding his father, hall of fame coach [[Bennie Purcell]].
