When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Since casualty statistics are sometimes disputed the footnotes to this article present the different estimates by official governmental sources as well as historians. Military figures include [[Killed in action|battle deaths]] (KIA) and [[Missing in action|personnel missing in action]] (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. [[Civilian casualties]] include deaths caused by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]], [[Holocaust victims]], [[German war crimes#World War II|German war crimes]], [[Japanese war crimes]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|population transfers in the Soviet Union]], [[Allied war crimes during World War II|Allied war crimes]], and deaths due to war related famine and disease.\n\nThe sources for the casualties of the individual nations do not use the same methods, and civilian deaths due to starvation and disease make up a large proportion of the civilian deaths in China and the Soviet Union. The losses listed here are actual deaths; hypothetical losses due to a decline in births are not included with the total dead. The distinction between [[Killed in action|military]] and [[civilian casualties]] caused directly by warfare and [[collateral damage]] is not always clear-cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia, sources can give only the [[Demographic analysis|total estimated population loss]] caused by the war and a [[Approximation|rough estimate]] of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, [[crimes against humanity]] and war-related famine. The casualties listed here include 19 to 25&nbsp;million war-related famine deaths in the USSR, China, Indonesia, [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945|Vietnam]], the Philippines, and [[Bengal Famine of 1943|India]] that are often omitted from other compilations of World War II casualties.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[John W.

The figures up until the end of January 1945 of 271,000 and the 82,000 from February to April 1945 give an overall figure of 353,000 air war deaths. Overy summarizes: \"Detailed reconstruction of deaths caused by the Royal Air Force bombing from February to May 1945, though incomplete, suggests a total of at least 57,000. If casualties inflicted by the American air forces are assumed to be lower, since their bombing was less clearly aimed at cities, an overall death toll of 82,000 is again statistically realistic.

The authors maintain that both Stalin and Hitler \"were both responsible but in different ways for these deaths\", and \"In short the general picture of Soviet wartime losses suggests a jigsaw puzzle. The general outline is clear: people died in colossal numbers but in many different miserable and terrible circumstances.

Long after the war, a myth persisted claiming the German military (or Wehrmacht) was not involved in the Holocaust and other crimes associated with Nazi genocidal policy. This belief is untrue. The German military participated in many aspects of the Holocaust: in supporting Hitler, in the use of forced labor, and in the mass murder of Jews and other groups targeted by the Nazis.\n\nThe military\u2019s complicity extended not only to the generals and upper leadership but also to the rank and file. In addition, the war and genocidal policy were inextricably linked.

The casualties recorded for Italy do not include Italians who were born in Italian colonies and possessions (ethnic Italians in Libya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and the Dodecanese) and in national territories that Italy lost with the Paris peace treaty of 1947 (mainly the [[Julian March]], [[Istria]] and [[Zadar|Zara/Zadar]]; a large part of the victims of the [[Foibe massacres]] are thus not included). Also Africans conscripted by Italy are not included in their figures.\n* With regards to the Partisan casualties, a ministerial study published in 1955 listed the partisans killed or executed as 35,828; however, the ''Ufficio dell'Albo d'Oro'' only considered as partisans the members of the Resistance who were civilians before joining the partisans, whereas partisans who were formerly members of the Italian armed forces (more than half those killed) were considered as members of their armed force of origin.\n* With regards to the Italian Social Republic casualties, the ''Ufficio dell'Albo d'Oro'' excludes from its lists of the fallen the individuals who committed war crimes. In the context of the RSI, where numerous war crimes were committed in the anti-partisan warfare, and many individuals were therefore involved in such crimes (especially GNR and Black Brigades personnel), this influences negatively the casualty count, under a statistical point of view.

After that date, in the last battles in East Africa there were 490 askaris killed in the [[battle of Culqualber]] and 3,700 killed in the [[battle of Gondar]], plus an unknown number in the battle of Amba Alagi and other minor clashes. This would mean that the number of askaris killed in East Africa was likely somewhere between 16,000 and 20,000. According to the Italian Army official history (USSME, ''La prima offensiva Britannica in Africa Settentrionale'', tomo I, allegato 32 (page 375)), the two Libyan colonial divisions lost 1,399 soldiers killed (not counting the officers, who were Italian) in the battle of Sidi Barrani, where they were both destroyed.

The exact number of dead and injured will never be known because of the confusion after the explosions. Persons unaccounted for might have been burned beyond recognition in the falling buildings, disposed of in one of the mass cremations of the first week of recovery, or driven out of the city to die or recover without any record remaining. No sure count of even the prepaid populations existed. Because of the decline in activity in the two port cities, the constant threat of incendiary raids, and the formal evacuation programs of the Government, an unknown number of the inhabitants had either drifter away from the cities or been removed according to plan. In this uncertain situation, estimates of casualties have generally ranged between 100,000 and 180,000 for Hiroshima, and between 50,000 and 100,000 for Nagasaki. The Survey believes the dead at Hiroshima to have been between 70,000 and 80,000, with an equal number injured; at Nagasaki over 35,000 dead and somewhat more than that injured seems the most plausible estimate.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/AtomicEffects/AtomicEffects-2.html|title=United States Strategic Bombing Survey The Effects of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki United States Government Printing Office Washington: 1946, p. 15|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[John W.

When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Since casualty statistics are sometimes disputed the footnotes to this article present the different estimates by official governmental sources as well as historians. Military figures include [[Killed in action|battle deaths]] (KIA) and [[Missing in action|personnel missing in action]] (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. [[Civilian casualties]] include deaths caused by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]], [[Holocaust victims]], [[German war crimes#World War II|German war crimes]], [[Japanese war crimes]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|population transfers in the Soviet Union]], [[Allied war crimes during World War II|Allied war crimes]], and deaths due to war related famine and disease.\n\nThe sources for the casualties of the individual nations do not use the same methods, and civilian deaths due to starvation and disease make up a large proportion of the civilian deaths in China and the Soviet Union. The losses listed here are actual deaths; hypothetical losses due to a decline in births are not included with the total dead. The distinction between [[Killed in action|military]] and [[civilian casualties]] caused directly by warfare and [[collateral damage]] is not always clear-cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia, sources can give only the [[Demographic analysis|total estimated population loss]] caused by the war and a [[Approximation|rough estimate]] of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, [[crimes against humanity]] and war-related famine. The casualties listed here include 19 to 25 million war-related famine deaths in the USSR, China, Indonesia, [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945|Vietnam]], the Philippines, and [[Bengal Famine of 1943|India]] that are often omitted from other compilations of World War II casualties.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[John W.

Using the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] data Overy calculated an average monthly death toll of 18,777 from September 1944 to January 1945, taking this monthly average he estimated losses of 57,000 from February to April 1945 to which he adds an additional 25,000 killed in Dresden for total deaths of 82,000 from February to April 1945. The figures up until the end of January 1945 of 271,000 and the 82,000 from February to April 1945 give an overall figure of 353,000 air war deaths. Overy summarizes: \"Detailed reconstruction of deaths caused by the Royal Air Force bombing from February to May 1945, though incomplete, suggests a total of at least 57,000. If casualties inflicted by the American air forces are assumed to be lower, since their bombing was less clearly aimed at cities, an overall death toll of 82,000 is again statistically realistic.

The German military participated in many aspects of the Holocaust: in supporting Hitler, in the use of forced labor, and in the mass murder of Jews and other groups targeted by the Nazis.\n\nThe military\u2019s complicity extended not only to the generals and upper leadership but also to the rank and file.

Also Africans conscripted by Italy are not included in their figures.\n* With regards to the Partisan casualties, a ministerial study published in 1955 listed the partisans killed or executed as 35,828; however, the ''Ufficio dell'Albo d'Oro'' only considered as partisans the members of the Resistance who were civilians before joining the partisans, whereas partisans who were formerly members of the Italian armed forces (more than half those killed) were considered as members of their armed force of origin.\n* With regards to the Italian Social Republic casualties, the ''Ufficio dell'Albo d'Oro'' excludes from its lists of the fallen the individuals who committed war crimes. In the context of the RSI, where numerous war crimes were committed in the anti-partisan warfare, and many individuals were therefore involved in such crimes (especially GNR and Black Brigades personnel), this influences negatively the casualty count, under a statistical point of view. The \"RSI Historical Foundation\" (''Fondazione RSI Istituto Storico'') has drafted [http://www.fondazionersi.org/caduti/AlboCaduti2016.pdf a list that lists the names of some 35,000 RSI military personnel killed in action or executed] during and immediately after World War II (including the \"revenge killings\" that occurred at the end of the hostilities and in their immediate aftermath), including some 13,500 members of the [[Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana]] and Milizia Difesa Territoriale, 6,200 members of the [[Black Brigades]], 2,800 [[Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana]] personnel, 1,000 [[Marina Nazionale Repubblicana]] personnel, 1,900 [[X MAS]] personnel, 800 soldiers of the \"Monterosa\" Division, 470 soldiers of the \"Italia\" Division, 1,500 soldiers of the \"San Marco\" Division, 300 soldiers of the \"Littorio\" Division, 350 soldiers of the \"Tagliamento\" Alpini Regiment, 730 soldiers of the 3rd and 8th Bersaglieri regiments, 4,000 troops of miscellaneous units of the [[Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano]] (excluding the aabove-mentioned Divisions and Alpini and Bersaglieri Regiments), 300 members of the ''Legione Autonoma Mobile \"Ettore Muti\"'', 200 members of the ''Raggruppamento Anti Partigiani'', 550 members of the [[29th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Italian)|Italian SS]], and 170 members of the ''Cacciatori degli Appennini Regiment''.\n* This would bring the total number of Italian military personnel killed to some 341,000 (excluding colonial troops).\n* According to the official history of the Italian Army (Rovighi, Alberto (1988), ''Le Operazioni in Africa Orientale: (giugno 1940 \u2013 novembre 1941)'' [Operations in East Africa: (June 1940 \u2013 November 1941)], Rome, Stato Maggiore Esercito, Ufficio storico) From June 1940 to 16 April 1941, 11,755 askaris were killed in Italian East Africa, excluding the losses in Giuba region and eastern fronts. After that date, in the last battles in East Africa there were 490 askaris killed in the [[battle of Culqualber]] and 3,700 killed in the [[battle of Gondar]], plus an unknown number in the battle of Amba Alagi and other minor clashes. This would mean that the number of askaris killed in East Africa was likely somewhere between 16,000 and 20,000. According to the Italian Army official history (USSME, ''La prima offensiva Britannica in Africa Settentrionale'', tomo I, allegato 32 (page 375)), the two Libyan colonial divisions lost 1,399 soldiers killed (not counting the officers, who were Italian) in the battle of Sidi Barrani, where they were both destroyed. There was not much use of colonial troops in North Africa afterwards.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n{{note|Japan|AB}}\u3000'''Japan'''\n* Estimates for total Japanese war dead in 1937\u20131945 range from at least 2.5 million<ref name=\"John W p. 296\"/> to 3.237 million<ref>Werner Gruhl, Imperial Japan's World War Two, 1931\u20131945, Transaction 2007; {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0352-8}}, p. 144</ref>\n* According to the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare Japanese war dead(1937\u201345) totaled 3.1 million persons including 2.3 million soldiers and Army/Navy civilian employees, 500,000 civilians in Japan and 300,000 civilians living outside of Japan.

The exact number of dead and injured will never be known because of the confusion after the explosions. Persons unaccounted for might have been burned beyond recognition in the falling buildings, disposed of in one of the mass cremations of the first week of recovery, or driven out of the city to die or recover without any record remaining. No sure count of even the prepaid populations existed. Because of the decline in activity in the two port cities, the constant threat of incendiary raids, and the formal evacuation programs of the Government, an unknown number of the inhabitants had either drifter away from the cities or been removed according to plan. In this uncertain situation, estimates of casualties have generally ranged between 100,000 and 180,000 for Hiroshima, and between 50,000 and 100,000 for Nagasaki. The Survey believes the dead at Hiroshima to have been between 70,000 and 80,000, with an equal number injured; at Nagasaki over 35,000 dead and somewhat more than that injured seems the most plausible estimate.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/AtomicEffects/AtomicEffects-2.html|title=United States Strategic Bombing Survey The Effects of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki United States Government Printing Office Washington: 1946, p. 15|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[John W.

From there, the road passes through Monterey, running parallel to and eventually crossing the [[Konkapot River]] near the center of town.  The road passes Lake Garfield and Chestnut Hill before crossing into [[Otis, Massachusetts|Otis]].  The road crosses through a section of Otis State Forest and passes the Otis Ridge Ski Area before merging for a short time with [[Massachusetts Route 8|Route 8]] through the town's center.  From there, the road heads eastward again, passing between Big Pond, Benton Pond and the [[Otis Reservoir]] (this area is also the site of another Knox Trail marker) towards the Hampden County line and the town of [[Blandford, Massachusetts|Blandford]].  Once in Blandford, the road heads due east, passing Miller Swamp, Jackson Hill and Blair Pond before entering the town's center, at which point the road begins to runs parallel to the south of [[Interstate 90]] (the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]).  Route 23 enters [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]], heading south of Punchbowl Mountain.

It passes the Egremont Country Club and the Great Barrington Airport before passing the eastern terminus of [[Massachusetts Route 71|Route 71]].  At this point the road becomes the Knox Trail.  From there the road heads towards the town center, merging with [[U.S. Route 7]], following that road for one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) before leaving Route 41, with Routes 7 and 23 turning eastward, crossing the [[Housatonic River]].  \nAfter another half-mile, U.S. Route 7 heads northward, leaving Route 23 to head eastward, this time combined with [[Massachusetts Route 183|Route 183]].  (There is a Knox Trail marker at this point.)  The two pass [[Ski Butternut|Butternut Basin Ski Area]] before crossing the [[Appalachian Trail]] and entering [[Monterey, Massachusetts|Monterey]].  Just east of the line, Route 183 heads south at the western terminus of [[Massachusetts Route 57|Route 57]], leaving Route 23 alone.  From there, the road passes through Monterey, running parallel to and eventually crossing the [[Konkapot River]] near the center of town.  The road passes Lake Garfield and Chestnut Hill before crossing into [[Otis, Massachusetts|Otis]].  The road crosses through a section of Otis State Forest and passes the Otis Ridge Ski Area before merging for a short time with [[Massachusetts Route 8|Route 8]] through the town's center.  From there, the road heads eastward again, passing between Big Pond, Benton Pond and the [[Otis Reservoir]] (this area is also the site of another Knox Trail marker) towards the Hampden County line and the town of [[Blandford, Massachusetts|Blandford]].  Once in Blandford, the road heads due east, passing Miller Swamp, Jackson Hill and Blair Pond before entering the town's center, at which point the road begins to runs parallel to the south of [[Interstate 90]] (the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]).  Route 23 enters [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]], heading south of Punchbowl Mountain.  The Knox Trail leaves the route at Knox Mountain Road, and the route crosses an overpass over the interstate before finally ending {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} east at the junction of [[U.S. Route 20]] near the town's center.\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|state=MA|length_ref=<ref name=\"massdot route log\"/>}}\n{{MAint\n|cspan=9\n|county=Berkshire\n|lspan=2\n|location=Egremont\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=NY|NY|23|dir1=west|city1=Hillsdale}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=3.40\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|41|dir1=south|location1=[[Salisbury, CT]]}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 41 [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Great Barrington\n|lspan=4\n|mile=5.64\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|71|dir1=west|road=[[Henry Knox Trail]]|dir2=west|city1=North Egremont}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route 71; western end of Henry Knox Trail concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=7.13\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|7|dir1=south|city1=Sheffield|location2=[[Canaan, Connecticut|Canaan, CT]]}}\n|notes=Western terminus US 7 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=8.07\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|41|dir1=north|city1=West Stockbridge}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route 41 concurrency\n1}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=8.86\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|7|dir1=north|MA|183|dir2=north|city1=Stockbridge}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of US 7 concurrency; western terminus of Route 183 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Monterey\n|mile=12.09\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|57|dir1=east|MA|183|dir2=south|city1=New Marlborough|city2=Sandisfield}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route 183 concurrency; western terminus of Route 57\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Otis\n|lspan=2\n|mile=23.42\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|8|US|20|to2=yes|dir1=north|city1=Becket}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 8 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=23.51\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|8|dir1=south|location1=[[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted, CT]]}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route 8 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|cspan=2\n|county=Hampden\n|lspan=2\n|location=Russell\n|mile=36.76\n|type=concur\n|road=General Knox Road / [[Henry Knox Trail]] east\n|notes=Eastern end of Henry Knox Trail concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=38.43\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|20|city1=Westfield|city2=Springfield|city3=Lee}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n}}\n{{jctbtm|keys=concur}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"150px\">\nImage:US-7, MA-41 and MA-23.jpg|Route 23 and US 7 leave Route 41 in Great Barrington.\nImage:MA Route 23 eastbound entering Otis MA.jpg|Route 23 enters Otis.\nImage:Otis-Knox Trail Stone.JPG|A [[Henry Knox Trail|Knox Trail]] stone along Route 23 in East Otis.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n{{Commons category|Massachusetts Route 23}}\n<references/>\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192518/http://neilbert.com/findroute.php?route=21-25 Neilbert.com Massachusetts Route Log]\n\n[[Category:Numbered routes in Massachusetts|023]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Berkshire County, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Hampden County, Massachusetts]]\n", "name_user": "Dmoore5556", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:dash to endash", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Route_23"}

In the early 1980s, CBN aired an English dub of the Christian-themed anime series ''[[Superbook]]'' and ''[[The Flying House (TV series)|The Flying House]]'', as well as the girls' drama series ''[[Honey Honey no Suteki na Bouken|Honey Honey]]'' and an uncut, Hawaiian-dubbed version of [[Go Nagai]]'s Super Robot series ''[[Mazinger Z]]'' (aired as part of a Japan-focused public-affairs show). In the late 1980s, after the station had been renamed The Family Channel, it would also air dubs of ''[[Wowser]]'' and [[Nippon Animation]]'s [[World Masterpiece Theater]] version of ''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]'' Nickelodeon aired anime such as ''[[Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' and ''[[Belle and Sebastian (Japanese TV series)|Belle and Sebastian]]'', and anime also later formed a major component of the network's [[Nick Jr.]] block, including ''[[Maple Town]]'', ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]'', ''[[Noozles]]'', ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', ''[[The Littl' Bits]]'', and ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]''. Premium channels also aired anime on occasion: [[Home Box Office|HBO]] broadcast numerous anime television series based on Western literature, including [[Gisaburo Sugii]]'s ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' and the World Masterpiece Theater versions of ''[[Little Women (1987 TV series)|Little Women]]'' and ''[[Tom Sawyer no Boken|Tom Sawyer]]'', and [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Unico]]'' features aired on [[The Disney Channel]].\n\nIn 1981, [[Roger Corman]] wrote an English dub of the first Galaxy Express movie ''[[Galaxy Express 999|Bonjour Galaxy Express 999]]'', shortened the name to ''Galaxy Express'', and aired it on television. The dub changed some of the original Japanese names into more recognizable American names for example: Tetsuro is now Joey and Harlock is now Warlock. Roger Corman also edited out 30 minutes of footage, and Antonia Levi, the author of \"Samurai from Outer Space\" said that [[Roger Corman]]'s dub was \"Highly edited and too damaged to watch\". Faring equally poorly was Corman's 1984 edit of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]]'', released theatrically as ''Warriors of the Wind''; this dub is said to have so displeased Miyazaki that he would insist that all future American releases of his work be unedited.\n\nIn 1983, Stern Electronics released a game to arcades called ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]'' and contains footage from ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' and ''[[The Mystery of Mamo]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[super robot]] and [[space opera]] [[anime]] was very popular, series such as ''Voltron'', ''Transformers'' and ''Robotech'' were successful in ratings and also commercial successes through selling merchandise. Faring less well was ''Mazinger Z'', aired in syndication in 1985 in a heavily edited dubbed version (not the Toei-commissioned dub previously broadcast on CBN) titled ''TranZor Z.''\n\nFaring even less well was the first American release of [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' in 1989. Harmony Gold produced a partial dub of the first five TV episodes and two movies (''The Curse of the Blood Rubies'' and ''The Mystical Adventure'') which were edited into an 80-minute film. The dubs were syndicated across America to independent television stations such as [[WPSG]] Philly 57 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[WWJ-TV|WGPR-TV]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], but failed to find an audience.\n  \nIn 1988 and 1989, the [[Bubblegum Crisis]] [[OVA]] series was one of the earliest fan subs and [[AnimEigo]] later got the license to the OVA's and dub the series.\n\nIn 1988, [[Streamline Pictures]] became one of the first companies dedicated solely to anime dubs, most notably dubbed versions of ''[[Twilight of the Cockroaches]]'' and of three more Miyazaki films: ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', both released initially as in-flight entertainment for [[Japan Airlines]] passengers traveling from North America to Japan, and ''[[Laputa: Castle in the Sky|Castle in the Sky]]''. The ''Totoro'' dub would eventually be released theatrically and commercially in the United States in 1993, and all three movies would later be redubbed by the [[Walt Disney Company]] as part of the company's deal with [[Studio Ghibli]].\n\n''[[Lensman: Secret of The Lens]]'' was first dubbed by [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] in 1988, and then [[Streamline Pictures]] re-dubbed it in 1990, and some of the voice actors voiced in both dubs. The film was based on the ''[[Lensman]]'' novels by [[E. E. Smith]]. Also, the [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] dub actually used remastered music and some music tracks came out of their previous movies ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' and ''Robotech The Movie: The Untold Story'', \nwhile the [[Streamline Pictures]] dub used the original Japanese soundtrack.\n\nIn 1988, [[AnimEigo]] just started after [[Streamline Pictures]] and had the slogan \"Anime in your way!\". Their first anime they dubbed is ''[[Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01]]'', which was renamed ''[[MADOX-01]]'' for the UK release in 1995, was only released on to [[VHS]] in 1989, due to content not suitable for [[television]] or [[theatrical]] release. They also dubbed the 4 episode [[OVA]] ''[[Vampire Princess Miyu]]'' in the same year, which was later adapted into a 26 episode TV series by [[Tokyopop]], later by [[Maiden Japan]] in 1997.\n\nIn the mid to late 80s, anime films like: ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Warriors of the Wind]]'', ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', ''[[Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01]]'', etc. Were dubbed by companies like: [[MGM]], [[Streamline Pictures]], [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[New World Pictures]], [[AnimEigo]], etc. Even though these films weren't very successful at the time, due to limited release, they did get positive reviews by critics and ''Akira'' received a cult following. Most of these films did get higher-quality dubs later on.\n\nA list of anime first distributed in the U.S. during the 1980s includes:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[Huckleberry no B\u014dken|Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''\n* ''[[Pinocchio: The Series#English versions|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''\n* ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]''\n* ''[[The Adventures of the Little Prince (TV series)|The Adventures of the Little Prince]]''\n* ''[[Tom Sawyer no Boken|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''\n* ''[[A Journey Through Fairyland]]''\n* ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1982 film)|Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Hana no Ko Lunlun|Angel]]''\n* ''[[Astro Boy (1980 TV series)|Astro Boy]]''\n* ''[[Belle and Sebastian (1981 TV series)|Belle and Sebastian]]''\n* ''[[Birth (anime)|Birth]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[The Brave Frog]] (Demetan Croaker, the Boy Frog)''\n* ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]''\n* ''[[Call of the Wild]]''\n* ''[[Captain Future]]''\n* ''[[Candy Candy]]''\n* ''[[Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years]]'' (combined adaptation of ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' and ''[[Queen Millennia]]'')\n* ''[[Castle in the Sky]]''\n* ''[[The Dagger of Kamui]]''\n*'' [[Dracula: Sovereign of the Damned]]''\n* ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' - never dubbed; English subtitled version aired on [[Nippon Golden Network]]\n* ''[[Dragon Ball (anime)|Dragon Ball]]''\n* ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''\n* ''[[Flower Angel]]''\n* ''[[The Flying House (TV series)|The Flying House]]''\n* ''[[Force Five]]'' (combined adaptation of ''[[Gaiking]]'', ''[[Dangard Ace]]'', ''[[Starvengers]]'', ''[[Grendizer]]'', ''[[Spaceketeers]]'')\n* ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]''\n* ''[[G-Force: Guardians of Space]]'' (adaptation of ''[[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman]]'')\n* ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo|Gigi and the Fountain of Youth]] (Magical Princess Minky Momo)''\n* ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]''\n* ''[[Honey Honey no Suteki na Bouken|Honey Honey]]''\n* ''[[Galactic Patrol Lensman|Lensman: Power of The Lens]] (Galactic Patrol Lensman)''\n* ''[[Lensman (1984 film)|Lensman: Secret of the Lens]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Leo the Lion (anime)|Leo the Lion]] (Janguru taitei Reo / Jungle Emperor: Move Ahead Leo!)''\n* ''[[Macron 1]]''\n* ''[[Maple Town]]''\n* ''[[Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01]]''\n* ''[[Kyoufu Densetsu Kaiki!

Companies such as [[FUNimation Productions]], [[Bandai Entertainment]], [[4Kids Entertainment]], [[Central Park Media]], [[Media Blasters]], [[Saban Entertainment]], [[Viz Video]], [[Pioneer LDC]] and [[ADV Films]] began licensing anime in the United States.\n\nThe first anime in the US in the 1990s, ''[[Dragon Warrior]]'' (also known as ''Dragon Quest''), based on the [[Dragon Quest|video game series]], aired in 1989 in Japan and 1990 in the US by [[Saban Entertainment]]. The show was created by [[Akira Toriyama]], the same person who made the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series. The show wasn't successful in the US and didn't get a release to home video.\n\n[[Saban Entertainment]] later dubbed the 1990 anime ''[[Kyatto Ninden Teyandee]]'', changed the name to ''Samurai Pizza Cats'', and aired it in syndication in 1991. In 2002, [[Saban Entertainment]] rights to the show expired, then [[Discotek Media]] obtained the rights and still owns the rights to the series to this day.\n\nViz which was already successful with its manga translation of [[Rumiko Takahashi]]'s ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]'', bought the rights to the anime and released it via [[direct-to-video]] starting in 1993. ''Ranma \u00bd'' enjoyed success in the VHS market and was the first anime title in the 1990s to have this level of success and one of the first titles to be recognized as an \"anime\". Viz also began publishing a magazine called ''[[Animerica]]'' in the 1990s which featured manga as well as articles on Japanese culture, fashion, manga, anime and video games, this helped spread the ''[[otaku]]'' subculture to Americans. [[Fansub]]s were also popular during this period.\n\n[[DiC]] (then-owned by [[Disney]]) and [[Funimation]] (with the help of [[Saban]] and [[Ocean Studios]]) licensed ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' (1996) respectively and both were televised in the U.S. through early morning syndication. Since the two anime were very successful internationally, they were purchased to capitalize on the success of Japan-influenced [[superhero]] shows like ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' (the very popular Americanized version of the [[tokusatsu]] series ''[[Super Sentai]]'') and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, [[Cartoon Network]] which had an action-themed evening block named [[Toonami]] began airing ''Sailor Moon'' and ''Dragon Ball Z'' both became overwhelmingly successful with younger audiences (being that they were aired in the evening hours which children were home) and as a result both got revived: receiving new dubs with significantly less editing being that these episodes were on cable television and with the recent inception of [[television rating system]] (both were rated TV-Y7-FV), the [[standards and practices|standards]] were relaxed. ''Voltron'', ''Robotech'' and ''Ronin Warriors'' also enjoyed renewed success on Toonami. Toonami would still continue to air anime and is credited with beginning the era of anime boom in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIn 1996, one of the most influential and controversial popular series was ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. It was released on [[VHS]] uncut by [[ADV Films]] and later in 2002, the films ''[[End of Evangelion]]'' and ''[[Evangelion: Death and Rebirth]]'' were released in the U.S. by [[Manga Entertainment]]. Evangelion grew to have a large fan base in the United States and is famed for its combining of the mecha genre with various aspects of philosophy, psychology, religious imagery, mental illnesses and shock horror elements.\n\nIn 1998, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' was introduced to U.S. and it became a ratings hit, a pop culture phenomenon and monumental commercial success through its merchandising (trading cards, VHS, toys, video games etc.). ''[[Digimon]]'' was introduced in 1999; although it was a success, it did not reach the same level of popularity as ''Pok\u00e9mon''.\n\n[[Syfy]] (formerly Sci-Fi Channel) also aired many experimental, avant-garde, action, horror and science fiction anime films and series during the 1990s during the late night and early morning hours until their removal from programming in 2011. ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Ninja Scroll]]'', ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]'', and ''[[Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer]]'' are among the films that have aired. Series such as ''[[Casshan: Robot Hunter]]'', ''[[Record of Lodoss War]]'', ''[[Iria: Zeiram the Animation]]'' and ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'' have also aired. In Northern California, [[KQEH|KTEH-TV]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] became famous locally for being one of the few [[PBS]] outlets to air anime, in both dubbed and subtitled versions.\n\nIn 1998, [[Disney]]'s [[Miramax]] released the anime film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' in the U.S. theatrically, though it was not a great success at the box office (it did much better on DVD releases) it began the relationship between Disney and [[Studio Ghibli]] to distribute the latter's films in the U.S.\n\nA list of anime first distributed in the U.S. during the 1990s includes:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[8 Man#8 Man After|8 Man After]]''\n* ''[[The Adventures of Hutch the Honeybee]] (Honeybee Hutch)''\n* ''[[Arc the Lad#Anime|Arc the Lad]]''\n* ''[[Battle Athletes]]''\n* ''[[Berserk (1997 TV series)|Berserk]]''\n* ''[[The Genie Family|Bob in a Bottle]] (The Genie Family)''\n* ''[[Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040]]''\n* ''[[Casshan: Robot Hunter]]''\n* ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''\n* ''[[Crayon Shin-chan]]'' (aired in Hawaii)\n* ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''\n* ''[[Dirty Pair#Anime|Dirty Pair]]\n* ''[[Dominion Tank Police]]''\n* ''[[Doomed Megalopolis]]''\n* ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]''\n* ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''\n* ''[[Dragon Half]]''\n* ''[[Dragon Quest (TV series)|Dragon Warrior]] (Dragon Quest: Legend of the Hero Abel)''\n* ''[[Eagle Riders]] (Gatchaman II)''\n* ''[[Fushigi Y\u00fbgi]]''\n* ''[[Garzey's Wing]]''\n* ''[[Genesis Survivor Gaiarth]]''\n* ''[[Genocyber]]''\n* ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]''\n* ''[[Golden Boy (manga)|Golden Boy]]''\n* ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]''\n* ''[[Hyper Doll]]''\n* ''[[Iria: Zeiram the Animation]]''\n* ''[[The Irresponsible Captain Tylor]]''\n* ''[[Jungle Emperor Leo]]''\n* ''[[Urikupen Ky\u016bjotai|Jungle Tales]] (Urikupen Ky\u016bjotai)''\n* ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''\n* ''[[Kurogane Communication]]''\n* ''[[The Littl' Bits]]''\n* ''[[Lupin the Third Part II]]''\n* ''[[Macross 7]]''\n* ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]''\n* ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]''\n* ''[[Maya the Honey Bee|Maya the Bee]]''\n* ''[[Maze (novel)|Maze]]''\n* ''[[Moldiver]]''\n* ''[[Monkey Magic (TV series)|Monkey Magic]]''\n* ''[[Monster Rancher (anime)|Monster Rancher]]''\n* ''[[My Neighbors the Yamadas]]''\n* ''[[Nazca (anime)|Nazca]]''\n* ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''\n* ''[[The New Adventures of Gigantor]] (New Tetsujin-28)''\n* ''[[Ninja Scroll]]''\n* ''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film)|Only Yesterday]]''\n* ''[[Outlaw Star]]''\n* ''[[Patlabor: The Movie]]''\n* ''[[Perfect Blue]]''\n* ''[[Phantom Quest Corp.]]''\n* ''[[Pinocchio: The Series]]''\n* ''[[Please Save My Earth]]''\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''\n* ''[[Pom Poko]]''\n* ''[[Porco Rosso]]''\n* ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''\n* ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]''\n* ''[[Record of Lodoss War]]''\n* ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]''\n* ''[[Ronin Warriors]]''\n* ''[[Sailor Moon\u00a0(TV series)|Sailor Moon]]''\n* ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]] (Kyatto Ninden Teyandee)''\n* ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]''\n* ''[[Slayers]]''\n* ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]''\n* ''[[Tonde Burin|Super Pig]] (Tonde Burin)''\n* ''[[Tekkaman Blade|Teknoman]] (Tekkaman Blade)''\n* ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]''\n* ''[[Tenchi Universe]]''\n* ''[[Thumbelina: A Magical Story]]''\n* ''[[Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer]]''\n* ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]''\n* ''[[Wedding Peach]]''\n* ''[[Whisper of the Heart]]''\n* ''[[Windaria]]''\n* ''[[Wowser (TV series)|Wowser]]''\n* ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]''\n* ''[[Zillion (anime)|Zillion]]''\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==2000s==\nIn the 2000s even after the popular series ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' ended their runs, Toonami still continued to air popular anime such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', which is credited for single-handedly popularizing the ''[[Gundam]]'' franchise in the west, ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'',''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'', ''[[.hack]]'', ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura|Cardcaptors]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'', ''[[Tenchi Universe]]'', ''[[Tenchi in Tokyo]]'', ''[[The 08th MS Team]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED]]'', ''[[Astro Boy]]'', ''[[SD Gundam]]'', ''[[Cyborg 009]]'', ''[[IGPX]]'', ''[[Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo]]'', ''[[Outlaw Star]]'', ''[[Hamtaro]]'' and ''[[Naruto]]''. ''Naruto'' was very successful on Toonami and remains of the most popular anime titles in U.S. In 2008, Toonami was discontinued and anime began airing exclusively on [[Adult Swim]], the late night counterpart to Cartoon Network.\n\nThe block Adult Swim began airing on Cartoon Network in 2001, its first anime title aired was ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was very successful and remains the longest aired anime series on Adult Swim. Adult Swim also aired series including uncut episodes of ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist (anime)|Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', ''[[InuYasha]]'', ''[[Outlaw Star]]'', ''[[Pilot Candidate]]'', ''[[Paranoia Agent]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', ''[[Death Note]]'', ''[[s-CRY-ed]]'', ''[[Eureka Seven]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', ''[[FLCL]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Case Closed]]'', ''[[Lupin III]]'', ''[[Blue Gender]]'', ''[[Code Geass]]'', ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Blood+]]'', ''[[Trinity Blood]]'', ''[[Shin Chan]]'', ''[[Wolf's Rain]]'', ''[[Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit]]'' and ''[[Trigun]]''. Adult Swim mostly airs anime under the title \"Action\" even though ''Shin Chan'' and ''Super Milk Chan'' are comedies. Adult Swim became so successful over the years that [[Turner Broadcasting]] split it from Cartoon Network and is now ranked as an independent network.\n\nDue to the popularity of ''Dragon Ball Z'', Funimation would continue to dominate the anime distribution in the United States and continued licensing several popular titles such as ''Yu Yu Hakusho'', ''Case Closed'', ''Blue Gender'', ''Fruits Basket'', ''Black Cat'', ''Ouran High School Host Club'', ''Kodocha'', ''One Piece'', ''Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple'', ''Trinity Blood'', ''Fullmetal Alchemist'', ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'' and ''Shin Chan'' and launched its own channel [[Funimation Channel]] to exclusively carry most of its titles. Funimation would also rescue rights to titles when if its licensor discontinued, such the case with ADV Films (which closed in 2008) and Geneon (which closed in 2007).\n\nAfter the success of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' in the late 1990s, 4Kids Entertainment continue to license anime titles and target them towards children such as the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' franchise, ''[[Sonic X]]'', ''[[Magical DoReMi]]'', ''[[Mew Mew Power]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', ''[[Kirby Right Back At Ya!]]'', ''[[Dinosaur King]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Muscle]]''. However 4Kids was met with much controversy for its use of \"[[dub localization|Americanization]]\" and heavy editing of content, particularly with its dub of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' and ''[[One Piece]]''.\n\nIn 2002, ''[[Spirited Away]]'' was released through Disney theatrically and was successful enough to be the first anime film to be nominated for and win an [[Academy Award]].\n\nA list of anime first distributed in the U.S. during the 2000s includes:<!-- Do not include '''Corey In The House''' [[MOS:A&M]]. -->\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[.hack//Legend of the Twilight]]''\n* ''[[.hack//Liminality]]\n* ''[[.hack//Sign]]''\n* ''[[5 Centimeters Per Second]]''\n* ''[[Afro Samurai]]''\n* ''[[Ai Yori Aoshi]]\n* ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]''\n* ''[[Air Gear]]''\n* ''[[All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku]]''\n* ''[[Amazing Nurse Nanako]]''\n* ''[[Kikaider (anime)|Android Kikaider: The Animation]]''\n* ''[[Angel Tales]]''\n* ''[[Angelic Layer]]''\n* ''[[Area 88]]''\n* ''[[Argento Soma]]''\n* ''[[Armitage III]]''\n* ''[[Astro Boy (2003)|Astro Boy]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Azumanga Daioh]]''\n* ''[[Baby Felix]]''\n* ''[[Baccano!]]''\n* ''[[Baki the Grappler]]''\n* ''[[Bakugan Battle Brawlers]]''\n* ''[[Bamboo Blade]]''\n* ''[[Banner of the Stars]]''\n* ''[[Basilisk (manga)|Basilisk]]''\n* ''[[Beck (manga)|Beck]]''\n* ''[[Battle B-Daman]]''\n* ''[[Best Student Council]]''\n* ''[[Beyblade]]''\n* ''[[The Big O]]''\n* ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]''\n* ''[[Black God (manga)|Black God]]''\n* ''[[Black Lagoon]]''\n* ''[[Blade of the Immortal]]''\n* ''[[Blade of the Phantom Master]]''\n* ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''\n* ''[[Blood+]]''\n* ''[[Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan]]''\n* ''[[Blue Dragon (anime)|Blue Dragon]]''\n* ''[[Blue Gender]]''\n* ''[[Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo]]''\n* ''[[Boogiepop Phantom]]''\n* ''[[Boys Be...]]''\n* ''[[Burn-Up Scramble]]''\n* ''[[Burst Angel]]''\n* ''[[Buso Renkin]]''\n* ''[[The Candidate for Goddess]] (Pilot Candidate)''\n* ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]] (Cardcaptors)''\n* ''[[Carried by the Wind: Tsukikage Ran]]''\n* ''[[Case Closed]] (Detective Conan)''\n* ''[[Casshern Sins]]''\n* ''[[The Cat Returns]]''\n* ''[[Chance Pop Session]]''\n* ''[[Chibi Vampire]]''\n* ''[[Chobits]]''\n* ''[[Chrono Crusade]]''\n* ''[[City Hunter#Anime|City Hunter]]''\n* ''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]''\n* ''[[Claymore (manga)|Claymore]]'' \n* ''[[Code Geass]]''\n* ''[[Cosmo Warrior Zero]]''\n* ''[[Coyote Ragtime Show]]''\n* ''[[Crest of the Stars]]''\n* ''[[Cromartie High School]]''\n* ''[[Cyber Team in Akihabara]]''\n* ''[[Cyborg 009|Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier]]''\n* ''[[Cybuster]]'' \n* ''[[D.Gray-man]]''\n* ''[[D.N.Angel]]\n* ''[[Daphne in the Brilliant Blue]]''\n* ''[[Darker than Black]]''\n* ''[[Dead Leaves]]''\n* ''[[DearS]]''\n* ''[[Death Note]]''\n* ''[[Descendants of Darkness]]''\n* ''[[Desert Punk]]\n* ''[[Destiny of the Shrine Maiden]]''\n* ''[[Devil May Cry: The Animated Series|Devil May Cry]]''\n* ''[[Di Gi Charat]]''\n* ''[[Diamond Daydreams]]''\n* ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]''\n* ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]''\n* ''[[Digimon Frontier]]''\n* ''[[Digimon Tamers]]''\n* ''[[Dinosaur King]]''\n* ''[[Dinozaurs]]''\n* ''[[Divergence Eve]]''\n* ''[[Doki Doki School Hours]]''\n* ''[[Dual!

Starting on March 2013, ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (2000 TV series)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and one of its continuing series, ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal'' started to air on the network. ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' and ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' also started to air on the network starting June 2013 and one of its continuing series, ''Digimon Fusion'' moved to the network on October 13, 2013 from [[Nickelodeon]] just after three episodes, mostly due to Nickelodeon's failed attempt at marketing the anime before it premiered September 7, 2013.\n\n[[Fansub]] sites of popular anime have been popular yet controversial in the U.S. Many are criticized for losing anime licensors revenue and have been blamed for the cause of many companies going out of business. [[Section23]], Bandai, Viz, [[TV Tokyo]] and Funimation have tried to limit these efforts by sending cease and decease letters or blocking out content on many sites. Also the production of English dubs of anime in general has decreased and many distributors are switching to the subtitle-only market such as [[Sentai Filmworks]], [[Aniplex Of America]] and [[NIS America]].\n\nIn 2012, [[Bandai]] folded its Bandai Entertainment anime licensing department in the United States, and eventually studio Sunrise (owned by Bandai Visual) made deals with Funimation and Sentai Filmworks to license and republish Sunrise titles formerly licensed by Bandai Entertainment. In 2012, [[4Kids Entertainment]] filed for bankruptcy protection and sold off the rights to the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' franchise back to [[Konami]] and the remaining licenses went to [[Saban Brands]].\n\nIn early 2012, ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos]]'' was released in over 100 theaters throughout North America.\n\n''[[The Secret World of Arrietty]]'' was released theatrically in 2012, and was only a moderate box office success in the United States, despite being one of the highest-grossing films of 2012 (Number 50 in the Worldwide box office).\n\nIn 2012, due to popular request on Twitter, Reddit and Facebook: the [[Toonami]] block was revived and began airing on [[Adult Swim]], replacing Adult Swim Action. Similar to ''Midnight Run'', it is now targeted to the young adult demographic with little to no editing of content. On May 16, 2014, Viz Media acquired the license for the original ''Sailor Moon'' series (formerly owned by DiC/Cloverway, Inc in the 1990s and early 2000s) and the new 2014 anime series, ''Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Crystal'', which it was premiered on July 5, 2014. In May 2014, [[The Walt Disney Company]] acquired the broadcasting rights for the 2005 series based on the Fujiko Fujio manga ''[[Doraemon]]'', and began airing the program on [[Disney XD]] on July 7 of that year, marking the first-ever release of the ''Doraemon'' franchise in the United States.\n\nIn December 2015, Funimation Channel changed its name to [[Toku (TV network)|Toku]], after [[Funimation]] finished its alliance with Olympusat, being the only 24/7 television channel dedicated in broadcasting anime series and films, as well as live-action Asian films.\n{{dynamic list|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[.hack//Quantum]]''\n* ''[[91 Days]]''\n* ''[[Absolute Duo]]''\n* ''[[Accel World]]''\n* ''[[Ace Attorney (anime)|Ace Attorney]]''\n* ''[[Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero]]''\n* ''[[After School Dice Club]]''\n* ''[[Aggretsuko]]''\n* ''[[A.I.C.O. -Incarnation-]]''\n* ''[[Ajin: Demi-Human]]''\n* ''[[Akame ga Kill!]]''\n* ''[[AKB0048]]''\n* ''[[Akiba's Trip: The Animation]]''\n* ''[[Alderamin on the Sky]]''\n* ''[[Aldnoah.Zero]]''\n* ''[[Alice & Zoroku]]''\n* ''[[All Out!!]]''\n* ''[[Amagi Brilliant Park]]''\n* ''[[And You Thought There Is Never a Girl Online?]]''\n* ''[[Angel Beats!]]''\n* ''[[Anohana]]''\n* ''[[Another (novel)|Another]]''\n* ''[[Aokana: Four Rhythm Across the Blue]]''\n* ''[[Appleseed XIII]]''\n* ''[[Aquarion Logos]]''\n* ''[[Aria the Scarlet Ammo]]''\n* ''[[Arifureta]]''\n* ''[[Arrietty]]''\n* ''[[Assassination Classroom]]''\n* ''[[The Asterisk War]]''\n* ''[[Attack on Titan]]''\n* ''[[Attack on Titan: Junior High]]''\n* ''[[Azur Lane]]''\n* ''[[B-Daman Crossfire]]''\n* ''[[B Gata H Kei]]''\n* ''[[B The Beginning]]''\n* ''[[Baka and Test]]''\n* ''[[Bakugan: Battle Planet]]''\n* ''[[Bakuman]]''\n* ''[[Barakamon]]''\n* ''[[Beastars]]''\n* ''[[Ben-To]]''\n* ''[[Beyblade Burst]]''\n* ''[[Beyblade: Metal Fusion]]''\n* ''[[Beyond the Boundary]]''\n* ''[[Bikini Warriors]]''\n* ''[[Black Bullet]]''\n* ''[[Black Butler]]''\n* ''[[Black Clover]]''\n* ''[[Bladedance of Elementalers]]''\n* ''[[Blast of Tempest]]''\n* ''[[BlazBlue: Alter Memory]]''\n* ''[[Blood Blockade Battlefront]]''\n* ''[[Blood-C]]''\n* ''[[Blood Lad]]''\n* ''[[Bloom Into You]]''\n* ''[[Blue Exorcist]]''\n* ''[[Bodacious Space Pirates]]''\n* ''[[Boogiepop and Others]]''\n* ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]''\n* ''[[The Boy and the Beast]]''\n* ''[[Broken Blade]]''\n* ''[[Brothers Conflict]]''\n* ''[[Brynhildr in the Darkness]]''\n* ''[[Bungo Stray Dogs]]''\n* ''[[Campione!]]''\n* ''[[Cannon Busters]]''\n* ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]]''\n* ''[[Cardfight!!

In the United States, most anime can be seen televised on channels, with channels such as [[Adult Swim]]'s [[Toonami]] block, and [[Toku (TV network)|Toku]] airing anime targeted toward young adults to adult audiences, and with channels such as [[Disney XD]], and [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] airing anime targeted toward children audiences. Anime can also be viewed [[online]] legally on streaming websites such as [[Anime Network]], [[Funimation]]'s FunimationNow platform, [[Crunchyroll]], [[Netflix]], [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]], [[YouTube]] and [[Hulu]].\n\n==1960s==\nIn the 1960s, ''Astro Boy'', ''Speed Racer'' and ''Kimba the White Lion'' were introduced to the US and were received positively. However audiences didn't see them as Japanese, possibly because they resembled most American cartoons of the time.\n;Films\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Name\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Licensor\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Release Date\n|-\n|''[[Panda and the Magic Serpent|The Tale of the White Serpent]]''\n|Global Pictures\n|{{dts|March 15, 1961}}\n|-\n|''[[Magic Boy (film)|Magic Boy]]''\n|[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|{{dts|June 22, 1961}}\n|-\n|''[[Alakazam the Great]]''\n|[[American International Pictures|American International]]\n|{{dts|July 26, 1961}}\n|-\n|''[[Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon]]''\n|[[Continental Distributing Inc.]]\n|{{dts|July 23, 1966}}\n|-\n|''[[Jack and the Witch]]''\n|American International\n|{{dts|1969}}\n|-\n|''[[The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun|The Little Norse Prince]]''\n|American International\n|{{dts|1969}}\n|}\n;TV series\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Name\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Licensor\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Network\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Start date\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | End date\n|-\n|''[[Astro Boy]]''\n|[[Universal Television|NBC Enterprises]]\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|{{dts|September 7, 1963}}\n|{{dts|August 20, 1965}}\n|-\n|''[[Gigantor]]''\n|[[Trans-Lux|Trans-Lux Television]]\n|Syndication\n|{{dts|1964}}\n|{{dts|1965}}\n|-\n|''[[8 Man|8th Man]]''\n|[[Worldvision Enterprises|ABC Films]]\n|Syndication\n|{{dts|1965}}\n|{{dts|1965}}\n|-\n|''[[Kimba the White Lion]]''\n|NBC Enterprises\n|Syndication\n|{{dts|July 2, 1965}}\n|{{dts|1966}}\n|-\n|''[[Marine Boy]]''\n|[[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts Television]]\n|Syndication\n|{{dts|1966}}\n|{{dts|1967}}\n|-\n|''[[Prince Planet]]''\n|American International\n|Syndication\n|{{dts|1966}}\n|{{dts|1967}}\n|-\n|''[[Speed Racer]]''\n|Trans-Lux Television\n|Syndication\n|{{dts|1967}}\n|{{dts|1968}}\n|-\n|''[[The Amazing 3#Anime|The Amazing 3]]''\n|Erika Productions\n|Syndication\n|{{dts|1967}}\n|{{dts|1967}}\n|}\n\n==1970s==\n;Films\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Name\n! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Licensor\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Release Date\n|-\n|''[[A Thousand and One Nights (1969 film)|A Thousand and One Nights]]''\n|Nippon Herald Movies\n|{{dts|1970}}\n|-\n|''[[Cleopatra (1970 film)|Cleopatra: Queen of Sex]]''\n|Xanadu Productions\n|{{dts|1972}}\n|-\n|''[[Jack and the Beanstalk (1974 film)|Jack and the Beanstalk]]''\n|[[Columbia Pictures]]\n|{{dts|November 18, 1976}}\n|-\n|''[[The Mouse and His Child (film)|The Extraordinary Adventures of the Mouse and His Child]]''\n|[[Sanrio]]\n|{{dts|November 18, 1977}}\n|-\n|''[[Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid (1975 film)|Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid]]''\n|[[G.

In the early 1980s, CBN aired an English dub of the Christian-themed anime series ''[[Superbook]]'' and ''[[The Flying House (TV series)|The Flying House]]'', as well as the girls' drama series ''[[Honey Honey no Suteki na Bouken|Honey Honey]]'' and an uncut, Hawaiian-dubbed version of [[Go Nagai]]'s Super Robot series ''[[Mazinger Z]]'' (aired as part of a Japan-focused public-affairs show). In the late 1980s, after the station had been renamed The Family Channel, it would also air dubs of ''[[Wowser]]'' and [[Nippon Animation]]'s [[World Masterpiece Theater]] version of ''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]'' Nickelodeon aired anime such as ''[[Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' and ''[[Belle and Sebastian (Japanese TV series)|Belle and Sebastian]]'', and anime also later formed a major component of the network's [[Nick Jr.]] block, including ''[[Maple Town]]'', ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]'', ''[[Noozles]]'', ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', ''[[The Littl' Bits]]'', and ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]''. Premium channels also aired anime on occasion: [[Home Box Office|HBO]] broadcast numerous anime television series based on Western literature, including [[Gisaburo Sugii]]'s ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' and the World Masterpiece Theater versions of ''[[Little Women (1987 TV series)|Little Women]]'' and ''[[Tom Sawyer no Boken|Tom Sawyer]]'', and [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Unico]]'' features aired on [[The Disney Channel]].\n\nIn 1981, [[Roger Corman]] wrote an English dub of the first Galaxy Express movie ''[[Galaxy Express 999|Bonjour Galaxy Express 999]]'', shortened the name to ''Galaxy Express'', and aired it on television. The dub changed some of the original Japanese names into more recognizable American names for example: Tetsuro is now Joey and Harlock is now Warlock. Roger Corman also edited out 30 minutes of footage, and Antonia Levi, the author of \"Samurai from Outer Space\" said that [[Roger Corman]]'s dub was \"Highly edited and too damaged to watch\". Faring equally poorly was Corman's 1984 edit of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]]'', released theatrically as ''Warriors of the Wind''; this dub is said to have so displeased Miyazaki that he would insist that all future American releases of his work be unedited.\n\nIn 1983, Stern Electronics released a game to arcades called ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]'' and contains footage from ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' and ''[[The Mystery of Mamo]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[super robot]] and [[space opera]] [[anime]] was very popular, series such as ''Voltron'', ''Transformers'' and ''Robotech'' were successful in ratings and also commercial successes through selling merchandise. Faring less well was ''Mazinger Z'', aired in syndication in 1985 in a heavily edited dubbed version (not the Toei-commissioned dub previously broadcast on CBN) titled ''TranZor Z.''\n\nFaring even less well was the first American release of [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' in 1989. Harmony Gold produced a partial dub of the first five TV episodes and two movies (''The Curse of the Blood Rubies'' and ''The Mystical Adventure'') which were edited into an 80-minute film. The dubs were syndicated across America to independent television stations such as [[WPSG]] Philly 57 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[WWJ-TV|WGPR-TV]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], but failed to find an audience.\n  \nIn 1988 and 1989, the [[Bubblegum Crisis]] [[OVA]] series was one of the earliest fan subs and [[AnimEigo]] later got the license to the OVA's and dub the series.\n\nIn 1988, [[Streamline Pictures]] became one of the first companies dedicated solely to anime dubs, most notably dubbed versions of ''[[Twilight of the Cockroaches]]'' and of three more Miyazaki films: ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', both released initially as in-flight entertainment for [[Japan Airlines]] passengers traveling from North America to Japan, and ''[[Laputa: Castle in the Sky|Castle in the Sky]]''. The ''Totoro'' dub would eventually be released theatrically and commercially in the United States in 1993, and all three movies would later be redubbed by the [[Walt Disney Company]] as part of the company's deal with [[Studio Ghibli]].\n\n''[[Lensman: Secret of The Lens]]'' was first dubbed by [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] in 1988, and then [[Streamline Pictures]] re-dubbed it in 1990, and some of the voice actors voiced in both dubs. The film was based on the ''[[Lensman]]'' novels by [[E. E. Smith]]. Also, the [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] dub actually used remastered music and some music tracks came out of their previous movies ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' and ''Robotech The Movie: The Untold Story'', \nwhile the [[Streamline Pictures]] dub used the original Japanese soundtrack.\n\nIn 1988, [[AnimEigo]] just started after [[Streamline Pictures]] and had the slogan \"Anime in your way!\". Their first anime they dubbed is ''[[Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01]]'', which was renamed ''[[MADOX-01]]'' for the UK release in 1995, was only released on to [[VHS]] in 1989, due to content not suitable for [[television]] or [[theatrical]] release. They also dubbed the 4 episode [[OVA]] ''[[Vampire Princess Miyu]]'' in the same year, which was later adapted into a 26 episode TV series by [[Tokyopop]], later by [[Maiden Japan]] in 1997.\n\nIn the mid to late 80s, anime films like: ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Warriors of the Wind]]'', ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', ''[[Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01]]'', etc. Were dubbed by companies like: [[MGM]], [[Streamline Pictures]], [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[New World Pictures]], [[AnimEigo]], etc. Even though these films weren't very successful at the time, due to limited release, they did get positive reviews by critics and ''Akira'' received a cult following. Most of these films did get higher-quality dubs later on.\n\nA list of anime first distributed in the U.S. during the 1980s includes:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[Huckleberry no B\u014dken|Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''\n* ''[[Pinocchio: The Series#English versions|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''\n* ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]''\n* ''[[The Adventures of the Little Prince (TV series)|The Adventures of the Little Prince]]''\n* ''[[Tom Sawyer no Boken|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''\n* ''[[A Journey Through Fairyland]]''\n* ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1982 film)|Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Hana no Ko Lunlun|Angel]]''\n* ''[[Astro Boy (1980 TV series)|Astro Boy]]''\n* ''[[Belle and Sebastian (1981 TV series)|Belle and Sebastian]]''\n* ''[[Birth (anime)|Birth]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[The Brave Frog]] (Demetan Croaker, the Boy Frog)''\n* ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]''\n* ''[[Call of the Wild]]''\n* ''[[Captain Future]]''\n* ''[[Candy Candy]]''\n* ''[[Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years]]'' (combined adaptation of ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' and ''[[Queen Millennia]]'')\n* ''[[Castle in the Sky]]''\n* ''[[The Dagger of Kamui]]''\n*'' [[Dracula: Sovereign of the Damned]]''\n* ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' - never dubbed; English subtitled version aired on [[Nippon Golden Network]]\n* ''[[Dragon Ball (anime)|Dragon Ball]]''\n* ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''\n* ''[[Flower Angel]]''\n* ''[[The Flying House (TV series)|The Flying House]]''\n* ''[[Force Five]]'' (combined adaptation of ''[[Gaiking]]'', ''[[Dangard Ace]]'', ''[[Starvengers]]'', ''[[Grandizer]]'', ''[[Spaceketeers]]'')\n* ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]''\n* ''[[G-Force: Guardians of Space]]'' (adaptation of ''[[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman]]'')\n* ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo|Gigi and the Fountain of Youth]] (Magical Princess Minky Momo)''\n* ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]''\n* ''[[Honey Honey no Suteki na Bouken|Honey Honey]]''\n* ''[[Galactic Patrol Lensman|Lensman: Power of The Lens]] (Galactic Patrol Lensman)''\n* ''[[Lensman (1984 film)|Lensman: Secret of the Lens]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Leo the Lion (anime)|Leo the Lion]] (Janguru taitei Reo / Jungle Emperor: Move Ahead Leo!)''\n* ''[[Macron 1]]''\n* ''[[Maple Town]]''\n* ''[[Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01]]''\n* ''[[Kyoufu Densetsu Kaiki!

Companies such as [[FUNimation Productions]], [[Bandai Entertainment]], [[4Kids Entertainment]], [[Central Park Media]], [[Media Blasters]], [[Saban Entertainment]], [[Viz Video]], [[Pioneer LDC]] and [[ADV Films]] began licensing anime in the United States.\n\nThe first anime in the US in the 1990s, ''[[Dragon Warrior]]'' (also known as ''Dragon Quest''), based on the [[Dragon Quest|video game series]], aired in 1989 in Japan and 1990 in the US by [[Saban Entertainment]]. The show was created by [[Akira Toriyama]], the same person who made the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series. The show wasn't successful in the US and didn't get a release to home video.\n\n[[Saban Entertainment]] later dubbed the 1990 anime ''[[Kyatto Ninden Teyandee]]'', changed the name to ''Samurai Pizza Cats'', and aired it in syndication in 1991. In 2002, [[Saban Entertainment]] rights to the show expired, then [[Discotek Media]] obtained the rights and still owns the rights to the series to this day.\n\nViz which was already successful with its manga translation of [[Rumiko Takahashi]]'s ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]'', bought the rights to the anime and released it via [[direct-to-video]] starting in 1993. ''Ranma \u00bd'' enjoyed success in the VHS market and was the first anime title in the 1990s to have this level of success and one of the first titles to be recognized as an \"anime\". Viz also began publishing a magazine called ''[[Animerica]]'' in the 1990s which featured manga as well as articles on Japanese culture, fashion, manga, anime and video games, this helped spread the ''[[otaku]]'' subculture to Americans. [[Fansub]]s were also popular during this period.\n\n[[DiC]] (then-owned by [[Disney]]) and [[Funimation]] (with the help of [[Saban]] and [[Ocean Studios]]) licensed ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' (1996) respectively and both were televised in the U.S. through early morning syndication. Since the two anime were very successful internationally, they were purchased to capitalize on the success of Japan-influenced [[superhero]] shows like ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' (the very popular Americanized version of the [[tokusatsu]] series ''[[Super Sentai]]'') and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, [[Cartoon Network]] which had an action-themed evening block named [[Toonami]] began airing ''Sailor Moon'' and ''Dragon Ball Z'' both became overwhelmingly successful with younger audiences (being that they were aired in the evening hours which children were home) and as a result both got revived: receiving new dubs with significantly less editing being that these episodes were on cable television and with the recent inception of [[television rating system]] (both were rated TV-Y7-FV), the [[standards and practices|standards]] were relaxed. ''Voltron'', ''Robotech'' and ''Ronin Warriors'' also enjoyed renewed success on Toonami. Toonami would still continue to air anime and is credited with beginning the era of anime boom in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIn 1996, one of the most influential and controversial popular series was ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. It was released on [[VHS]] uncut by [[ADV Films]] and later in 2002, the films ''[[End of Evangelion]]'' and ''[[Evangelion: Death and Rebirth]]'' were released in the U.S. by [[Manga Entertainment]]. Evangelion grew to have a large fan base in the United States and is famed for its combining of the mecha genre with various aspects of philosophy, psychology, religious imagery, mental illnesses and shock horror elements.\n\nIn 1998, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' was introduced to U.S. and it became a ratings hit, a pop culture phenomenon and monumental commercial success through its merchandising (trading cards, VHS, toys, video games etc.). ''[[Digimon]]'' was introduced in 1999; although it was a success, it did not reach the same level of popularity as ''Pok\u00e9mon''.\n\n[[Syfy]] (formerly Sci-Fi Channel) also aired many experimental, avant-garde, action, horror and science fiction anime films and series during the 1990s during the late night and early morning hours until their removal from programming in 2011. ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Ninja Scroll]]'', ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]'', and ''[[Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer]]'' are among the films that have aired. Series such as ''[[Casshan: Robot Hunter]]'', ''[[Record of Lodoss War]]'', ''[[Iria: Zeiram the Animation]]'' and ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'' have also aired. In Northern California, [[KQEH|KTEH-TV]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] became famous locally for being one of the few [[PBS]] outlets to air anime, in both dubbed and subtitled versions.\n\nIn 1998, [[Disney]]'s [[Miramax]] released the anime film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' in the U.S. theatrically, though it was not a great success at the box office (it did much better on DVD releases) it began the relationship between Disney and [[Studio Ghibli]] to distribute the latter's films in the U.S.\n\nA list of anime first distributed in the U.S. during the 1990s includes:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[8 Man#8 Man After|8 Man After]]''\n* ''[[The Adventures of Hutch the Honeybee]] (Honeybee Hutch)''\n* ''[[Arc the Lad#Anime|Arc the Lad]]''\n* ''[[Battle Athletes]]''\n* ''[[Berserk (1997 TV series)|Berserk]]''\n* ''[[The Genie Family|Bob in a Bottle]] (The Genie Family)''\n* ''[[Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040]]''\n* ''[[Casshan: Robot Hunter]]''\n* ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''\n* ''[[Crayon Shin-chan]]'' (aired in Hawaii)\n* ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''\n* ''[[Dirty Pair#Anime|Dirty Pair]]\n* ''[[Dominion Tank Police]]''\n* ''[[Doomed Megalopolis]]''\n* ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]''\n* ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''\n* ''[[Dragon Half]]''\n* ''[[Dragon Quest (TV series)|Dragon Warrior]] (Dragon Quest: Legend of the Hero Abel)''\n* ''[[Eagle Riders]] (Gatchaman II)''\n* ''[[Fushigi Y\u00fbgi]]''\n* ''[[Garzey's Wing]]''\n* ''[[Genesis Survivor Gaiarth]]''\n* ''[[Genocyber]]''\n* ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]''\n* ''[[Golden Boy (manga)|Golden Boy]]''\n* ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]''\n* ''[[Hyper Doll]]''\n* ''[[Iria: Zeiram the Animation]]''\n* ''[[The Irresponsible Captain Tylor]]''\n* ''[[Jungle Emperor Leo]]''\n* ''[[Urikupen Ky\u016bjotai|Jungle Tales]] (Urikupen Ky\u016bjotai)''\n* ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''\n* ''[[Kurogane Communication]]''\n* ''[[The Littl' Bits]]''\n* ''[[Lupin the Third Part II]]''\n* ''[[Macross 7]]''\n* ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]''\n* ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]''\n* ''[[Maya the Honey Bee|Maya the Bee]]''\n* ''[[Maze (novel)|Maze]]''\n* ''[[Moldiver]]''\n* ''[[Monkey Magic (TV series)|Monkey Magic]]''\n* ''[[Monster Rancher (anime)|Monster Rancher]]''\n* ''[[My Neighbors the Yamadas]]''\n* ''[[Nazca (anime)|Nazca]]''\n* ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''\n* ''[[The New Adventures of Gigantor]] (New Tetsujin-28)''\n* ''[[Ninja Scroll]]''\n* ''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film)|Only Yesterday]]''\n* ''[[Outlaw Star]]''\n* ''[[Patlabor: The Movie]]''\n* ''[[Perfect Blue]]''\n* ''[[Phantom Quest Corp.]]''\n* ''[[Pinocchio: The Series]]''\n* ''[[Please Save My Earth]]''\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''\n* ''[[Pom Poko]]''\n* ''[[Porco Rosso]]''\n* ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''\n* ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]''\n* ''[[Record of Lodoss War]]''\n* ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]''\n* ''[[Ronin Warriors]]''\n* ''[[Sailor Moon\u00a0(TV series)|Sailor Moon]]''\n* ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]] (Kyatto Ninden Teyandee)''\n* ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]''\n* ''[[Slayers]]''\n* ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]''\n* ''[[Tonde Burin|Super Pig]] (Tonde Burin)''\n* ''[[Tekkaman Blade|Teknoman]] (Tekkaman Blade)''\n* ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]''\n* ''[[Tenchi Universe]]''\n* ''[[Thumbelina: A Magical Story]]''\n* ''[[Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer]]''\n* ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]''\n* ''[[Wedding Peach]]''\n* ''[[Whisper of the Heart]]''\n* ''[[Windaria]]''\n* ''[[Wowser (TV series)|Wowser]]''\n* ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]''\n* ''[[Zillion (anime)|Zillion]]''\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==2000s==\nIn the 2000s even after the popular series ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' ended their runs, Toonami still continued to air popular anime such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', which is credited for single-handedly popularizing the ''[[Gundam]]'' franchise in the west, ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'',''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'', ''[[.hack]]'', ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura|Cardcaptors]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'', ''[[Tenchi Universe]]'', ''[[Tenchi in Tokyo]]'', ''[[The 08th MS Team]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED]]'', ''[[Astro Boy]]'', ''[[SD Gundam]]'', ''[[Cyborg 009]]'', ''[[IGPX]]'', ''[[Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo]]'', ''[[Outlaw Star]]'', ''[[Hamtaro]]'' and ''[[Naruto]]''. ''Naruto'' was very successful on Toonami and remains of the most popular anime titles in U.S. In 2008, Toonami was discontinued and anime began airing exclusively on [[Adult Swim]], the late night counterpart to Cartoon Network.\n\nThe block Adult Swim began airing on Cartoon Network in 2001, its first anime title aired was ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was very successful and remains the longest aired anime series on Adult Swim. Adult Swim also aired series including uncut episodes of ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist (anime)|Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', ''[[InuYasha]]'', ''[[Outlaw Star]]'', ''[[Pilot Candidate]]'', ''[[Paranoia Agent]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', ''[[Death Note]]'', ''[[s-CRY-ed]]'', ''[[Eureka Seven]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', ''[[FLCL]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Case Closed]]'', ''[[Lupin III]]'', ''[[Blue Gender]]'', ''[[Code Geass]]'', ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Blood+]]'', ''[[Trinity Blood]]'', ''[[Shin Chan]]'', ''[[Wolf's Rain]]'', ''[[Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit]]'' and ''[[Trigun]]''. Adult Swim mostly airs anime under the title \"Action\" even though ''Shin Chan'' and ''Super Milk Chan'' are comedies. Adult Swim became so successful over the years that [[Turner Broadcasting]] split it from Cartoon Network and is now ranked as an independent network.\n\nDue to the popularity of ''Dragon Ball Z'', Funimation would continue to dominate the anime distribution in the United States and continued licensing several popular titles such as ''Yu Yu Hakusho'', ''Case Closed'', ''Blue Gender'', ''Fruits Basket'', ''Black Cat'', ''Ouran High School Host Club'', ''Kodocha'', ''One Piece'', ''Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple'', ''Trinity Blood'', ''Fullmetal Alchemist'', ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'' and ''Shin Chan'' and launched its own channel [[Funimation Channel]] to exclusively carry most of its titles. Funimation would also rescue rights to titles when if its licensor discontinued, such the case with ADV Films (which closed in 2008) and Geneon (which closed in 2007).\n\nAfter the success of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' in the late 1990s, 4Kids Entertainment continue to license anime titles and target them towards children such as the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' franchise, ''[[Sonic X]]'', ''[[Magical DoReMi]]'', ''[[Mew Mew Power]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', ''[[Kirby Right Back At Ya!]]'', ''[[Dinosaur King]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Muscle]]''. However 4Kids was met with much controversy for its use of \"[[dub localization|Americanization]]\" and heavy editing of content, particularly with its dub of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' and ''[[One Piece]]''.\n\nIn 2002, ''[[Spirited Away]]'' was released through Disney theatrically and was successful enough to be the first anime film to be nominated for and win an [[Academy Award]].\n\nA list of anime first distributed in the U.S. during the 2000s includes:<!-- Do not include '''Corey In The House''' [[MOS:A&M]]. -->\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[.hack//Legend of the Twilight]]''\n* ''[[.hack//Liminality]]\n* ''[[.hack//Sign]]''\n* ''[[5 Centimeters Per Second]]''\n* ''[[Afro Samurai]]''\n* ''[[Ai Yori Aoshi]]\n* ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]''\n* ''[[Air Gear]]''\n* ''[[All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku]]''\n* ''[[Amazing Nurse Nanako]]''\n* ''[[Kikaider (anime)|Android Kikaider: The Animation]]''\n* ''[[Angel Tales]]''\n* ''[[Angelic Layer]]''\n* ''[[Area 88]]''\n* ''[[Argento Soma]]''\n* ''[[Armitage III]]''\n* ''[[Astro Boy (2003)|Astro Boy]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Azumanga Daioh]]''\n* ''[[Baby Felix]]''\n* ''[[Baccano!]]''\n* ''[[Baki the Grappler]]''\n* ''[[Bakugan Battle Brawlers]]''\n* ''[[Bamboo Blade]]''\n* ''[[Banner of the Stars]]''\n* ''[[Basilisk (manga)|Basilisk]]''\n* ''[[Beck (manga)|Beck]]''\n* ''[[Battle B-Daman]]''\n* ''[[Best Student Council]]''\n* ''[[Beyblade]]''\n* ''[[The Big O]]''\n* ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]''\n* ''[[Black God (manga)|Black God]]''\n* ''[[Black Lagoon]]''\n* ''[[Blade of the Immortal]]''\n* ''[[Blade of the Phantom Master]]''\n* ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''\n* ''[[Blood+]]''\n* ''[[Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan]]''\n* ''[[Blue Dragon (anime)|Blue Dragon]]''\n* ''[[Blue Gender]]''\n* ''[[Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo]]''\n* ''[[Boogiepop Phantom]]''\n* ''[[Boys Be...]]''\n* ''[[Burn-Up Scramble]]''\n* ''[[Burst Angel]]''\n* ''[[Buso Renkin]]''\n* ''[[The Candidate for Goddess]] (Pilot Candidate)''\n* ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]] (Cardcaptors)''\n* ''[[Carried by the Wind: Tsukikage Ran]]''\n* ''[[Case Closed]] (Detective Conan)''\n* ''[[Casshern Sins]]''\n* ''[[The Cat Returns]]''\n* ''[[Chance Pop Session]]''\n* ''[[Chibi Vampire]]''\n* ''[[Chobits]]''\n* ''[[Chrono Crusade]]''\n* ''[[City Hunter#Anime|City Hunter]]''\n* ''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]''\n* ''[[Claymore (manga)|Claymore]]'' \n* ''[[Code Geass]]''\n* ''[[Cosmo Warrior Zero]]''\n* ''[[Coyote Ragtime Show]]''\n* ''[[Crest of the Stars]]''\n* ''[[Cromartie High School]]''\n* ''[[Cyber Team in Akihabara]]''\n* ''[[Cyborg 009|Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier]]''\n* ''[[Cybuster]]'' \n* ''[[D.Gray-man]]''\n* ''[[D.N.Angel]]\n* ''[[Daphne in the Brilliant Blue]]''\n* ''[[Darker than Black]]''\n* ''[[Dead Leaves]]''\n* ''[[DearS]]''\n* ''[[Death Note]]''\n* ''[[Descendants of Darkness]]''\n* ''[[Desert Punk]]\n* ''[[Destiny of the Shrine Maiden]]''\n* ''[[Devil May Cry: The Animated Series|Devil May Cry]]''\n* ''[[Di Gi Charat]]''\n* ''[[Diamond Daydreams]]''\n* ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]''\n* ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]''\n* ''[[Digimon Frontier]]''\n* ''[[Digimon Tamers]]''\n* ''[[Dinosaur King]]''\n* ''[[Dinozaurs]]''\n* ''[[Divergence Eve]]''\n* ''[[Doki Doki School Hours]]''\n* ''[[Dual!

Starting on March 2013, ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (2000 TV series)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and one of its continuing series, ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal'' started to air on the network. ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' and ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' also started to air on the network starting June 2013 and one of its continuing series, ''Digimon Fusion'' moved to the network on October 13, 2013 from [[Nickelodeon]] just after three episodes, mostly due to Nickelodeon's failed attempt at marketing the anime before it premiered September 7, 2013.\n\n[[Fansub]] sites of popular anime have been popular yet controversial in the U.S. Many are criticized for losing anime licensors revenue and have been blamed for the cause of many companies going out of business. [[Section23]], Bandai, Viz, [[TV Tokyo]] and Funimation have tried to limit these efforts by sending cease and decease letters or blocking out content on many sites. Also the production of English dubs of anime in general has decreased and many distributors are switching to the subtitle-only market such as [[Sentai Filmworks]], [[Aniplex Of America]] and [[NIS America]].\n\nIn 2012, [[Bandai]] folded its Bandai Entertainment anime licensing department in the United States, and eventually studio Sunrise (owned by Bandai Visual) made deals with Funimation and Sentai Filmworks to license and republish Sunrise titles formerly licensed by Bandai Entertainment. In 2012, [[4Kids Entertainment]] filed for bankruptcy protection and sold off the rights to the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' franchise back to [[Konami]] and the remaining licenses went to [[Saban Brands]].\n\nIn early 2012, ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos]]'' was released in over 100 theaters throughout North America.\n\n''[[The Secret World of Arrietty]]'' was released theatrically in 2012, and was only a moderate box office success in the United States, despite being one of the highest-grossing films of 2012 (Number 50 in the Worldwide box office).\n\nIn 2012, due to popular request on Twitter, Reddit and Facebook: the [[Toonami]] block was revived and began airing on [[Adult Swim]], replacing Adult Swim Action. Similar to ''Midnight Run'', it is now targeted to the young adult demographic with little to no editing of content. On May 16, 2014, Viz Media acquired the license for the original ''Sailor Moon'' series (formerly owned by DiC/Cloverway, Inc in the 1990s and early 2000s) and the new 2014 anime series, ''Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Crystal'', which it was premiered on July 5, 2014. In May 2014, [[The Walt Disney Company]] acquired the broadcasting rights for the 2005 series based on the Fujiko Fujio manga ''[[Doraemon]]'', and began airing the program on [[Disney XD]] on July 7 of that year, marking the first-ever release of the ''Doraemon'' franchise in the United States.\n\nIn December 2015, Funimation Channel changed its name to [[Toku (TV network)|Toku]], after [[Funimation]] finished its alliance with Olympusat, being the only 24/7 television channel dedicated in broadcasting anime series and films, as well as live-action Asian films.\n{{dynamic list|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[.hack//Quantum]]''\n* ''[[91 Days]]''\n* ''[[Absolute Duo]]''\n* ''[[Accel World]]''\n* ''[[Ace Attorney (anime)|Ace Attorney]]''\n* ''[[Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero]]''\n* ''[[After School Dice Club]]''\n* ''[[Aggretsuko]]''\n* ''[[A.I.C.O. -Incarnation-]]''\n* ''[[Ajin: Demi-Human]]''\n* ''[[Akame ga Kill!]]''\n* ''[[AKB0048]]''\n* ''[[Akiba's Trip: The Animation]]''\n* ''[[Alderamin on the Sky]]''\n* ''[[Aldnoah.Zero]]''\n* ''[[Alice & Zoroku]]''\n* ''[[All Out!!]]''\n* ''[[Amagi Brilliant Park]]''\n* ''[[And You Thought There Is Never a Girl Online?]]''\n* ''[[Angel Beats!]]''\n* ''[[Anohana]]''\n* ''[[Another (novel)|Another]]''\n* ''[[Aokana: Four Rhythm Across the Blue]]''\n* ''[[Appleseed XIII]]''\n* ''[[Aquarion Logos]]''\n* ''[[Aria the Scarlet Ammo]]''\n* ''[[Arifureta]]''\n* ''[[Arrietty]]''\n* ''[[Assassination Classroom]]''\n* ''[[The Asterisk War]]''\n* ''[[Attack on Titan]]''\n* ''[[Attack on Titan: Junior High]]''\n* ''[[Azur Lane]]''\n* ''[[B-Daman Crossfire]]''\n* ''[[B Gata H Kei]]''\n* ''[[B The Beginning]]''\n* ''[[Baka and Test]]''\n* ''[[Bakugan: Battle Planet]]''\n* ''[[Bakuman]]''\n* ''[[Barakamon]]''\n* ''[[Beastars]]''\n* ''[[Ben-To]]''\n* ''[[Beyblade Burst]]''\n* ''[[Beyblade: Metal Fusion]]''\n* ''[[Beyond the Boundary]]''\n* ''[[Bikini Warriors]]''\n* ''[[Black Bullet]]''\n* ''[[Black Butler]]''\n* ''[[Black Clover]]''\n* ''[[Bladedance of Elementalers]]''\n* ''[[Blast of Tempest]]''\n* ''[[BlazBlue: Alter Memory]]''\n* ''[[Blood Blockade Battlefront]]''\n* ''[[Blood-C]]''\n* ''[[Blood Lad]]''\n* ''[[Bloom Into You]]''\n* ''[[Blue Exorcist]]''\n* ''[[Bodacious Space Pirates]]''\n* ''[[Boogiepop and Others]]''\n* ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]''\n* ''[[The Boy and the Beast]]''\n* ''[[Broken Blade]]''\n* ''[[Brothers Conflict]]''\n* ''[[Brynhildr in the Darkness]]''\n* ''[[Bungo Stray Dogs]]''\n* ''[[Campione!]]''\n* ''[[Cannon Busters]]''\n* ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]]''\n* ''[[Cardfight!!
