She was converted from an [[ocean liner]] that was under construction when the [[First World War]] began and became the first example of the standard pattern of aircraft carrier, with a full-length [[flight deck]] that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was involved for several years in the development of the optimum design for other aircraft carriers. ''Argus'' also evaluated various types of [[arresting gear]], general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s. She spent one brief deployment on the [[China Station]] in the late 1920s before being placed in [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|reserve]] for budgetary reasons.\n\n''Argus'' was recommissioned and partially modernised shortly before the Second World War and served as a [[training ship]] for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many [[Malta Convoys|ferry trips]] to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to [[Malta]]; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to [[Murmansk]] in Russia, [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], and [[Reykjav\u00edk]] in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and ''Argus'' was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]], providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of [[French North Africa]] and was slightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, ''Argus'' was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an [[accommodation ship]] and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. ''Argus'' was sold in late 1946 and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] the following year.\n\n==Design, description and construction==\n''Argus'' had her genesis in the [[Admiralty]]'s desire during the First World War for an aircraft carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but had no way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder [[William Beardmore and Company|William Beardmore]] had proposed to the Admiralty an aircraft carrier design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian [[ocean liner]]s ''Conte Rosso'' and ''Giulio Cesare'' had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. ''Conte Rosso'' was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of ''Giulio Cesare'', and the company began work on converting the ship.<ref>McBride, pp. 73\u201375</ref>\n\nJames Graham,sixth Marquis of Montrose, a director of the Beardmore company, proposed to the Admiralty a design for, \" A Parent Ship for Naval Aeroplanes and Torpedo Boat Destroyer, \" in 1912.(Page 40 MacKay & Friedman). The initial design had two [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|islands]] with the flight deck running between them. Each island contained one [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was mounted on top of the bracing, which left a clear height of {{convert|20|ft|m|1}} for the aircraft on the flight deck. Fairly early in the design process, the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.<ref>Friedman, pp. 62, 65</ref>\n\nIn November 1916, the ship's design was tested in a [[wind tunnel]] by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] to evaluate the turbulence caused by the twin islands and the bridge over them. They were found to cause problems, but no changes were made until the ship was nearly complete. In April 1918, ''Argus'' was ordered to be modified to a [[flush deck|flush-decked]] configuration after the [[sea trial]]s of the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had revealed severe turbulence problems caused by her superstructure. The ship was given a bridge underneath her flight deck, extending from side to side, and she was fitted with a retractable [[pilot house]] in the middle of the flight deck for use when not operating aircraft.<ref>Friedman, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\n''Argus''{{'}}s stability had been a concern from the beginning. Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling, most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight, raising her centre of gravity. Even the addition of {{convert|600|LT}} of [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] still left the ship with a very low [[metacentric height]] of only {{convert|1.6|ft}} lightly loaded and {{convert|3.8|ft}} at [[deep load]]. This meant she was very steady, but [[Heeling (sailing)|heeled]] noticeably when turning. The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds, but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area.<ref name=f6>Friedman, p. 66</ref>\n\n''Argus'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|565|ft|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|68|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|23|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|14450|LT}} at [[Standard displacement#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|15575|LT}} at deep load. Each of the ship's four sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s drove one [[propeller shaft]]. Steam was supplied by 12 cylindrical [[Scotch boiler]]s. The turbines were designed for a total of {{convert|20000|shp|lk=in}}, but they produced {{convert|21376|shp}} during her sea trials in September 1918, and gave ''Argus'' a speed of {{convert|20.506|kn}}. The ship carried {{convert|2500|LT}} of [[fuel oil]], which gave her a range of {{convert|3600|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 67, 365</ref>\n\nThe ship's flight deck was {{convert|549|ft|1}} long and her [[hangar]] was {{convert|330|ft|1}} long, {{convert|48|-|68|ft|1}} wide, and {{convert|16|ft|1}} high.<ref name=m67>McBride, pp. 76, 86</ref> Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft lifts]] (elevators); the forward lift measured {{convert|30|x|36|ft|m|1}} and the rear {{convert|60|x|18|ft|m|1}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 365</ref> ''Argus'' was the only British carrier serving in the Second World War capable of striking down (stowing away) aircraft with non-folding wings because of her wide lifts and tall hangar ceiling.<ref>Brown 2003, p. 115</ref> Three [[fire curtain]]s divided the hangar and another separated the hangar and the [[quarterdeck]].<ref name=m6/> She could accommodate between 15 and 18 aircraft.<ref name=f9/> No arresting gear was fitted as completed. Two large [[crane (machine)|cranes]] were positioned on the quarterdeck, beneath the rear of the flight deck. Petrol storage consisted of {{convert|8000|impgal|l usgal}} in {{convert|2|impgal|l usgal|adj=on}} tins stowed below the waterline. The ship's crew totalled 495 officers and men.<ref name=m6>McBride, p. 76</ref>\n\nThe ship was armed with four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|{{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}}]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s, two on the quarterdeck and one on each side of the hull. She was also fitted with two low-angle 4-inch guns, one also on each side of the hull. The rear [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and the torpedo warhead storage magazine were protected by a total of {{convert|2|in}} of protective plating on all sides, but the forward magazine and bomb storage rooms had only a 2-inch thick deck to protect them.<ref name=m67/>\n\n''Argus'' was [[Keel|laid down]] in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in [[Dalmuir]], as the ''Conte Rosso''. She was renamed after her purchase in September 1916 and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2{{nbsp}}December 1917, her building having been slowed by labour shortages.<ref>McBride, pp. 75, 77</ref> The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918.<ref>Friedman, p. 363</ref> Formally named after [[Argus Panoptes|Argus of the 100 Eyes]] from Greek mythology,<ref>Silverstone, p. 211</ref> ''Argus'' was nicknamed the ''Hat Box'' or \"Ditty Box\" or the ''Flatiron'' due to her flat-topped appearance.<ref name=m9>McBride, p. 79</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n===1918\u20131939===\nAfter commissioning too late to participate in the First World War, ''Argus'' was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from ''Furious''. The first landings on the ship were made on Tuesday 24September{{nbsp}}1918 by two [[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutters|Sopwith Ship Strutters]] flown by Commander Bell-Davis. The other aeroplane was flown onto her deck by Captain C.H. Cockey from Turnhouse. (ref: Mackay Page 49) The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and [[Sopwith Pup]]s. ''Argus'' was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered {{convert|9|in|0}}, which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest of the flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. ''Argus'' joined the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four [[Sopwith Camel]] fighters, two [[Airco DH.9A]] bombers and two [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] [[floatplane]]s. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.<ref>Friedman, pp. 67\u201369</ref>\n\nAfter the ship's return from its cruise, a conference was convened aboard ''Argus'' on 19 May to consider revised landing arrangements. It was decided that a longer system of wires was needed, and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed. Powered [[palisade]]s were also needed on the side of the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire. The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} later in the year and ''Argus''{{'}} arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise, during which the ship carried ten [[Parnall Panther]] spotter and [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and three [[Fairey III]]C reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the ship's after lift was permanently locked in the raised position and {{convert|150|LT}} of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship. This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made, only two of which resulted in serious accidents, an accident rate comparable to those of land-based units. The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise, primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 69</ref>\n\nOn September 1922, ''Argus'', equipped with [[Gloster Nightjar]] fighters, was deployed to the [[Dardanelles]] as a response to the [[Chanak crisis]]. As well as operating her own aircraft, ''Argus'' was used to fly off [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]] that had been ferried to the Dardanelles aboard the [[seaplane carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|2}} to an airfield at [[\u015eile|Kilia]] on the European side of the straits. (The aircraft could not be flown off ''Ark Royal'' since it was a seaplane carrier with no flight deck. The Bristol Fighters were transferred to ''Argus'' by crane).<ref name=\"AE p38\">Halley, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, ''Argus'' was [[Inclining test|inclined]] to evaluate her stability in light of the additional weights that had been added since her completion and it was discovered that her metacentric height had been reduced by {{convert|0.83|ft|1}}. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to fit her with a [[Anti-torpedo bulge|girdle]] at her [[waterline]] to increase her beam and thus her stability. He intended to do this under the 1923\u20131924 Naval Programme, but this was delayed several times as the ship was needed for training and when she was finally modified it was under the 1925\u20131926 Naval Programme. Girdling increased her deep displacement to {{convert|16750|LT}} and her beam to {{convert|74|ft|1}}, and reduced her draught to {{convert|22|ft|10|in|m|1}} and her speed by a quarter of a knot. The ship was also fitted with bulk petrol storage, new four-inch guns that used [[List of British ordnance terms#Fixed QF|fixed ammunition]], and new radio masts.<ref>Friedman, p. 67</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft carrier HMS Argus in the later 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|''Argus'' in the late 1920s]]\n''Argus'' usually operated about 15 aircraft during the 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or [[Fairey Flycatcher]]s), one of spotters (Parnall Panthers or [[Avro Bison]]s), and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 466\u201369</ref>\n\nThe ship's hull was surveyed in 1927 and anticipated to be sound for another 15 years,<ref name=\"f9\"/> and she relieved {{HMS|Hermes|95|2}} on the [[China Station]] from 1{{nbsp}}September to 20 March 1928.<ref>McCart, pp. 21\u201323</ref> Sometime after her return, ''Argus'' was laid up at Plymouth at 14-days readiness to save money. Since she was completed before 9{{nbsp}}December 1921, the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] classified her as an experimental aircraft carrier and thus she did not need to be scrapped to release treaty-limited tonnage for new construction. The ship was reduced to Extended Reserve (four months readiness) at [[Rosyth]] in September 1932. In February 1936, it was decided to refit the ship as a tender for [[De Havilland Tiger Moth#Variants|Queen Bee]] [[target drone]]s. The opportunity was taken to widen her flight deck by {{convert|10|ft}} and replace her old boilers with [[destroyer]]-type boilers which could generate more steam than her turbines could handle. The boilers were taken from scrapped destroyers of the V and W class which were being broken up at Inverkeithing. (MacKay P88) The ship was intended to have one hydro-pneumatic [[aircraft catapult]], but this was instead diverted to {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}}. Since ''Argus'' was now classified as a naval auxiliary, her four-inch guns were removed. Her refit was completed on 30 July 1938 and she underwent sea trials the following month.<ref name=m9/><ref>Friedman, pp. 69, 71</ref>. She was classified as a Target Aeroplane Carrier for the de Havilland Queen Bee and recommissioned 11 August 1938, in command was Captain W.G Benn R.N.(MacKay P91)\n\n===Second World War===\nAfter recommissioning, ''Argus'' served as a training carrier to allow pilots to practice their deck-landing skills. She was carrying out this duty in the [[Gulf of Lion]] when the [[World War II|Second World War]] began. By April 1940, the ship had been rearmed with two [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF Mk{{nbsp}}V 4-inch]] anti-aircraft guns on her quarterdeck, as well as three quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers .50{{nbsp}}machine gun mounts]]; one of these was on each side of her hull and the third was on the centreline of the quarterdeck.<ref name=f1>Friedman, p. 71</ref><ref>McBride, p. 80</ref> Together with the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and six destroyers, ''Argus'' escorted Convoy US-3, loaded with Australian and New Zealand troops, to the United Kingdom in mid-June.<ref>Rohwer, p. 22</ref> A week later, she ferried [[Supermarine Walrus]] amphibians of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] to [[Reykjav\u00edk]], Iceland. ''Argus'' loaded a dozen [[Hawker Hurricane]] and two [[Blackburn Skua]] fighters of 418 Flight RAF in late July for delivery to Malta as part of [[Operation Hurry]]. Escorted by ''Ark Royal'', three battleships, two cruisers and 10 destroyers, the ship flew them off without incident on 2{{nbsp}}August 1940 from a point west of [[Sicily]], although two of the Hurricanes crashed on landing.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1987, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Accompanied by the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and escorted by two destroyers, she returned to [[Liverpool]] to load 30 Hurricanes with their wings removed. ''Argus'' sailed on 22 August and arrived at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] on 5{{nbsp}}September where her aircraft were off-loaded. After her return to the United Kingdom, the ship was briefly refitted<ref>Nailer, pp. 152\u201353</ref> and she ferried 701 Squadron back to the United Kingdom in late October.<ref name=s7>Sturtivant, pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\nOn 11 November, ''Argus'' sailed again from Liverpool with a deck-load of a dozen Hurricanes and two Skuas for delivery to Malta ([[Operation White]]). She rendezvoused with [[Force H]] four days later and launched the aircraft on the morning of 17 November. Eight of the Hurricanes ran out of fuel en route due to [[headwind]]s and one Skua was forced to [[emergency landing|crash land]] on Sicily after it had been damaged by Italian [[flak]]. In mid-December, the ship embarked six [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers of [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821X Squadron]] for delivery to Gibraltar and another pair of Swordfish from [[825 Naval Air Squadron|825 Squadron]] for self-defence. The carrier rendezvoused with ''Furious'' and Convoy WS-5A before the combined force was discovered by the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper}} on 25 December, but little damage was inflicted by ''Hipper'' before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in ''Argus'' with bombs that they could not carry and the torpedoes were aboard ''Furious''.<ref name=n4/> After ''Furious''{{'}}s Skuas had flown off to search for ''Hipper'', space was cleared to allow ''Argus''{{'}} Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate ''Hipper'' because of the poor visibility. ''Argus'' delivered 821X Squadron to Gibraltar and was back in the United Kingdom by 14 January 1941.<ref name=n4>Nailer, p. 154</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft in hangar of HMS Argus (I49) c1942.jpg|thumb|left|Five Sea Hurricanes and a single Seafire lined up in the hangar, c. 1942\u201344]]\nIn March, the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March, where they were loaded onto ''Ark Royal'' and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of [[812 Naval Air Squadron|812 Squadron]] for self-defence. After a brief refit, ''Argus'' sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to ''Ark Royal''. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was back in the United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of [[800 Naval Air Squadron|800X Squadron]] were also embarked to protect the ship against the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] Condors that patrolled the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the Eastern [[Atlantic]]. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.<ref>Nailer, pp. 155\u201357</ref>\n\nIn late August to early September, ''Argus'' transported 24 Hurricanes of [[No. 151 Wing RAF]] to [[Murmansk]], Russia.<ref>Rohwer, p. 93</ref><ref name=Mcbride80>McBride, pp. 80\u201381</ref> She then ferried a dozen [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers of [[828 Naval Air Squadron|828 Squadron]] to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of [[804 Naval Air Squadron|804 Squadron]] on her return trip to England, but this was cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied ''Eagle'' back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. ''Argus'' loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from [[818 Naval Air Squadron|818 Squadron]] and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8{{nbsp}}November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in [[Operation Perpetual]], sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. ''Ark Royal'' was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced ''Argus'' to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.<ref>Nailer, pp. 159\u201360</ref>\n\nForce H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and ''Argus'' loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to ''Eagle'' and embarked nine [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters of [[807 Naval Air Squadron|807 Squadron]]. The plan for [[Operation Spotter]] I was for ''Argus'' to provide fighter cover for ''Eagle'' as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7{{nbsp}}March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During [[Operation Picket]] I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by ''Eagle'' on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from ''Argus''. The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when ''Eagle'' flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from ''Argus''. The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.<ref>Nailer, pp. 160\u201361</ref>\n\nAnother attempt to deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during [[Operation LB]]. As usual, ''Argus'' provided the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and ''Eagle'' ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take-off point for Malta on 19 May.<ref>Nailer, p. 162</ref> The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and they were forced to return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to \"Winter\" rather than \"Summer\". One of the Fulmars was shot down by [[Vichy French]] [[Dewoitine D.520]] fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]] that had been shot down earlier.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 282\u201384</ref> By this time the ship's [[Vickers]] .50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20{{nbsp}}mm]] light anti-aircraft guns.<ref name=f1/>\n\nAfterwards, the ship returned to the UK to ferry [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801 Squadron]] to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7{{nbsp}}June. Together with ''Eagle'', ''Argus'' was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June ([[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]]). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine Swordfish from [[813 Naval Air Squadron|813 Squadron]] and four more Swordfish from [[824 Naval Air Squadron|824 Squadron]] to protect the convoy from submarines while ''Eagle'' loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side. Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] and one [[CANT Z.1007]] bomber. ''Eagle'' transferred her Fulmars to ''Argus'' over the course of the battle and two more were lost later in the day.

She was converted from an [[ocean liner]] that was under construction when the [[First World War]] began and became the first example of the standard pattern of aircraft carrier, with a full-length [[flight deck]] that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was involved for several years in the development of the optimum design for other aircraft carriers. ''Argus'' also evaluated various types of [[arresting gear]], general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s. She spent one brief deployment on the [[China Station]] in the late 1920s before being placed in [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|reserve]] for budgetary reasons.\n\n''Argus'' was recommissioned and partially modernised shortly before the Second World War and served as a [[training ship]] for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many [[Malta Convoys|ferry trips]] to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to [[Malta]]; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to [[Murmansk]] in Russia, [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], and [[Reykjav\u00edk]] in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and ''Argus'' was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]], providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of [[French North Africa]] and was slightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, ''Argus'' was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an [[accommodation ship]] and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. ''Argus'' was sold in late 1946 and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] the following year.\n\n==Design, description and construction==\n''Argus'' had her genesis in the [[Admiralty]]'s desire during the First World War for an aircraft carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but had no way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder [[William Beardmore and Company|William Beardmore]] had proposed to the Admiralty an aircraft carrier design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian [[ocean liner]]s ''Conte Rosso'' and ''Giulio Cesare'' had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. ''Conte Rosso'' was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of ''Giulio Cesare'', and the company began work on converting the ship.<ref>McBride, pp. 73\u201375</ref>\n\nJames Graham,sixth Marquis of Montrose, a director of the Beardmore company, proposed to the Admiralty a design for, \" A Parent Ship for Naval Aeroplanes and Torpedo Boat Destroyer, \" in 1912.(Page 40 MacKay & Friedman). The initial design had two [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|islands]] with the flight deck running between them. Each island contained one [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was mounted on top of the bracing, which left a clear height of {{convert|20|ft|m|1}} for the aircraft on the flight deck. Fairly early in the design process, the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.<ref>Friedman, pp. 62, 65</ref>\n\nIn November 1916, the ship's design was tested in a [[wind tunnel]] by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] to evaluate the turbulence caused by the twin islands and the bridge over them. They were found to cause problems, but no changes were made until the ship was nearly complete. In April 1918, ''Argus'' was ordered to be modified to a [[flush deck|flush-decked]] configuration after the [[sea trial]]s of the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had revealed severe turbulence problems caused by her superstructure. The ship was given a bridge underneath her flight deck, extending from side to side, and she was fitted with a retractable [[pilot house]] in the middle of the flight deck for use when not operating aircraft.<ref>Friedman, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\n''Argus''{{'}}s stability had been a concern from the beginning. Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling, most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight, raising her centre of gravity. Even the addition of {{convert|600|LT}} of [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] still left the ship with a very low [[metacentric height]] of only {{convert|1.6|ft}} lightly loaded and {{convert|3.8|ft}} at [[deep load]]. This meant she was very steady, but [[Heeling (sailing)|heeled]] noticeably when turning. The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds, but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area.<ref name=f6>Friedman, p. 66</ref>\n\n''Argus'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|565|ft|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|68|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|23|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|14450|LT}} at [[Standard displacement#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|15575|LT}} at deep load. Each of the ship's four sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s drove one [[propeller shaft]]. Steam was supplied by 12 cylindrical [[Scotch boiler]]s. The turbines were designed for a total of {{convert|20000|shp|lk=in}}, but they produced {{convert|21376|shp}} during her sea trials in September 1918, and gave ''Argus'' a speed of {{convert|20.506|kn}}. The ship carried {{convert|2500|LT}} of [[fuel oil]], which gave her a range of {{convert|3600|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 67, 365</ref>\n\nThe ship's flight deck was {{convert|549|ft|1}} long and her [[hangar]] was {{convert|330|ft|1}} long, {{convert|48|-|68|ft|1}} wide, and {{convert|16|ft|1}} high.<ref name=m67>McBride, pp. 76, 86</ref> Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft lifts]] (elevators); the forward lift measured {{convert|30|x|36|ft|m|1}} and the rear {{convert|60|x|18|ft|m|1}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 365</ref> ''Argus'' was the only British carrier serving in the Second World War capable of striking down (stowing away) aircraft with non-folding wings because of her wide lifts and tall hangar ceiling.<ref>Brown 2003, p. 115</ref> Three [[fire curtain]]s divided the hangar and another separated the hangar and the [[quarterdeck]].<ref name=m6/> She could accommodate between 15 and 18 aircraft.<ref name=f9/> No arresting gear was fitted as completed. Two large [[crane (machine)|cranes]] were positioned on the quarterdeck, beneath the rear of the flight deck. Petrol storage consisted of {{convert|8000|impgal|l usgal}} in {{convert|2|impgal|l usgal|adj=on}} tins stowed below the waterline. The ship's crew totalled 495 officers and men.<ref name=m6>McBride, p. 76</ref>\n\nThe ship was armed with four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|{{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}}]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s, two on the quarterdeck and one on each side of the hull. She was also fitted with two low-angle 4-inch guns, one also on each side of the hull. The rear [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and the torpedo warhead storage magazine were protected by a total of {{convert|2|in}} of protective plating on all sides, but the forward magazine and bomb storage rooms had only a 2-inch thick deck to protect them.<ref name=m67/>\n\n''Argus'' was [[Keel|laid down]] in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in [[Dalmuir]], as the ''Conte Rosso''. She was renamed after her purchase in September 1916 and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2{{nbsp}}December 1917, her building having been slowed by labour shortages.<ref>McBride, pp. 75, 77</ref> The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918.<ref>Friedman, p. 363</ref> Formally named after [[Argus Panoptes|Argus of the 100 Eyes]] from Greek mythology,<ref>Silverstone, p. 211</ref> ''Argus'' was nicknamed the ''Hat Box'' or \"Ditty Box\" or the ''Flatiron'' due to her flat-topped appearance.<ref name=m9>McBride, p. 79</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n===1918\u20131939===\nAfter commissioning too late to participate in the First World War, ''Argus'' was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from ''Furious''. The first landings on the ship were made on Tuesday 24September{{nbsp}}1918 by two [[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutters|Sopwith Ship Strutters]] flown by Commander Bell-Davis. The other aeroplane was flown onto her deck by Captain C.H. Cockey from Turnhouse.<ref name=Mackay P49 ref> The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and [[Sopwith Pup]]s. ''Argus'' was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered {{convert|9|in|0}}, which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest of the flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. ''Argus'' joined the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four [[Sopwith Camel]] fighters, two [[Airco DH.9A]] bombers and two [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] [[floatplane]]s. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.<ref>Friedman, pp. 67\u201369</ref>\n\nAfter the ship's return from its cruise, a conference was convened aboard ''Argus'' on 19 May to consider revised landing arrangements. It was decided that a longer system of wires was needed, and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed. Powered [[palisade]]s were also needed on the side of the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire. The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} later in the year and ''Argus''{{'}} arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise, during which the ship carried ten [[Parnall Panther]] spotter and [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and three [[Fairey III]]C reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the ship's after lift was permanently locked in the raised position and {{convert|150|LT}} of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship. This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made, only two of which resulted in serious accidents, an accident rate comparable to those of land-based units. The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise, primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 69</ref>\n\nOn September 1922, ''Argus'', equipped with [[Gloster Nightjar]] fighters, was deployed to the [[Dardanelles]] as a response to the [[Chanak crisis]]. As well as operating her own aircraft, ''Argus'' was used to fly off [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]] that had been ferried to the Dardanelles aboard the [[seaplane carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|2}} to an airfield at [[\u015eile|Kilia]] on the European side of the straits. (The aircraft could not be flown off ''Ark Royal'' since it was a seaplane carrier with no flight deck. The Bristol Fighters were transferred to ''Argus'' by crane).<ref name=\"AE p38\">Halley, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, ''Argus'' was [[Inclining test|inclined]] to evaluate her stability in light of the additional weights that had been added since her completion and it was discovered that her metacentric height had been reduced by {{convert|0.83|ft|1}}. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to fit her with a [[Anti-torpedo bulge|girdle]] at her [[waterline]] to increase her beam and thus her stability. He intended to do this under the 1923\u20131924 Naval Programme, but this was delayed several times as the ship was needed for training and when she was finally modified it was under the 1925\u20131926 Naval Programme. Girdling increased her deep displacement to {{convert|16750|LT}} and her beam to {{convert|74|ft|1}}, and reduced her draught to {{convert|22|ft|10|in|m|1}} and her speed by a quarter of a knot. The ship was also fitted with bulk petrol storage, new four-inch guns that used [[List of British ordnance terms#Fixed QF|fixed ammunition]], and new radio masts.<ref>Friedman, p. 67</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft carrier HMS Argus in the later 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|''Argus'' in the late 1920s]]\n''Argus'' usually operated about 15 aircraft during the 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or [[Fairey Flycatcher]]s), one of spotters (Parnall Panthers or [[Avro Bison]]s), and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 466\u201369</ref>\n\nThe ship's hull was surveyed in 1927 and anticipated to be sound for another 15 years,<ref name=\"f9\"/> and she relieved {{HMS|Hermes|95|2}} on the [[China Station]] from 1{{nbsp}}September to 20 March 1928.<ref>McCart, pp. 21\u201323</ref> Sometime after her return, ''Argus'' was laid up at Plymouth at 14-days readiness to save money. Since she was completed before 9{{nbsp}}December 1921, the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] classified her as an experimental aircraft carrier and thus she did not need to be scrapped to release treaty-limited tonnage for new construction. The ship was reduced to Extended Reserve (four months readiness) at [[Rosyth]] in September 1932. In February 1936, it was decided to refit the ship as a tender for [[De Havilland Tiger Moth#Variants|Queen Bee]] [[target drone]]s. The opportunity was taken to widen her flight deck by {{convert|10|ft}} and replace her old boilers with [[destroyer]]-type boilers which could generate more steam than her turbines could handle. The boilers were taken from scrapped destroyers of the V and W class which were being broken up at Inverkeithing. (MacKay P88) The ship was intended to have one hydro-pneumatic [[aircraft catapult]], but this was instead diverted to {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}}. Since ''Argus'' was now classified as a naval auxiliary, her four-inch guns were removed. Her refit was completed on 30 July 1938 and she underwent sea trials the following month.<ref name=m9/><ref>Friedman, pp. 69, 71</ref>. She was classified as a Target Aeroplane Carrier for the de Havilland Queen Bee and recommissioned 11 August 1938, in command was Captain W.G Benn R.N.(MacKay P91)\n\n===Second World War===\nAfter recommissioning, ''Argus'' served as a training carrier to allow pilots to practice their deck-landing skills. She was carrying out this duty in the [[Gulf of Lion]] when the [[World War II|Second World War]] began. By April 1940, the ship had been rearmed with two [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF Mk{{nbsp}}V 4-inch]] anti-aircraft guns on her quarterdeck, as well as three quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers .50{{nbsp}}machine gun mounts]]; one of these was on each side of her hull and the third was on the centreline of the quarterdeck.<ref name=f1>Friedman, p. 71</ref><ref>McBride, p. 80</ref> Together with the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and six destroyers, ''Argus'' escorted Convoy US-3, loaded with Australian and New Zealand troops, to the United Kingdom in mid-June.<ref>Rohwer, p. 22</ref> A week later, she ferried [[Supermarine Walrus]] amphibians of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] to [[Reykjav\u00edk]], Iceland. ''Argus'' loaded a dozen [[Hawker Hurricane]] and two [[Blackburn Skua]] fighters of 418 Flight RAF in late July for delivery to Malta as part of [[Operation Hurry]]. Escorted by ''Ark Royal'', three battleships, two cruisers and 10 destroyers, the ship flew them off without incident on 2{{nbsp}}August 1940 from a point west of [[Sicily]], although two of the Hurricanes crashed on landing.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1987, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Accompanied by the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and escorted by two destroyers, she returned to [[Liverpool]] to load 30 Hurricanes with their wings removed. ''Argus'' sailed on 22 August and arrived at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] on 5{{nbsp}}September where her aircraft were off-loaded. After her return to the United Kingdom, the ship was briefly refitted<ref>Nailer, pp. 152\u201353</ref> and she ferried 701 Squadron back to the United Kingdom in late October.<ref name=s7>Sturtivant, pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\nOn 11 November, ''Argus'' sailed again from Liverpool with a deck-load of a dozen Hurricanes and two Skuas for delivery to Malta ([[Operation White]]). She rendezvoused with [[Force H]] four days later and launched the aircraft on the morning of 17 November. Eight of the Hurricanes ran out of fuel en route due to [[headwind]]s and one Skua was forced to [[emergency landing|crash land]] on Sicily after it had been damaged by Italian [[flak]]. In mid-December, the ship embarked six [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers of [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821X Squadron]] for delivery to Gibraltar and another pair of Swordfish from [[825 Naval Air Squadron|825 Squadron]] for self-defence. The carrier rendezvoused with ''Furious'' and Convoy WS-5A before the combined force was discovered by the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper}} on 25 December, but little damage was inflicted by ''Hipper'' before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in ''Argus'' with bombs that they could not carry and the torpedoes were aboard ''Furious''.<ref name=n4/> After ''Furious''{{'}}s Skuas had flown off to search for ''Hipper'', space was cleared to allow ''Argus''{{'}} Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate ''Hipper'' because of the poor visibility. ''Argus'' delivered 821X Squadron to Gibraltar and was back in the United Kingdom by 14 January 1941.<ref name=n4>Nailer, p. 154</ref>\n\n[[File:Aircraft in hangar of HMS Argus (I49) c1942.jpg|thumb|left|Five Sea Hurricanes and a single Seafire lined up in the hangar, c. 1942\u201344]]\nIn March, the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March, where they were loaded onto ''Ark Royal'' and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of [[812 Naval Air Squadron|812 Squadron]] for self-defence. After a brief refit, ''Argus'' sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to ''Ark Royal''. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was back in the United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of [[800 Naval Air Squadron|800X Squadron]] were also embarked to protect the ship against the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] Condors that patrolled the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the Eastern [[Atlantic]]. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.<ref>Nailer, pp. 155\u201357</ref>\n\nIn late August to early September, ''Argus'' transported 24 Hurricanes of [[No. 151 Wing RAF]] to [[Murmansk]], Russia.<ref>Rohwer, p. 93</ref><ref name=Mcbride80>McBride, pp. 80\u201381</ref> She then ferried a dozen [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers of [[828 Naval Air Squadron|828 Squadron]] to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of [[804 Naval Air Squadron|804 Squadron]] on her return trip to England, but this was cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied ''Eagle'' back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. ''Argus'' loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from [[818 Naval Air Squadron|818 Squadron]] and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8{{nbsp}}November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in [[Operation Perpetual]], sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. ''Ark Royal'' was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced ''Argus'' to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.<ref>Nailer, pp. 159\u201360</ref>\n\nForce H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and ''Argus'' loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to ''Eagle'' and embarked nine [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters of [[807 Naval Air Squadron|807 Squadron]]. The plan for [[Operation Spotter]] I was for ''Argus'' to provide fighter cover for ''Eagle'' as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7{{nbsp}}March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During [[Operation Picket]] I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by ''Eagle'' on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from ''Argus''. The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when ''Eagle'' flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from ''Argus''. The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.<ref>Nailer, pp. 160\u201361</ref>\n\nAnother attempt to deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during [[Operation LB]]. As usual, ''Argus'' provided the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and ''Eagle'' ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take-off point for Malta on 19 May.<ref>Nailer, p. 162</ref> The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and they were forced to return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to \"Winter\" rather than \"Summer\". One of the Fulmars was shot down by [[Vichy French]] [[Dewoitine D.520]] fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]] that had been shot down earlier.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 282\u201384</ref> By this time the ship's [[Vickers]] .50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20{{nbsp}}mm]] light anti-aircraft guns.<ref name=f1/>\n\nAfterwards, the ship returned to the UK to ferry [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801 Squadron]] to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7{{nbsp}}June. Together with ''Eagle'', ''Argus'' was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June ([[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]]). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine Swordfish from [[813 Naval Air Squadron|813 Squadron]] and four more Swordfish from [[824 Naval Air Squadron|824 Squadron]] to protect the convoy from submarines while ''Eagle'' loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side. Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] and one [[CANT Z.1007]] bomber. ''Eagle'' transferred her Fulmars to ''Argus'' over the course of the battle and two more were lost later in the day. The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 319\u201320, 325, 327, 329\u201330, 333, 336</ref>\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A12882.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph of an aircraft carrier at sea. An aircraft is about to land on her stern, and another aircraft is positioned at the forward end of the flight deck|''Argus'' at sea during [[Operation Torch]] in late 1942]]\n\nAs part of the preparations for another resupply convoy for Malta ([[Operation Pedestal]]), ''Argus'' returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft, including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron, for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] on 2{{nbsp}}August for Gibraltar. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5{{nbsp}}August for a three-day training exercise to work out co-ordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed not ready for combat. It was ordered to return to the UK aboard ''Argus''.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizia 1991, pp. 451\u201352</ref><ref>Nailer, p. 164</ref>\n\nIn November 1942, ''Argus'' was assigned to the Eastern Naval Task Force that invaded [[Algiers]], Algeria, during the Allied landings in French North Africa with 18 [[Supermarine Seafire]] IICs of [[880 Naval Air Squadron|880 Squadron]] aboard.<ref>Brown 2009, p. 62</ref> The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that killed four men. She and the [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Avenger|D14|2}} joined a convoy returning to the United Kingdom on the evening of 14/15 November that was spotted by the Germans. {{GS|U-155|1941|2}} torpedoed ''Avenger'', right behind ''Argus'' in the convoy, later that morning. The ship was under repair for a month after she reached the United Kingdom, but she required a more thorough refit that lasted from February to May 1943. Reclassified as an escort carrier after the completion of her refit, she was relegated to deck-landing training. She was ordered to be paid off on 27 January 1944, but this order was apparently revoked as she continued training until 27 September 1944 when the last take-off was made from her deck, a Fairey Swordfish.<ref>McBride, p. 86</ref> In March, she was ordered to be converted to an aircraft freighter around the end of the year, but this plan was also apparently cancelled. ''Argus'' became an accommodation ship at Chatham<ref name=f1/> in December<ref>Colledge and Warlow, p. 20</ref> and she was approved for scrapping on 6{{nbsp}}May 1946.<ref name=f1/> She was sold to [[Thos W Ward]] on 5{{nbsp}}December 1946 and arrived at [[Inverkeithing]] later that month to be broken up.<ref>Lenton, p. 96</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David K.|title=The Grand Fleet: Warship Design and Development 1906\u20131922|publisher=Caxton Editions|location=London|year=2003|edition=reprint of the 1999|isbn=1-84067-531-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=J.

In their elimination final, the heavily favoured Eagles were defeated at home by the [[Western Bulldogs]], who went on to claim the 2016 premiership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-08/western-bulldogs-beat-west-coast-in-elimination-final/7827992|title=Western Bulldogs stun West Coast in elimination final|date=8 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, West Coast finished in eighth position on the table. A thrilling finish against Adelaide in the last ever game at Subiaco was enough to put them into their third consecutive finals series under Simpson. Their percentage of 105.7% edged out Melbourne, who finished with the same number of wins and an almost identical percentage of 105.2%. Remarkably, their elimination final away against {{AFL PA}} ended up a tie after regulation time and was sent to [[extra time]]. The Eagles controversially won after the siren courtesy of a [[Luke Shuey]] goal. The following week they were soundly defeated away by {{AFL GWS}}, in front of the lowest finals crowd in over 100 years.\n\nFew predicted West Coast would contend in season 2018, with most having them outside the 8. After losing the inaugural game at the new [[Optus Stadium]] against the Sydney Swans, West Coast went on to win 10 in a row to surge to top of the ladder, including defeating Hawthorn at Etihad and Richmond, the eventual minor premiers. However, injuries to star forwards [[Josh Kennedy (footballer, born 1987)|Josh Kennedy]] and [[Jack Darling]] saw them struggle, losing 3 games in a row including to Sydney for a second this time at the SCG. Despite injuries, they managed to rebound and stabilise. The Eagle's form at the MCG had long been criticised, and round 17 against an in form Collingwood who had won 7 of the previous matches was seen as a stern test. The match was fairly close throughout, until the Eagles got on top in the last ten minutes of the third quarter to win by a commanding 35 points. The victory was bittersweet, however, as the All-Australian ruckman [[Nic Naitanui]] went down with an ACL for the second time after his 2016 injury, putting him out for the rest of the season. In round 20 star midfielder [[Andrew Gaff]] was suspended for 8 weeks for a hit on Fremantle player Andrew Brayshaw. Following this many dismissed the Eagles, believing they were unable to win the flag. The following week there was a bright spot in a dark period, as [[Jeremy McGovern]] kicked a goal after the siren at Adelaide Oval to pinch the game from Port Adelaide, in similar circumstances to West Coast's win over Port in the 2017 elimination final.\n\nThe Eagles finished the home and away season second on the ladder with 16 wins and 6 losses - their best result since 2006 - earning the right to host the second qualifying final against third-placed Collingwood at Optus Stadium. Collingwood. led for most of the close, hard-fought match, before the Eagles again pulled away in the last quarter to win by 16 points.\n\nIn the second preliminary final, the Eagles faced the fifth-placed Melbourne Demons, a team whose impressive end-of-season form had begun with a victory over the Eagles at Optus Stadium in round 22. What was touted as a close-fought match instead became a blowout. West Coast led 10.9.69 to 0.6.6 at half time, Melbourne becoming the first team since 1927 to fail to score a goal in a half of finals football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2018/26/wce-v-melb|title=West Coast Eagles Vs Melbourne - Match Centre - AFL.com.au|website=afl.com.au}}</ref> West Coast eventually won by 66 points, 121 to 55.\n\nIn the grand final, West Coast again played Collingwood, who had upset Richmond in the first preliminary final the week prior. In a match dubbed an all-time classic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theroar.com.au/2018/09/29/west-coast-crowned-2018-afl-premiers-in-all-time-classic-grand-final/|title=West Coast crowned 2018 AFL premiers in all-time classic grand final|publisher=}}</ref> Collingwood led by as much as 29 points in the first quarter, but the resilient Eagles managed to claw their way back into the contest, and with just over 2 minutes left, a brilliant play set up by a Jeremy McGovern intercept mark and a further sensational mark by first year player Liam Ryan  saw Dom Sheed score a goal from a tight angle to put the Eagles 4 points in front. The Eagles went on to win 79 to 74, claiming their fourth premiership in front of 100,022 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. [[Luke Shuey]] won the Norm Smith Medal.\n\nThe Eagles started their premiership defence in indifferent fashion, suffering three heavy defeats in the first six weeks of the 2019 season. The reigning premiers recovered magnificently, winning 12 of their next fourteen matches, but missed out on a spot in the top four after an upset 38-point loss to Hawthorn in round 23. The Eagles finished fifth on the AFL ladder with a 15\u20137 win-loss record. They thrashed Essendon by 55 points in the first elimination final but their premiership defence was brought to a premature end the following week, losing to minor premiers Geelong by 20 points in the first semi-final.\n\n[[File:Subiaco Oval panorama.jpg|thumb|800px|center|[[Subiaco Oval]] during a match against {{AFL Fre}} in the [[2008 NAB Cup]].]]\n\n==Finance and ownership==\nThe West Coast Eagles have been owned in full by the [[West Australian Football Commission]] (WAFC) since 1989.

It entered the AFL, then known as the Victorian Football League, in [[1987 VFL season|1987]] along with [[Queensland]]'s [[Brisbane Bears]]. It reached the finals series for the first time in [[1988 VFL season|1988]], and won its first premiership in [[1992 AFL season|1992]], having been defeated in the [[1991 AFL Grand Final|grand final]] the previous year. It was the first non-Victorian team to compete in and win a grand final. The Eagles have since won three more premierships, in [[1994 AFL season|1994]], [[2006 AFL season|2006]] and [[2018 AFL season|2018]]. The club is currently coached by [[Adam Simpson]]. \n\nThe Eagles have won the second most premierships (four, second to {{AFL Haw}}) in the AFL era (1990 onwards) and are one of the most strongly supported and profitable clubs in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theroar.com.au/2018/05/09/best-two-clubs-afl-era-no-neither-hawthorn/|title=The best two clubs of the AFL era (and no, neither is Hawthorn)|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/west-coast-eagles/flag-win-a-2-million-windfall-for-west-coast-eagles-ng-b88977105z|title=Flag win a $2 million windfall for West Coast Eagles|date=1 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs well as competing in the AFL, West Coast also field teams in the [[AFL Women's]] (AFLW) and [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the West Coast Eagles}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; font-size: 85%; border: 1px solid #BBB; margin: .5em 0 0 .3em;\"\n! colspan=\"7\"| West Coast Eagles seasons\n|-\n!

However, injuries to star forwards [[Josh Kennedy (footballer, born 1987)|Josh Kennedy]] and [[Jack Darling]] saw them struggle, losing 3 games in a row including to Sydney for a second this time at the SCG. Despite injuries, they managed to rebound and stabilise. The Eagle's form at the MCG had long been criticised, and round 17 against an in form Collingwood who had won 7 of the previous matches was seen as a stern test. The match was fairly close throughout, until the Eagles got on top in the last ten minutes of the third quarter to win by a commanding 35 points. The victory was bittersweet, however, as the All-Australian ruckman [[Nic Naitanui]] went down with an ACL for the second time after his 2016 injury, putting him out for the rest of the season. In round 20 star midfielder [[Andrew Gaff]] was suspended for 8 weeks for a hit on Fremantle player Andrew Brayshaw. Following this many dismissed the Eagles, believing they were unable to win the flag. The following week there was a bright spot in a dark period, as [[Jeremy McGovern]] kicked a goal after the siren at Adelaide Oval to pinch the game from Port Adelaide, in similar circumstances to West Coast's win over Port in the 2017 elimination final.\n\nThe Eagles finished the home and away season second on the ladder with 16 wins and 6 losses - their best result since 2006 - earning the right to host the second qualifying final against third-placed Collingwood at Optus Stadium. Collingwood. led for most of the close, hard-fought match, before the Eagles again pulled away in the last quarter to win by 16 points.\n\nIn the second preliminary final, the Eagles faced the fifth-placed Melbourne Demons, a team whose impressive end-of-season form had begun with a victory over the Eagles at Optus Stadium in round 22. What was touted as a close-fought match instead became a blowout. West Coast led 10.9.69 to 0.6.6 at half time, Melbourne becoming the first team since 1927 to fail to score a goal in a half of finals football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2018/26/wce-v-melb|title=West Coast Eagles Vs Melbourne - Match Centre - AFL.com.au|website=afl.com.au}}</ref> West Coast eventually won by 66 points, 121 to 55.\n\nIn the grand final, West Coast again played Collingwood, who had upset Richmond in the first preliminary final the week prior. In a match dubbed an all-time classic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theroar.com.au/2018/09/29/west-coast-crowned-2018-afl-premiers-in-all-time-classic-grand-final/|title=West Coast crowned 2018 AFL premiers in all-time classic grand final|publisher=}}</ref> Collingwood led by as much as 29 points in the first quarter, but the resilient Eagles managed to claw their way back into the contest, and with just over 2 minutes left, a brilliant play set up by a Jeremy McGovern intercept mark and a further sensational mark by first year player Liam Ryan  saw Dom Sheed score a goal from a tight angle to put the Eagles 4 points in front. The Eagles went on to win 79 to 74, claiming their fourth premiership in front of 100,022 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. [[Luke Shuey]] won the Norm Smith Medal.\n\nThe Eagles started their premiership defence in indifferent fashion, suffering three heavy defeats in the first six weeks of the 2019 season. The reigning premiers recovered magnificently, winning 12 of their next fourteen matches, but missed out on a spot in the top four after an upset 38-point loss to Hawthorn in round 23. The Eagles finished fifth on the AFL ladder with a 15\u20137 win-loss record. They thrashed Essendon by 55 points in the first elimination final but their premiership defence was brought to a premature end the following week, losing to minor premiers Geelong by 20 points in the first semi-final.\n\n[[File:Subiaco Oval panorama.jpg|thumb|800px|center|[[Subiaco Oval]] during a match against {{AFL Fre}} in the [[2008 NAB Cup]].]]\n\n==Finance and ownership==\nThe West Coast Eagles have been owned in full by the [[West Australian Football Commission]] (WAFC) since 1989.

It posited that there were some specific pathogenic bacteria among the biome which were solely responsible for disease, and in the absence of which the oral environment would be healthy. In his \u201cNonspecific plaque hypothesis\u201d, the hypothesis states that the severity of the disease depends upon the amount of plaque accumulation. Even though it is an old concept, most of the current periodontal treatment strategies still depend on it<ref>Superscript text</ref>https://actascientific.com/ASDS/pdf/ASDS-03-0688.pdf</sup>. It was later realised that disease occurred even in the absence of these bacteria, albeit to a lesser degree, which observation gave rise to the non-specific hypothesis.

During this time, it was believed that periodontal therapy involved complete plaque control and not just targeting specific bacteria. If plaque control was achieved, then it would limit the production of gingival irritants thereby decreasing inflammation and periodontal destruction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kimball | first1 = GD | year = 1952 | title = The relationship of materia alba and dental plaque to periodontal disease | url = | journal = Journal of Periodontology| volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 16\u2013169 | doi = 10.1902/jop.1952.23.3.164 }}</ref>\n\n==Ecological plaque hypothesis==\n\nThe ecological or keystone plaque hypothesis is that a shift in the ecology of the biome results in an imbalance and exorbitantly high numbers of certain keystone pathogens.\n\n===Caries===\n\n[[File:Ecological plaque hypothesis and the aetiology of dental caries.jpg|thumb|Ecological plaque hypothesis and the aetiology of dental caries]]\nThe ecological plaque hypothesis, a combination of the two previously mentioned hypotheses, suggests that there are certain species responsible for pathology, but are present in insufficient quantities to cause damage to a healthy individual.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=W.
