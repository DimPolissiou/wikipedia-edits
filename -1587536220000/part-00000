The workers saved the old but still usable joists they were removing and passed them on to the squatters.\"<ref name=\"online\"/>\n\nUnder the terms of the homesteading agreement made in 2002, the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board secured a loan through the National Co-op Bank to help pay for essential renovations (bringing the building up to city code regulations for legal occupancy), which the squatters performed themselves, as much as possible, to reduce costs.<ref name=\":3\" /> When construction work was complete, the residents assumed ownership of the building as a limited equity [[housing cooperative]].<ref name=\"ferguson\"/>\n\n==Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space==\nThe [[Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space]] (MoRUS) is a living archive of the [[Lower East Side]]'s squats and gardens, located in the ground-floor storefront of C Squat at 155 Avenue C. It runs neighborhood tours highlighting the efforts of local residents and organizations to clean up vacant lots and fix up abandoned buildings for community use, also promotes scholarship of grassroots urban space activism by researching and archiving efforts to create community spaces. The exhibitions feature materials that document these actions in order to educate people on the political implications of reclaimed space.\n\nEast Village community activists began planning the museum in May 2011 and opened it with public tours in October 2012.\n\nThe museum's storefront displays materials such as photographs, posters, zines, underground newspapers, comics, banners and buttons that show how local residents cleaned up vacant lots and buildings in the area and made them organizing spaces for the community. The museum offers three public walking tours that lead participants to the East Village\u2019s most legendary community gardens, squats and sites of social change and explain their complex and often controversial histories. Tour guides are generally longtime activists, squatters, gardeners, academics, and journalists who were directly involved in some aspect of the neighborhood that is relevant to the museum.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/nyregion/east-village-museum-shares-a-piece-of-activist-history.html?_r=1&ref=nyregion</ref><ref>http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/31421/</ref>\n\nShortly after its opening, [[The New York Times]] ran an online feature, proclaiming, \"MoRUS Squats on Avenue C\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/morus-squats-on-avenue-c/|title=\"MoRUS Squats on Avenue C\"|last=Rajitkul|first=Remika|date=December 28, 2012|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 17, 2016|via=}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 though the museum is not technically affiliated with C Squat (nor are they squatters there), but rather an independently operated space, founded under the auspices of [[Time's Up!]], a New York City-based nonprofit environmental organization.

It is thus a [[cognate]] of the words [[Slavonia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slavs|Slavia]]. The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.\n\nThe reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slov\u011bnin\u044a}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' (\"word\"), originally denoting \"people who speak (the same language),\" i.&nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}, meaning \"silent, mute people\" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044a}} \"[[muteness|mute]], mumbling\"). The word ''slovo'' (\"word\") and the related ''slava'' (\"glory, fame\") and ''slukh'' (\"hearing\") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*\u1e31lew-}} (\"be spoken of, glory\"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{grc-tr|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} \"fame\"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} (\"be called\"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.\n\nThe modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945\u20131955 |language=Slovenian, English |trans-title=A Town as an Administrative\u2013Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko dru\u0161tvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831002448/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/ |archive-date=31 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialisti\u010dna republika Slovenija}}).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialisti\u010dne republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232837/http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix \"Socialist\" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; clear:right;\"\n|+Official names\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1945\u20131946 || '''[[Slovene National Liberation Committee|Federal Slovenia]]''' || Part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia\n|-\n| 1946\u20131963 || '''People's Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1963\u20131990 || '''Socialist Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1990\u2013present || '''Republic of Slovenia''' || Independent country from 1991\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Slovenia}}\n\n=== Prehistory to Slavic settlement ===\n\n==== Prehistory ====\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Divje Babe flute|pierced cave bear bone]], possibly a [[flute]], from [[Divje Babe]]]]\nPresent-day Slovenia has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times.

They were mostly Christianized by [[Irish people|Irish]] missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the \"Apostle of Carantanians\". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].\n\n[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in the [[Slovene language]] until 1414.]]\n\nIn the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.\n\nAfter the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.\n\nBy the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spannheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.<ref name=\"culture.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia \u2013 Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]], the Hungarian clan [[Z\u00e1h (gens)|Z\u00e1h]] administering the territories connecting Slovenia with [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]] was exterminated in 1330 and the Slovenes permanently lost the connection with their [[Slovakia|Slovak]] kinsmen. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century.

The main territory of Slovenia, being the most industrialized and westernized compared to other less developed parts of Yugoslavia, became the main center of industrial production: Compared to Serbia, for example, Slovenian industrial production was four times greater; and it was 22 times greater than in [[North Macedonia]]. The interwar period brought further industrialization in Slovenia, with rapid economic growth in the 1920s, followed by a relatively successful economic adjustment to the [[1929 economic crisis]] and [[Great Depression]].\n\nFollowing a [[Carinthian Plebiscite|plebiscite]] in October 1920, the Slovene-speaking southern [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] was ceded to [[Austria]].

The most infamous ones were [[Rab concentration camp|Rab]] and [[Gonars concentration camp|Gonars]]. To counter the Communist-led insurgence, the Italians sponsored local anti-guerrilla units, formed mostly by the local conservative Catholic Slovene population that resented the revolutionary violence of the partisans. After the [[Italian armistice]] of September 1943, the Germans took over both the Province of Ljubljana and the Slovenian Littoral, incorporating them into what was known as the [[Operation Zone of Adriatic Coastal Region]]. They united the Slovene anti-Communist counter-insurgence into the [[Slovene Home Guard]] and appointed a puppet regime in the Province of Ljubljana. The anti-Nazi resistance however expanded, creating its own administrative structures as the basis for Slovene statehood within a new, federal and socialist Yugoslavia.<ref name=Tomasevich_2001>{{cite book|first=Jozo|last=Tomasevich|title=War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941\u20131945: Occupation and Collaboration|volume=2|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-8047-3615-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqUSGevFe5MC&printsec=frontcover|ref=Tomasevich_2001|pages=96\u201397}}</ref><ref name=\"Dennison I.

A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by [[Italy]] after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.\n\nAfter the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949\u201353, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].\n\nThe late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere, as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965\u201366, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.\n\nOpposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/> Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.\n\n=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===\nIn 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off.

During the first term of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s government, for the first time after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their [[loan-deposit ratio]]s veering out of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].\n\nAfter the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Jan\u0161a's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005\u20132008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Jan\u0161a attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that left and right parties attributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; reason behind was that each block tried to establish economic elite which will support political forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pavlov\u010di\u010d|first1=Idija|title=Jo\u017ee P.

The [[State's Attorney|State Prosecutor]] is an independent state authority responsible for prosecuting cases brought against those suspected of committing criminal offences.

The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''\u017eupan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''ob\u010dinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]].

It is thus a [[cognate]] of the words [[Slavonia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slavs|Slavia]]. The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.\n\nThe reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slov\u011bnin\u044a}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' (\"word\"), originally denoting \"people who speak (the same language),\" i.&nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}, meaning \"silent, mute people\" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044a}} \"[[muteness|mute]], mumbling\"). The word ''slovo'' (\"word\") and the related ''slava'' (\"glory, fame\") and ''slukh'' (\"hearing\") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*\u1e31lew-}} (\"be spoken of, glory\"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{grc-tr|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} \"fame\"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} (\"be called\"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.\n\nThe modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945\u20131955 |language=Slovenian, English |trans-title=A Town as an Administrative\u2013Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko dru\u0161tvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831002448/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/ |archive-date=31 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialisti\u010dna republika Slovenija}}).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialisti\u010dne republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232837/http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix \"Socialist\" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; clear:right;\"\n|+Official names\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1945\u20131946 || '''[[Slovene National Liberation Committee|Federal Slovenia]]''' || Part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia\n|-\n| 1946\u20131963 || '''People's Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1963\u20131990 || '''Socialist Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1990\u2013present || '''Republic of Slovenia''' || Independent country from 1991\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Slovenia}}\n\n=== Prehistory to Slavic settlement ===\n\n==== Prehistory ====\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Divje Babe flute|pierced cave bear bone]], possibly a [[flute]], from [[Divje Babe]]]]\nPresent-day Slovenia has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times.

They were mostly Christianized by [[Irish people|Irish]] missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the \"Apostle of Carantanians\". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].\n\n[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in the [[Slovene language]] until 1414.]]\n\nIn the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.\n\nAfter the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.\n\nBy the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spannheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.<ref name=\"culture.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia \u2013 Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]], the Hungarian clan [[Z\u00e1h (gens)|Z\u00e1h]] administering the territories connecting Slovenia with [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]] was exterminated in 1330 and the Slovenes permanently lost the connection with their [[Slovakia|Slovak]] kinsmen. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century. [[Patria del Friuli]] ruled present western Slovenia until [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] takeover in 1420.\n\n[[File:Boj s Turki-Valvasor.jpg|thumb|The Ottoman army battling the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Habsburgs]] in present-day Slovenia during the [[Great Turkish War]].]]\nAt the end of the Middle Ages, the [[Slovene Lands]] suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Turkish raids]].

The other locations in the United States where many Slovenians settled were areas with substantial industrial and mining activities: Pittsburgh, Chicago, Pueblo, Butte, northern Minnesota, and the Salt Lake Valley.

The idea of a [[United Slovenia]], first advanced during the [[revolutions of 1848]], became the common platform of most Slovenian parties and political movements in Austria-Hungary.

A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by [[Italy]] after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.\n\nAfter the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949\u201353, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].\n\nThe late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere, as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965\u201366, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.\n\nOpposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/> Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.\n\n=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===\nIn 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]], pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.\n\nIn September 1989, numerous [[constitutional amendment]]s were passed to introduce [[parliamentary democracy]] to Slovenia.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |title=Razvoj parlamentarizma: funkcije sodobnih parlamentov |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Development of Parliamentarism: The Functions of Modern Parliaments |first=Drago |last=Zajc |page=109 |publisher=Publishing House of the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana |year=2004 |isbn=961-235-170-8 |access-date=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072954/http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |title=Osamosvojitveni akti Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |publisher=Office for Legislation, Government of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117183414/http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> <!--The same year [[Rally of Truth|Action North]] united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia as the first defense action against attacks by [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s supporters, leading to Slovenian independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|title=Historical Circumstances in Which \"The Rally of Truth\" in Ljubljana Was Prevented|publisher=Journal of Criminal Justice and Security|accessdate=4 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213053210/http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|archivedate=13 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/osamosvojitev/prispevek/108/predvajaj/|title=\"Rally of truth\" (Miting resnice)|publisher= A documentary published by [[RTV Slovenija]]|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>{{request quotation|date=July 2012}}--> On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the \"Republic of Slovenia\".<ref name=\"twenty.si\">{{cite web|author=Innovatif and ORG.TEND |url=http://www.twenty.si/first-20-years/90/ |title=Year 1990 &#124; Slovenia 20 years |publisher=Twenty.si |date=14 May 1992 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uradni-list.si/dl/vip_akti/1990-02-0402.pdf |title=Odlok o razglasitvi ustavnih amandmajev k ustave<!-- sic! --> Socialisti\u010dne Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |journal=Uradni List Republike Slovenije |date=16 March 1990 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> In April 1990, the first democratic election in Slovenia took place, and the united opposition movement [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|DEMOS]] led by [[Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik]] emerged victorious.\n[[File:Teritorialci so z armbrustom zadeli tank v kri\u017ei\u0161\u010du pred MMP Ro\u017ena Dolina..jpg|thumb|left|Slovenian Territorial Defense Units counterattacking the Yugoslav National Army tank who entered Slovenia during the [[Ten-Day War]], 1991]]\nThe initial revolutionary events in Slovenia pre-dated the [[Revolutions of 1989]] in Eastern Europe by almost a year, but went largely unnoticed by international observers.

There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].\n\nAfter the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Jan\u0161a's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005\u20132008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Jan\u0161a attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that left and right parties attributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; reason behind was that each block tried to establish economic elite which will support political forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pavlov\u010di\u010d|first1=Idija|title=Jo\u017ee P.

The [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia|Constitutional Court]], composed of nine judges elected for nine-year terms, decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution; all laws and regulations must also conform with the general principles of international law and with ratified international agreements.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/>\n\n=== Administrative divisions and traditional regions ===\n{{Main|Statistical regions of Slovenia|Municipalities of Slovenia}}\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"width: auto;\"\n|+ Traditional regions of Slovenia\n|-\n||[[File:Borders of the Historical Habsburgian Lands in the Republic of Slovenia.png|center|275px]]\n|-\n| <center> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''1'''</span> [[Slovene Littoral]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''Carniola:''' <br /> '''2a'''</span> [[Upper Carniola|Upper]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2b'''</span> [[Inner Carniola|Inner]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2c'''</span> [[Lower Carniola|Lower]] <br/> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''3'''</span> [[Slovene Carinthia|Carinthia]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''4'''</span> [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''5'''</span> [[Prekmurje]]</center>\n|}\n\n==== Municipalities ====\nOfficially, Slovenia is subdivided into 212 [[municipalities]] (eleven of which have the status of urban municipalities). The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''\u017eupan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''ob\u010dinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]]. In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.si/zak/Zak_vel.nsf/0/660b7ab7cbd45736c125662d0037c142?OpenDocument |title=Sprejet zakon |publisher=.gov.si |date=13 July 2000 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration (''na\u010delnik ob\u010dinske uprave''), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\"/>\n\n[[File:Slovenia, administrative divisions - Nmbrs (statistical regions) - colored.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Statistical regions: 1.&nbsp;Gorizia, 2.&nbsp;Upper Carniola, 3.&nbsp;Carinthia, 4.&nbsp;Drava, 5.&nbsp;Mura, 6.&nbsp;Central Slovenia, 7.&nbsp;Central Sava, 8.&nbsp;Savinja, 9.&nbsp;Coastal\u2013Karst, 10.&nbsp;Inner Carniola\u2013Karst, 11.&nbsp;Southeast Slovenia, 12.&nbsp;Lower Sava]]\n\n==== Administrative districts ====\nThere is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia. The 62 administrative districts, officially called \"Administrative Units\" (''upravne enote''), are only subdivisions of the national government administration and are named after their respective bases of government offices.

A water recycling device was used in the lotus lake of the set, allowing ripples to be seen on the lake surface. A special ceiling was built for the ancestral hall.<ref name=zhuan /> \n\nFor the Qinghe Nie sect, the set was designed to be surrounded by high walls and the entrance isn't easily seen because it was often invaded by Qishan Wen sect. For Qishan Wen sect, designs from the [[Shang dynasty]] were used.

C. Christensen]] and starring Jasen Wade, Sarah Kent and Kimball Stinger. The film was based on the [[Cokeville Elementary School hostage crisis]] in 1986 <ref name=CokevilleMiracleMovie>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=30450706 |title='Cokeville Miracle' coming to the big screen |format= |work= |accessdate=2014-10-23}}</ref> and the book ''The Cokeville Miracle: When Angels Intervene'' by [[Hartt Wixom]] and Judene Wixom. The [[Christian film industry|faith-based film]] was released in select theaters across the United States in the summer of 2015, and was distributed by [[Deseret Book]] Company and affiliated retailers.\n\n==Plot==\nIn May 1986, cop Ron Hartley (Jasen Wade) is at a crime scene, during which two people were murdered. He is traumatized from the experience and begins to question the beliefs of his religion.\n\nIn [[Tucson, Arizona]], David Young (Nathan Stevens), former town marshal of [[Cokeville, Wyoming]], tests a homemade bomb on an old bus, which succeeds. He then expresses his triumph with his second wife, Doris (Kymberly Mellen). In Cokeville, Ron is playing with his two children; Cindy (Alexa Rae) and Jason (Kimball Stinger). When the family's nightly prayer comes, Ron refuses to say it, as he is questioning his faith due to all the horrible things he's seen. His wife, Claudia (Sarah Kent), is worried for him.\n\nOn a Sunday, Ron does not attend his church with his family. Meanwhile, David is travelling with Doris, buying groceries as materials. He has his two friends Gerald Deppe and Doyle Mendenhall (Channon Voyce and Paul Hunt) meet him in Cokeville. David and Doris demonstrate igniting gunpowder while it is in the air, making it seem as if the air is on fire. Deppe and Mendenhall take the plot as launching illegal fireworks. The next day, the five set out for [[Cokeville Elementary School]], where David reveals their real plan is to take the school hostage and blow it up with his bomb, which will then lead to David being the leader of a \"brave new world\". Deppe and Mendenhall refuse to cooperate, and David handcuffs them in the back of his van.\n\nRon, on the same day, travels to help his brother with some issues, while Cindy and Jason go to the school. During the past few days at the school, the fire alarms have been going off without any smoke or any other trigger, baffling the staff. David, Doris and Penny ([[Caitlin EJ Meyer]]), one of David's two daughters from his previous marriage, bring the bomb into the school, with Doris and Penny carrying firearms. Penny is reluctant to follow the plan. The three walk into the school undetected, and announce to their secretary, Christina Cook (Jillette Dayton), their plan. They take her hostage, and when David starts harshly yelling at a student, Penny confronts him. Instead of shooting her like he had earlier threatened, he gets his car keys and throws them at her, commanding her to leave, saying she is no daughter of his.\n\nAfter Penny leaves, David and Doris take three people (two staff, one student) into Room 4, where David takes control of a class being held in the room. Doris then manipulates the rest of the school to go into Room 4, telling them \"a surprise\" waits for them. Once all 136 students and 18 teachers are in the room, David establishes control by explaining his rules, then sitting next to the bomb; if he pulls the trigger, it will detonate. He shows off his firearms and explains he\u2019ll kill children with a .22 because they\u2019re innocent, while his .45 is reserved for teachers. \n\nAfter a few minutes, Max Excell (Alan Peterson), the school principal who had been away, walks in and discovers the situation. David tells him to call the local authorities and tell them he demands $2,000,000 for each child, and if he doesn't return in 15 minutes, he will begin shooting students one by one.\n\nPenny speeds to the local police station where she informs them of her father's plan, proving it by showing them Deppe and Mendenhall, still handcuffed. The police take the three for questioning, while they start informing the families. Ron begins to return to Cokeville, when he is informed of the hostage situation. He is still far out, but starts to rush towards Cokeville, as he is the nearest officer and every other one is out of town. In the school, gas from the bomb begins to leak and children are getting sick. One of the teachers convinces David to let them open the doors and windows. After the principal returns, David demands him to call the White House.\n\nDuring the next few hours, the teachers create a \"magic square\" of masking tape on the floor where only David is allowed to go. The square serves as a boundary between the bomb and the children. Around this time, David is getting more and more agitated especially when Jason Hartley taunts him. When Jason puts his foot inside the magic square, David loses control and yells at Jason, who doesn\u2019t flinch. Shortly after that, David leaves for the restroom, telling Doris to take his place at the bomb. While chatting with one of the teachers, Doris accidentally triggers the bomb by gesturing with her hand. It explodes and Doris is ignited in flames. The children are quickly evacuated as firefighters and paramedics are stationed right outside the doors and windows. David comes out of the bathroom to see Doris\u2019 body completely engulfed in flames; he shoots her to put her out of her misery. He also shoots a teacher, John Miller (Joshua Cooper), in the back as the man leaves the classroom to help children escape. \n\nDespite the fire from the blast, David shooting his gun, and his remaining ammo exploding in the heat of the fire, everyone but Doris still manages to evacuate safely. David returns to the bathroom where he kills himself, making him and Doris the only two to be killed during this event. Ron is informed of the bombing and he expresses that God isn't real. He arrives in town, rushing towards the school.\n\nA few days later, Jason and Cindy are recovering well from burns and other minor injuries. Jason, however, seems traumatized and Ron takes him to see a psychologist. After the doctor meets privately with Jason for a while, he simply tells Ron that, \"You and Jason need to sit down and have a nice, long talk.\" Ron and Claudia both talk to Jason, who then tells him \"there were other people in the room.\" He confides in them that he saw people dressed all in white \u2014 angels. Ron doubts this but Claudia believes him after Jason points out a picture of his great-grandmother, who had passed away years earlier, saying she was his angel in the classroom. Ron questions this so Claudia convinces him to gather evidence just as he would for any other investigation.\n\nHe visits multiple families who inform him of similar stories from their children. He visits the investigating certified bomb expert, Rich Haskell ([[Rick Macy]]), from Sherrif's office in Rock Springs, who tells him that three of the five wires in the bomb were mysteriously cut; not broken, but cut clean. Haskell also mentions that the open windows and doors windows provided ventilation for the explosion. He is baffled that the shrapnel David put in the explosive was thrown around the room but no one was injured by it. Ron later tells Claudia that he found out every one of the hostages prayed some time during the crisis, and that some ran back into the room to help others. Despite all this information, Ron is reluctant to believe it.\n\nOn Sunday, Jason refuses to attend church unless his dad does so as well. Motivated to attend for Jason, Ron tries to make it through the meetings. But after the main meeting, Ron's doubts start to control him again and he tells Claudia that he can't do it. She tells him that he needs to control it or he could lose her and their children. Ron then overhears some words the bishop, John Teichart (Shawn Stevens), is saying in a class. He says that hatred will not be the answer but prayer will. Ron then goes to the youth room where they are singing \"A Child's Prayer\".

C. Christensen]] and starring Jasen Wade, Sarah Kent and Kimball Stinger. The film was based on the [[Cokeville Elementary School hostage crisis]] in 1986 <ref name=CokevilleMiracleMovie>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=30450706 |title='Cokeville Miracle' coming to the big screen |format= |work= |accessdate=2014-10-23}}</ref> and the book ''The Cokeville Miracle: When Angels Intervene'' by [[Hartt Wixom]] and Judene Wixom. The [[Christian film industry|faith-based film]] was released in select theaters across the United States in the summer of 2015, and was distributed by [[Deseret Book]] Company and affiliated retailers.\n\n==Plot==\nIn May 1986, cop Ron Hartley (Jasen Wade) is at a crime scene, during which two people were murdered. He is traumatized from the experience and begins to question the beliefs of his religion.\n\nIn [[Tucson, Arizona]], David Young (Nathan Stevens), former town marshal of [[Cokeville, Wyoming]], tests a homemade bomb on an old bus, which succeeds. He then expresses his triumph with his second wife, Doris (Kymberly Mellen). In Cokeville, Ron is playing with his two children; Cindy (Alexa Rae) and Jason (Kimball Stinger). When the family's nightly prayer comes, Ron refuses to say it, as he is questioning his faith due to all the horrible things he's seen. His wife, Claudia (Sarah Kent), is worried for him.\n\nOn a Sunday, Ron does not attend his church with his family. Meanwhile, David is travelling with Doris, buying groceries as materials. He has his two friends Gerald Deppe and Doyle Mendenhall (Channon Voyce and Paul Hunt) meet him in Cokeville. David and Doris demonstrate igniting gunpowder while it is in the air, making it seem as if the air is on fire. Deppe and Mendenhall take the plot as launching illegal fireworks. The next day, the five set out for [[Cokeville Elementary School]], where David reveals their real plan is to take the school hostage and blow it up with his bomb, which will then lead to David being the leader of a \"brave new world\". Deppe and Mendenhall refuse to cooperate, and David handcuffs them in the back of his van.\n\nRon, on the same day, travels to help his brother with some issues, while Cindy and Jason go to the school. During the past few days at the school, the fire alarms have been going off without any smoke or any other trigger, baffling the staff. David, Doris and Penny ([[Caitlin EJ Meyer]]), one of David's two daughters from his previous marriage, bring the bomb into the school, with Doris and Penny carrying firearms. Penny is reluctant to follow the plan. The three walk into the school undetected, and announce to their secretary, Christina Cook (Jillette Dayton), their plan. They take her hostage, and when David starts harshly yelling at a student, Penny confronts him. Instead of shooting her like he had earlier threatened, he gets his car keys and throws them at her, commanding her to leave, saying she is no daughter of his.\n\nAfter Penny leaves, David and Doris take three people (two staff, one student) into Room 4, where David takes control of a class being held in the room. Doris then manipulates the rest of the school to go into Room 4, telling them \"a surprise\" waits for them. Once all 136 students and 18 teachers are in the room, David establishes control by explaining his rules, then sitting next to the bomb; if he pulls the trigger, it will detonate. He shows off his firearms and explains he\u2019ll kill children with a .22 because they\u2019re innocent, while his .45 is reserved for teachers. \n\nAfter a few minutes, Max Excell (Alan Peterson), the school principal who had been away, walks in and discovers the situation. David tells him to call the local authorities and tell them he demands $2,000,000 for each child, and if he doesn't return in 15 minutes, he will begin shooting students one by one.\n\nPenny speeds to the local police station where she informs them of her father's plan, proving it by showing them Deppe and Mendenhall, still handcuffed. The police take the three for questioning, while they start informing the families. Ron begins to return to Cokeville, when he is informed of the hostage situation. He is still far out, but starts to rush towards Cokeville, as he is the nearest officer and every other one is out of town. In the school, gas from the bomb begins to leak and children are getting sick. One of the teachers convinces David to let them open the doors and windows. After the principal returns, David demands him to call the White House.\n\nDuring the next few hours, the teachers create a \u201cmagic square\u201d of masking tape on the floor where only David is allowed to go. The square serves as a boundary between the bomb and the children. Around this time, David is getting more and more agitated especially when Jason Hartley taunts him. When Jason puts his foot inside the magic square, David loses control and yells at Jason, who doesn\u2019t flinch. Shortly after that, David leaves for the restroom, telling Doris to take his place at the bomb. While chatting with one of the teachers, Doris accidentally triggers the bomb by gesturing with her hand. It explodes and Doris is ignited in flames. The children are quickly evacuated as firefighters and paramedics are stationed right outside the doors and windows. David comes out of the bathroom to see Doris\u2019 body completely engulfed in flames; he shoots her to put her out of her misery. He also shoots a teacher, John Miller (Joshua Cooper), in the back as the man leaves the classroom to help children escape. \n\nDespite the fire from the blast, David shooting his gun, and his remaining ammo exploding in the heat of the fire, everyone but Doris still manages to evacuate safely. David returns to the bathroom where he kills himself, making him and Doris the only two to be killed during this event. Ron is informed of the bombing and he expresses that God isn't real. He arrives in town, rushing towards the school.\n\nA few days later, Jason and Cindy are recovering well from burns and other minor injuries. Jason, however, seems traumatized and Ron takes him to see a psychologist. After the doctor meets privately with Jason for a while, he simply tells Ron that, \u201cYou and Jason need to sit down and have a nice, long talk.\u201d Ron and Claudia both talk to Jason, who then tells him \"there were other people in the room.\u201d He confides in them that he saw people dressed all in white \u2014 angels. Ron doubts this but Claudia believes him after Jason points out a picture of his great-grandmother, who had passed away years earlier, saying she was his angel in the classroom. Ron questions this so Claudia convinces him to gather evidence just as he would for any other investigation.\n\nHe visits multiple families who inform him of similar stories from their children. He visits the investigating certified bomb expert, Rich Haskell ([[Rick Macy]]), from Sherrif's office in Rock Springs, who tells him that three  of the five wires in the bomb were mysteriously cut; not broken, but cut clean. Haskell also mentions that the open windows and doors windows provided ventilation for the explosion. He is baffled that the shrapnel David put in the explosive was thrown around the room but no one was injured by it. Ron later tells Claudia that he found out every one of the hostages prayed some time during the crisis, and that some ran back into the room to help others. Despite all this information, Ron is reluctant to believe it.\n\nOn Sunday, Jason refuses to attend church unless his dad does so as well. Motivated to attend for Jason, Ron tries to make it through the meetings. But after the main meeting, Ron's doubts start to control him again and he tells Claudia that he can't do it. She tells him that he needs to control it or he could lose her and their children. Ron then overhears some words the bishop, John Teichart (Shawn Stevens), is saying in a class. He says that hatred will not be the answer but prayer will. Ron then goes to the youth room where they are singing \"A Child's Prayer\". He notices that almost all of the kids in the room have some injuries of some kind, and he becomes humble and asks God for forgiveness for doubting Him. Cindy and Jason notice him and run to him, and he asks for their forgiveness as well. That night, at the family prayer, Ron is saying it for the first time in a long time.\n\n==Cast==\n* Jasen Wade as Ron Hartley, the film's protagonist, one of the town's deputies who is questioning his faith as his children are taken hostage.\n* Sarah Kent as Claudia Hartley, Ron's wife, who is worried about his skepticism.\n* Kimball Stinger as Jason Hartley, Ron and Claudia's son, who tells them about seeing an angel of a deceased ancestor.\n* Alexa Rae as Cindy Hartley, Ron and Claudia's daughter.\n* Nathan Stevens as David Young, the film's antagonist, the ex-town marshal who holds Cokeville Elementary hostage.\n* Kymberly Mellen as Doris Young, David's second wife, who accompanies him on his devious plan, but treats the children with much kindness.\n* [[Caitlin EJ Meyer]] as Penny Young, David's second daughter from his previous marriage, who refuses to participate in his evil plan.\n* Paul Hunt and Channon Voyce as Doyle Mendenhall and Gerald Deppe, two of David Young's friends who also refuse to participate in holding helpless, little children hostage.\n* Alan Peterson as Max Excell, the Principal of Cokeville Elementary.\n* Jillette Dayton as Christina \"Tina\" Cook, the Secretary of Cokeville Elementary.\n* Barta Heiner as Verlene Bennion, an elderly teacher at Cokeville Elementary who suffers from smoke inhalation after the bomb goes off.\n* Liz Christensen as Pat Bennion, Verlene's daughter-in-law and one of the teachers at Cokeville Elementary.\n* Joshua Cooper as John Miller, a music teacher who is shot by David Young after the bomb goes off.\n* [[Rick Macy]] as Rich Haskell, a certified bomb expert from the Sweetwater County Sherrif's department in Rock Springs.\n* Shawn Stevens as John Teichert, the bishop of Cokeville's local congregation.\n\n==Production==\nWritten and directed by T.

His story is contained in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the [[Book of Genesis]], chapters 5\u20139 and in the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Genesis flood narrative]] is among the best-known stories of the [[Bible]]. Noah is also portrayed as \"the first tiller of the soil\" and the inventor of wine.\n\nAccording to the Genesis account, Noah labored faithfully to build the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] at God's command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the [[Great Flood|Flood]]. Afterwards, God made a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with him and promised never again to destroy all the earth's creatures with a flood. The flood narrative is followed by the story of the [[Curse of Ham]].\n\nIn addition to the Book of Genesis, Noah is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the [[Books of Chronicles|First Book of Chronicles]], and the books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]], [[Sirach]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[2 Esdras]], [[4 Maccabees]]; in the [[New Testament]], he is mentioned in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[First Epistle of Peter|1st Peter]] and [[Second Epistle of Peter|2nd Peter]]. Noah was the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including the [[Quran]] ([[Surah]]s [[Sura 71|71]], [[Sura 7|7]], [[Sura 11|1]], and [[Sura 21|21]]).\n\n==Biblical account==\n[[File:Noah mosaic.JPG|thumb|right |12th-century Venetian [[mosaic]] depiction of Noah sending the dove]]\nThe primary account of Noah in the Bible is in the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\nNoah was the tenth of the Pre-Flood ([[Antediluvian]]) Patriarchs.

They were also told that all fowls, land animals, and fishes would be afraid of them. Furthermore, as well as green plants, every moving thing would be their food with the exception that the blood was not to be eaten. Man's life blood would be required from the beasts and from man. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man\" (9:6). A rainbow, called \"my bow\", was given as the sign of a covenant \"between me and you and every living creature that ''[is]'' with you, for perpetual generations\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|9:2\u201317|9}}), called the Noahic covenant or the [[rainbow covenant]].\n\nNoah died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:28\u201329|9}}</ref> the last of the extremely long-lived [[Antediluvian]] patriarchs.

He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay \"uncovered\" within his tent.

Harold Ellens|J. H. Ellens]] and W. G. Rollins address the narrative of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|9:18\u201327|HE}} that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham. Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\".<ref>Speiser, 1964, 62</ref><ref>T. A. Bergren. ''Biblical Figures Outside the Bible'', 2002, ({{ISBN|1563384116}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56338-411-0}}), p. 136</ref> A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.<ref>Ellens & Rollins, 2004, p.53</ref>\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as quoted in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}. From this interpretation, it can be deduced that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah.<ref>Levenson, 2004, 26</ref>\n\n===Table of nations===\n[[File:Noahsworld map.jpg|thumb|right|The dispersion of the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth (map from the 1854 ''Historical Textbook and Atlas of Biblical Geography'')]]\n{{See also|Generations of Noah}}\n{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10|HE}} sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the flood.

The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nu\u1e25'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25'']] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u062d}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).<ref name=Skolnik287 >{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287\u2013291}}</ref><ref name=\"Enc Islam\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with Noah just as he did with Abraham, [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. Noah prays to God, \"Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels from the land: / For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels.\"{{dead link|date=March 2017}}<ref>[https://http//www.quranbrowser.com/%20%22family 71:26\u201327 Rodwell 1876 version]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an [[Noah's Ark|Ark]], after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop [[Mount Judi]] ({{cite quran|11|44|s=ns}}).\n[[File:Noah's ark and the deluge.JPG|thumb|Noah's ark and the deluge from Zubdat-al Tawarikh]]\nAlso, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.<ref name=Skolnik287 /><ref name = \"Enc Islam\"/>\n\n{{cite quran|29|14|s=ns}} states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.\n{{quote|And, indeed, [in times long past] We sent forth Noah unto his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years bar fifty; and then the floods overwhelmed them while they were still lost in evildoing.}}\n\nAccording to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], which extended until the time of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] (Abraham, 950 years).

The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.<ref>Ellens & Rollins, 2004, p.53</ref>\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as quoted in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}.

They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed, as Abraham prayed for the wicked of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. In fact, Noah is never seen to speak; he simply listens to God and acts on his orders.

[[St Augustine of Hippo]] (354\u2013430), demonstrated in ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which corresponds to the [[body of Christ]]; the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the [[Anglican]] rite of baptism, which asks God, \"who of thy great mercy didst save Noah,\" to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised.<ref>Peters, DM., [https://books.google.com/?id=MXU3PTrFe6gC#v=snippet&q=nuanced%20%22temple%20period%22%20%22and%20early%20christianity%22&f=false ''Noah Traditions in the Dead Sea Scrolls: Conversations and Controversies of Antiquity''], Society of Biblical Lit, 2008, pp. 15\u201317.</ref>\n\nIn [[History of medieval Christianity|medieval Christianity]], Noah's three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known [[continent]]s, [[Japheth]]/Europe, [[Shem]]/Asia, and [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]/Africa, although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society \u2013 the priests (Shem), the warriors (Japheth), and the peasants (Ham).

The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nu\u1e25'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25'']] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u062d}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).<ref name=Skolnik287 >{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287\u2013291}}</ref><ref name=\"Enc Islam\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with Noah just as he did with Abraham, [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. Noah prays to God, \"Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels from the land: / For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels.\"{{dead link|date=March 2017}}<ref>[https://http//www.quranbrowser.com/%20%22family 71:26\u201327 Rodwell 1876 version]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an [[Noah's Ark|Ark]], after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop [[Mount Judi]] ({{cite quran|11|44|s=ns}}).\n[[File:Noah's ark and the deluge.JPG|thumb|Noah's ark and the deluge from Zubdat-al Tawarikh]]\nAlso, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.<ref name=Skolnik287 /><ref name = \"Enc Islam\"/>\n\n{{cite quran|29|14|s=ns}} states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.\n{{quote|And, indeed, [in times long past] We sent forth Noah unto his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years bar fifty; and then the floods overwhelmed them while they were still lost in evildoing.}}\n\nAccording to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], which extended until the time of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] (Abraham, 950 years).

He has also been called '''John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth'''.\n\n==Early life==\nStuart was born in Scotland in 1745 and began life there as John Ferdinand Smyth. He later wrote that he was the son of Wentworth Smyth, a Jacobite who had fought in the risings of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]]. According to Stuart\u2019s account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], and that his father was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Lady Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]]. Henrietta Maria had died in 1686, not long after Monmouth's execution, and her son Wentworth was adopted by a Colonel Smyth, an [[aide-de-camp]] of Monmouth, becoming his heir.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref> Consequently, Stuart\u2019s father grew up in France and returned to Scotland at the time of the 1715 Rising.<ref name=monthly>\u201cMemoirs of FERDINAND SMYTH STUART, M.D., Major in the British Army, and Grandson of the Duke of Monmouth\u201d, in ''The Monthly Magazine'', 1 February 1815, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6m76vtrNAJkC&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 36\u201341]</ref> Stuart stated in 1808 that he was named after his godfather, [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Prince  Ferdinand of Brunswick]].<ref>Ferdinand  Smyth Stuart, ''Destiny and Fortitude'' (1808) p. 42</ref> A genealogist, [[Anthony J.

With expansion cards, the Altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in [[BASIC]]. In contrast, the Apple I was a hobbyist machine. Wozniak's design included a $25 [[CPU]] ([[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]]) on a single circuit board with 256 [[byte]]s of [[Read-only memory|ROM]], 4K or 8K bytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and a 40-character by 24-row display controller.

The Apple II's intended successor, the [[Apple III]], released the same year, was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1984.
