This appreciation in value led large numbers of homeowners (subprime or not) to borrow against their homes as an apparent windfall.

As banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners, housing prices began to rise. Lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the real estate bubble. Loans of various types (e.g., mortgage, credit card, and auto) were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/economy/24text-bush.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&oref=slogin|title=President Bush's Address to Nation|work=The New York Times|date=September 24, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm|title=Bernanke-Four Questions About the Financial Crisis|publisher=Federalreserve.gov|date=April 14, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02krugman.html?pagewanted=print|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Revenge of the Glut|date=March 2, 2009|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased.

US government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized [[deregulation]] to encourage business, which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions. Thus, policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and [[hedge funds]], also known as the [[shadow banking system]]. Some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial (depository) banks in providing credit to the US economy, but they were not subject to the same regulations.<ref name=\"newyorkfed.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2008/tfg080609.html|title=Geithner-Speech Reducing Systemic Risk in a Dynamic Financial System|publisher=Newyorkfed.org|date=June 9, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThese institutions, as well as certain regulated banks, had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or MBS losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9c158a92-1a3c-11de-9f91-0000779fd2ac.html|title=Greenspan-We Need a Better Cushion Against Risk|work=Financial Times|date=March 26, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> These losses affected the ability of financial institutions to lend, slowing economic activity.

In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated. The worst loans were originated in 2004\u20132007, the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs.\n\n[[File:U.S. Home Ownership and Subprime Origination Share.png|thumb|upright=1.6|US subprime lending expanded dramatically 2004\u20132006]]\n\nAs well as easy credit conditions, there is evidence that competitive pressures contributed to an increase in the amount of subprime lending during the years preceding the crisis.

They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place.<ref>Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch?

Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The [[balance of payments]] [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the US) running a [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the US to finance its imports.\n\nAll of this created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China) or because of high oil prices. Ben Bernanke has referred to this as a \"[[saving glut]]\".<ref name=Bernanke>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070911a.htm|title=Chairman Ben S.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\nIn April 2009, US Federal Reserve vice-chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes:\n\n<blockquote>Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn't take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Financial innovation and complexity===\n[[File:CDO - FCIC and IMF Diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|IMF Diagram of CDO and RMBS]]\nThe term [[financial innovation]] refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]; the bundling of subprime mortgages into [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) or [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of [[securitization]]; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS). The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}\n\nCDO issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by Q1 2007, then declined back under $20 billion by Q1 2008. Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf|title=2010 CDO Thesis|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called [[synthetic CDO]] enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found.

It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding). With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks). Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/resource/staff-data-projects/story-of-a-security|title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission \u2013 story of a security|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Wolf]] further wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks, stating: \"... an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade\u2014the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself\u2014was to find a way round regulation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/095722f6-6028-11de-a09b-00144feabdc0.html|title=FT Martin Wolf \u2013 Reform of Regulation and Incentives|work=Financial Times|date=June 23, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Incorrect pricing of risk===\n[[File:AIG Protester on Pine Street.jpg|thumb|A protester on [[Wall Street]] in the wake of the [[AIG bonus payments controversy]] is interviewed by news media.]]\n\nMortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years.

Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis, enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have, and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward, readily understandable format.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system.<ref name=\"Declaration of G20\" /> For example, the pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. Banks estimated that $450 billion of CDO were sold between \"late 2005 to the middle of 2007\"; among the $102 billion of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for \"high quality\" CDOs was approximately 32&nbsp;cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for [[mezzanine capital|mezzanine]] CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar.<ref name=\"TPMBLOG1\">{{cite web|date=March 2, 2009|url=http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|title=paulw's Blog &#124; Talking Points Memo &#124; The power of belief|publisher=Tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406005046/http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|archivedate=April 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAnother example relates to [[AIG]], which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps. The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted. However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008. US taxpayers provided over $180&nbsp;billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&refer=home|title=Bloomberg-Credit Swap Disclosure Obscures True Financial Risk|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=November 6, 2008|accessdate=February 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F8QZzuT?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&refer=home|archivedate=June 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Nanette|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2009/db20090316_859460.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story|title=Business Week-Who's Who on AIG List of Counterparties|work=BusinessWeek|date=March 17, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis.

Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client [[assets under management]]. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a \"plausible deniability\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \"vintages\" of subprime loans was so low.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Calomiris|first=Charles|title=The Subprime Turmoil: What's Old, What's New, and What's Next|journal=Journal of Structured Finance|volume=15|issue=1|pages=6\u201352|date=Spring 2009|url=http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|doi=10.3905/JSF.2009.15.1.006|accessdate=August 19, 2010|citeseerx=10.1.1.628.2224|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125175710/http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|archive-date=November 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDespite the dominance of the above formula, there are documented attempts of the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the formula limitations, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lipton, A., and A.

These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of [[asset liability mismatch|maturity mismatch]], meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities:\n\n{{quote|In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2&nbsp;trillion. Assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to $2.5&nbsp;trillion. Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8&nbsp;trillion. The combined balance sheets of the five largest investment banks totaled $4&nbsp;trillion. In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over $6&nbsp;trillion, and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10&nbsp;trillion.

These Marxist economists do not point to low wages or underconsumption as the cause of the crisis, but instead point to capitalism's long-term tendency of the [[rate of profit]] to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. From this point of view, the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets, where there was potential for greater return on investment. The speculative frenzy of the late 90s and 2000s was, in this view, a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital, expressed through the fall in the rate of profit. According to Michael Roberts, the fall in the rate of profit \"eventually triggered the credit crunch of 2007 when credit could no longer support profits\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Michael|url=https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/carchedi-foster-and-the-causes-of-crisis/|title=Carchedi, Foster, and the causes of crisis|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, [[John C.

This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.\n\nIndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the [[California]] and [[Florida]] markets\u2014states, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] was most pronounced\u2014and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.\n\nIndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-[[Adjustable-rate mortgage|adjustable-rate-mortgages]] (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the [[secondary mortgage market]].  IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.<ref name=\"ustreas.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf|title=Audit Report - SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS: Material Loss Review of IndyMac Bank, FSB|accessdate=March 18, 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419101451/http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf|archivedate=April 19, 2009}} Audit Report Office of Inspector General</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09001.html|title=FDIC: Press Releases - PR-1-2009 1/2/2009|website=fdic.gov|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201626/http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMay 12, 2008, in a small note in the \"Capital\" section of its what would become its last [[10-Q]] released before receivership, IndyMac revealed\u2014but did not admit\u2014that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency.\n\nIndyMac reported that during April 2008, [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the ratings on a significant number of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds\u2014including $160 million issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008.

Tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today. Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the Great Depression.

They will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record. On the other hand, a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk. In the case of businesses, their creditworthiness depends on their future profits. Profit prospects look much worse in November 2008 than they did in November 2007...

With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments.

In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated.

This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast.

By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted, and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards.<ref name=\"This American Life\" />\n\nThe collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending, extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees. This essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority.

Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The [[balance of payments]] [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the US) running a [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the US to finance its imports.\n\nAll of this created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China) or because of high oil prices.

The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Financial innovation and complexity===\n[[File:CDO - FCIC and IMF Diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|IMF Diagram of CDO and RMBS]]\nThe term [[financial innovation]] refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]; the bundling of subprime mortgages into [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) or [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of [[securitization]]; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS). The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}\n\nCDO issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by Q1 2007, then declined back under $20 billion by Q1 2008. Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf|title=2010 CDO Thesis|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called [[synthetic CDO]] enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found.

It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding). With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks). Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/resource/staff-data-projects/story-of-a-security|title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission \u2013 story of a security|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Wolf]] further wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks, stating: \"... an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade\u2014the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself\u2014was to find a way round regulation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/095722f6-6028-11de-a09b-00144feabdc0.html|title=FT Martin Wolf \u2013 Reform of Regulation and Incentives|work=Financial Times|date=June 23, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Incorrect pricing of risk===\n[[File:AIG Protester on Pine Street.jpg|thumb|A protester on [[Wall Street]] in the wake of the [[AIG bonus payments controversy]] is interviewed by news media.]]\n\nMortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years.

Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis, enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have, and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward, readily understandable format.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system.<ref name=\"Declaration of G20\" /> For example, the pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. Banks estimated that $450 billion of CDO were sold between \"late 2005 to the middle of 2007\"; among the $102 billion of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for \"high quality\" CDOs was approximately 32&nbsp;cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for [[mezzanine capital|mezzanine]] CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar.<ref name=\"TPMBLOG1\">{{cite web|date=March 2, 2009|url=http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|title=paulw's Blog &#124; Talking Points Memo &#124; The power of belief|publisher=Tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406005046/http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|archivedate=April 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAnother example relates to [[AIG]], which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps.

However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008. US taxpayers provided over $180&nbsp;billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&refer=home|title=Bloomberg-Credit Swap Disclosure Obscures True Financial Risk|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=November 6, 2008|accessdate=February 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F8QZzuT?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&refer=home|archivedate=June 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Nanette|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2009/db20090316_859460.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story|title=Business Week-Who's Who on AIG List of Counterparties|work=BusinessWeek|date=March 17, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis.

Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client [[assets under management]]. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a \"plausible deniability\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \"vintages\" of subprime loans was so low.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Calomiris|first=Charles|title=The Subprime Turmoil: What's Old, What's New, and What's Next|journal=Journal of Structured Finance|volume=15|issue=1|pages=6\u201352|date=Spring 2009|url=http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|doi=10.3905/JSF.2009.15.1.006|accessdate=August 19, 2010|citeseerx=10.1.1.628.2224|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125175710/http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|archive-date=November 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDespite the dominance of the above formula, there are documented attempts of the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the formula limitations, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lipton, A., and A.

These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of [[asset liability mismatch|maturity mismatch]], meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices.

These Marxist economists do not point to low wages or underconsumption as the cause of the crisis, but instead point to capitalism's long-term tendency of the [[rate of profit]] to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. From this point of view, the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets, where there was potential for greater return on investment. The speculative frenzy of the late 90s and 2000s was, in this view, a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital, expressed through the fall in the rate of profit. According to Michael Roberts, the fall in the rate of profit \"eventually triggered the credit crunch of 2007 when credit could no longer support profits\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Michael|url=https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/carchedi-foster-and-the-causes-of-crisis/|title=Carchedi, Foster, and the causes of crisis|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, [[John C.

During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.\n\nIndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the [[California]] and [[Florida]] markets\u2014states, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] was most pronounced\u2014and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.\n\nIndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-[[Adjustable-rate mortgage|adjustable-rate-mortgages]] (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the [[secondary mortgage market]].  IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.<ref name=\"ustreas.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf|title=Audit Report - SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS: Material Loss Review of IndyMac Bank, FSB|accessdate=March 18, 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419101451/http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf|archivedate=April 19, 2009}} Audit Report Office of Inspector General</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09001.html|title=FDIC: Press Releases - PR-1-2009 1/2/2009|website=fdic.gov|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201626/http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMay 12, 2008, in a small note in the \"Capital\" section of its what would become its last [[10-Q]] released before receivership, IndyMac revealed\u2014but did not admit\u2014that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency.\n\nIndyMac reported that during April 2008, [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the ratings on a significant number of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds\u2014including $160 million issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio.

With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks.

If the Prime Minister or a senior party leader of India was killed in the attack, India would have been forced to retaliate militarily.{{sfnp|Riedel, Deadly Embrace|2012|p=69}} In the event, India called the terror attack an \"attack on democracy\" and began [[2001 India Pakistan standoff|large-scale troop mobilisation]] at the India-Pakistan border, launching the largest war games in fifteen years. Pakistan retaliated by launching its own war games, moving troops from the Afghan border to the Indian border. The United States, annoyed with the dilution of the War on Terror as well as the threat of an Indo-Pakistani war, delivered an ultimatum to Musharraf, asking him to make \"a clear statement to the world that he intends to crack down on terror\". Pushed to a corner, Musharraf announced on 12 January 2002 that no organisation would be allowed to indulge in terrorism in the name of Kashmir. He declared a ban on five extremist groups including the JeM. Hundreds of militants were rounded up, states Ahmed Rashid, giving rise to severe hostility and derision from them. However, by March 2002, all the arrested militants were freed and curbs on them were quietly lifted.{{sfnp|Rashid, Descent into Chaos|2012|loc=Chapter 6}} Financial and intelligence inputs to JeM were resumed. Masood Azhar was released under a court order.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=927}}\n\n===Bans, revolts and split=== \nEarlier in 2001, when the group anticipated that the US State Department would declare it a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation, it renamed itself ''Tehrik-ul-Furqan'' and transferred its assets to low-profile supporters. JeM was declared a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation by the United Nations in October 2001 and by the US in December 2001.{{sfnp|Gunaratna & Kam, Handbook of Terrorism|2016|p=230}}\n\nIn response to the January 2002 ban by Pakistan, JeM changed its name to '''Khuddam ul-Islam'''. Khuddam was also banned in 2003, after which it re-branded itself as a charity called ''Al-Rehmat Trust''.<ref name=\"congressional\"/><ref name=rebirth/>\n\nBy this time, the JeM had split into two groups, due to conflicts among the members. Three JeM commanders, Abdul Jabbar, Maulana Umar Farooq and Abdullah Shah Mazhar, left the group and formed ''Jamaat ul-Furqan''. The remaining group that stayed with Masood Azhar used the name ''Khuddam ul-Islam''.{{sfnp|Gunaratna & Kam, Handbook of Terrorism|2016|p=230}}\n\nThe rank and file of the JeM were angered by Musharraf's U-turn in joining the War on Terror. By staying loyal to the Pakistani state, Masood Azhar lost majority support in the JeM Supreme Council, who demanded his resignation. Particularly influential among the rebels was Maulana Abdul Jabbar, whose faction led a ''jihad'' against what they called the \"slave\" government of Pakistan and the US influence upon it. They were supported by Al Qaeda, and joined by members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and Harkatul Mujahideen.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=927}}\n\nFrom March to September 2002, the rebels carried out suicide missions on Pakistani officials in cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Murree, Taxila and Bahawalpur. After the fall of the Taliban government, the JeM activists returning from Afghanistan attacked Christian temples, Shia mosques and diplomatic missions inside Pakistan. The ISI demanded Masood Azhar to rein in the rank-and-file. However he had lost control over them. He maintained that they were already expelled from the organisation and the state should arrest them. In fact, most of the factions remained within the JeM and competed with the parent organisation for authority and resources. Some rebellious factions gathered around Abdul Jabbar who launched ''Jamaat-ul-Furqan'' in late 2002. The rebel factions were supported by \"rogue\" members of the ISI.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|pp=927-928}}\n\nIn November 2003, the Musharraf government banned the renamed ''Khuddam ul-Islam'' as well as ''Jamaat-ul-Furqan''. Then the rebels carried out two assassination attempts on President Musharraf himself, on 14 December and 25 December 2003. There was evidence of Pakistan military members providing logistical support for the attempts. The explosives used in the bombings were traced to an Al Qaeda camp in South Waziristan. Masood Azhar too had publicly called for the assassination of Musharraf.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|pp=928}}\n\nEventually, the government cracked down on the rogue elements in the military and intelligence establishments. More than a hundred members were apprehended and dismissed, with some members being sentenced to death. However, the majority of the militant infrastructure was left intact. Azhar's group, which had fallen into relative obscurity by 2004, was allowed to rebuild itself after the problematic portions of the leadership were purged.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=929}} The rebellious factions eventually realigned themselves with [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]] (Pakistani Taliban) in 2007.<ref name=thedead/>\n\n===Revival===\nMasood Azhar stayed loyal to the Pakistani state after 2004.

If the Prime Minister or a senior party leader of India was killed in the attack, India would have been forced to retaliate militarily.{{sfnp|Riedel, Deadly Embrace|2012|p=69}} In the event, India called the terror attack an \"attack on democracy\" and began [[2001 India Pakistan standoff|large-scale troop mobilisation]] at the India-Pakistan border, launching the largest war games in fifteen years. Pakistan retaliated by launching its own war games, moving troops from the Afghan border to the Indian border. The United States, annoyed with the dilution of the War on Terror as well as the threat of an Indo-Pakistani war, delivered an ultimatum to Musharraf, asking him to make \"a clear statement to the world that he intends to crack down on terror\". Pushed to a corner, Musharraf announced on 12 January 2002 that no organisation would be allowed to indulge in terrorism in the name of Kashmir. He declared a ban on five extremist groups including the JeM. Hundreds of militants were rounded up, states Ahmed Rashid, giving rise to severe hostility and derision from them. However, by March 2002, all the arrested militants were freed and curbs on them were quietly lifted.{{sfnp|Rashid, Descent into Chaos|2012|loc=Chapter 6}} Financial and intelligence inputs to JeM were resumed. Masood Azhar was released under a court order.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=927}}\n\n===Bans, revolts and split=== \nEarlier in 2001, when the group anticipated that the US State Department would declare it a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation, it renamed itself ''Tehrik-ul-Furqan'' and transferred its assets to low-profile supporters. JeM was declared a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation by the United Nations in October 2001 and by the US in December 2001.{{sfnp|Gunaratna & Kam, Handbook of Terrorism|2016|p=230}}\n\nIn response to the January 2002 ban by Pakistan, JeM changed its name to '''Khuddam ul-Islam'''. Khuddam was also banned in 2003, after which it re-branded itself as a charity called ''Al-Rehmat Trust''.<ref name=\"congressional\"/><ref name=rebirth/>\n\nBy this time, the JeM had split into two groups, due to conflicts among the members. Three JeM commanders, Abdul Jabbar, Maulana Umar Farooq and Abdullah Shah Mazhar, left the group and formed ''Jamaat ul-Furqan''. The remaining group that stayed with Masood Azhar used the name ''Khuddam ul-Islam''.{{sfnp|Gunaratna & Kam, Handbook of Terrorism|2016|p=230}}\n\nThe rank and file of the JeM were angered by Musharraf's U-turn in joining the War on Terror. By staying loyal to the Pakistani state, Masood Azhar lost majority support in the JeM Supreme Council, who demanded his resignation. Particularly influential among the rebels was Maulana Abdul Jabbar, whose faction led a ''jihad'' against what they called the \"slave\" government of Pakistan and the US influence upon it. They were supported by Al Qaeda, and joined by members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and Harkatul Mujahideen.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|p=927}}\n\nFrom March to September 2002, the rebels carried out suicide missions on Pakistani officials in cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Murree, Taxila and Bahawalpur. After the fall of the Taliban government, the JeM activists returning from Afghanistan attacked Christian temples, Shia mosques and diplomatic missions inside Pakistan. The ISI demanded Masood Azhar to rein in the rank-and-file. However he had lost control over them. He maintained that they were already expelled from the organisation and the state should arrest them. In fact, most of the factions remained within the JeM and competed with the parent organisation for authority and resources. Some rebellious factions gathered around Abdul Jabbar who launched ''Jamaat-ul-Furqan'' in late 2002. The rebel factions were supported by \"rogue\" members of the ISI.{{sfnp|Popovic, The Perils of Weak Organization|2015|pp=927-928}}\n\nIn November 2003, the Musharraf government banned the renamed ''Khuddam ul-Islam'' as well as ''Jamaat-ul-Furqan''. Then the rebels carried out two assassination attempts on President Musharraf himself, on 14 December and 25 December 2003. There was evidence of Pakistan military members providing logistical support for the attempts. The explosives used in the bombings were traced to an Al Qaeda camp in South Waziristan.
