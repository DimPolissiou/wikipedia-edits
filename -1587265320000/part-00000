Its configuration is unique for this type of aircraft, with four [[podded engines]] underneath a [[low wing]]. It is the only airplane built by McDonnell to be marketed to civil buyers prior to the company's merger with [[Douglas Aircraft]] to form [[McDonnell Douglas]]. The jet could be outfitted for 10 passengers in a luxury executive configuration and could carry as many as 29.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Model 119 was designed in 1957 for the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s UCX (Utility-Cargo Experimental) contract announced in August 1956, competing with the [[Lockheed JetStar]]; the Air Force simultaneously announced the UTX (Utility-Trainer Experimental) competition, but McDonnell chose not to enter this contest, which was won by the smaller two-engined [[North American Sabreliner]]. McDonnell entered the UCX competition with an eye on commercial sales; the company had never produced a civil aircraft.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Off-The-Shelf Jets |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=May 1959 |pages=26\u201327, 79 }}</ref>\n\nDesigned for a {{convert|2200|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} range at {{convert|550|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} [[airspeed]] against a {{convert|70|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} headwind, the 119 had a [[swept wing|wing sweep]] of 35 degrees and a [[vertical stabilizer]] sweep of 45 degrees.

Following this setback, McDonnell began to market the type commercially, renaming it the 220 to commemorate McDonnell's second 20 years of business, and showing it in a 10-place luxury configuration and a more basic configuration with 29 passenger seats. McDonnell drew up plans to equip production models with more modern [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] or [[General Electric CF700]] engines, and the 220 was awarded a [[Federal Aviation Administration]] [[type certificate]] on 17 October 1960.{{sfn|Francillon|1990|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nThe company negotiated a provisional deal with [[Pan American World Airways]] to lease 170 of the jets, but no other commercial or military orders materialized, and McDonnell was ultimately unable to offer the aircraft to Pan Am at an attractive price; consequently, the airline rejected the aircraft in favor of the [[Dassault Falcon 20|Dassault-Breguet Myst\u00e8re 20]], and no further production ensued.

The station's original slogan ''The Quality Station'' was taken seriously by management, who tried to produce programs which they often perceived as being superior to similar programs being produced by rival stations.\n\n3XY was the last commercial radio station to come on air in Melbourne until [[Classic Rock Radio|3MP]] began broadcasting in 1976, 41 years later.  By the time 3XY began broadcasting in 1935, most listeners had established their broadcasting patterns and they often continued to listen to 3XY's rivals, which is usually seen as the reason why 3XY was very low in the ratings for some decades.<ref name=\"auto2\">Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Annual Reports.

In Melbourne, since 1931, [[3AK]] had been broadcasting almost exclusively in the early-morning hours when other stations were off the air. However, on 1 February 1954, 3AK began broadcasting exclusively during hours of daylight, and concurrently [[KIIS 101.1|3DB]], [[RSN Racing & Sport|3UZ]] and 3XY were all given 24-hour licences, but both 3DB and 3UZ had ceased all-night broadcasting within six months.

When BAY-FM commenced broadcasting in December 1989, 3XY briefly simulcast the BAY-FM overnight programs, retaining its [[rock music]] format during the day. However, once new studios in [[Corio Bay]] were completed, Bay FM and 3XY began full-time simulcasting, 3XY breaking only for coverage of [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) games, which they were contracted to cover. After a period of 12 months, the then-[[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] demanded that the two stations begin separate programming. While the two stations remained in their Corio studios, Bay FM relaunched with an [[easy listening]] format, with 3XY retaining its soft rock format. In 1991, 3XY was sold to [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA Limited]], owners of [[2CH]] Sydney and other stations, who almost immediately shut the station down and re-opened it seven months later as 3EE.\n\n3XY's transmitter was turned off at 1.00 pm on 23 September 1991. The final on-air program as 3XY was a one-hour pre-recorded special, commissioned by AWA and produced and presented by music historian [[Glenn A. Baker]]. It was a tribute showcasing the music of 1976 when 3XY was number one in the radio ratings. Roxanne Bennett was the last 'live' announcer on 3XY, finishing her shift at 12 noon that day with [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]]'s song ''[[I'll Be Gone (Spectrum song)|I'll Be Gone]]'' the final song played before the one hour pre-recorded special was aired. The last song to be ever aired on 3XY, was [[AC/DC]]'s ''[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]'', at the end of the pre-recorded special.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWvcdSv1-o4|title=3XY's FINAL MOMENTS - AUDIO|first=|last=RIEGS-TV|date=9 June 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nAWA formally applied for a change of callsign from 3XY to '''3EE''' and a change of frequency from 1422&nbsp;kHz to 693&nbsp;kHz. Both requests were granted by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]. Although it was a relaunch of the 3XY licence that had existed since 1935 and not the issuing of a new licence, AWA chose to promote the forthcoming 3EE as a \"completely new\" station.\n\n(A new licence for the 1422&nbsp;kHz frequency was purchased at auction in 1994 by the Greek Media Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/3XY-Greek-Radio-177176725666138/|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Initially the licence was for a specified period of three years, and was then to be subject to a five yearly auction cycle. This rule was removed, and the station was effectively permitted to continue on a permanent basis. The new station<ref>https://radioau.net/3xy-hellas/</ref> adopted the 3XY call-sign. It is a [[narrowcast]] [[Greek language]] commercial station, with no connection to the station of 1935\u201391.)\n\n===1992-1993: 3EE===\nThe \"new\" station 3EE began official transmission at 7.00am Friday 2 July 1992. Promoted as ''The Breeze'', the station had a mix of easy listening music, personality talk and Saturday AFL football. Some programs garnered a loyal following but overall the station failed to gain a commercially viable audience in its target demographic of people aged 40+. AWA had a three-year strategy to grow the 3EE audience, but in 1993 the company decided to exit the commercial broadcasting sector and concentrate on its core business of electronics design and manufacture. AWA sold 3EE to Wesgo Communications, owner of another Melbourne station, [[3MP]], based in [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], an outer south-eastern suburb. A few months later in 1994, AWA sold 3EE's sister station in Sydney [[2CH]], bringing to an end AWA's 70 years in radio broadcasting.\n\n===1993-2017: Magic 693/1278===\n3MP and 3EE [[simulcast]] their programs until the ABA ordered that they cease the practice and recommence two separate formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=3EE&pb=sag&pb=age&dt=enterRange&dr=1month&sd=01/01/1993&ed=30/06/1994&so=date&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=adv&clsPage=1&docID=news931126_0181_2953|title=Fairfax Syndication Photo Print Sales and Content Licensing|website=newsstore.fairfax.com.au}}</ref> As from December 1993, 3EE used the marketing name of ''Magic 693'', whilst retaining its official call-sign 3EE. It had a 1940s, 1950s and 1960s music format, while 3MP maintained its more mainstream [[easy listening]] format on 1377.\n\nMedia operator [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]], which also owned Melbourne radio stations [[3AK]] and [[3AW]], bought the 3MP and 3EE licences, and in accordance with media ownership laws which restrict any organisation from owning more than two radio stations in one region, they chose to keep 3AW and 3EE (''Magic 693''), while selling off the lower rating 3AK and 3MP licences.\n\nFrom 1 May 2006, Magic 693 became Magic 1278 after switching frequencies with 3AW.\n\nOn 13 April 2015, the station's entire on air line-up, and most of the programming and production team, was made redundant, as the result of the merger of [[Fairfax Media]]'s radio assets and the [[Macquarie Radio Network]]. Immediately, a new music format was introduced that focused on the classic hits of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Magic gone from Magic!

The station's original slogan ''The Quality Station'' was taken seriously by management, who tried to produce programs which they often perceived as being superior to similar programs being produced by rival stations.\n\n3XY was the last commercial radio station to come on air in Melbourne until [[Classic Rock Radio|3MP]] began broadcasting in 1976, 41 years later.  By the time 3XY began broadcasting in 1935, most listeners had established their broadcasting patterns and they often continued to listen to 3XY's rivals, which is usually seen as the reason why 3XY was very low in the ratings for some decades.<ref name=\"auto2\">Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Annual Reports.

In Melbourne, since 1931, [[3AK]] had been broadcasting almost exclusively in the early-morning hours when other stations were off the air. However, on 1 February 1954, 3AK began broadcasting exclusively during hours of daylight, and concurrently [[KIIS 101.1|3DB]], [[RSN Racing & Sport|3UZ]] and 3XY were all given 24-hour licences, but both 3DB and 3UZ had ceased all-night broadcasting within six months.

When BAY-FM commenced broadcasting in December 1989, 3XY briefly simulcast the BAY-FM overnight programs, retaining its [[rock music]] format during the day. However, once new studios in [[Corio Bay]] were completed, Bay FM and 3XY began full-time simulcasting, 3XY breaking only for coverage of [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) games, which they were contracted to cover. After a period of 12 months, the then-[[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] demanded that the two stations begin separate programming. While the two stations remained in their Corio studios, Bay FM relaunched with an [[easy listening]] format, with 3XY retaining its soft rock format. In 1991, 3XY was sold to [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA Limited]], owners of [[2CH]] Sydney and other stations, who almost immediately shut the station down and re-opened it seven months later as 3EE.\n\n3XY's transmitter was turned off at 1.00 pm on 23 September 1991. The final on-air program as 3XY was a one-hour pre-recorded special, commissioned by AWA and produced and presented by music historian [[Glenn A. Baker]]. It was a tribute showcasing the music of 1976 when 3XY was number one in the radio ratings. Roxanne Bennett was the last 'live' announcer on 3XY, finishing her shift at 12 noon that day with [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]]'s song ''[[I'll Be Gone (Spectrum song)|I'll Be Gone]]'' the final song played before the one hour pre-recorded special was aired. The last song to be ever aired on 3XY, was [[AC/DC]]'s ''[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]'', at the end of the pre-recorded special.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWvcdSv1-o4|title=3XY's FINAL MOMENTS - AUDIO|first=|last=RIEGS-TV|date=9 June 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nAWA formally applied for a change of callsign from 3XY to '''3EE''' and a change of frequency from 1422&nbsp;kHz to 693&nbsp;kHz. Both requests were granted by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]. Although it was a relaunch of the 3XY licence that had existed since 1935 and not the issuing of a new licence, AWA chose to promote the forthcoming 3EE as a \"completely new\" station.\n\n(A new licence for the 1422&nbsp;kHz frequency was purchased at auction in 1994 by the Greek Media Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/3XY-Greek-Radio-177176725666138/|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Initially the licence was for a specified period of three years, and was then to be subject to a five yearly auction cycle. This rule was removed, and the station was effectively permitted to continue on a permanent basis. The new station<ref>https://radioau.net/3xy-hellas/</ref> adopted the 3XY call-sign. It is a [[narrowcast]] [[Greek language]] commercial station, with no connection to the station of 1935\u201391.)\n\n===1992-1993: 3EE===\nThe \"new\" station 3EE began official transmission at 7.00am Friday 2 July 1992. Promoted as ''The Breeze'', the station had a mix of easy listening music, personality talk and Saturday AFL football. Some programs garnered a loyal following but overall the station failed to gain a commercially viable audience in its target demographic of people aged 40+. AWA had a three-year strategy to grow the 3EE audience, but in 1993 the company decided to exit the commercial broadcasting sector and concentrate on its core business of electronics design and manufacture. AWA sold 3EE to Wesgo Communications, owner of another Melbourne station, [[3MP]], based in [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], an outer south-eastern suburb.

'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources. '''[[Economic impact]]s''' are usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Cultural education may also be improved, which can be overlooked.<ref name=\"Rollins et al 2016\">Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) \"Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas\". In P.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, [[baboons]] and [[hyenas]] have learnt to track tourist [[safari]] vehicles to lead them to [[cheetah]] kills, which they then steal.<ref>Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., & Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). \"Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism\", (No. 10). Iied.</ref> This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the [[food webs]] and [[keystone species]].\n\nThere is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] lions, [[rhino]], [[leopard]]s, and even [[giraffes]]. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by [[trophy hunting]]. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.<ref>Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., & Kerley, G. I. (2016). \"Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.\". ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''.</ref>\n\nAnother tourism destination activity is [[scuba diving]]. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by [[recreational diving]]. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \"na\u00efve\" divers who engage in [[underwater photography]] are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.<ref>Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., & Ditton, R. B.

It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture.

The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web |last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.academia.edu/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R. (2015). ''Travel and Tourism: Economic Impact 2015 World'' (pp. 1\u201320).

(2007). \"Regional economic impacts of tourism: The case of Denmark\". ''Regional Studies'', 41(6), 839\u2013854.</ref>\n\nThe economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities.  Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\">Goeldner, C. R., & Ritchie, J. B. (2007). ''Tourism Principles, Practices, Philosophies''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by \"residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes\".<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nIn contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

Toronto: Oxford University Press</ref> For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination. That individual goes on to spend that dollar on lunch from a local vendor, and that vendor goes on to spend it locally.<ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\">Wagner, J. E. (1997). \"Estimating the economic impacts of tourism\". ''Annals of Tourism Research'', 24(3), 592\u2013608.</ref>\n\n=== Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism ===\nThere are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/>  A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.<ref name=\"Wyllie\">Robert W. Wyllie. 2000. ''Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues''. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03</ref> A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.<ref>Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: [https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29954/Title_and_Text.pdf?sequence=1 The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\nNegative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.<ref name=\"Nelson\">J.G Nelson, R. Butler, G. Wall. (1999). \"Tourism and Sustainable Development; A Civic Approach\". ''Heritage Resource Centre Joint Publication'', Number 2. ''University of Waterloo and Department of Geography Publication Series'', Number 52. University of Waterloo</ref> Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and [[regulations]]. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/> Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\">Tyrrell, T. J., & Johnston, R. J. (2006). \"The Economic Impacts of Tourism: A Special Issue\". ''Journal of Travel Research'', 45(1), 3\u20137.</ref> Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n===Tourism satellite account===\nThe [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]]<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.<ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\">Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''. Routledge.</ref> This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy. For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:\n\n* provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment\n* is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism\n* is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission\n* is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development\n* provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments\n* provides information on tourism human resource characteristics\n\nThrough collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap.<ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\".<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n=== Projections for 2020 ===\nPredictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the [[world economy|world's economic system]] appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6&nbsp;billion by the year 2020.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of those tourists, 1.18&nbsp;billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of these travelers, arrivals in [[developing countries]] are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Norjana et al., 2014\"/><ref name=\"Zhang et al\" />\nDirect contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> [[employment rate|Employment]] is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sustainable tourism]]\n*[[Overtourism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite journal|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325376012|first1= A.|last1= Gorrini|first2= V.|last2=Bertini |title= Walkability assessment and tourism cities: the case of Venice|date= 31 May 2018|quote= Tourism-based assessment in the historical Venice.

'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources. '''[[Economic impact]]s''' are usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Cultural education may also be improved, which can be overlooked.<ref name=\"Rollins et al 2016\">Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) \"Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas\". In P.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized.

[[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\n== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [[wikt:authenticity|authenticity]], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.<ref name=\"Fernandes\">([http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes]){{Dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagence\">(Fagence, http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{Dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a \"cure\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/news/top_news/2017/03/06/content_281475586651838.htm|title=Tourism seen as cure for poverty in central, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref> For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.academia.edu/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R.

Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\">Goeldner, C.

This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

Chapters 01-03</ref> A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.<ref>Kyungmi K.

Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\nNegative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment.

Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n===Tourism satellite account===\nThe [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]]<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.<ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\">Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''.

For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:\n\n* provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment\n* is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism\n* is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission\n* is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development\n* provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments\n* provides information on tourism human resource characteristics\n\nThrough collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap.<ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\".<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n=== Projections for 2020 ===\nPredictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the [[world economy|world's economic system]] appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6&nbsp;billion by the year 2020.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of those tourists, 1.18&nbsp;billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of these travelers, arrivals in [[developing countries]] are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Norjana et al., 2014\"/><ref name=\"Zhang et al\" />\nDirect contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> [[employment rate|Employment]] is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sustainable tourism]]\n*[[Overtourism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite journal|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325376012|first1= A.|last1= Gorrini|first2= V.|last2=Bertini |title= Walkability assessment and tourism cities: the case of Venice|date= 31 May 2018|quote= Tourism-based assessment in the historical Venice.

Although she was originally intended to be built as a [[paddle steamer]], she was fitted with twin diesel engines just before completion. She now operates on the River Dart mainly used as the second Totnes service vessel.\n*'''Dart Venturer'''\n:Originally built as ''Plymouth Venturer'' for [[Plymouth Boat Cruises]] in 1982, this 300 passenger vessel ran for them until 2002, when it was \"swapped\" with Dart Pleasure Craft's smaller ''Plymouth Belle''.

One of two sisters built in 1957 for [[British Rail]] as ''Humphrey Gilbert'' (her sister was ''Adrian Gilbert''), for use on the Dartmouth-Kingswear ferry service. When the Paignton-Kingswear branch line was closed by British Rail, the two ferries passed briefly into local authority ownership, then were sold for use on the Falmouth - St Mawes Ferry. Following a sale back to BR for use on the [[Gravesend\u2013Tilbury Ferry]], they were deemed unsuitable for use on either of these two routes.

The station was to have the call-sign 2EU, based on the initials of '''E'''lectrical '''U'''tilities. However, before the licence, ''PMG - Broadcasting Station Licence'' No.12, was issued on 7 November 1924, Electrical Utilities advised the PMG that it wished to reverse the initials in the call-sign - thus the licence was issued to 2UE.<ref>copy of the original licence in the collections of Bruce Carty, [[Gosford]], [[New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n====2UE====\n2UE opened on 26 January 1925. The founder of Electrical Utilities and 2EU/2UE was Cecil \"Pa\" Stevenson, who was also 2UE's chief engineer, and one of the most prominent personalities in Australia's early broadcasting history.  Prior to opening 2UE, he had operated experimental station 2IY, as well as working alongside a couple of other early experimenters.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\">Carty, Bruce, ''On the Air: Australian Radio History'', privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W.</ref><ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/son-2eu-passes</ref>\n\nThe original studio was in the dining room of Stevenson's [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]] home; and an 80 feet (24.384 metres) transmitting tower was installed in his back yard. All the equipment was homemade; the studio and equipment costing \u00a3750 ($1,500) to build, and \u00a39 ($18) per week to operate. Within a short time the studios were moved to Stevenson's radio store in [[George Street, Sydney]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\nMost programming was provided by [[78 rpm]] recordings or [[player piano]] rolls. It is reputed that whilst changing records or rolls, Stevenson would whistle so as to prevent dead air.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> 2UE was originally on the air daily from 8.00&nbsp;pm to 10.00&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\">Walker, R.R., ''The Magic Spark: 50 Years of Radio in Australia'', 1973, The Hawthorn Press, Melbourne</ref> The station is reputed to have broadcast Australia's first radio advertisement.  A local butcher was so disconcerted with the sounds between recordings and piano rolls that he paid Stevenson one shilling (10\u00a2) to substitute his whistling with short talks about the quality of the butcher's meat. One shilling then became the station's standard advertising rate.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\">Griffen-Foley, Bridget, ''Changing Stations: The Story of Australian Commercial Radio'', UNSW Press, 2009, Sydney</ref>\n\nThere are records of early 2UE broadcasts being picked-up in the US and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n2UE is the oldest current commercial radio station in Australia.<ref>Carty, Bruce, ''On the Air: Australian Radio \nHistory'', privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W.</ref><ref>2UE was not the first B Class or commercial station in Australia. This honour goes to either [[2CM]] or [[2BE (Sydney)|2BE]], according to one's definition of a B Class station. They both broadcast out of Sydney, and both of these stations were short-lived. Bruce Carty claims that the first B Class station was 2CM, whilst R.R. Walker plumps for 2BE. The second-oldest current commercial radio station on the air is [[2HD]] Newcastle, which made its first broadcast just one day after 2UE.</ref>\n\nIn 1929, through Cecil Stevenson, 2UE experimented with sending pictures by radio using radiovision or [[Television|mechanical television]]. The [[television in Australia|experiments]] were short-lived due to the lack of receivers to pick up\nthe transmissions.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> (Melbourne stations [[3UZ]] and [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] also both conducted similar experimental transmissions in 1929.)\n\n===1930s===\n====Broadcast Services Association====\nAs a cost saving measure in the depths of the [[Great Depression]], in December 1935 it was announced that an organisation to be known as Broadcasting Service Association, Limited, would co-ordinate and provide combined production resources for 2UE and [[2GB]], but without owning or operating either station.  On 7 January 1937, it was announced that the two stations would operate as the ''Red Network'' and the ''Blue Network''; a concept which was copied from the US's [[NBC]] network, which operated a [[NBC Red Network|Red Network]] and [[NBC Blue Network|Blue Network]] at this time. However, the concept never transpired in Australia, because in February 1937 2GB announced that it was going to form its own national network, and that eventually led to the formation of the [[Macquarie Media|Macquarie Network]] in 1938<ref>see also [[The Labor Daily]] \u2013 http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/237442801</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230799639 |title=Radio Network System |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=8457 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 February 1937 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> which was at first jointly managed by 2GB and 2UE.<ref name=company>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article229134023 |title=Radio Company Formed |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=1841 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 July 1938 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n====Major Broadcasting Network====\nIn 1938 2UE and [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] Melbourne launched the [[Major Broadcasting Network]] which for many decades was Australia's second most important radio network, after the Macquarie Network. The main person behind the formation of the Major Network was [[David Thomas Worrall|David Worrall]], manager of 3DB, and a most important figure in broadcasting history.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/worrall-david-thomas-12074</ref><ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/>\n\nThe Major Network's Sydney outlet later changed from 2UE to [[2CH]] and then to [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] before 2UE yet again became the Major Network outlet in Sydney in September 1950<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230472085 |title=Drug addict's struggle back to happiness |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=12,681 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 September 1950 |accessdate=29 October 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\nThe Network broadcast a wide range of live variety programs including quizzes and [[radio drama|dramas]] including [[soap operas]], mostly emanating from the 3DB or 2UE studios.<ref>Jones, Colin, ''Something in the Air: A History of Radio in Australia'', Kangaroo Press, 1995.</ref>\n\nThe formation of the Major Network actually happened after two earlier attempts by David Worrall to form a network with 2UE as the Sydney station. In 1933, a loose grouping, but the first Australian attempt to form a commercial network, was attempted, known as the Federal Network. Then, in 1933 the Associated Broadcasters of Australia was formed but, again, did not last long.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/>\n\n====Accommodation====\nIn 1938 2UE and 2GB, as partners in the newly formed Broadcast Services Association moved their studios and offices to Savoy House, 29 Bligh Street, Sydney,<ref name=company/> with 2UE on the 4th and 5th floors and [[2GB]] on the 6th and 7th floors.\n\nIn 1930 a new transmitter was installed at [[Lilli Pilli, New South Wales|Lilli Pilli]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Ownership====\nIn 1933\u201334 Stevenson sold the station to Associated Newspapers Ltd, publishers of [[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]].<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Time Signal====\nIn 1938 the station was commencing its broadcasts at 6.00&nbsp;am with ''The Alarm Clock''.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\nFrom 1939, 2UE became the first Australian station to broadcast six pips from the Australian [[observatory]] as an hourly [[time signal]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> For many decades all Australian stations carried the six pip time signal first heard on 2UE, and some stations still do.\n\n====Drama====\nThe 2UE Dramatic Players were established in the 1930s providing a number of dramas and serials on a [[repertory theatre|repertory]] basis. The Players were led by [[George Edwards (actor)|George Edwards]], arguably the most prominent radio actor and producer of the time.  Some time later, Paul Jacklin<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jacklin-paul-seymour-12687</ref> was appointed as 2UE's head of production.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/> Malcolm \"Max\" Afford<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/afford-malcolm-max-9315</ref> also played an important role in 2UE's dramatic productions in the 1930s and into the 1940s.  Right up to the early 1960s 2UE was to produce many dozens of audio plays for the Major Broadcasting Network. These mainly consisted of 15-minute serials or soap operas and 30-minute dramas. However, probably the most important dramatic production to emanate from the 2UE studios was the Australian version of the ''Lux Radio Theatre''<ref>''ABC Weekly'', various editions \u2013 http://www.abctvgorehill.com.au/abchtm/pubs_abcweekly.htm</ref><ref>http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A143501;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10</ref><ref>[[Lux Radio Theatre]]</ref> which was heard at 8.00&nbsp;pm every Sunday evening until 1952 \u2013 in pre-television days, arguably the most listened-to hour in the week for any radio station. (For much of its time on air, the Lux Radio Theatre was in competition with 2GB's ''Macquarie Radio Theatre'' later known as the ''Caltex Theatre''.)<ref>https://www.google.com.au/search?source=hp&q=Macquarie+radio+drama+Sunday&oq=Macquarie+radio+drama+Sunday&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1394.15393.0.16459.29.29.0.0.0.0.260.5280.2-23.24.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..5.21.4806.0..0j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i20i263k1j0i22i30k1j33i160k1j33i21k1j33i22i29i30k1.250.TtJlDsQFFQI</ref><ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Live Music====\n2UE transmitted many live musical broadcasts during this era. These ranged from classical to pop. The importance of these types of programming at that time, is highlighted by the fact that in 1933 the 2UE Academy of Music was formed under Rex Shaw<ref>http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6cj8dxv</ref> and Professor Clarence Elkin, so as to train singers and instrumentalists, particularly in the classical field. However, the Academy only lasted about a year.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Cricket / Don Bradman====\nIn the 1930s, [[Test Cricket]] had a particularly high profile and most capital city radio stations, both the ABC and commercial stations, used the cricket as a vehicle for competitive programming, often interspersing live variety programs with news of the ongoing match supplied by overseas [[cablegram]]s. In 1931 a Sydney menswear store arranged for [[Don Bradman]] to broadcast twice weekly during the cricket season.  He was on a two-year contract at the very high sum of \u00a31,000 a year; a deal which is credited with keeping Bradman in Australia.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\nBradman also regularly played the piano during 2UE's weekly ''Call to Youth'' program.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n===1940s===\n====Accommodation====\nIn July 1941 Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] officially opened a new 1,000 watt [[radio transmitter|transmitter]] at [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]]. The transmitter tower was wired with explosives by the army, so that an enemy could not have used it, should there have been a [[World War II]] invasion.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n \nFire destroyed the Savoy House studios in 1943, and another Sydney station, [[2CH]], gave 2UE temporary accommodation in their own studio complex.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Horse Racing====\n2UE was well known over many decades for its coverage of races, both in Sydney and, through relays, of meetings throughout Australia. It also relayed Sydney races both through Major Broadcasting Network affiliates and through other stations. The 2UE racing service commenced in 1945 when Sports Editor [[Clif Cary]], already well known for his cricket broadcasts, started a service then known as the Associated Sports Broadcasts which relayed horse racing and other Saturday afternoon sporting events to nine other N.S.W. stations.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/> The racing service ended in 1983 when [[Des Hoysted]] called the last race to be broadcast by 2UE. The long list of 2UE race-callers included [[Clif Cary]], Ken Howard, Des Hoysted, Andrew Martin and Harry Solomons.\n\n===1950s===\n====Promotional slogan====\nDuring this era, 2UE was known as '''The Modern Station'''.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Sale of 2UE====\nIn 1954 John Lamb purchased 2UE from Associated Newspapers, for \u00a3165,000 ($330,000). Lamb also owned [[2KO]] [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. John Lamb died in 1978, and his son, Stewart, moved from Newcastle to Sydney to look after the Lamb family's interests in 2UE.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lamb-john-10773</ref>\n\n====Gary O'Callaghan====\n[[Gary O'Callaghan]] was Sydney's number one breakfast announcer for 28 years, winning 159 surveys.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/2ue-radio-host-gary-ocallaghan-dead-at-83-20170819-gxzue9.html</ref><ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Top 40====\n2UE instigated Australia's first [[Top 40]] on 2 March 1958, with former Newcastle announcer Pat Barton<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/vale-pat-barton</ref> as the host of a daily Top 40 program. The number one song on the very first Top 40 chart was [[Pat Boone]]'s [[April Love (song)|April Love]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/><ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/top-40-turns-50-video-has-failed-kill-radio-star</ref>\n\n===1960s===\n====New promotional slogan====\nDuring the 1960s, the station was known as '''The Brighter 2UE'''.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Sydney's Pop Music station====\nIn the early 1960s, 2UE dropped virtually all of its variety and drama shows. It was considered that television had become the home for these types of programming. 2UE increased its reliance on a Top 40 format, becoming one of the first stations in Australia to devote most of its air time to pop music, but by the end of this decade [[2SM]] had superseded 2UE as Sydney's most popular Top 40 station.\n\nPopular 2UE DJs in this era included [[Bob Rogers (disc jockey)|Bob Rogers]],Tony Withers and [[John Laws]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\nCommencing in 1966, a major pop music promotion on 2UE Sydney and [[3UZ]] Melbourne was [[[[Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds]], a national rock band concert staged to promote Australian talent and foster new bands. However, after a few years, 2SM was appointed as the Sydney outlet for the Battle of the Sounds, replacing 2UE.<ref>http://www.milesago.com/performance/hoadleys.htm</ref>\n\nOne popular variety program that did survive for many years was the ''National Old Time Dance'' with Jack Papworth's orchestra, every Friday evening. It was relayed to stations across Australia. At one stage it was broadcast from The Albert Palais, Leichhardt.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/><ref>http://www.australianotr.com.au/allan-black-2ue-parts-1-15.html</ref>\n\n====Talkback====\nUntil 1967 talkback was illegal in Australia because of government concerns that: a) people may say something they shouldn't; and b) callers may not know they were on the air.  Nevertheless, many stations, particularly [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] in Sydney and [[3AK]] Melbourne, did broadcast talkback from 1963. However, 2UE and [[3DB (Melbourne)]] were the first Australian stations to legally present talkback, commencing on 17 April 1967. Journalist Ormsby Wilkins was the first 2UE talkback host.<ref>https://www.nfsa.gov.au/latest/50-years-talkback-radio-australia</ref>\n\n===1970s===\n====Country Music====\nAlthough 2UE was mainly broadcasting Top 40 during this period, in the early 1970s it also featured some [[country music]], including programs hosted by Studio Manager Nick Erby. John Laws also included a deal of country music in his programs.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n====Ownership Changes====\nThe Lamb family sold 2UE to [[Kerry Packer]] in the 1980s, and Packer then sold it to [[Alan Bond]] but when the Bond Empire was crumbling in the early 1990s,the Lamb family was to buy back 2UE.<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/late-stewart-lambs-contribution-radio-industry</ref>\n\n==== CBC Network ====\nIn 1986, under Kerry Packer, 2UE and [[3AK]] Melbourne, embarked on a shared [[talk-back]] format called the '''CBC Network''' which featured selected Melbourne and Sydney based programs being broadcast across both stations. Two separate breakfast programs were broadcast for both Sydney and Melbourne but that was the only shift with separate programming. All other programs, whether emanating from Sydney or Melbourne, were heard over both stations.  Well-known Sydney and Melbourne news broadcaster and radio management expert Brian White managed both stations. However, the CBC experiment was a short-lived failure.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/talk-radio-entrant-faces-a-hard-oft-travelled-road/story-e6frg99x-1225855203124 Talk radio entrant faces a hard, oft-travelled road], By Mark Day, 19 April 2010, The Australian</ref>\n\n====Huge Prize====\nIn 1984 2UE ran a competition, ''Millionaire Mania'' in which a prize of $20,000 a year for 50 years, was offered. This was believed to be the largest ever radio prize, to that date! 2UE management was no doubt relieved when Premier [[Neville Wran]] drew out the name of someone described as an \"older lady\".<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n===1990s===\n====Cash for comment====\n{{main|Cash for comment affair}}\n2UE was the centre of the cash for comment affair, an Australian scandal that broke in 1999. It concerned [[Advertorial|paid advertising]] on talk back radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. The affair was first reported on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' by reporters [[Richard Ackland]], [[Deborah Richards]] and Ann Connelly.  They revealed that 2UE hosts [[John Laws]] and [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] had been paid to give favourable comment to companies including [[Qantas]], [[Optus]], [[Foxtel]], [[Mirvac]] and major Australian banks, without disclosing this arrangement to listeners. The [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] found that John Laws, Alan Jones, and 2UE had committed 90 breaches of the industry code and five breaches of 2UE's license conditions. 2UE was fined $360,000 for John Laws's improper conduct.<ref name=\"jla\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/john-laws-ads-cost-2ue-radio-360000-20090717-dnlb.html |title=John Laws' ads cost 2UE radio $360,000 |author=Katelyn Catanzariti |accessdate=6 September 2011 |date=17 July 2009 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald  }}</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132016===\n====News Talk====\n2UE continued to broadcast a [[news talk]] format, involving current affairs oriented programs with [[talk radio|talkback]] across the day and more relaxed programming at nights and on weekends. News updates were broadcast at the top of every hour, provided by [[Macquarie Radio Network]].\n\n====More Ownership Changes====\nIn March 2001, the Lamb family sold 2UE and 4BC to [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] for a reputed $90&nbsp;million.\n\nIn July 2007, [[Fairfax Media]] purchased all of Southern Cross Broadcasting's metro radio assets, including 2UE, [[3AW]] and 4BC.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-03/fairfax-buys-southern-cross-radio-stations/88360</ref>\n\nOn 22 December 2014, it was announced that Fairfax's radio division and [[Macquarie Media|Macquarie Radio Network]] would merge.<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/fairfax-and-macquarie-radio-network-merge</ref> The merger was finalised on 1 April 2015.<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/mrn-fairfax-merger-complete</ref>\n\nDespite having had a strong relationship in the 1930s through the Broadcast Services Association, by the 21st century 2UE had been a constant rival of [[2GB]] for many decades.  Both of these Sydney stations had offered a similar format. In the early 2010s 2UE slipped badly in the ratings,<ref name=\"Ratings\" /> suffering major blows when long time breakfast program host [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] moved across to the 2GB breakfast program and when broadcaster [[John Laws]] retired from radio, leaving his 2UE morning program at the end of 2007.\n\nOn 9 April 2015, with 2UE and 2GB now both owned by the newly merged Macquarie Radio Network, the 2UE newsroom was closed after 90 years with the last news report being broadcast at 6&nbsp;pm that day.

This rating placed 2UE tenth out of the 14 surveyed stations. During this survey period, its Monday to Friday share slipped to 3.2 per cent of the available audience, putting it behind [[Macquarie Radio Network]]'s [[2CH]] which averaged 4.6 per cent and meant 2UE was only ahead of three stations.

The station was to have the call-sign 2EU, based on the initials of '''E'''lectrical '''U'''tilities. However, before the licence, ''PMG - Broadcasting Station Licence'' No.12, was issued on 7 November 1924, Electrical Utilities advised the PMG that it wished to reverse the initials in the call-sign - thus the licence was issued to 2UE.<ref>copy of the original licence in the collections of Bruce Carty, [[Gosford]], [[New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n====2UE====\n2UE opened on 26 January 1925. The founder of Electrical Utilities and 2EU/2UE was Cecil \"Pa\" Stevenson, who was also 2UE's chief engineer, and one of the most prominent personalities in Australia's early broadcasting history.  Prior to opening 2UE, he had operated experimental station 2IY, as well as working alongside a couple of other early experimenters.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\">Carty, Bruce, ''On the Air: Australian Radio History'', privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W.</ref><ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/son-2eu-passes</ref>\n\nThe original studio was in the dining room of Stevenson's [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]] home; and an 80 feet (24.384 metres) transmitting tower was installed in his back yard. All the equipment was homemade; the studio and equipment costing \u00a3750 ($1,500) to build, and \u00a39 ($18) per week to operate. Within a short time the studios were moved to Stevenson's radio store in [[George Street, Sydney]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\nMost programming was provided by [[78 rpm]] recordings or [[player piano]] rolls. It is reputed that whilst changing records or rolls, Stevenson would whistle so as to prevent dead air.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> 2UE was originally on the air daily from 8.00&nbsp;pm to 10.00&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\">Walker, R.R., ''The Magic Spark: 50 Years of Radio in Australia'', 1973, The Hawthorn Press, Melbourne</ref> The station is reputed to have broadcast Australia's first radio advertisement.  A local butcher was so disconcerted with the sounds between recordings and piano rolls that he paid Stevenson one shilling (10\u00a2) to substitute his whistling with short talks about the quality of the butcher's meat. One shilling then became the station's standard advertising rate.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\">Griffen-Foley, Bridget, ''Changing Stations: The Story of Australian Commercial Radio'', UNSW Press, 2009, Sydney</ref>\n\nThere are records of early 2UE broadcasts being picked-up in the US and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n2UE is the oldest current commercial radio station in Australia.<ref>Carty, Bruce, ''On the Air: Australian Radio \nHistory'', privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W.</ref><ref>2UE was not the first B Class or commercial station in Australia. This honour goes to either [[2CM]] or [[2BE (Sydney)|2BE]], according to one's definition of a B Class station. They both broadcast out of Sydney, and both of these stations were short-lived. Bruce Carty claims that the first B Class station was 2CM, whilst R.R. Walker plumps for 2BE. The second-oldest current commercial radio station on the air is [[2HD]] Newcastle, which made its first broadcast just one day after 2UE.</ref>\n\nIn 1929, through Cecil Stevenson, 2UE experimented with sending pictures by radio using radiovision or [[Television|mechanical television]]. The [[television in Australia|experiments]] were short-lived due to the lack of receivers to pick up\nthe transmissions.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> (Melbourne stations [[3UZ]] and [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] also both conducted similar experimental transmissions in 1929.)\n\n===1930s===\n====Broadcast Services Association====\nAs a cost saving measure in the depths of the [[Great Depression]], in December 1935 it was announced that an organisation to be known as Broadcasting Service Association, Limited, would co-ordinate and provide combined production resources for 2UE and [[2GB]], but without owning or operating either station.  On 7 January 1937, it was announced that the two stations would operate as the ''Red Network'' and the ''Blue Network''; a concept which was copied from the US's [[NBC]] network, which operated a [[NBC Red Network|Red Network]] and [[NBC Blue Network|Blue Network]] at this time. However, the concept never transpired in Australia, because in February 1937 2GB announced that it was going to form its own national network, and that eventually led to the formation of the [[Macquarie Media|Macquarie Network]] in 1938<ref>see also [[The Labor Daily]] \u2013 http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/237442801</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230799639 |title=Radio Network System |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=8457 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 February 1937 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> which was at first jointly managed by 2GB and 2UE.<ref name=company>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article229134023 |title=Radio Company Formed |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=1841 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 July 1938 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n====Major Broadcasting Network====\nIn 1938 2UE and [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] Melbourne launched the [[Major Broadcasting Network]] which for many decades was Australia's second most important radio network, after the Macquarie Network. The main person behind the formation of the Major Network was [[David Thomas Worrall|David Worrall]], manager of 3DB, and a most important figure in broadcasting history.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/worrall-david-thomas-12074</ref><ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/>\n\nThe Major Network's Sydney outlet later changed from 2UE to [[2CH]] and then to [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] before 2UE yet again became the Major Network outlet in Sydney in September 1950<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230472085 |title=Drug addict's struggle back to happiness |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=12,681 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 September 1950 |accessdate=29 October 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\nThe Network broadcast a wide range of live variety programs including quizzes and [[radio drama|dramas]] including [[soap operas]], mostly emanating from the 3DB or 2UE studios.<ref>Jones, Colin, ''Something in the Air: A History of Radio in Australia'', Kangaroo Press, 1995.</ref>\n\nThe formation of the Major Network actually happened after two earlier attempts by David Worrall to form a network with 2UE as the Sydney station. In 1933, a loose grouping, but the first Australian attempt to form a commercial network, was attempted, known as the Federal Network. Then, in 1933 the Associated Broadcasters of Australia was formed but, again, did not last long.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/>\n\n====Accommodation====\nIn 1938 2UE and 2GB, as partners in the newly formed Broadcast Services Association moved their studios and offices to Savoy House, 29 Bligh Street, Sydney,<ref name=company/> with 2UE on the 4th and 5th floors and [[2GB]] on the 6th and 7th floors.\n\nIn 1930 a new transmitter was installed at [[Lilli Pilli, New South Wales|Lilli Pilli]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Ownership====\nIn 1933\u201334 Stevenson sold the station to Associated Newspapers Ltd, publishers of [[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]].<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Time Signal====\nIn 1938 the station was commencing its broadcasts at 6.00&nbsp;am with ''The Alarm Clock''.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\nFrom 1939, 2UE became the first Australian station to broadcast six pips from the Australian [[observatory]] as an hourly [[time signal]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> For many decades all Australian stations carried the six pip time signal first heard on 2UE, and some stations still do.\n\n====Drama====\nThe 2UE Dramatic Players were established in the 1930s providing a number of dramas and serials on a [[repertory theatre|repertory]] basis. The Players were led by [[George Edwards (actor)|George Edwards]], arguably the most prominent radio actor and producer of the time.  Some time later, Paul Jacklin<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jacklin-paul-seymour-12687</ref> was appointed as 2UE's head of production.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/> Malcolm \"Max\" Afford<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/afford-malcolm-max-9315</ref> also played an important role in 2UE's dramatic productions in the 1930s and into the 1940s.  Right up to the early 1960s 2UE was to produce many dozens of audio plays for the Major Broadcasting Network. These mainly consisted of 15-minute serials or soap operas and 30-minute dramas. However, probably the most important dramatic production to emanate from the 2UE studios was the Australian version of the ''Lux Radio Theatre''<ref>''ABC Weekly'', various editions \u2013 http://www.abctvgorehill.com.au/abchtm/pubs_abcweekly.htm</ref><ref>http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A143501;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10</ref><ref>[[Lux Radio Theatre]]</ref> which was heard at 8.00&nbsp;pm every Sunday evening until 1952 \u2013 in pre-television days, arguably the most listened-to hour in the week for any radio station. (For much of its time on air, the Lux Radio Theatre was in competition with 2GB's ''Macquarie Radio Theatre'' later known as the ''Caltex Theatre''.)<ref>https://www.google.com.au/search?source=hp&q=Macquarie+radio+drama+Sunday&oq=Macquarie+radio+drama+Sunday&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1394.15393.0.16459.29.29.0.0.0.0.260.5280.2-23.24.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..5.21.4806.0..0j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i20i263k1j0i22i30k1j33i160k1j33i21k1j33i22i29i30k1.250.TtJlDsQFFQI</ref><ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Live Music====\n2UE transmitted many live musical broadcasts during this era. These ranged from classical to pop. The importance of these types of programming at that time, is highlighted by the fact that in 1933 the 2UE Academy of Music was formed under Rex Shaw<ref>http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6cj8dxv</ref> and Professor Clarence Elkin, so as to train singers and instrumentalists, particularly in the classical field. However, the Academy only lasted about a year.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Cricket / Don Bradman====\nIn the 1930s, [[Test Cricket]] had a particularly high profile and most capital city radio stations, both the ABC and commercial stations, used the cricket as a vehicle for competitive programming, often interspersing live variety programs with news of the ongoing match supplied by overseas [[cablegram]]s. In 1931 a Sydney menswear store arranged for [[Don Bradman]] to broadcast twice weekly during the cricket season.  He was on a two-year contract at the very high sum of \u00a31,000 a year; a deal which is credited with keeping Bradman in Australia.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\nBradman also regularly played the piano during 2UE's weekly ''Call to Youth'' program.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n===1940s===\n====Accommodation====\nIn July 1941 Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] officially opened a new 1,000 watt [[radio transmitter|transmitter]] at [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]]. The transmitter tower was wired with explosives by the army, so that an enemy could not have used it, should there have been a [[World War II]] invasion.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n \nFire destroyed the Savoy House studios in 1943, and another Sydney station, [[2CH]], gave 2UE temporary accommodation in their own studio complex.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Horse Racing====\n2UE was well known over many decades for its coverage of races, both in Sydney and, through relays, of meetings throughout Australia. It also relayed Sydney races both through Major Broadcasting Network affiliates and through other stations. The 2UE racing service commenced in 1945 when Sports Editor [[Clif Cary]], already well known for his cricket broadcasts, started a service then known as the Associated Sports Broadcasts which relayed horse racing and other Saturday afternoon sporting events to nine other N.S.W. stations.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/> The racing service ended in 1983 when [[Des Hoysted]] called the last race to be broadcast by 2UE. The long list of 2UE race-callers included [[Clif Cary]], Ken Howard, Des Hoysted, Andrew Martin and Harry Solomons.\n\n===1950s===\n====Promotional slogan====\nDuring this era, 2UE was known as '''The Modern Station'''.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Sale of 2UE====\nIn 1954 John Lamb purchased 2UE from Associated Newspapers, for \u00a3165,000 ($330,000). Lamb also owned [[2KO]] [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. John Lamb died in 1978, and his son, Stewart, moved from Newcastle to Sydney to look after the Lamb family's interests in 2UE.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lamb-john-10773</ref>\n\n====Gary O'Callaghan====\n[[Gary O'Callaghan]] was Sydney's number one breakfast announcer for 28 years, winning 159 surveys.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/2ue-radio-host-gary-ocallaghan-dead-at-83-20170819-gxzue9.html</ref><ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Top 40====\n2UE instigated Australia's first [[Top 40]] on 2 March 1958, with former Newcastle announcer Pat Barton<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/vale-pat-barton</ref> as the host of a daily Top 40 program. The number one song on the very first Top 40 chart was [[Pat Boone]]'s [[April Love (song)|April Love]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/><ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/top-40-turns-50-video-has-failed-kill-radio-star</ref>\n\n===1960s===\n====New promotional slogan====\nDuring the 1960s, the station was known as '''The Brighter 2UE'''.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Sydney's Pop Music station====\nIn the early 1960s, 2UE dropped virtually all of its variety and drama shows. It was considered that television had become the home for these types of programming. 2UE increased its reliance on a Top 40 format, becoming one of the first stations in Australia to devote most of its air time to pop music, but by the end of this decade [[2SM]] had superseded 2UE as Sydney's most popular Top 40 station.\n\nPopular 2UE DJs in this era included [[Bob Rogers (disc jockey)|Bob Rogers]],Tony Withers and [[John Laws]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\nCommencing in 1966, a major pop music promotion on 2UE Sydney and [[3UZ]] Melbourne was [[[[Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds]], a national rock band concert staged to promote Australian talent and foster new bands. However, after a few years, 2SM was appointed as the Sydney outlet for the Battle of the Sounds, replacing 2UE.<ref>http://www.milesago.com/performance/hoadleys.htm</ref>\n\nOne popular variety program that did survive for many years was the ''National Old Time Dance'' with Jack Papworth's orchestra, every Friday evening. It was relayed to stations across Australia. At one stage it was broadcast from The Albert Palais, Leichhardt.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/><ref>http://www.australianotr.com.au/allan-black-2ue-parts-1-15.html</ref>\n\n====Talkback====\nUntil 1967 talkback was illegal in Australia because of government concerns that: a) people may say something they shouldn't; and b) callers may not know they were on the air.  Nevertheless, many stations, particularly [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] in Sydney and [[3AK]] Melbourne, did broadcast talkback from 1963. However, 2UE and [[3DB (Melbourne)]] were the first Australian stations to legally present talkback, commencing on 17 April 1967. Journalist Ormsby Wilkins was the first 2UE talkback host.<ref>https://www.nfsa.gov.au/latest/50-years-talkback-radio-australia</ref>\n\n===1970s===\n====Country Music====\nAlthough 2UE was mainly broadcasting Top 40 during this period, in the early 1970s it also featured some [[country music]], including programs hosted by Studio Manager Nick Erby. John Laws also included a deal of country music in his programs.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n====Ownership Changes====\nThe Lamb family sold 2UE to [[Kerry Packer]] in the 1980s, and Packer then sold it to [[Alan Bond]] but when the Bond Empire was crumbling in the early 1990s,the Lamb family was to buy back 2UE.<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/late-stewart-lambs-contribution-radio-industry</ref>\n\n==== CBC Network ====\nIn 1986, under Kerry Packer, 2UE and [[3AK]] Melbourne, embarked on a shared [[talk-back]] format called the '''CBC Network''' which featured selected Melbourne and Sydney based programs being broadcast across both stations. Two separate breakfast programs were broadcast for both Sydney and Melbourne but that was the only shift with separate programming. All other programs, whether emanating from Sydney or Melbourne, were heard over both stations.  Well-known Sydney and Melbourne news broadcaster and radio management expert Brian White managed both stations. However, the CBC experiment was a short-lived failure.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/talk-radio-entrant-faces-a-hard-oft-travelled-road/story-e6frg99x-1225855203124 Talk radio entrant faces a hard, oft-travelled road], By Mark Day, 19 April 2010, The Australian</ref>\n\n====Huge Prize====\nIn 1984 2UE ran a competition, ''Millionaire Mania'' in which a prize of $20,000 a year for 50 years, was offered. This was believed to be the largest ever radio prize, to that date! 2UE management was no doubt relieved when Premier [[Neville Wran]] drew out the name of someone described as an \"older lady\".<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n===1990s===\n====Cash for comment====\n{{main|Cash for comment affair}}\n2UE was the centre of the cash for comment affair, an Australian scandal that broke in 1999. It concerned [[Advertorial|paid advertising]] on talk back radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. The affair was first reported on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' by reporters [[Richard Ackland]], [[Deborah Richards]] and Ann Connelly.

However, internal disagreements (in particular the notion that competition is contrary to the essence of karate) led to the creation of different organisations\u2014including an initial split between the [[Japan Karate Association]] (headed by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]) and the [[Shotokai]] (headed by Motonobu Hironishi and [[Shigeru Egami]]), followed by many others\u2014so that today there is no single \"Shotokan school\", although they all bear Funakoshi's influence.\n\nAs the most widely practiced style, Shotokan is considered a traditional and influential form of karate do.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Image:ShotokanCalligraphy.jpg|thumb|90px|right|Calligraphy of ''Shotokan'']]\n\n''Shotokan'' was the name of the first official dojo built by Gichin Funakoshi, in 1936<ref>[http://www.jka.or.jp/english/about/funakoshi.html Funakoshi Gichin (1868\u20131957)]</ref> at [[Mejiro, Toshima, Tokyo|Mejiro]], and destroyed in 1945 as a result of an [[Air raids on Japan|allied bombing]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/gichin_funakoshi_the_father_of_karate/| title = Gichin Funakoshi, the father of karate | accessdate = 21 December 2008}}</ref>  {{Nihongo|'''Shoto'''|\u677e\u6fe4|Sh\u014dt\u014d}}, meaning \"pine-waves\" (the movement of pine needles when the wind blows through them), was Funakoshi's pen-name,<ref name=\"Funakoshi1\">[[Gichin Funakoshi|Funakoshi, Gichin]] (1981). \"Karate-do: My Way of Life\".

The Japanese {{Nihongo|'''kan'''|\u9928|kan}} means \"house\" or \"hall\". In honour of their sensei, Funakoshi's students created a sign reading ''sh\u014dt\u014d-kan'', which they placed above the entrance of the hall where Funakoshi taught.<ref name=\"Funakoshi1\" /> Gichin Funakoshi never gave his system a name, just calling it ''karate''.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nShotokan training is usually divided into three parts: ''[[kihon]]'' (basics), ''[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]'' (forms or patterns of moves), and ''[[kumite]]'' (sparring). Techniques in ''kihon'' and ''kata'' are characterised by deep, long stances that provide stability, enable powerful movements, and strengthen the legs. Shotokan is regarded as a dynamic martial art as it develops anaerobic, powerful techniques as well as developing speed. Initially strength and power are demonstrated instead of slower, more flowing motions. Those who progress to brown and black belt level develop a much more fluid style that incorporates grappling, throwing and some standing joint locking techniques, which can be found even in basic kata.<ref>{{cite book |last=Funakoshi |first=Gichin |date=1973 |title=Karate-Do Kyohan |publisher=Kodansha |page=227 |isbn=0-87011-190-6 }}</ref> ''Kumite'' (fighting) techniques are practised in the kihon and kata and developed from basic to advanced levels with an opponent.\n\n===Philosophy===\n[[Image:nijukun.gif|thumb|400px|right|Calligraphy of the ''[[Niju kun]]'']]\n[[Gichin Funakoshi]] laid out the '''Twenty Precepts of Karate'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jka.or.jp/english/karate/precepts.html| title='The Twenty Precepts of Karate| first=Official site| last=JKA | accessdate=16 July 2006}}</ref> (or [[Niju kun]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.nijukun.com/| author = Teruyuki Okazaki | year = 2006 | title=Perfection of Character | isbn=0-9785763-2-2}}</ref>), which form the foundations of the art, before some of his students established the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA). Within these twenty principles, based heavily on [[bushido]] and [[Zen]], lies the philosophy of Shotokan. The principles allude to notions of humility, respect, compassion, patience, and both an inward and outward calmness. It was Funakoshi's belief that through karate practice and observation of these 20 principles, the karateka would improve their person.<ref name=Funakoshi1 />\n\nThe ''[[d\u014dj\u014d kun]]'' lists five philosophical rules for training in the dojo: seek perfection of character, be faithful, endeavor to excel, respect others, and refrain from violent behaviour. These rules are called the Five Maxims of Karate.<ref>''South African JKA Affiliated Life Book'' (2010).</ref> The d\u014dj\u014d kun is usually posted on a wall in the dojo, and some shotokan clubs recite the d\u014dj\u014d kun at the beginning and/or end of each class to provide motivation and a context for further training.\n\nFunakoshi also wrote: \"The ultimate aim of Karate lies not in victory or defeat, but in the perfection of the character of the participant.\"<ref name=\"Funakoshi1\" />\n\n===Common terms===\n{{Main|List of karate terms}}\nMany terms used in karate stem from Japanese culture. While many are names (e.g. [[Heian series|Heian]], [[Gankaku]]), others are exclusive to martial arts (e.g. [[kata]], [[kumite]]). Many terms are seldom used in daily life, such as [[zenkutsu dachi]], while others appear routinely, such as [[rei (disambiguation)|rei]]. The Japanese form is often retained in schools outside Japan to preserve the Okinawan culture and Funakoshi's philosophies.\n\nHowever, many schools of JKA (Japan Karate Association) affiliated Shotokan Karate used the full terminology on a daily basis, providing translations also. For example, the KUI (Karate Union of Ireland), utilises the full and proper Japanese name for each move and kata in training, grading and competition.\n\n===Ranks===\nRank is used in karate to indicate experience, expertise, and to a lesser degree, seniority. As with many martial arts, Shotokan uses a system of coloured belts to indicate rank. Most Shotokan schools use the ''[[ky\u016b]]'' / ''[[Dan rank|dan]]'' system but have added other belt colours. The order of colours varies widely from school to school, but kyu belts are denoted with colours that in some schools become darker as a student approaches [[shodan (rank)|shodan]]. Dan level belts are invariably black, with some schools using stripes to denote various ranks of black belt. Gichin Funakoshi himself never awarded a rank higher than Godan (5th dan black belt). <ref> Black Belt Magazine, March 1982, page 22 [https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=HtIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=funakoshi+never+awarded+more+than+godan&source=bl&ots=TmcAlQFoTx&sig=ACfU3U21AdP7lYBNN8eKIFpnqQ-1E1g62g&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi08pSZtojnAhUOw1kKHVUwAxIQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=funakoshi%20never%20awarded%20more%20than%20godan&f=false]</ref>\n\n===Kihon===\n{{Main|Kihon}}\nKihon basics is the practice of basic techniques in Shotokan Karate. Kihon Kata, or Taikyoku Shodan, was developed by Yoshitaka Funakoshi, the son of Gichin Funakoshi, as a basic introduction to karate kata. (Yoshitaka also developed Taikyoku Nidan and Sandan.) The kata consists of successive restatements of the theme of [[gedan barai]]\u2014[[oi tsuki]].\n\n===Kata===\n{{Main|Karate kata}}\n[[Image:Funakoshi Gichin2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Gichin Funakoshi]] executing ''[[Kanku dai]]'' (\u89b3\u7a7a\u5927) kata]]\n\n[[File:Heian Shodan Embusen.gif|thumb|[[Embusen]] of Heian Shodan (from ''Best Embusen: Shotokan'')]]\n\n''Kata'' is often described as a set sequence of karate moves organised into a pre-arranged fight against imaginary opponents. The kata consists of kicks, punches, sweeps, strikes and blocks. Body movement in various ''kata'' includes stepping, twisting, turning, dropping to the ground, and jumping. In Shotokan, ''kata'' is a performance or a demonstration, with every technique potentially a killing blow (''ikken hisatsu'')\u2014while paying particular attention to form and timing (rhythm). As the ''karateka'' grows older, more emphasis is placed on the health benefits of practicing ''kata'', promoting fitness while keeping the body soft, supple, and agile.\n\nSeveral Shotokan groups have introduced \"kata\" (form) from other styles into their training. The original Shotokan kata syllabus is introduced in Funakoshi's book ''Karate-do Kyohan'', which is the Master Text of Shotokan karate. Dai Nihon Karate-do Shotokai is the official representative of Shotokan karate. Japan Shotokai's kata syllabus is the same as established in \"Karate-do Kyohan\" added Gigo Funakoshi's staff kata Matsukaze No Kon.<ref>[http://www.shotokai.jp/english/keiko/kata.html The Official Homepage of Dai Nihon Karate-do Shotokai]</ref> When the [[Japan Karate Association|JKA]] was formed, [[Masatoshi Nakayama|Nakayama]] laid down 27 ''kata'' as the ''kata'' syllabus for this organisation. Even today, thousands of Shotokan ''dojo'' only practice 26 of these 27 kata. The standard JKA kata are: ''[[Taikyoku shodan]]'' (sometimes termed Kata Kihon or Kihon Kata, the name has been discontinued in some Shotokan dojos) (\u592a\u6975\u521d\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian shodan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u521d\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian nidan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u4e8c\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian sandan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u4e09\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian yondan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u56db\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian godan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u4e94\u6bb5), ''[[Bassai dai]]'' (\u62ab\u585e\u5927), ''[[Jion]]'' (\u6148\u6069), ''[[Enpi (kata)|Enpi]]'' (\u71d5\u98db), ''[[Kanku dai]]'' (\u89b3\u7a7a\u5927), ''[[Hangetsu]]'' (\u534a\u6708), ''[[Jitte]]'' (\u5341\u624b), ''[[Gankaku]]'' (\u5ca9\u9db4), ''[[Tekki series|Tekki shodan]]'' (\u9244\u9a0e\u521d\u6bb5), ''[[Tekki series|Tekki nidan]]'' (\u9244\u9a0e\u4e8c\u6bb5), ''[[Tekki series|Tekki sandan]]'' (\u9244\u9a0e\u4e09\u6bb5), ''[[Nij\u016bshiho]]'' (\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u6b65), ''[[Chinte]]'' (\u73cd\u624b), ''[[S\u014dchin]]'' (\u58ef\u93ad), ''[[R\u014dhai|Meiky\u014d/R\u014dhai]]'' (\u660e\u93e1), ''[[Unsu]]'' (\u96f2\u624b), ''[[Bassai|Bassai sh\u014d]]'' (\u62ab\u585e\u5c0f), ''[[K\u016bsank\u016b (kata)|Kank\u016b sh\u014d]]'' (\u89b3\u7a7a\u5c0f), ''[[Wankan]]'' (\u738b\u51a0), ''[[Goj\u016bshiho|Goj\u016bshiho sh\u014d]]'' (\u4e94\u5341\u56db\u6b69\u5c0f), ''[[Goj\u016bshiho|Goj\u016bshiho dai]]'' (\u4e94\u5341\u56db\u6b69\u5927), and ''[[Ji'in]]'' (\u6148\u9670).<ref name=\"Funakoshi2\">[[Gichin Funakoshi|Funakoshi, Gichin]] (1973). \"Karate-do Kyohan\", Kodansha International Ltd, Tokyo. {{ISBN|0-87011-190-6}}.</ref><ref name=\"Sugiyama\">Sugiyama, Shojiro (1984). \"25 Shoto-Kan Kata\".

Meeting of hands), is the practical application of kihon and kata to real opponents. The formalities of kumite in Shotokan karate were first instituted by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]] wherein basic, intermediate, and advanced sparring techniques and rules were formalised.<ref name=\"masatoshi1\">Masatoshi Nakayama (1978). ''Best Karate, Vol. 3: Kumite 1'', Kodansha International. {{ISBN|0-87011-332-1}}.</ref>\n\nShotokan practitioners first learn how to apply the techniques taught in ''kata'' to hypothetical opponents by way of ''kata'' ''[[bunkai]]''. ''Kata bunkai'' then matures into controlled ''kumite''.<ref name=\"tanaka1\">Masahiko Tanaka, (2001). ''Karate-d\u014d: Perfecting Kumite'', Sake Publishers. ASIN B000Q81406.</ref>\n\n''Kumite'' is the third part of the Shotokan triumvirate of ''kihon, kata and kumite''. ''Kumite'' is taught in ever increasing complexity from beginner through low grade blackbelt (1st \u2013 2nd) to intermediate (3rd \u2013 4th) and advanced (5th onwards) level practitioners.\n\nBeginners first learn ''kumite'' through basic drills, of one, three or five attacks to the head (''jodan'') or body (''chudan'') with the defender stepping backwards whilst blocking and only countering on the last defence. These drills use basic (''kihon'') techniques and develop a sense of timing and distance in defence against a known attack.\n\nAt around purple belt level ''karateka'' learn one-step sparring (''ippon kumite''). Though there is only one step involved, rather than three or five, this exercise is more advanced because it involves a greater variety of attacks and blocks usually the defenders own choice.<ref>Randall G. Hassell and Teruyuki Okazaki, (1983). ''Conversations with the Master: Masatoshi Nakayama'', Palmerston & Reed Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-911921-00-1}}</ref> It also requires the defender to execute a counter-attack faster than in the earlier types of sparring. Counter-attacks may be almost anything, including strikes, grapples, and take-down manoeuvres.\n\nSome schools prescribe the defences, most notably the Kase-ha Shotokan-ry\u016b, which uses an eight step, three directional blocking and attacking pattern, which develops from yellow belt level through to advanced level.\n\nThe next level of ''kumite'' is freestyle one-step sparring (''jiyu ippon kumite''). This type of ''kumite'', and its successor\u2014free sparring, have been documented extensively by Nakayama<ref name=\"masatoshi1\" /><ref name=\"masatoshi2\">Masatoshi Nakayama (1978). ''Best Karate, Vol 4: Kumite 2'', Kodansha International. {{ISBN|0-87011-359-3}}.</ref><ref name=\"masatoshi3\">Masatoshi Nakayama. (1966). ''Dynamic Karate'', Kodansha International. ASIN B000TBPU3C.</ref> and are expanded upon by the JKA instructor trainee program, for those clubs under the JKA. Freestyle one-step sparring is similar to one-step sparring but requires the ''karateka'' to be in motion. Practicing one-step sparring improves free sparring (''jiyu kumite'') skills, and also provides an opportunity for practicing major counter-attacks (as opposed to minor counter-attacks).<ref name=\"tanaka1\" /> [[Tsutomu Ohshima]] states that freestyle one-step sparring is the most realistic practice in Shotokan Karate, and that it is more realistic than free sparring.<ref name=\"Ohshima\">Ohshima, Tsutomu (1998). \"Notes on Training\". Idyll Arbor, Enumclaw, WA. {{ISBN|0-937663-32-8}}.</ref>\n\nFree sparring (or free style) (''jiyu kumite'') is the last element of sparring learned. In this exercise, two training partners are free to use any karate technique or combination of attacks, and the defender at any given moment is free to avoid, block, counter, or attack with any karate technique. Training partners are encouraged to make controlled and focused contact with their opponent, but to withdraw their attack as soon as surface contact has been made.<ref name=\"masatoshi2\" /> This allows attacking a full range of target areas (including punches and kicks to the face, head, throat, and body) with no padding or protective gloves, but maintains a degree of safety for the participants. Throwing one's partner and performing [[takedown (grappling)|takedowns]] are permitted in free sparring, but it is unusual for competition matches to involve extended grappling or ground-wrestling, as Shotokan ''karateka'' are encouraged to end an encounter with a single attack (''ippon''), avoiding extended periods of conflict, or unnecessary contact in situations where there may be more than one attacker.\n\n''Kaishu ippon kumite'' is an additional sparring exercise that is usually introduced for higher grades. This starts in a similar manner to freestyle one-step sparring; the attacker names the attack he/she will execute, attacks with that technique, and the defender blocks and counters the attack. Unlike freestyle one-step sparring, however, the attacker may then be required to block the defender's counter-attack and strike back. This exercise is often considered more difficult than either freestyle one-step sparring or free sparring, as the defender typically cannot escape to a safe distance in time to avoid the counter to the counter-attack.<ref name=\"tanaka1\" />\n\n''Kumite'' within the dojo often differs from competition ''kumite''. In ''dojo kumite'' any and all techniques, within reason, are valid; punches, knife hand strikes, headbutt, locks, takedowns, kicks, etc. In competition certain regulations apply, certain techniques are valid, and certain target areas, such as the joints or throat, are forbidden. The purpose of competition is to score points through the application of ''kumite'' principles while creating an exciting and competitive atmosphere, whereas the purpose of training ''kumite'' in the ''dojo'' is to be prepared to kill or cripple an opponent in a realistic situation.<ref>[http://jkiworld.com/shotokan.html Japan Karatedo International]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n[[Gichin Funakoshi]] had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan karate of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. After years of study in both styles, Funakoshi created a simpler system that combined the ideals of the two.<ref name=\"Funakoshi1\" /> He never named this system, however, always referring to it simply as \"karate.\" Funakoshi's karate reflects the changes made in the art by [[Ank\u014d Itosu]], including the ''[[Heian series|Heian/Pinan]] [[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]'' series.

However, internal disagreements (in particular the notion that competition is contrary to the essence of karate) led to the creation of different organisations\u2014including an initial split between the [[Japan Karate Association]] (headed by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]) and the [[Shotokai]] (headed by Motonobu Hironishi and [[Shigeru Egami]]), followed by many others\u2014so that today there is no single \"Shotokan school\", although they all bear Funakoshi's influence.\n\nAs the most widely practiced style, Shotokan is considered a traditional and influential form of karate do.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Image:ShotokanCalligraphy.jpg|thumb|90px|right|Calligraphy of ''Shotokan'']]\n\n''Shotokan'' was the name of the first official dojo built by Gichin Funakoshi, in 1936<ref>[http://www.jka.or.jp/english/about/funakoshi.html Funakoshi Gichin (1868\u20131957)]</ref> at [[Mejiro, Toshima, Tokyo|Mejiro]], and destroyed in 1945 as a result of an [[Air raids on Japan|allied bombing]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/gichin_funakoshi_the_father_of_karate/| title = Gichin Funakoshi, the father of karate | accessdate = 21 December 2008}}</ref>  {{Nihongo|'''Shoto'''|\u677e\u6fe4|Sh\u014dt\u014d}}, meaning \"pine-waves\" (the movement of pine needles when the wind blows through them), was Funakoshi's pen-name,<ref name=\"Funakoshi1\">[[Gichin Funakoshi|Funakoshi, Gichin]] (1981). \"Karate-do: My Way of Life\".

The Japanese {{Nihongo|'''kan'''|\u9928|kan}} means \"house\" or \"hall\". In honour of their sensei, Funakoshi's students created a sign reading ''sh\u014dt\u014d-kan'', which they placed above the entrance of the hall where Funakoshi taught.<ref name=\"Funakoshi1\" /> Gichin Funakoshi never gave his system a name, just calling it ''karate''.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nShotokan training is usually divided into three parts: ''[[kihon]]'' (basics), ''[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]'' (forms or patterns of moves), and ''[[kumite]]'' (sparring). Techniques in ''kihon'' and ''kata'' are characterised by deep, long stances that provide stability, enable powerful movements, and strengthen the legs. Shotokan is regarded as a dynamic martial art as it develops anaerobic, powerful techniques as well as developing speed. Initially strength and power are demonstrated instead of slower, more flowing motions. Those who progress to brown and black belt level develop a much more fluid style that incorporates grappling, throwing and some standing joint locking techniques, which can be found even in basic kata.<ref>{{cite book |last=Funakoshi |first=Gichin |date=1973 |title=Karate-Do Kyohan |publisher=Kodansha |page=227 |isbn=0-87011-190-6 }}</ref> ''Kumite'' (fighting) techniques are practised in the kihon and kata and developed from basic to advanced levels with an opponent.\n\n===Philosophy===\n[[Image:nijukun.gif|thumb|400px|right|Calligraphy of the ''[[Niju kun]]'']]\n[[Gichin Funakoshi]] laid out the '''Twenty Precepts of Karate'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jka.or.jp/english/karate/precepts.html| title='The Twenty Precepts of Karate| first=Official site| last=JKA | accessdate=16 July 2006}}</ref> (or [[Niju kun]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.nijukun.com/| author = Teruyuki Okazaki | year = 2006 | title=Perfection of Character | isbn=0-9785763-2-2}}</ref>), which form the foundations of the art, before some of his students established the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA). Within these twenty principles, based heavily on [[bushido]] and [[Zen]], lies the philosophy of Shotokan. The principles allude to notions of humility, respect, compassion, patience, and both an inward and outward calmness. It was Funakoshi's belief that through karate practice and observation of these 20 principles, the karateka would improve their person.<ref name=Funakoshi1 />\n\nThe ''[[d\u014dj\u014d kun]]'' lists five philosophical rules for training in the dojo: seek perfection of character, be faithful, endeavor to excel, respect others, and refrain from violent behaviour. These rules are called the Five Maxims of Karate.<ref>''South African JKA Affiliated Life Book'' (2010).</ref> The d\u014dj\u014d kun is usually posted on a wall in the dojo, and some shotokan clubs recite the d\u014dj\u014d kun at the beginning and/or end of each class to provide motivation and a context for further training.\n\nFunakoshi also wrote: \"The ultimate aim of Karate lies not in victory or defeat, but in the perfection of the character of the participant.\"<ref name=\"Funakoshi1\" />\n\n===Common terms===\n{{Main|List of karate terms}}\nMany terms used in karate stem from Japanese culture. While many are names (e.g. [[Heian series|Heian]], [[Gankaku]]), others are exclusive to martial arts (e.g. [[kata]], [[kumite]]). Many terms are seldom used in daily life, such as [[zenkutsu dachi]], while others appear routinely, such as [[rei (disambiguation)|rei]]. The Japanese form is often retained in schools outside Japan to preserve the Okinawan culture and Funakoshi's philosophies.\n\nHowever, many schools of JKA (Japan Karate Association) affiliated Shotokan Karate used the full terminology on a daily basis, providing translations also. For example, the KUI (Karate Union of Ireland), utilises the full and proper Japanese name for each move and kata in training, grading and competition.\n\n===Ranks===\nRank is used in karate to indicate experience, expertise, and to a lesser degree, seniority. As with many martial arts, Shotokan uses a system of coloured belts to indicate rank. Most Shotokan schools use the ''[[ky\u016b]]'' / ''[[Dan rank|dan]]'' system but have added other belt colours. The order of colours varies widely from school to school, but kyu belts are denoted with colours that in some schools become darker as a student approaches [[shodan (rank)|shodan]]. Dan level belts are invariably black, with some schools using stripes to denote various ranks of black belt. Gichin Funakoshi himself never awarded a rank higher than Godan (5th dan black belt). <ref> Black Belt Magazine, March 1982, page 22 [https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=HtIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=funakoshi+never+awarded+more+than+godan&source=bl&ots=TmcAlQFoTx&sig=ACfU3U21AdP7lYBNN8eKIFpnqQ-1E1g62g&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi08pSZtojnAhUOw1kKHVUwAxIQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=funakoshi%20never%20awarded%20more%20than%20godan&f=false]</ref>\n\n===Kihon===\n{{Main|Kihon}}\nKihon basics is the practice of basic techniques in Shotokan Karate. Kihon Kata, or Taikyoku Shodan, was developed by Yoshitaka Funakoshi, the son of Gichin Funakoshi, as a basic introduction to karate kata. (Yoshitaka also developed Taikyoku Nidan and Sandan.) The kata consists of successive restatements of the theme of [[gedan barai]]\u2014[[oi tsuki]].\n\n===Kata===\n{{Main|Karate kata}}\n[[Image:Funakoshi Gichin2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Gichin Funakoshi]] executing ''[[Kanku dai]]'' (\u89b3\u7a7a\u5927) kata]]\n\n[[File:Heian Shodan Embusen.gif|thumb|[[Embusen]] of Heian Shodan (from ''Best Embusen: Shotokan'')]]\n\n''Kata'' is often described as a set sequence of karate moves organised into a pre-arranged fight against imaginary opponents. The kata consists of kicks, punches, sweeps, strikes and blocks. Body movement in various ''kata'' includes stepping, twisting, turning, dropping to the ground, and jumping. In Shotokan, ''kata'' is a performance or a demonstration, with every technique potentially a killing blow (''ikken hisatsu'')\u2014while paying particular attention to form and timing (rhythm). As the ''karateka'' grows older, more emphasis is placed on the health benefits of practicing ''kata'', promoting fitness while keeping the body soft, supple, and agile.\n\nSeveral Shotokan groups have introduced \"kata\" (form) from other styles into their training. The original Shotokan kata syllabus is introduced in Funakoshi's book ''Karate-do Kyohan'', which is the Master Text of Shotokan karate. Dai Nihon Karate-do Shotokai is the official representative of Shotokan karate. Japan Shotokai's kata syllabus is the same as established in \"Karate-do Kyohan\" added Gigo Funakoshi's staff kata Matsukaze No Kon.<ref>[http://www.shotokai.jp/english/keiko/kata.html The Official Homepage of Dai Nihon Karate-do Shotokai]</ref> When the [[Japan Karate Association|JKA]] was formed, [[Masatoshi Nakayama|Nakayama]] laid down 27 ''kata'' as the ''kata'' syllabus for this organisation. Even today, thousands of Shotokan ''dojo'' only practice 26 of these 27 kata. The standard JKA kata are: ''[[Taikyoku shodan]]'' (sometimes termed Kata Kihon or Kihon Kata, the name has been discontinued in some Shotokan dojos) (\u592a\u6975\u521d\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian shodan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u521d\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian nidan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u4e8c\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian sandan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u4e09\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian yondan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u56db\u6bb5), ''[[Heian series|Heian godan]]'' (\u5e73\u5b89\u4e94\u6bb5), ''[[Bassai dai]]'' (\u62ab\u585e\u5927), ''[[Jion]]'' (\u6148\u6069), ''[[Enpi (kata)|Enpi]]'' (\u71d5\u98db), ''[[Kanku dai]]'' (\u89b3\u7a7a\u5927), ''[[Hangetsu]]'' (\u534a\u6708), ''[[Jitte]]'' (\u5341\u624b), ''[[Gankaku]]'' (\u5ca9\u9db4), ''[[Tekki series|Tekki shodan]]'' (\u9244\u9a0e\u521d\u6bb5), ''[[Tekki series|Tekki nidan]]'' (\u9244\u9a0e\u4e8c\u6bb5), ''[[Tekki series|Tekki sandan]]'' (\u9244\u9a0e\u4e09\u6bb5), ''[[Nij\u016bshiho]]'' (\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u6b65), ''[[Chinte]]'' (\u73cd\u624b), ''[[S\u014dchin]]'' (\u58ef\u93ad), ''[[R\u014dhai|Meiky\u014d/R\u014dhai]]'' (\u660e\u93e1), ''[[Unsu]]'' (\u96f2\u624b), ''[[Bassai|Bassai sh\u014d]]'' (\u62ab\u585e\u5c0f), ''[[K\u016bsank\u016b (kata)|Kank\u016b sh\u014d]]'' (\u89b3\u7a7a\u5c0f), ''[[Wankan]]'' (\u738b\u51a0), ''[[Goj\u016bshiho|Goj\u016bshiho sh\u014d]]'' (\u4e94\u5341\u56db\u6b69\u5c0f), ''[[Goj\u016bshiho|Goj\u016bshiho dai]]'' (\u4e94\u5341\u56db\u6b69\u5927), and ''[[Ji'in]]'' (\u6148\u9670).<ref name=\"Funakoshi2\">[[Gichin Funakoshi|Funakoshi, Gichin]] (1973). \"Karate-do Kyohan\", Kodansha International Ltd, Tokyo. {{ISBN|0-87011-190-6}}.</ref><ref name=\"Sugiyama\">Sugiyama, Shojiro (1984). \"25 Shoto-Kan Kata\".

Meeting of hands), is the practical application of kihon and kata to real opponents. The formalities of kumite in Shotokan karate were first instituted by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]] wherein basic, intermediate, and advanced sparring techniques and rules were formalised.<ref name=\"masatoshi1\">Masatoshi Nakayama (1978). ''Best Karate, Vol. 3: Kumite 1'', Kodansha International. {{ISBN|0-87011-332-1}}.</ref>\n\nShotokan practitioners first learn how to apply the techniques taught in ''kata'' to hypothetical opponents by way of ''kata'' ''[[bunkai]]''. ''Kata bunkai'' then matures into controlled ''kumite''.<ref name=\"tanaka1\">Masahiko Tanaka, (2001). ''Karate-d\u014d: Perfecting Kumite'', Sake Publishers. ASIN B000Q81406.</ref>\n\n''Kumite'' is the third part of the Shotokan triumvirate of ''kihon, kata and kumite''. ''Kumite'' is taught in ever increasing complexity from beginner through low grade blackbelt (1st \u2013 2nd) to intermediate (3rd \u2013 4th) and advanced (5th onwards) level practitioners.\n\nBeginners first learn ''kumite'' through basic drills, of one, three or five attacks to the head (''jodan'') or body (''chudan'') with the defender stepping backwards whilst blocking and only countering on the last defence. These drills use basic (''kihon'') techniques and develop a sense of timing and distance in defence against a known attack.\n\nAt around purple belt level ''karateka'' learn one-step sparring (''ippon kumite''). Though there is only one step involved, rather than three or five, this exercise is more advanced because it involves a greater variety of attacks and blocks usually the defenders own choice.<ref>Randall G. Hassell and Teruyuki Okazaki, (1983). ''Conversations with the Master: Masatoshi Nakayama'', Palmerston & Reed Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-911921-00-1}}</ref> It also requires the defender to execute a counter-attack faster than in the earlier types of sparring. Counter-attacks may be almost anything, including strikes, grapples, and take-down manoeuvres.\n\nSome schools prescribe the defences, most notably the Kase-ha Shotokan-ry\u016b, which uses an eight step, three directional blocking and attacking pattern, which develops from yellow belt level through to advanced level.\n\nThe next level of ''kumite'' is freestyle one-step sparring (''jiyu ippon kumite''). This type of ''kumite'', and its successor\u2014free sparring, have been documented extensively by Nakayama<ref name=\"masatoshi1\" /><ref name=\"masatoshi2\">Masatoshi Nakayama (1978). ''Best Karate, Vol 4: Kumite 2'', Kodansha International. {{ISBN|0-87011-359-3}}.</ref><ref name=\"masatoshi3\">Masatoshi Nakayama. (1966). ''Dynamic Karate'', Kodansha International. ASIN B000TBPU3C.</ref> and are expanded upon by the JKA instructor trainee program, for those clubs under the JKA. Freestyle one-step sparring is similar to one-step sparring but requires the ''karateka'' to be in motion. Practicing one-step sparring improves free sparring (''jiyu kumite'') skills, and also provides an opportunity for practicing major counter-attacks (as opposed to minor counter-attacks).<ref name=\"tanaka1\" /> [[Tsutomu Ohshima]] states that freestyle one-step sparring is the most realistic practice in Shotokan Karate, and that it is more realistic than free sparring.<ref name=\"Ohshima\">Ohshima, Tsutomu (1998). \"Notes on Training\". Idyll Arbor, Enumclaw, WA. {{ISBN|0-937663-32-8}}.</ref>\n\nFree sparring (or free style) (''jiyu kumite'') is the last element of sparring learned. In this exercise, two training partners are free to use any karate technique or combination of attacks, and the defender at any given moment is free to avoid, block, counter, or attack with any karate technique. Training partners are encouraged to make controlled and focused contact with their opponent, but to withdraw their attack as soon as surface contact has been made.<ref name=\"masatoshi2\" /> This allows attacking a full range of target areas (including punches and kicks to the face, head, throat, and body) with no padding or protective gloves, but maintains a degree of safety for the participants. Throwing one's partner and performing [[takedown (grappling)|takedowns]] are permitted in free sparring, but it is unusual for competition matches to involve extended grappling or ground-wrestling, as Shotokan ''karateka'' are encouraged to end an encounter with a single attack (''ippon''), avoiding extended periods of conflict, or unnecessary contact in situations where there may be more than one attacker.\n\n''Kaishu ippon kumite'' is an additional sparring exercise that is usually introduced for higher grades. This starts in a similar manner to freestyle one-step sparring; the attacker names the attack he/she will execute, attacks with that technique, and the defender blocks and counters the attack. Unlike freestyle one-step sparring, however, the attacker may then be required to block the defender's counter-attack and strike back. This exercise is often considered more difficult than either freestyle one-step sparring or free sparring, as the defender typically cannot escape to a safe distance in time to avoid the counter to the counter-attack.<ref name=\"tanaka1\" />\n\n''Kumite'' within the dojo often differs from competition ''kumite''. In ''dojo kumite'' any and all techniques, within reason, are valid; punches, knife hand strikes, headbutt, locks, takedowns, kicks, etc. In competition certain regulations apply, certain techniques are valid, and certain target areas, such as the joints or throat, are forbidden. The purpose of competition is to score points through the application of ''kumite'' principles while creating an exciting and competitive atmosphere, whereas the purpose of training ''kumite'' in the ''dojo'' is to be prepared to kill or cripple an opponent in a realistic situation.<ref>[http://jkiworld.com/shotokan.html Japan Karatedo International]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n[[Gichin Funakoshi]] had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan karate of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. After years of study in both styles, Funakoshi created a simpler system that combined the ideals of the two.<ref name=\"Funakoshi1\" /> He never named this system, however, always referring to it simply as \"karate.\" Funakoshi's karate reflects the changes made in the art by [[Ank\u014d Itosu]], including the ''[[Heian series|Heian/Pinan]] [[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]'' series.

Creon has killed the three kings and refuses to allow them proper burial. Theseus agrees to wage war on Creon.\n\nIn Thebes, Palamon and Arcite, cousins and close friends, are bound by duty to fight for Creon, though they are appalled by his tyranny. In a hard-fought battle Palamon and Arcite enact prodigies of courage, but the Thebans are defeated by Theseus. Palamon and Arcite are imprisoned, but philosophically resign themselves to their fate. Their stoicism is instantly destroyed when from their prison window they see Princess Emilia, Hippolyta's sister. Both fall in love with her, and their friendship turns to bitter rivalry. Arcite is released after a relative intercedes on his behalf. He is banished from Athens, but he disguises himself, wins a local wrestling match, and is appointed as Emilia's bodyguard.\n\nMeanwhile, the jailer's daughter has fallen in love with Palamon and helps him escape. She follows him, but he ignores her \u2013 still obsessed with Emilia. He lives in the forest half-starved, where he meets Arcite. The two argue, but Arcite offers to bring Palamon food, drink and armaments so that they can meet in an equal fight over Emilia.\n\nThe jailer's daughter, forsaken, has gone mad. She sings and babbles in the forest. She meets a troupe of local countrymen who want to perform a [[Morris dance]] before the king and queen. Local schoolmaster Gerald invites the mad daughter to join the performance. Theseus and Hippolyta appear, hunting. Gerald hails them, and they agree to watch the yokels perform a bizarre act for them, with the jailer's mad daughter dancing. The royal couple reward them.\n\nArcite returns with the food and weapons. After a convivial dinner with reminiscences, the two fight. Theseus and his entourage arrive on the scene. He orders that Palamon and Arcite be arrested and executed. Hippolyta and Emilia intervene, and so Theseus agrees to a public tournament between the two for Emilia's hand. Each warrior will be allowed three companions to assist them. The loser and his companion knights will be executed.\n\nThe jailer finds his daughter with the help of friends. He tries to restore her mental health. On the advice of a doctor, he encourages her former suitor to pretend to be Palamon so that she will be gradually accustomed to see him as her true love. His devotion slowly wins her over.\n\nBefore the tournament, Arcite prays to Mars that he win the battle; Palamon prays to Venus that he marry Emilia; Emilia prays to Diana that she be wed to the one who loves her best. Each prayer is granted: Arcite wins the combat, but is then thrown from his horse and dies, leaving Palamon to wed Emilia.\n\n==Sources==\nBefore the composition of ''The Two Noble Kinsmen'', Chaucer's \"[[The Knight's Tale|Knight's Tale]]\" had been adapted for the stage twice before, although both  versions are now lost. The first was by [[Richard Edwardes]] in ''[[Palamon and Arcite (Edwardes)|Palamon and Arcite]]'' (1566). This play was commissioned for a one-off performance before [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] in Oxford. It was never published, and it is unlikely to have served as a basis for ''The Two Noble Kinsmen''.\n\nAnother play on the topic, the authorship of which is not known, would certainly have been known to Shakespeare and Fletcher. It was performed by the [[Admiral's Men]] in September 1594, which had then recently been formed after a split in Shakespeare's own company.
