The song was written by [[Bilal Hajji]] and [[Savan Kotecha]], along with the song's producer [[RedOne|Nadir \"RedOne\" Khayat]]. The song was released as a promotional single in anticipation of the re-release of ''Overcome'' (2010). Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how she and her partner were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other how they felt. In response, Burke asked her aunt why he was letting the silence in their relationship do the talking instead of them discussing it. \"The Silence\" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]]-influenced [[Power ballad#Power ballads|power ballad]] and [[instrumentation]] consists of a [[piano]], a [[guitar]] and [[drums]]. The lyrics of the song feature the protagonist asking why the other person in the relationship remains silent about their difficulties instead of talking about them.\n\nThe song garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised Burke's vocal performance. It also received comparisons to songs by [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]] and [[Leona Lewis]]. Upon the release of ''Overcome'', the song debuted at number 95 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on the strength of digital download sales. A year later when released as a promotional single, it peaked at number 16 on the chart. It peaked inside the top thirty on the singles charts in Hungary, Ireland and Scotland, and peaked at number 66 in Switzerland. An accompanying [[music video]] was directed by Nzingha Stewart and shot in black and white. It features Burke in a variety of different stylized sets in different outfits and dresses. The singer has performed the song on ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' and ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. It was included on the [[set list]] of her [[All Night Long Tour]] (2011).\n\n==Background and release==\nAfter the release and success of the lead single \"[[Bad Boys (Alexandra Burke song)|Bad

The song was released as a promotional single in anticipation of the re-release of ''Overcome'' (2010). Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how she and her partner were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other how they felt.

It also received comparisons to songs by [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]] and [[Leona Lewis]].

shot.<ref name=\"SunriseInterview\"/><ref name=\"VirginMediaInterview\"/> The video was shot in black and white, and features Burke in different outfits and dresses, as well as in a variety of sets with props. It begins with a couple of [[establishing shot]]s of Burke of her posing with a balloon wearing and in another set where she is sitting on music speakers. Throughout the video, Burke is visibly in a studio with different backdrops, where she is preparing to be photographed. During the first [[Verse (music)|verse]], Burke is shown in the two sets while she sings the lyrics. Prior to the first chorus, a new set is introduced of Burke wearing a black dress which exposes all of her back while sitting on the floor next to a stereo. During the first verse, all three sets show Burke carrying out different tasks with he props, as well as a new set where she sits in front of a white backdrop in a plain white oversized shirt. As the second verse begins, the set of Burke sitting on the floor next to a stereo changes to that of her standing up in front of a microphone singing the lyrics, with the backdrop of a city skyline. During the second verse, another set is introduced of Burke posing against a stuffed animal. During the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], Burke sings the lyrics standing in front of the camera without any props surrounding her; prior to sustaining a long [[Note (music)|note]], Burke has her back to the camera and is nude from the waist up. During the final verse, Burke's anger and desperation is shown to be heightened, as she sings to her herself in the mirror and places more emphasis on her movement. The video ends with the singer nude from the waist up and facing the camera, covering herself with her arms crossed over her chest.\n\n==Live performances==\nBurke performed the song for the first time on MTV Push upon the release of ''Overcome''.<ref name=\"MTVPush\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/mtv-push/episode/mtv-push-alexandra-burke|title=MTV PUSH \u2013 Alexandra Burke \u2013
