Two versions were considered then: a DC-10-10 with a fuselage stretch of {{convert|40|ft|m}} and a DC-10-30 stretched by {{convert|30|ft|m}}. The latter version would have been capable of transporting up to 340 passengers in a multi-class configuration, or 277 passengers and their luggage over {{convert|5300|nmi|km}}. At the same time, the manufacturer was seeking to reduce wing and engine drag on the trijet. Another version of the aircraft was also envisaged, the \"DC-10 global\", aimed to counter the risks of loss of orders for the DC-10-30 that the [[Boeing 747SP]] and its range were causing. The DC-10 global would have incorporated more fuel tanks.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\">{{Cite book |last= Marriott |first= Leo |title= McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (Modern Civil Aircraft: 12) |publisher= Howell Press |date=December 1992 |location= |isbn= 0-7110-2071-X }}</ref>\n\nWhile continuing their research for a new aircraft, McDonnell Douglas designated the program DC-10 Super 60, previously known for a short time as DC-10 Super 50. The Super 60 was to be an intercontinental aircraft incorporating many aerodynamic improvements in the wings, and a fuselage lengthened by {{convert|26|ft|8|in|m}} to allow for up to 350 passengers to be seated in a mixed-class layout, compared to 275 in the same configuration of the DC-10.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nFollowing more refinements, in 1979 the DC-10 Super 60 was proposed in three distinct versions like the DC-8. The DC-10-61 was designed to be a high-capacity medium-range aircraft. It would have a fuselage stretch of {{convert|40|ft|m}} over the earlier DC-10 models, enabling it to carry 390 passengers in a mixed class or 550 passengers in an all-economy layout, similar to [[Boeing]]'s later [[Boeing 777|777-300]] and [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-600]]. Like the [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]], the series 62 was proposed for long-range routes. It would feature a more modest fuselage stretch of {{convert|26|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, along with an increased wingspan and fuel capacity. It would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers (mixed class) or 440 passengers (all-economy), similar to the later [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200]] or the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]]/[[Airbus A340|A340-300/500]]. Finally, the series 63 would have incorporated the same fuselage as the DC-10-61 as well as all the larger wing of the -62. After high-profile accidents in the 1970s, such as [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] and [[American Airlines Flight 191]], the trijet's reputation was seriously damaged by doubts regarding its structural integrity. For these reasons, and due to a downturn in the airline industry, all work on the Super 60 was stopped.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas MD-11, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines JP6102340.jpg|thumb|Nine-abreast economy class]]\nIn 1981, a [[Continental Airlines]] DC-10-10 (registration number N68048) was leased to conduct more research, particularly the effects the newly designed winglets would have on aircraft performance. Different types of winglets were tested during that time in conjunction with [[NASA]]. McDonnell Douglas was again planning new DC-10 versions that could incorporate winglets and more efficient engines developed at the time by [[Pratt & Whitney]] ([[PW2000|PW2037]]) and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] ([[RB211|RB.211-535F4]]). The manufacturer finally rationalized all these studies under the MD-EEE (Ecology-Economy-Efficiency) designation, that was later modified to the MD-100 following some more changes. The MD-100 was proposed in two versions: the Series 10, having an airframe shorter by {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} compared to the DC-10 and seating up to 270 passengers in a mixed-class configuration; and the Series 20, incorporating a fuselage stretch of {{convert|20|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} over the DC-10 and able to seat up to 333 passengers in the same kind of configuration as the Series 10. Both versions could be powered by the same engine families as the actual MD-11 plus the RB.211-600. However, the situation for the manufacturer, and the airline industry in general, did not look bright. No new DC-10 orders were received, and many among the observers and customers doubted that the manufacturer would stay in business much longer. Thus, the Board of Directors decided in November 1983 to once again cease all work on the projected new trijet.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nThe following year no new orders for the DC-10 were received. The production line was kept active thanks to earlier orders from the U.S. Air Force for 60 [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10A]] tankers. McDonnell Douglas was still convinced that a new derivative for the DC-10 was needed, as shown by the second-hand market for their Series 30 and the heavier DC-10-30ER version. Thus, in 1984 a new derivative aircraft version of the DC-10 was designated MD-11. From the very beginning, the MD-11X was conceived in two different versions. The MD-11X-10, based on a DC-10-30 airframe, offered a range of {{convert|6500|nmi|km}} with passengers. That first version would have had a [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) of {{convert|580000|lb|kg}} and would have used [[CF6|CF6-80C2]] or [[PW4000]] engines. The MD-11X-20 was to have a longer fuselage, accommodating up to 331 passengers in a mixed-class layout, and a range of {{convert|6000|nmi|km}}.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nAs more orders for the DC-10 were received, McDonnell Douglas used the time gained before the end of DC-10 production to consult with potential customers and to refine the proposed new trijet. In July 1985, the Board of Directors authorized the Long Beach plant to offer the MD-11 to potential customers. At the time, the aircraft was still proposed in two versions, both with the same fuselage length, a stretch of {{convert|22|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} over the DC-10 airframe, as well as the same engine choice as the MD-11X. One version would have a range of {{convert|4780|nmi|km}} with a gross weight of {{convert|500000|lb|kg}} and transport up to 337 passengers, while the second would carry 331 passengers over {{convert|6900|nmi|km}}. A year later, as several airlines had committed to the MD-11, the situation was looking optimistic. The aircraft was now a 320-seater baseline and defined as an {{convert|18|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}} stretch over the DC-10-30 powered by the new advanced turbofans offered by the major engine manufacturers and giving it a range of {{convert|6800|nmi|km}}. Other versions, such as a shortened ER with a range of {{convert|7500|nmi|km}}, an all-cargo offering a maximum payload of {{convert|200970|lb|kg}} and a Combi with a provision for ten freight pallets on the main deck, were proposed. Further growth of the aircraft was also foreseen, such as the MD-11 Advanced.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\n[[File:D-ALCL (3119122609).jpg|thumb|Center engine at the base of the vertical stabilizer, like the DC-10]]\nThe lack of innovation from McDonnell Douglas during the MD-11's design had been attributed to the company's declining cash flow, as it struggled with problems with its military contracts and declining orders for its commercial jets.<ref name=iasa.com.au>{{cite web |url=http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/sr111/forbidding.html |title=Jet's Troubled History Raises Issues For the FAA and the Manufacturer |work=iasa.com.au [[The Wall Street Journal]] |last=Pasztor |first=Andy |date=September 19, 2000 |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref> Limited company resources resulting in the MD-11 being developed as a refinement of the existing DC-10, in contrast to rivals Airbus and Boeing who during this time period developed all-new aircraft designs that would become the Airbus A330/A340 and Boeing 777.

Two versions were considered then: a DC-10-10 with a fuselage stretch of {{convert|40|ft|m}} and a DC-10-30 stretched by {{convert|30|ft|m}}. The latter version would have been capable of transporting up to 340 passengers in a multi-class configuration, or 277 passengers and their luggage over {{convert|5300|nmi|km}}. At the same time, the manufacturer was seeking to reduce wing and engine drag on the trijet. Another version of the aircraft was also envisaged, the \"DC-10 global\", aimed to counter the risks of loss of orders for the DC-10-30 that the [[Boeing 747SP]] and its range were causing. The DC-10 global would have incorporated more fuel tanks.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\">{{Cite book |last= Marriott |first= Leo |title= McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (Modern Civil Aircraft: 12) |publisher= Howell Press |date=December 1992 |location= |isbn= 0-7110-2071-X }}</ref>\n\nWhile continuing their research for a new aircraft, McDonnell Douglas designated the program DC-10 Super 60, previously known for a short time as DC-10 Super 50. The Super 60 was to be an intercontinental aircraft incorporating many aerodynamic improvements in the wings, and a fuselage lengthened by {{convert|26|ft|8|in|m}} to allow for up to 350 passengers to be seated in a mixed-class layout, compared to 275 in the same configuration of the DC-10.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nFollowing more refinements, in 1979 the DC-10 Super 60 was proposed in three distinct versions like the DC-8. The DC-10-61 was designed to be a high-capacity medium-range aircraft. It would have a fuselage stretch of {{convert|40|ft|m}} over the earlier DC-10 models, enabling it to carry 390 passengers in a mixed class or 550 passengers in an all-economy layout, similar to [[Boeing]]'s later [[Boeing 777|777-300]] and [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-600]]. Like the [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]], the series 62 was proposed for long-range routes. It would feature a more modest fuselage stretch of {{convert|26|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, along with an increased wingspan and fuel capacity. It would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers (mixed class) or 440 passengers (all-economy), similar to the later [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200]] or the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]]/[[Airbus A340|A340-300/500]]. Finally, the series 63 would have incorporated the same fuselage as the DC-10-61 as well as all the larger wing of the -62. After high-profile accidents in the 1970s, such as [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] and [[American Airlines Flight 191]], the trijet's reputation was seriously damaged by doubts regarding its structural integrity. For these reasons, and due to a downturn in the airline industry, all work on the Super 60 was stopped.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas MD-11, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines JP6102340.jpg|thumb|Nine-abreast economy class]]\nIn 1981, a [[Continental Airlines]] DC-10-10 (registration number N68048) was leased to conduct more research, particularly the effects the newly designed winglets would have on aircraft performance. Different types of winglets were tested during that time in conjunction with [[NASA]]. McDonnell Douglas was again planning new DC-10 versions that could incorporate winglets and more efficient engines developed at the time by [[Pratt & Whitney]] ([[PW2000|PW2037]]) and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] ([[RB211|RB.211-535F4]]). The manufacturer finally rationalized all these studies under the MD-EEE (Ecology-Economy-Efficiency) designation, that was later modified to the MD-100 following some more changes. The MD-100 was proposed in two versions: the Series 10, having an airframe shorter by {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} compared to the DC-10 and seating up to 270 passengers in a mixed-class configuration; and the Series 20, incorporating a fuselage stretch of {{convert|20|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} over the DC-10 and able to seat up to 333 passengers in the same kind of configuration as the Series 10. Both versions could be powered by the same engine families as the actual MD-11 plus the RB.211-600. However, the situation for the manufacturer, and the airline industry in general, did not look bright. No new DC-10 orders were received, and many among the observers and customers doubted that the manufacturer would stay in business much longer. Thus, the Board of Directors decided in November 1983 to once again cease all work on the projected new trijet.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nThe following year no new orders for the DC-10 were received. The production line was kept active thanks to earlier orders from the U.S. Air Force for 60 [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10A]] tankers. McDonnell Douglas was still convinced that a new derivative for the DC-10 was needed, as shown by the second-hand market for their Series 30 and the heavier DC-10-30ER version. Thus, in 1984 a new derivative aircraft version of the DC-10 was designated MD-11. From the very beginning, the MD-11X was conceived in two different versions. The MD-11X-10, based on a DC-10-30 airframe, offered a range of {{convert|6500|nmi|km}} with passengers. That first version would have had a [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) of {{convert|580000|lb|kg}} and would have used [[CF6|CF6-80C2]] or [[PW4000]] engines. The MD-11X-20 was to have a longer fuselage, accommodating up to 331 passengers in a mixed-class layout, and a range of {{convert|6000|nmi|km}}.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nAs more orders for the DC-10 were received, McDonnell Douglas used the time gained before the end of DC-10 production to consult with potential customers and to refine the proposed new trijet. In July 1985, the Board of Directors authorized the Long Beach plant to offer the MD-11 to potential customers. At the time, the aircraft was still proposed in two versions, both with the same fuselage length, a stretch of {{convert|22|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} over the DC-10 airframe, as well as the same engine choice as the MD-11X. One version would have a range of {{convert|4780|nmi|km}} with a gross weight of {{convert|500000|lb|kg}} and transport up to 337 passengers, while the second would carry 331 passengers over {{convert|6900|nmi|km}}. A year later, as several airlines had committed to the MD-11, the situation was looking optimistic. The aircraft was now a 320-seater baseline and defined as an {{convert|18|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}} stretch over the DC-10-30 powered by the new advanced turbofans offered by the major engine manufacturers and giving it a range of {{convert|6800|nmi|km}}.

When the 1st Mountain Division of the German 49th Army Corps took over the city, the gates of all NKVD prisons were opened and, within hours, the scale of Soviet murders revealed. A special commission was formed under SS Judge Hans Tomforde to make a report. Jews were ordered to start removing decomposing bodies from cells and cellars into prison yards. Over 10,000 dead were accounted for at Brygidki. At some prisons, the mountains of [[Putrefaction|putrefacting]] corpses reaching the basement ceilings forced the Germans to stop counting and wall-off the doors with brickwork. The German propaganda blamed the killings on the Jewish commissars and encouraged local Ukrainians to take their revenge &ndash; according to testimonies collected by the Germans, OUN-UPA members were in the majority of prisoners. In early July 1941 [[Einsatzgruppen|SS paramilitary death squads]] organized [[Lviv pogroms|the first pogrom]] against the Jews with the aid of [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]]. About 4,000 Jews were massacred by Ukrainian nationalists. In late July, another pogrom (known as [[Petliura]] Days), took the lives of more than 2,000 Jews.<ref name=\"ushmm-2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005171 |title=Lvov |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C. |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103305/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005171 |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"sztetl.org-2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/article/lwow/5,historia/?action=view&page=5 | title=Spo\u0142eczno\u015b\u0107 \u017cydowska przed 1989 \u2013 Ukraina / \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c (obw\u00f3d lwowski) | publisher=Muzeum Historii \u017byd\u00f3w Polskich [[Virtual Shtetl]] | work=Lw\u00f3w | accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref> Some, mostly Ukrainian scholars, argue that the pogroms were in retaliation for the [[NKVD prisoner massacres#Poland|NKVD prisoner massacres]] of approximately 7,000,<ref>Jerzy W\u0119gierski, ''Lw\u00f3w pod okupacj\u0105 sowieck\u0105 1939-1941'' , Warszawa 1991, Editions Spotkania, {{ISBN|83-85195-15-7}} p. 273.</ref> and up to 10,000 prisoners according to OUN,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book | url=http://www.ex.ua/get/4095342 | title=\"\u0428\u043e\u0430\" \u0443 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0456 | location=\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432 | publisher=\u041b\u0410 \u00ab\u041f\u0456\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0434\u0430\u00bb | year=2006 | accessdate=February 13, 2015 | author=[[Yevhen Nakonechny]] | pages=98\u201399 or 50 in current document (1/284 or 1/143 digitized) | isbn=966-8522-47-8 | format=[[DjVu]] | trans-title=\"Shoa\" in Lviv | via=\u0406\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f @ EX.UA, direct download (7.7 MB) }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{Unreliable source?|reason=Nakonechny is a known denialist.|date=May 2016}}</ref> including Polish, Jewish and Ukrainian intellectuals, political activists, and alleged common criminals held at Lw\u00f3w's three prisons comprising [[Brygidki]], \u0141\u0105ckiego Street and Zamarstynowska Street prison.

Thus, if we accept the Soviet and Jewish victims' version of the events rather than the version advanced by the Ukrainians (who were the actual rioters and perpetrated the murders), it was the Nazis who \"gave license\" to the UNO, the Ukrainian nationalists, the [[Ukrainian People's Militia]] (soon to become the [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]]), and Ukrainian citizenry (identified simply by yellow armbands), to conduct a full blown massacre in which at least 2000 Jewish men were killed.

Eventually, between 110,000 and 120,000 Jews were forced into the new ghetto. The living conditions there were extremely poor, coupled with severe overcrowding. For example, food rations allocated to the Jews were estimated to equal only 10% of the German and 50% of the Ukrainian or Polish rations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Filip Friedman, ''Zag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w lwowskich'' (Extermination of the Jews of Lw\u00f3w) {{OCLC|38706656}}.</ref>\n\nThe Germans established a Jewish police force called the ''J\u00fcdischer Ordnungsdienst Lemberg'' wearing dark blue Polish police uniforms from before World War II, but with the Polish insignia replaced by a [[Star of David|Magen David]] and the new letters J.O.L. in various positions on their uniform.

Their ranks numbered from 500 to 750 policemen.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The Jewish police force answered to the Jewish National city council known as the Judenrat, which in turn answered to the Gestapo.\n\n===Deportations===\nThe Lemberg Ghetto was one of the first to have Jews transported to the [[death camps]] as part of [[Aktion Reinhard]]. Between March 16 and April&nbsp;1, 1942, approximately 15,000 Jews were taken to the Klepar\u00f3w railway station and deported to the [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] [[extermination camp]]. Following these initial deportations, and death by disease and random shootings, around 86,000 Jews officially remained in the ghetto, though there were many more not recorded. During this period, many Jews were also forced to work for the Wehrmacht and the ghetto's German administration, especially in the nearby [[Janowska concentration camp|Janowska]] labor camp. On June 24\u201325, 1942, 2,000 Jews were taken to the labor camp; only 120 were used for forced labor, and all of the others were shot.\n\nBetween August 10\u201331, 1942, the \"Great Aktion\" was carried out, where between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews were rounded up, gathered at transit point placed in Janowska camp and then deported to Belzec. Many who were not deported, including local orphans and hospital inpatients, were shot. On September 1, 1942, the Gestapo hanged the head of Lw\u00f3w\u2019s [[Judenrat]] and members of the ghetto's Jewish police force on balconies of Judenrat's building at \u0141okietka street and Hermana street corner. Around 65,000 Jews remained while winter approached with no heating or sanitation, leading to an outbreak of typhus.\n\nBetween January 5\u20137, 1943, another 15,000-20,000 Jews, including the last members of the Judenrat, were shot outside of the town on the orders of Fritz Katzmann. After this ''aktion'' in January 1943 Judenrat was dissolved, that what remained of the ghetto was renamed ''Judenlager Lemberg'' (Jewish Camp Lw\u00f3w), thus formally redesigned as labor camp with about 12,000 ''legal'' Jews, able to work in German war industry and several thousands ''illegal'' Jews (mainly women, children and elderly) hiding in it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn the beginning of June 1943 Germans decided to finally end the existence of the Jewish quarter and its inhabitants. As Nazis entered the Ghetto they met some sporadic acts of armed resistance, but most of the Jews were trying to hide themselves in earlier prepared hideouts (so called ''bunkers''). In effect many buildings were suffused with gasoline and burned in order to \"flush out\" Jews from their hiding places. Some Jews managed to escape or to conceal themselves in the sewer system.\n\nBy the time that the Soviet  [[Red Army]] entered Lw\u00f3w on July 26, 1944, only a few hundred Jews remained in the city. Number varies from 200 to 900 (823 according to data of Jewish Provisional Committee in Lw\u00f3w, {{lang-pl|Tymczasowy Komitet \u017bydowski we Lwowie}} from 1945).\n\nAmong its notable inhabitants was [[Chaim Widawski]], who disseminated news about the war picked up with an illegal radio.<ref name=\"Trunk\">{{cite book|last1=Trunk|first1=Isaiah |last2=Shapiro|first2= Robert Moses|title=\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto: a history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugVsNrbMSx4C&pg=PR56&lpg=PR56&dq=%22chaim+widawski%22&source=bl&ots=-TinKMIz9u&sig=LMD4Zb4Egt-0XVhDT29vxGXQkek&hl=en&ei=kk4kTd7aFsH38AaOsqjLAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22chaim%20widawski%22&f=false|year=2006|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=978-0-253-34755-8|page=lvi}}</ref> Polish Olympic football player [[Leon Sperling]] was shot to death by the Nazis in the ghetto in December 1941.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kay Schaffer & Sidonie Smith|title=The Olympics at the Millennium: Power, Politics, and the Games|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=pg 61|year=2000|pages=318|isbn=0-8135-2820-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMzYdZpk8qMC&pg=PA61&dq=sperling+leon+jewish+sport}}</ref>  Nazi-hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]] was one of the best-known Jewish inhabitants of Lemberg Ghetto to survive the war (as his memoirs (The Executioners Among Us) indicate, he was saved from execution by a Ukrainian policeman), though he was later transported to a [[concentration camp]], rather than remaining in the ghetto.\n\n===Rescue===\nSome local gentiles attempted to aid and shelter the Jews.

When the 1st Mountain Division of the German 49th Army Corps took over the city, the gates of all NKVD prisons were opened and, within hours, the scale of Soviet murders revealed. A special commission was formed under SS Judge Hans Tomforde to make a report. Jews were ordered to start removing decomposing bodies from cells and cellars into prison yards. Over 10,000 dead were accounted for at Brygidki. At some prisons, the mountains of [[Putrefaction|putrefacting]] corpses reaching the basement ceilings forced the Germans to stop counting and wall-off the doors with brickwork. The German propaganda blamed the killings on the Jewish commissars and encouraged local Ukrainians to take their revenge &ndash; according to testimonies collected by the Germans, OUN-UPA members were in the majority of prisoners. In early July 1941 [[Einsatzgruppen|SS paramilitary death squads]] organized [[Lviv pogroms|the first pogrom]] against the Jews with the aid of [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]]. About 4,000 Jews were massacred by Ukrainian nationalists. In late July, another pogrom (known as [[Petliura]] Days), took the lives of more than 2,000 Jews.<ref name=\"ushmm-2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005171 |title=Lvov |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C. |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103305/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005171 |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"sztetl.org-2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/article/lwow/5,historia/?action=view&page=5 | title=Spo\u0142eczno\u015b\u0107 \u017cydowska przed 1989 \u2013 Ukraina / \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c (obw\u00f3d lwowski) | publisher=Muzeum Historii \u017byd\u00f3w Polskich [[Virtual Shtetl]] | work=Lw\u00f3w | accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref> Some, mostly Ukrainian scholars, argue that the pogroms were in retaliation for the [[NKVD prisoner massacres#Poland|NKVD prisoner massacres]] of approximately 7,000,<ref>Jerzy W\u0119gierski, ''Lw\u00f3w pod okupacj\u0105 sowieck\u0105 1939-1941'' , Warszawa 1991, Editions Spotkania, {{ISBN|83-85195-15-7}} p. 273.</ref> and up to 10,000 prisoners according to OUN,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book | url=http://www.ex.ua/get/4095342 | title=\"\u0428\u043e\u0430\" \u0443 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0456 | location=\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432 | publisher=\u041b\u0410 \u00ab\u041f\u0456\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0434\u0430\u00bb | year=2006 | accessdate=February 13, 2015 | author=[[Yevhen Nakonechny]] | pages=98\u201399 or 50 in current document (1/284 or 1/143 digitized) | isbn=966-8522-47-8 | format=[[DjVu]] | trans-title=\"Shoa\" in Lviv | via=\u0406\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f @ EX.UA, direct download (7.7 MB) }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{Unreliable source?|reason=Nakonechny is a known denialist.|date=May 2016}}</ref> including Polish, Jewish and Ukrainian intellectuals, political activists, and alleged common criminals held at Lw\u00f3w's three prisons comprising [[Brygidki]], \u0141\u0105ckiego Street and Zamarstynowska Street prison.

Thus, if we accept the Soviet and Jewish victims' version of the events rather than the version advanced by the Ukrainians (who were the actual rioters and perpetrated the murders), it was the Nazis who \"gave license\" to the UNO, the Ukrainian nationalists, the [[Ukrainian People's Militia]] (soon to become the [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]]), and Ukrainian citizenry (identified simply by yellow armbands), to conduct a full blown massacre in which at least 2000 Jewish men were killed.

Eventually, between 110,000 and 120,000 Jews were forced into the new ghetto. The living conditions there were extremely poor, coupled with severe overcrowding. For example, food rations allocated to the Jews were estimated to equal only 10% of the German and 50% of the Ukrainian or Polish rations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Filip Friedman, ''Zag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w lwowskich'' (Extermination of the Jews of Lw\u00f3w) {{OCLC|38706656}}.</ref>\n\nThe Germans established a Jewish police force called the ''J\u00fcdischer Ordnungsdienst Lemberg'' wearing dark blue Polish police uniforms from before World War II, but with the Polish insignia replaced by a [[Star of David|Magen David]] and the new letters J.O.L. in various positions on their uniform.

Their ranks numbered from 500 to 750 policemen.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The Jewish police force answered to the Jewish National city council known as the Judenrat, which in turn answered to the Gestapo.\n\n===Deportations===\nThe Lemberg Ghetto was one of the first to have Jews transported to the [[death camps]] as part of [[Aktion Reinhard]]. Between March 16 and April&nbsp;1, 1942, approximately 15,000 Jews were taken to the Klepar\u00f3w railway station and deported to the [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] [[extermination camp]]. Following these initial deportations, and death by disease and random shootings, around 86,000 Jews officially remained in the ghetto, though there were many more not recorded. During this period, many Jews were also forced to work for the Wehrmacht and the ghetto's German administration, especially in the nearby [[Janowska concentration camp|Janowska]] labor camp. On June 24\u201325, 1942, 2,000 Jews were taken to the labor camp; only 120 were used for forced labor, and all of the others were shot.\n\nBetween August 10\u201331, 1942, the \"Great Aktion\" was carried out, where between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews were rounded up, gathered at transit point placed in Janowska camp and then deported to Belzec. Many who were not deported, including local orphans and hospital inpatients, were shot. On September 1, 1942, the Gestapo hanged the head of Lw\u00f3w\u2019s [[Judenrat]] and members of the ghetto's Jewish police force on balconies of Judenrat's building at \u0141okietka street and Hermana street corner. Around 65,000 Jews remained while winter approached with no heating or sanitation, leading to an outbreak of typhus.\n\nBetween January 5\u20137, 1943, another 15,000-20,000 Jews, including the last members of the Judenrat, were shot outside of the town on the orders of Fritz Katzmann. After this ''aktion'' in January 1943 Judenrat was dissolved, that what remained of the ghetto was renamed ''Judenlager Lemberg'' (Jewish Camp Lw\u00f3w), thus formally redesigned as labor camp with about 12,000 ''legal'' Jews, able to work in German war industry and several thousands ''illegal'' Jews (mainly women, children and elderly) hiding in it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn the beginning of June 1943 Germans decided to finally end the existence of the Jewish quarter and its inhabitants. As Nazis entered the Ghetto they met some sporadic acts of armed resistance, but most of the Jews were trying to hide themselves in earlier prepared hideouts (so called ''bunkers''). In effect many buildings were suffused with gasoline and burned in order to \"flush out\" Jews from their hiding places. Some Jews managed to escape or to conceal themselves in the sewer system.\n\nBy the time that the Soviet  [[Red Army]] entered Lw\u00f3w on July 26, 1944, only a few hundred Jews remained in the city. Number varies from 200 to 900 (823 according to data of Jewish Provisional Committee in Lw\u00f3w, {{lang-pl|Tymczasowy Komitet \u017bydowski we Lwowie}} from 1945).\n\nAmong its notable inhabitants was [[Chaim Widawski]], who disseminated news about the war picked up with an illegal radio.<ref name=\"Trunk\">{{cite book|last1=Trunk|first1=Isaiah |last2=Shapiro|first2= Robert Moses|title=\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto: a history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugVsNrbMSx4C&pg=PR56&lpg=PR56&dq=%22chaim+widawski%22&source=bl&ots=-TinKMIz9u&sig=LMD4Zb4Egt-0XVhDT29vxGXQkek&hl=en&ei=kk4kTd7aFsH38AaOsqjLAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22chaim%20widawski%22&f=false|year=2006|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=978-0-253-34755-8|page=lvi}}</ref> Polish Olympic football player [[Leon Sperling]] was shot to death by the Nazis in the ghetto in December 1941.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kay Schaffer & Sidonie Smith|title=The Olympics at the Millennium: Power, Politics, and the Games|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=pg 61|year=2000|pages=318|isbn=0-8135-2820-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMzYdZpk8qMC&pg=PA61&dq=sperling+leon+jewish+sport}}</ref>  Nazi-hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]] was one of the best-known Jewish inhabitants of Lemberg Ghetto to survive the war (as his memoirs (The Executioners Among Us) indicate, he was saved from execution by a Ukrainian policeman), though he was later transported to a [[concentration camp]], rather than remaining in the ghetto.\n\n===Rescue===\nSome local gentiles attempted to aid and shelter the Jews.

Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz started to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqui arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding.

Luckily, Khubsoorat's father arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. \n\nSiddiqui also finds a good job offer for Nabeel. Nabeel is forced to attend the job interview by his wife Khoobsurat.

Every episode ends with the family being ripped off, or either of the men getting a beating from his wife for flirting with other women. The storyline starts off with Nabeel and Mehmood living in an apartment as bachelors and progresses to both of them marrying and having children.\n\nThe show is known to break the [[fourth wall]] all the time.\n\n====Episode 1-25 (Pre-marriage)====\nNabeel's childhood friend Ahmad moves abroad and tells Nabeel to look after his apartment. Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz started to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqui arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding. Nabeel tells him that the nikah is already read, and he gets really angry, later he is convinced to eat biryani which later calms down his mood.\n\n====Episode 26-82 (After marriage)====\n(Nabeel's mother becomes a regular cast member after episode 25.)\n\nSoon after the couples get married, Nabeel gets a call from Ahmad, who tells him he has found someone who will move into the apartment, and that they have two days to move out. Luckily, Khubsoorat's father arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. \n\nSiddiqui also finds a good job offer for Nabeel. Nabeel is forced to attend the job interview by his wife Khoobsurat. Nabeel later gets declined due to his demanding of a salary of 3-4 lakhs, saying he is made for much bigger things and will not work for anyone who does not see his true potential.\n\n====Episode 83-87 (Bulbulay in Dubai)====\nThe Bulbulay family goes on a trip to [[Dubai]] but without telling each other. Nabeel and Khoobsurat win a trip to [[Dubai]] from a lucky draw. Mehmood and Mumtaz go to [[Dubai]] for their honeymoon, with their own money. They happen to be booked into the same hotel. While walking in the hall, Nabeel and Mehmood bump into each other; they pretend that they don't know each other and rush back to their rooms. When both families have plans to go to the Oasis Mall, and both Mehmood and Nabeel are taking showers in their rooms, Khoobsurat and Mumtaz (Momo) wait for them in the hotel lobby and see each other clearly. Momo goes out of the hotel to avoid Khoobsurat and rushes off to the mall in a taxi.  Khoobsurat, Nabeel, and Mehmood go to find her. After they're reunited, they go to Ibn Battuta Mall the next day, where they meet FM radio producers and are offered jobs that don't work out.\n\n====Episode 88-100 (pre-parenthood)====\nWhile returning home from Dubai, Momo loses her bag at the airport.
