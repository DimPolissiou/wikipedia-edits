This inability to transport cholesterol out of cells leads to a deficiency of high-density lipoproteins in the circulation, which is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. Additionally, the buildup of cholesterol in cells can be toxic, causing cell death or impaired function. These combined factors lead to the signs and symptoms of Tangier disease.\n\nThis condition is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern, meaning that for the phenotype to appear, two copies of the gene must be present in the genotype.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Autosomal recessive: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}</ref> Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Tanger.gif|thumb|Diffuse hazy opacity of the right cornea in a patient with Tangier disease.]]\nTangier disease results in familial high-density lipoprotein deficiency.

After initial diagnosis with [[Niemann-Pick]] he was transferred to Dr. Louis Avioli at the National Cancer Institute. Donald Fredrickson, then head of the Molecular Disease Branch, became aware of the case and had a hunch that the original diagnosis was incorrect. In 1960, he traveled with Dr. Avioli to Tangier Island for further investigation. After finding the same symptom in Teddy's sister, an investigation revealed an extremely high number of [[foam cell]]s (cholesterol ester-laden macrophages) in not only the tonsils, but also in a wide-range of tissues, including the bone marrow and spleen. During a second trip to the island, they found that the family had very low levels of HDL cholesterol, suggesting a genetic basis of the disease.<ref>''When a Gene Makes You Smell Like A Fish'' - Published 1990 Received From the Tangier History Museum\"</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 12901\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|E|78|6|e|70}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|272.5}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 205400\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = D013631\n| Orphanet        = 31150\n}}\n* {{NLM|tangierdisease}}\n\n{{Lipidemias}}\n{{ABC transporter disorders}}\n\n[[Category:Lipid metabolism disorders]]\n[[Category:Autosomal recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Membrane transport protein disorders]]\n[[Category:Skin conditions resulting from errors in metabolism]]\n[[Category:Rare diseases]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}\n\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Tangier disease\n| synonyms        = '''Familial alpha-lipoprotein deficiency'''<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>{{rp|535}}\n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           = \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n\n'''Tangier disease'''  or [[hypoalphalipoproteinemia]] is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by a severe reduction in the amount of [[high density lipoprotein]] (HDL), often referred to as \"good [[cholesterol]]\", in the bloodstream.<ref>Rust S, Rosier M, Funke H, et al.

It was written by Carey, [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], [[Adonis Shropshire]] and [[Kendrick Dean]], and produced by the former two. \"I Stay in Love\" was released through [[Island Records]] on October 28, 2008, as the fourth and final single from the album.  Drawing influence from the  [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music genre, the song features a piano and keyboard-driven melody, and a strong accompanying drum-beat. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting \"her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track.\" She describes the old time she shared with her [[Romantic interest|love interest]]. She narrates that even though they said let go, and that she is aware that there is nothing left in their relationship, she still \"stays in love with him\".\n\n\"I Stay in Love\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many considering the song a strong ballad and a highlight from the album, while complimenting its production and piano-driven melody, despite criticizing the similarities to Carey's previous single, \"[[We Belong Together (Mariah Carey song)|We Belong Together]]\" (2005). The song performed weak commercially, becoming Carey's first single from the album to not chart on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], although peaking at number eighty-one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, and becoming Carey's fourteenth number one on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted and peaked at number ninety-five, and spent only one week on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nCarey performed \"I Stay in Love\" live on two high-profile televised events. First, on November 8, 2008, she was featured as a guest judge and musical performer of the [[The X Factor (UK series 5)|fifth season]] of the popular British talent competition, ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''.

She is featured as a dancer in Las Vegas, and is where she discovers her ex-lover has moved on.]]\nThe video, black-and-white, begins with Carey parking her antique automobile in desert. She gets out, with customized black boots with an 'M' on them, and as, she walks towards the camera, the vehicle explodes. As the music begins and the scene shifts to another where Carey applying her eye make-up and earrings. As a form of product placement, her fragrance is shown on a dresser in her [[Boudoir]]. As Carey finishes getting ready, scenery of Las Vegas is shown, before shifting to Carey, now dressed as a Vegas performer. As she walks down a runway dressed in white garments ad feathers, she catches the attention of a man. He turns out to be Carey's ex-lover, who in turn came to the show to meet with one of Carey's fellow dancers. As he caresses the female in the dressing room, Carey sees them, and walks by them, bumping into him purposely. Additional scenes are shown of Carey laying alone on the dark runway, apparently after the show has finished, as well as preparing herself for the show. During the second verse, the video then shows Carey driving down a highway in the desert, and as she drives, past memories of the pair are shown, holding each other intimately in a bed. She then pushes old gifts he had given her into the passengers seat, and pulls over the car, continuing the scene from the beginning of the video. After the car explodes, Carey tears off her necklace in despair, and begins to flail her arms in desperation. The video ends with Carey back at the show in Vegas during the finale, as glitter drops from the top of the stage. Carey, now back in the desert, looks for another ride, and gets into a black [[Cadillac]] [[Escalade]] driven by Nick Cannon.\n\n=== Reception and ''Luscious Pink'' commercial ===\nNick Levine from Digital Spy complimented the video, commenting that it managed \"to be both ridiculous and a little bit moving - quite an achievement.\"<ref name=\"digitally\"/> ''Entertainment Weekly'' writer Michael Slezak described Carey's boots as \"hot\", and considered the cinematography of the music video \"gorgeous\".

It was written by Carey, [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], [[Adonis Shropshire]] and [[Kendrick Dean]], and produced by the former two. \"I Stay in Love\" was released through [[Island Records]] on October 28, 2008, as the fourth and final single from the album.  Drawing influence from the  [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music genre, the song features a piano and keyboard-driven melody, and a strong accompanying drum-beat. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting \"her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track.\" She describes the old time she shared with her [[Romantic interest|love interest]]. She narrates that even though they said let go, and that she is aware that there is nothing left in their relationship, she still \"stays in love with him\".\n\n\"I Stay in Love\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many considering the song a strong ballad and a highlight from the album, while complimenting its production and piano-driven melody, despite criticizing the similarities to Carey's previous single, \"[[We Belong Together (Mariah Carey song)|We Belong Together]]\" (2005). The song performed weak commercially, becoming Carey's first single from the album to not chart on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], although peaking at number eighty-one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, and becoming Carey's fourteenth number one on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted and peaked at number ninety-five, and spent only one week on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nCarey performed \"I Stay in Love\" live on two high-profile televised events. First, on November 8, 2008, she was featured as a guest judge and musical performer of the [[The X Factor (UK series 5)|fifth season]] of the popular British talent competition, ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. Additionally, Carey performed it live at the [[American Music Award]]s, held on November 23, 2008. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by Carey's husband, [[Nick Cannon]], and features Carey as a dancer in a Las Vegas show at the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio Hotel and Casino Resort]]. Additionally, during the show and its preparations, Carey realizes that her ex-lover has found love with one of her fellow dancers, leading her to blow up the car he gave her, as well as its accompaniments in the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\n==Background and composition==\n\"I Stay in Love\" was written and produced by [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], with additional songwriting from [[Adonis Shropshire]] and [[Kendrick Dean]], for Carey's eleventh studio album, ''[[E=MC\u00b2 (Mariah Carey album)|E=MC\u00b2]]'' (2008). Carey produced the track for Maroon Entertainment and by Cox for Blabby Inc. Copyright is held by Rye Songs which is administered by Songs of Universal ([[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]])/W.B.M. Music Corp. O/D/O itself and Songs in the key of B Flat/Noontime South/EMI Foray Music O/B/O itself and Phoenix Ave. Publishing/Christian Combs Publishing (SESAC).

She is featured as a dancer in Las Vegas, and is where she discovers her ex-lover has moved on.]]\nThe video, black-and-white, begins with Carey parking her antique automobile in desert. She gets out, with customized black boots with an 'M' on them, and as, she walks towards the camera, the vehicle explodes. As the music begins and the scene shifts to another where Carey applying her eye make-up and earrings. As a form of product placement, her fragrance is shown on a dresser in her [[Boudoir]]. As Carey finishes getting ready, scenery of Las Vegas is shown, before shifting to Carey, now dressed as a Vegas performer. As she walks down a runway dressed in white garments ad feathers, she catches the attention of a man. He turns out to be Carey's ex-lover, who in turn came to the show to meet with one of Carey's fellow dancers. As he caresses the female in the dressing room, Carey sees them, and walks by them, bumping into him purposely. Additional scenes are shown of Carey laying alone on the dark runway, apparently after the show has finished, as well as preparing herself for the show. During the second verse, the video then shows Carey driving down a highway in the desert, and as she drives, past memories of the pair are shown, holding each other intimately in a bed. She then pushes old gifts he had given her into the passengers seat, and pulls over the car, continuing the scene from the beginning of the video. After the car explodes, Carey tears off her necklace in despair, and begins to flail her arms in desperation. The video ends with Carey back at the show in Vegas during the finale, as glitter drops from the top of the stage. Carey, now back in the desert, looks for another ride, and gets into a black [[Cadillac]] [[Escalade]] driven by Nick Cannon.\n\n=== Reception and ''Luscious Pink'' commercial ===\nNick Levine from Digital Spy complimented the video, commenting that it managed \"to be both ridiculous and a little bit moving - quite an achievement.\"<ref name=\"digitally\"/> ''Entertainment Weekly'' writer Michael Slezak described Carey's boots as \"hot\", and considered the cinematography of the music video \"gorgeous\".

Occasionally, Meckel's diverticulitis may present with all the features of [[acute appendicitis]]. Also, severe pain in the [[epigastric region]] is experienced by the person along with bloating in the epigastric and umbilical regions. At times, the symptoms are so painful that they may cause sleepless nights with acute pain felt in the foregut region, specifically in the [[epigastric]] and [[Navel|umbilical]] regions.\n\nIn some cases, bleeding occurs without warning and may stop spontaneously. The symptoms can be extremely painful, often mistaken as just stomach pain resulting from not eating or constipation.\n\nRarely, a Meckel's diverticulum containing ectopic pancreatic tissue can present with abdominal pain and increased serum amylase levels, mimicking acute pancreatitis.<ref>Darlington CD, Anitha GF.
