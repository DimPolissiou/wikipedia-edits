In 1891 Sherwood was proclaimed a local government area, being part of the Yeerongpilly Division established by Xlll the Divisional Board Act of 1879, which instituted local government to sparsely populated districts of Queensland. \nThe future Sherwood Shire contained an area of 22 square miles. The most northerly landmark, Oxley Point (Chelmer), was on the Brisbane River, 5 miles southwest of Brisbane. Reaching this point by the Brisbane River, involved a journey of twelve miles. The northern and western boundaries of the shire were the Brisbane River from the mouth of Oxley Creek to Woogaroo Creek in the south-west with Oxley Creek forming the eastern boundary.  The southern boundary was the upper reaches of the Oxley creek proceeding in a south-easterly direction to a point 1 mile above the mouth of Woogaroo Creek to its junction with the Brisbane River.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189286|title=Suburban Conservatism in the Sherwood Shire, 1891-1920|last1=Fones|first1=Ralph|date=1 January 1993|website=UQ eSpace|publisher=The University of Queensland|format=PDF|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> \n== Early History == \n==== Brisbane River ====\nThree shipwrecked and disoriented ticket of leave convicts, [[Thomas Pamphlett|Pamphlet]], Finnegan and Parsons in June 1823 were walking and were diverted by the river to the mouth of Oxley Creek. The discovery of two native canoes allowed them to cross the river and journey downstream.  [[John Oxley]] in December 1823 named the creek \u2018Canoe Creek\u2019 in recognition of the discovery, but in time it was renamed [[Oxley Creek]].<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nDuring the 1820s, the river was used by convicts to convey limestone from Limestone Hill ([[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]) to the penal settlement at [[Brisbane]]. From 1842, the river was the regular means of transport between Brisbane and Ipswich. The [[Seventeen Mile Rocks, Queensland|Seventeen Mile Rocks]] caused delays to laden vessels until the tide rose sufficiently to pass. From the 1860s, local selectors transported produce by river to Ipswich and Brisbane with tide times influencing the lifestyle of the early farmers. The steamer, \u2018The Fairy\u2019, provided a daily service between Brisbane and Oxley Point (Chelmer) until 1875, when it sank when colliding with another vessel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122071002 |title=THE SINKING OF THE FAIRY. |newspaper=[[Queensland Times, Ipswich Herald And General Advertiser]] |location=Queensland, Australia |date=22 April 1875 |access-date=17 March 2020 |page=4 |via=Trove }}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:StateLibQld_1_132532_Swimmers_cooling_off_in_the_Brisbane_River_at_Chelmer.jpg|thumb|StateLibQld 1 132532 Swimmers cooling off in the Brisbane River at Chelmer]]\n[[File:Major A.

Alexander Boyd, a farmer on Oxley Creek between 1864 and 1870, documented the common occurrence of high floods.The 1893 flood peaked 48 feet above the low tide mark at the Oxley Creek mouth, while upstream, the water rose 20 to 30 feet. The flooded Brisbane River destroyed houses, outbuildings along with farm animals destroying the railway bridge at Oxley Point. As a result of the flood, there was created a beach at Oxley Point, known as \u2018The Sands\u2019 becoming a popular swimming area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brisbanehistory.com/1893_brisbane_flood_intro.html|title=The 1893 flood|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 183451 Rural scene in Oxley Road, Chelmer, Brisbane, in 1906.jpg|thumb|Chelmer Swamp and Oxley Road]]\n\n==== Land Features ====\nSeveral hills, part of a system of low ridges extending from Spring Mountain sixteen miles to the south-west, ranged from 100 to 200 feet. Two of these hills in the now residential suburbs of Corinda and Oxley, lay close to a bend of the river downstream from [[Seventeen Mile Rocks, Queensland|Seventeen Mile Rocks]]. From these hills, several seasonal steams coursed towards Oxley Creek forming swamps and lagoons. The largest of these swamps was situated south of Oxley Point in present day [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]]. In the 1940s it was designated a municipal rubbish dump and the swamp was filled in. It lay where the current sporting grounds are now situated on the eastern side of the Chelmer Station. The hills and ridges on the southern boundary fed other streams such as Bullock Head Creek and Sandy Creek which combined to form Wolston Creek.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nExplorers and early selectors in the area recorded descriptions of the original flora. Oxley\u2019s made account of rich brush along the river, and the settlers of the 1860s referred to the dense scrub which clothed the river and creek banks and giant fig trees grew abundantly. The land\u2019s natural features influenced the lifestyle of the local Aborigines being from Jagarra tribe. This tribe\u2019s habitat lay along the Brisbane River, westwards almost to the Great Dividing Range. They referred to the land on either side of Oxley Creek as Bennawarra. The wildlife of swamps and attracted a section of the tribe known as Yerongapan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n  \nOccasionally, white contact with Aborigines led to clashes. In 1828, at Seventeen Mile Rocks, Aborigines attacked a boat from Limestone Hill, (Ipswich), killing a soldier and a convict. ln 1832, there was a massacre of a convict fishing party on the Brisbane River. By the 1860s, hostilities had ceased in the local area with white settlers being permitted to witness a [[corroboree]] near Oxley Creek. Early selectors found evidence of Aboriginal sites, believing a circular floating island in the large Oxley Point (Chelmer) swamp was a [[Bora (Australian)|bora ring]]. There were other reported areas used as borra rings one being between the Anglican Cemetery and Oxley Creek, and on the site of the [[Corinda railway station]]. Seventeen Mile Rocks at low tide provided crossing to [[Fig Tree Pocket, Queensland|Fig Tree Pocket]] for aboriginals, known to local Aborigines as Biami Yumba, \u2018the abode of the good spirits\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Early Exploration and Settlement ==\nThe white man first exploited the local area during the convict era, extracting pine and other building materials. Between 1825 and 1829, convicts quarried a portion of Corinda Hill for [[sandstone]], which was used in the construction of the [[Commissariat Store, Brisbane|Commissariat]] and [[The Old Windmill, Brisbane|Windmill]] in the penal colony. This quarry is located at the western point of Quarry Street. In 1851, Thomas Boyland leased land of what became the Shire, where he grazed cattle and sheep. The land became to then be known as Boyland\u2019s Pocket. After Queensland became a colony in 1859, Boyland declined and offer to purchase the land.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Corinda_to_Chelmer_Initial_Landowners_1860s.jpg|thumb|Corinda to Chelmer Initial Landowners 1860s]]\nIn May 1860, the land was subdivided into 25 portions. Each portion averaged 60 acres and initially sold for \u00a31 an acre, the area being eventually known as Oxley West. Between 1861 and 1864, 96 portions of land, were offered for sale in the area known as [[Oxley, Queensland|Oxley]]. In 1851, Lands Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Simpson leased 5,500 acres of land in the south-western section and purchased 640 acres where he erected his home [[Wolston House]], near Wolston Creek. After using the property as a horse stud, he returned to England in 1860 after the death of his nephew, James Ommaney, killed when thrown from a horse while riding on the Wolston property. A hill close to where the fatality occurred was named Mt. Ommaney. Grazier, Matthew Goggs senior, purchased Simpsons holding, and enlarged it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Corinda_Oxley_17_Mile_Rocks_Initial_Landowners.jpg|thumb|Initial Landowners in Corinda Oxley 17 Mile Rocks Area]]\nFollowing the subdivision of Oxley West, the subsequent land sale attracted both speculators and immigrant settlers. There were three categories of land purchasers during the 1860s: the speculators the immigrant; and immigrants arriving after most of the land had been sold. Speculators included Governor Bowen\u2019s secretary, [[John Bramston (Australian politician)|John Bramston]], who purchased land at Oxley Point and [[Charles Blakeney (politician)|Charles Blakeney]], Frank McDougall and [[Arnold Wienholt]], who served in either the upper or lower houses of the colonial legislature during the 1860s, but did not reside locally.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral immigrants paid their fare to Australia from Britain and on arrival received land orders which equaled the cost of their fares. However, the [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4604131 initial price of land], \u00a31 per acre rose to \u00a33, then to \u00a36, thereby reducing the purchasing power of land orders. Original land purchasers such as Alexander Boyd, William Gray and [[Arthur Francis (politician)|Arthur Francis]] settled on or near elevated land now known as Corinda Hill.\nDespite their farming intentions, Boyd, Gray and Francis lacked experience. Having persevered, their contribution lay outside the local area: Boyd, a school inspector; Gray, a Congregational minister; and Francis, a magistrate. Other original land purchasers being the Strong and Orr families, (Oxley West), and the Lucock and Brodie families, (Oxley), continued to earn their living in the local area as farmers. They instead chose the fertile river and creek flats.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThe third category of land purchaser acquired their land from either speculators or selectors. The Berry and [[Sinnamon Farm|Sinnamon]] families who financed their trip from Northern Ireland, initially worked for original settlers, William Gray and William Dart. Unmarried migrants, John Donaldson assisted government surveyor John Payne and [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/20762226 John A. Dunlop] labouring for William Gray. They gained an intimate knowledge of the area, and along with the Berry and Sinnamon families and other latecomers like the Nosworthy and Trotter families they farmed the fertile land adjoining the Brisbane River and Oxley Creek.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \n== Farming ==\nA number of selectors intended to [[Cotton|grow cotton]], as the [[American Civil War|American civil war]] disrupted shipments to British cotton manufacturers, but cash crops being bananas, vegetables and citrus fruits provided a reliable income. This idea of growing cotton was probably instilled in prospective immigrants by a Mr. Henry Jordan.

He resided in Sherwood and in 1890 he died being, buried at the Sherwood Cemetery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jordan-henry-3871|title=Jordan, Henry (1818\u20131890)|last=Morrison|first=A.

Initially Berry and Francis constructed primitive horse driven sugar mills; with Berry\u2019s mill employing up to sixty men.  Thomas Berry Junior also operated a steam driven mill.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nDuring 1872, the Oxley Creek district produced 270 tons of sugar from 244 acres of harvested cane. Only half the acreage under cane was harvested, because of the effect of severe winters and accompanying frosts. By 1874 however, a disease [[Puccinia melanocephala|referred to as rust]], caused problems having devastated cane crops in Southern Queensland and consequently cane farming in the Oxley Creek district waned. Local farmers, like Joseph Tainton depended on reliable cereal crops and by the 1890s, farmers had added [[Dairy|dairying]] to their activities, continuing into the early 1900s. The number of farmers was 58 by 1900.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThere were summer heatwaves of the 1860s which contrasted with the severe winters of the 1870s which had adversely affected cane farming. New settlers experienced the humid conditions typical of a semi-tropical climate. Thomas Berry senior noted the hot summer of 1863, when the temperature in Fahrenheit averaged 95 degrees in the shade and 135 degrees outside. There was a drought in 1877 and pressure was put on the State Government to build a water reservoir in the Sherwood area. In 1878 a reservoir was built to dam watercourses at the rear of the Oxley West (Sherwood) State School.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article181819614|title=OXLEY.|date=1 June 1878|newspaper=[[The Week]]|access-date=3 March 2020|location=Queensland, Australia|page=22|via=Trove}}</ref> The most severe drought occurred between 1899 and 1902 when many of the Sinnamon family\u2019s stock perished.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThe characteristics of generosity, stubbornness and self-determination were attributed to William Gray, who settled locally in 1861. This was matched by the reliability and trustworthiness of John Dunlop, an early farmer and bush carpenter. William Dart, a typical agriculturalist rose at 4 am and conscientiously worked until dark, clearing and developing his holding. [[Arthur Francis (politician)|Arthur M.

The tragic and depressing aspect of pioneering life involved the loss of children at birth or in the months following. This was put down to the lack of pre-natal care and the scarcity of milk which contributed to problems after the birth of a child. The loss of children in infancy had a prolonged effect on Angela Francis. She was motivated to establish a mid-wife training scheme for women in isolated areas. On another occasion, to prevent the possibility of naive female migrants succumbing to the adverse influences of urban life, Angela Francis trained several young females as governesses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1863 the residents presented a petition to government signed by 30 residents, called for the construction of a bridge over Oxley Creek which had the effect of halving the distance to the Brisbane markets. The creek had recently been bridged upstream at Oxley during the construction of a new road from Ipswich to Brisbane. The government responded by building another bridge from Sherwood over Oxley Creek in 1864, one mile from its mouth and in 1865, a road linked this bridge to Rocky Waterholes ([[Rocklea, Queensland|Rocklea]]).  In the mid-1870s, the installation of a vehicular ferry between Oxley Point ([[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]]) and [[Indooroopilly, Queensland|Indooroopilly]] provided another avenue of land transport to Brisbane.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Churches ==\n==== Moral Dilemma ====\nIn 1889, there was another petition concerning the hotel at Oxley. Rather than being a benefit to the local area, the hotel had operated as a change station for horses and a refreshment stop for coaches on [[Ipswich Road, Brisbane|Ipswich Road]]. In 1873, a new hotel was constructed at the intersection of present day Ipswich and Oxley Roads. In 1889, 23 residents, in their petition expressed their objection that the new Oxley hotel, in addition to its Liquor licence, also had a [[Music hall|Music Hall]] licence.

Several protestant churches continued to campaign for the prohibition of liquor to all the public.

Two of these hills in the now residential suburbs of Corinda and Oxley, lay close to a bend of the river downstream from [[Seventeen Mile Rocks, Queensland|Seventeen Mile Rocks]]. From these hills, several seasonal steams coursed towards Oxley Creek forming swamps and lagoons. The largest of these swamps was situated south of Oxley Point in present day [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]]. In the 1940s it was designated a municipal rubbish dump and the swamp was filled in. It lay where the current sporting grounds are now situated on the eastern side of the Chelmer Station. The hills and ridges on the southern boundary fed other streams such as Bullock Head Creek and Sandy Creek which combined to form Wolston Creek.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nExplorers and early selectors in the area recorded descriptions of the original flora. Oxley\u2019s made account of rich brush along the river, and the settlers of the 1860s referred to the dense scrub which clothed the river and creek banks and giant fig trees grew abundantly. The land\u2019s natural features influenced the lifestyle of the local Aborigines being from Jagarra tribe. This tribe\u2019s habitat lay along the Brisbane River, westwards almost to the Great Dividing Range. They referred to the land on either side of Oxley Creek as Bennawarra.

In 1828, at Seventeen Mile Rocks, Aborigines attacked a boat from Limestone Hill, (Ipswich), killing a soldier and a convict. ln 1832, there was a massacre of a convict fishing party on the Brisbane River. By the 1860s, hostilities had ceased in the local area with white settlers being permitted to witness a [[corroboree]] near Oxley Creek. Early selectors found evidence of Aboriginal sites, believing a circular floating island in the large Oxley Point (Chelmer) swamp was a [[Bora (Australian)|bora ring]]. There were other reported areas used as borra rings one being between the Anglican Cemetery and Oxley Creek, and on the site of the [[Corinda railway station]].

Between 1825 and 1829, convicts quarried a portion of Corinda Hill for [[sandstone]], which was used in the construction of the [[Commissariat Store, Brisbane|Commissariat]] and [[The Old Windmill, Brisbane|Windmill]] in the penal colony. This quarry is located at the western point of Quarry Street. In 1851, Thomas Boyland leased land of what became the Shire, where he grazed cattle and sheep. The land became to then be known as Boyland\u2019s Pocket. After Queensland became a colony in 1859, Boyland declined and offer to purchase the land.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Corinda_to_Chelmer_Initial_Landowners_1860s.jpg|thumb|Corinda to Chelmer Initial Landowners 1860s]]\nIn May 1860, the land was subdivided into 25 portions. Each portion averaged 60 acres and initially sold for \u00a31 an acre, the area being eventually known as Oxley West. Between 1861 and 1864, 96 portions of land, were offered for sale in the area known as [[Oxley, Queensland|Oxley]]. In 1851, Lands Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Simpson leased 5,500 acres of land in the south-western section and purchased 640 acres where he erected his home [[Wolston House]], near Wolston Creek. After using the property as a horse stud, he returned to England in 1860 after the death of his nephew, James Ommaney, killed when thrown from a horse while riding on the Wolston property.

There were three categories of land purchasers during the 1860s: the speculators the immigrant; and immigrants arriving after most of the land had been sold. Speculators included Governor Bowen\u2019s secretary, [[John Bramston (Australian politician)|John Bramston]], who purchased land at Oxley Point and [[Charles Blakeney (politician)|Charles Blakeney]], Frank McDougall and [[Arnold Wienholt]], who served in either the upper or lower houses of the colonial legislature during the 1860s, but did not reside locally.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral immigrants paid their fare to Australia from Britain and on arrival received land orders which equaled the cost of their fares.

Original land purchasers such as Alexander Boyd, William Gray and [[Arthur Francis (politician)|Arthur Francis]] settled on or near elevated land now known as Corinda Hill.\nDespite their farming intentions, Boyd, Gray and Francis lacked experience. Having persevered, their contribution lay outside the local area: Boyd, a school inspector; Gray, a Congregational minister; and Francis, a magistrate.

Thomas Berry Junior also operated a steam driven mill.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nDuring 1872, the Oxley Creek district produced 270 tons of sugar from 244 acres of harvested cane. Only half the acreage under cane was harvested, because of the effect of severe winters and accompanying frosts. By 1874 however, a disease [[Puccinia melanocephala|referred to as rust]], caused problems having devastated cane crops in Southern Queensland and consequently cane farming in the Oxley Creek district waned. Local farmers, like Joseph Tainton depended on reliable cereal crops and by the 1890s, farmers had added [[Dairy|dairying]] to their activities, continuing into the early 1900s.

There was a drought in 1877 and pressure was put on the State Government to build a water reservoir in the Sherwood area. In 1878 a reservoir was built to dam watercourses at the rear of the Oxley West (Sherwood) State School.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article181819614|title=OXLEY.|date=1 June 1878|newspaper=[[The Week]]|access-date=3 March 2020|location=Queensland, Australia|page=22|via=Trove}}</ref> The most severe drought occurred between 1899 and 1902 when many of the Sinnamon family\u2019s stock perished.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThe characteristics of generosity, stubbornness and self-determination were attributed to William Gray, who settled locally in 1861.

The tragic and depressing aspect of pioneering life involved the loss of children at birth or in the months following. This was put down to the lack of pre-natal care and the scarcity of milk which contributed to problems after the birth of a child. The loss of children in infancy had a prolonged effect on Angela Francis. She was motivated to establish a mid-wife training scheme for women in isolated areas. On another occasion, to prevent the possibility of naive female migrants succumbing to the adverse influences of urban life, Angela Francis trained several young females as governesses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1863 the residents presented a petition to government signed by 30 residents, called for the construction of a bridge over Oxley Creek which had the effect of halving the distance to the Brisbane markets. The creek had recently been bridged upstream at Oxley during the construction of a new road from Ipswich to Brisbane. The government responded by building another bridge from Sherwood over Oxley Creek in 1864, one mile from its mouth and in 1865, a road linked this bridge to Rocky Waterholes ([[Rocklea, Queensland|Rocklea]]).  In the mid-1870s, the installation of a vehicular ferry between Oxley Point ([[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]]) and [[Indooroopilly, Queensland|Indooroopilly]] provided another avenue of land transport to Brisbane.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Churches ==\n==== Moral Dilemma ====\nIn 1889, there was another petition concerning the hotel at Oxley.

In 1873, a new hotel was constructed at the intersection of present day Ipswich and Oxley Roads.

He has to choose between living up to others' expectation or his own dreams.\n\nA young musician named Gun ([[Prachaya Ruangroj]]), who was waiting for his true love, crosses paths with Aye ([[Chayanit Chansangavej]]). While their relationship is going well, he encounters a choice of leaving his old life and moving to [[Taiwan]] with Aye.\n\nAll three of them faced with their own problem until they'd been brought to a mysterious bar, \"Somewhere only we know\". Its owner, Tor ([[Singto Numchok]]), offers them a second chance to turn back time for a new choice to either follow their heart or listen to their head.

Tallahassee is home to two of Florida's major public universities, [[Florida State University]] and [[Florida A&M University]], as well as [[Tallahassee Community College]]. Together these institutions have a combined enrollment of more than 70,000 students annually, creating both economic and social effects.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Leon County}}\nOriginally part of [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]] and later [[Gadsden County, Florida|Gadsden County]], Leon County was created in 1824.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQ-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA32|year=1908|publisher=Florida Historical Society.|page=32}}</ref> It was named after [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] who was the first [[Europe]]an to reach Florida.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA185|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=185}}</ref>\n\nThe United States finally acquired this territory in the nineteenth century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

The layers above the basement are [[carbonate rock]] created from dying [[foraminifera]], [[bryozoa]], [[mollusk]]s, and [[coral]]s from as early as the [[Paleocene]], a period of ~66\u201455.8 Ma.<ref>[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/guerry/GLY4155/sp35/Fgs35.HTM Geology of Florida, University of Florida] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228042634/http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/guerry/GLY4155/sp35/Fgs35.HTM |date=2009-12-28 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Eocene]] (~55.8\u201433.9 Ma) and [[Oligocene]] (~33.9\u201423 Ma), the [[Appalachian Mountains]] began to uplift and the erosion rate increased enough to fill the [[Gulf Trough]] with [[quartz sand]]s, [[silt]]s, and [[clay]]s via rivers and streams. The first sedimentation layer in Leon County is the Oligocene [[Suwannee Limestone]] in the southeastern part of the county as stated by the [[United States Geological Survey]] and [[Florida Geological Survey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/sofia.usgs.gov/|title=South Florida Information Access (SOFIA) -- USGS Greater Everglades Ecosystems Science|website=archive.usgs.gov|accessdate=October 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Early Miocene]] (~23.03\u201415.7 Ma) sedimentation in Leon County is [[Hawthorn Group]], [[Torreya Formation]] and [[St. Marks Formation]] and found in the northern two-thirds of the county.\n\nThe [[Pliocene]] (~5.332\u20142.588 Ma) is represented by the [[Miccosukee Formation]] scattered within the Torreya Formation.\n\nSediments were laid down from the [[Pleistocene]] epoch (~2.588 million\u201412\u2009000 years ago) through [[Holocene]] epoch (~12,000\u2014present) and are designated [[Beach ridge and trail]] and [[undifferentiated sediments]].\n\n====Terraces and shorelines====\nDuring the Pleistocene, what would be Leon County emerged and submerged with each glacial and [[interglacial]] period.

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

He attended the local [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] with hopes of becoming a classical pianist. As his interest in [[jazz]] grew, he started playing in nightclubs in the late 1950s just as [[bossa nova]], a jazz-inflected derivative of [[samba]], was emerging. Mendes played with [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] (regarded as a mentor) and many U.S. jazz musicians who toured Brazil.\n\nMendes formed the Sexteto Bossa Rio and recorded ''[[Dance Moderno]]'' in 1961. Touring Europe and the United States, Mendes recorded albums with [[Cannonball Adderley]] and [[Herbie Mann]] and played [[Carnegie Hall]]. Mendes moved to the U.S. in 1964 and cut two albums under the Sergio Mendes & Brasil '65 group name with [[Capitol Records]] and [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nMendes became full partners with Richard Adler, a Brooklyn-born American who had previously brought Bossa Tr\u00e9s plus two dancers, Joe Bennett and a Brazilian partner, to appear on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1963.  He was also accompanied by Jobim; Flavio Ramos, and Aloisio Olivera, a record and TV producer from Rio.  The Musicians Union only allowed this group to appear on one TV show and make one club appearance ([[Basin Street East]]) before ordering them to leave the U.S.  When the new group Brasil '65 was formed, [[Shelly Manne]], [[Bud Shank]] and other West Coast musicians got Mendes and the others into the local musicians union.  Adler and Mendes formed Brasil '65, which consisted of [[Wanda S\u00e1]] and [[Rosinha de Valen\u00e7a]], as well as the Sergio Mendes Trio.  The group recorded albums for Atlantic and Capitol.\n\n===Brasil '66===\n[[File:Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66.png|thumb|right|Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66]]\nAll of Mendes' jazz albums for Atlantic Records, through [[Nesuhi Ertegun|Nesuhi]] and [[Ahmet Ertegun]], had low sales.  Richard Adler suggested that Mendes and the group sing in English, as well as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as Mendes had demanded, and Adler sought new English-based material such as \"[[Goin' Out of My Head]]\" by [[Teddy Randazzo]] and [[Bobby Weinstein]]. In order to sing these songs properly in English, Adler suggested that the group find two American girl singers who would sing in both English and Portuguese.  Adler called his friend Jerry Dennon and [[A&M Records]] founders [[Herb Alpert]] and [[Jerry Moss]], and arranged for an audition for Mendes' new group, which was dubbed \"Brasil '66.'\"  Alpert and Moss signed Mendes and his group to A&M Records.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Adler then went to the Ertegun Brothers at Atlantic Records and sought to have them release Mendes from his Atlantic Jazz contract.  Ahmet agreed to allow him to record albums under the name \"Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66\" with A&M.  Mendes was not at this meeting, only Adler and Ahmet Ertegun.  Alpert took over as producer for the A&M albums, and the group became a huge success with their first single, \"[[Mas Que Nada]]\", by writer [[Jorge Ben]].\n\nThe first album on A&M was ''[[Herb Alpert Presents (Sergio Mendes album)|Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66]]'', an album that went platinum based largely on the success of the single \"Mas Que Nada\" (a [[Jorge Ben]] cover) and the personal support of Alpert, with whom Mendes toured.\n\nThe original lineup of Brasil '66 was Mendes (piano), vocalists [[Lani Hall]] (later Alpert's wife) and [[Bibi Vogel]], Bob Matthews (bass), Jos\u00e9 Soares (percussion) and Jo\u00e3o Palma (drums). [[John Pisano]] played guitar.  This new line-up including Hansen then recorded two more albums between 1966\u20131968 (including the best-selling ''[[Look Around (Sergio Mendes album)|Look Around]]'' LP), before there was a major personnel change for their fourth album ''[[Fool on the Hill (album)|Fool on the Hill]]''.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nMendes often changed the lineup. Vocalist Bibi Vogel was replaced by [[Janis Hansen (singer)|Janis Hansen]], who in turn was replaced by [[Karen Philipp]]. Veteran drummer [[Dom Um Rom\u00e3o]] teamed with [[Rubens Bassini]] to assume percussionist duties. [[Claudio Slon]] joined the group as drummer in 1969, and went on to play with Mendes for nearly a decade. Sebasti\u00e3o Neto took over on bass and [[Oscar Castro-Neves]] took on guitar. These changes gave the group a more orchestral sound than before. In the early 1970s, lead singer Hall pursued a solo career and became Alpert's second wife.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> Some accounts claim that Mendes was upset with Alpert for years for \"stealing\" Hall away from his group.\n\nThough his early singles with Brasil '66 (most notably \"Mas Que Nada\") met with some success, Mendes really burst into mainstream prominence when he performed the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated \"[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\" on the [[40th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] telecast in April 1968. Brasil '66's version of the song quickly shot into the top 10,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> peaking at No. 4<ref name=\"Whitburn\">[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (1996). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 6th Edition ([[Billboard Publications]])</ref> and eclipsing [[Dusty Springfield]]'s version from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Mendes spent the rest of 1968 enjoying consecutive top 10 and top 20 hits with his follow-up singles \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\" and \"[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> From 1968 on, Mendes was arguably the biggest Brazilian star in the world<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> and enjoyed immense popularity worldwide, performing in venues as varied as stadium arenas and the [[White House]], where he gave concerts for presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> The Brasil '66 group appeared at the [[Expo '70|World Expo]] in Osaka, Japan in June 1970.\n\n===Middle career===\nMendes' career in the U.S. stalled in the mid-1970s, but he remained popular in South America and Japan. His two albums with [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] in 1973 and 1974 followed by several for [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] from 1975 on, found Mendes continuing to mine the best in American pop music and post-Bossa writers of his native Brazil, while forging new directions in soul with collaborators like [[Stevie Wonder]], who wrote Mendes' R&B-inflected minor hit \"The Real Thing\".\n\nIn 1983, he rejoined Alpert's A&M records and enjoyed success with a self-titled album and several follow-up albums, all of which received considerable adult contemporary airplay with charting singles. \"[[Never Gonna Let You Go (S\u00e9rgio Mendes song)|Never Gonna Let You Go]]\", featuring vocals by [[Joe Pizzulo]] and Leza Miller,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> equalled the success of his 1968 single \"The Look of Love\" by reaching No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart; it also spent four weeks atop the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary chart]].<ref name=\"Whitburn\"/> In 1984, he recorded the ''Confetti'' album, which had the hit songs \"Olympia\", which was also used as a [[1984 Summer Olympics#Music|theme song for the Olympic Games]] that year and \"Alibis\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The 1980s also saw Mendes working with singer [[Lani Hall]] again on the song \"No Place to Hide\" from the ''Brasil '86'' album, and as producer of her vocals on the title song for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.\n\nBy the time Mendes released his Grammy-winning Elektra album ''[[Brasileiro]]'' in 1992, he was the undisputed master of pop-inflected Brazilian jazz. The late-1990s [[lounge music]] revival brought retrospection and respect to Mendes' oeuvre, particularly the classic Brasil '66 albums.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:S\u00e9rgio Mendes.jpg|thumb|left|S\u00e9rgio Mendes 2008]]\n''[[Timeless (S\u00e9rgio Mendes album)|Timeless]]'' features a wide array of [[neo-soul]] and [[alternative hip hop]] guest artists, including [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Black Thought]], [[Jill Scott]], [[Chali 2na]] of [[Jurassic 5]], [[India.Arie]], [[John Legend]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Pharoahe Monch]].

Mendes has also collaborated with many artists through the years, including [[The Black Eyed Peas]], with whom he re-recorded in 2006 a version of his breakthrough hit \"[[Mas Que Nada]]\".\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\nMendes was born in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Brazil,<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=834}}</ref> the son of a physician. He attended the local [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] with hopes of becoming a classical pianist. As his interest in [[jazz]] grew, he started playing in nightclubs in the late 1950s just as [[bossa nova]], a jazz-inflected derivative of [[samba]], was emerging. Mendes played with [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] (regarded as a mentor) and many U.S. jazz musicians who toured Brazil.\n\nMendes formed the Sexteto Bossa Rio and recorded ''[[Dance Moderno]]'' in 1961. Touring Europe and the United States, Mendes recorded albums with [[Cannonball Adderley]] and [[Herbie Mann]] and played [[Carnegie Hall]]. Mendes moved to the U.S. in 1964 and cut two albums under the Sergio Mendes & Brasil '65 group name with [[Capitol Records]] and [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nMendes became full partners with Richard Adler, a Brooklyn-born American who had previously brought Bossa Tr\u00e9s plus two dancers, Joe Bennett and a Brazilian partner, to appear on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1963.  He was also accompanied by Jobim; Flavio Ramos, and Aloisio Olivera, a record and TV producer from Rio.  The Musicians Union only allowed this group to appear on one TV show and make one club appearance ([[Basin Street East]]) before ordering them to leave the U.S.  When the new group Brasil '65 was formed, [[Shelly Manne]], [[Bud Shank]] and other West Coast musicians got Mendes and the others into the local musicians union.  Adler and Mendes formed Brasil '65, which consisted of [[Wanda S\u00e1]] and [[Rosinha de Valen\u00e7a]], as well as the Sergio Mendes Trio.  The group recorded albums for Atlantic and Capitol.\n\n===Brasil '66===\n[[File:Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66.png|thumb|right|Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66]]\nAll of Mendes' jazz albums for Atlantic Records, through [[Nesuhi Ertegun|Nesuhi]] and [[Ahmet Ertegun]], had low sales.  Richard Adler suggested that Mendes and the group sing in English, as well as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as Mendes had demanded, and Adler sought new English-based material such as \"[[Goin' Out of My Head]]\" by [[Teddy Randazzo]] and [[Bobby Weinstein]]. In order to sing these songs properly in English, Adler suggested that the group find two American girl singers who would sing in both English and Portuguese.  Adler called his friend Jerry Dennon and [[A&M Records]] founders [[Herb Alpert]] and [[Jerry Moss]], and arranged for an audition for Mendes' new group, which was dubbed \"Brasil '66.'\"  Alpert and Moss signed Mendes and his group to A&M Records.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Adler then went to the Ertegun Brothers at Atlantic Records and sought to have them release Mendes from his Atlantic Jazz contract.  Ahmet agreed to allow him to record albums under the name \"Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66\" with A&M.  Mendes was not at this meeting, only Adler and Ahmet Ertegun.  Alpert took over as producer for the A&M albums, and the group became a huge success with their first single, \"[[Mas Que Nada]]\", by writer [[Jorge Ben]].\n\nThe first album on A&M was ''[[Herb Alpert Presents (Sergio Mendes album)|Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66]]'', an album that went platinum based largely on the success of the single \"Mas Que Nada\" (a [[Jorge Ben]] cover) and the personal support of Alpert, with whom Mendes toured.\n\nThe original lineup of Brasil '66 was Mendes (piano), vocalists [[Lani Hall]] (later Alpert's wife) and [[Bibi Vogel]], Bob Matthews (bass), Jos\u00e9 Soares (percussion) and Jo\u00e3o Palma (drums). [[John Pisano]] played guitar.  This new line-up including Hansen then recorded two more albums between 1966\u20131968 (including the best-selling ''[[Look Around (Sergio Mendes album)|Look Around]]'' LP), before there was a major personnel change for their fourth album ''[[Fool on the Hill (album)|Fool on the Hill]]''.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" />\n\nMendes often changed the lineup. Vocalist Bibi Vogel was replaced by [[Janis Hansen (singer)|Janis Hansen]], who in turn was replaced by [[Karen Philipp]]. Veteran drummer [[Dom Um Rom\u00e3o]] teamed with [[Rubens Bassini]] to assume percussionist duties. [[Claudio Slon]] joined the group as drummer in 1969, and went on to play with Mendes for nearly a decade. Sebasti\u00e3o Neto took over on bass and [[Oscar Castro-Neves]] took on guitar. These changes gave the group a more orchestral sound than before. In the early 1970s, lead singer Hall pursued a solo career and became Alpert's second wife.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> Some accounts claim that Mendes was upset with Alpert for years for \"stealing\" Hall away from his group.\n\nThough his early singles with Brasil '66 (most notably \"Mas Que Nada\") met with some success, Mendes really burst into mainstream prominence when he performed the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated \"[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\" on the [[40th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] telecast in April 1968. Brasil '66's version of the song quickly shot into the top 10,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> peaking at No. 4<ref name=\"Whitburn\">[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (1996). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 6th Edition ([[Billboard Publications]])</ref> and eclipsing [[Dusty Springfield]]'s version from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Mendes spent the rest of 1968 enjoying consecutive top 10 and top 20 hits with his follow-up singles \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\" and \"[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> From 1968 on, Mendes was arguably the biggest Brazilian star in the world<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> and enjoyed immense popularity worldwide, performing in venues as varied as stadium arenas and the [[White House]], where he gave concerts for presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> The Brasil '66 group appeared at the [[Expo '70|World Expo]] in Osaka, Japan in June 1970.\n\n===Middle career===\nMendes' career in the U.S. stalled in the mid-1970s, but he remained popular in South America and Japan. His two albums with [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] in 1973 and 1974 followed by several for [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] from 1975 on, found Mendes continuing to mine the best in American pop music and post-Bossa writers of his native Brazil, while forging new directions in soul with collaborators like [[Stevie Wonder]], who wrote Mendes' R&B-inflected minor hit \"The Real Thing\".\n\nIn 1983, he rejoined Alpert's A&M records and enjoyed success with a self-titled album and several follow-up albums, all of which received considerable adult contemporary airplay with charting singles. \"[[Never Gonna Let You Go (S\u00e9rgio Mendes song)|Never Gonna Let You Go]]\", featuring vocals by [[Joe Pizzulo]] and Leza Miller,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> equalled the success of his 1968 single \"The Look of Love\" by reaching No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart; it also spent four weeks atop the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary chart]].<ref name=\"Whitburn\"/> In 1984, he recorded the ''Confetti'' album, which had the hit songs \"Olympia\", which was also used as a [[1984 Summer Olympics#Music|theme song for the Olympic Games]] that year and \"Alibis\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The 1980s also saw Mendes working with singer [[Lani Hall]] again on the song \"No Place to Hide\" from the ''Brasil '86'' album, and as producer of her vocals on the title song for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.\n\nBy the time Mendes released his Grammy-winning Elektra album ''[[Brasileiro]]'' in 1992, he was the undisputed master of pop-inflected Brazilian jazz. The late-1990s [[lounge music]] revival brought retrospection and respect to Mendes' oeuvre, particularly the classic Brasil '66 albums.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:S\u00e9rgio Mendes.jpg|thumb|left|S\u00e9rgio Mendes 2008]]\n''[[Timeless (S\u00e9rgio Mendes album)|Timeless]]'' features a wide array of [[neo-soul]] and [[alternative hip hop]] guest artists, including [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Black Thought]], [[Jill Scott]], [[Chali 2na]] of [[Jurassic 5]], [[India.Arie]], [[John Legend]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Pharoahe Monch]].

The first six were garnered by the team's first coaching superstar, [[Fielding H. Yost]]. Yost directed his \"Point-a-Minute\" teams to four consecutive national titles from 1901 to 1904, amassing a record of 41\u20130\u20131. Yost also led Michigan to national titles in 1918 and 1923. Yost was instrumental in the creation of [[Michigan Stadium]] and designed it to permit its expansion to expand to a capacity of over 150,000. Yost's legacy also lives on with [[Yost Ice Arena]], where Michigan's men's ice hockey team plays their home games. Michigan football has won five more national titles since Yost permanently retired in 1926. The Wolverines won back-to-back titles under [[Harry Kipke]] in 1932 and 1933 and two more consecutive championships under [[Fritz Crisler]] and [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] in 1947 and 1948.

Rodriguez coached the Wolverines through the 2010 season, compiling a record of 15\u201322. Rodriguez would be followed by coach [[Brady Hoke]] who would go onto coach four seasons.

Michigan won the [[1902 Rose Bowl|inaugural Rose Bowl]] in 1902, the first college [[bowl game]] ever played. The Wolverine football program has claimed 11 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national titles]].<ref>[http://www.umich.edu/~bhl/athdept/football/misc/natchamp.htm University of Michigan Football \u2013 National Championships]. University of Michigan Athletics History (2002).</ref>\n\nMichigan's 11 national championships have come under the direction of five coaches. The first six were garnered by the team's first coaching superstar, [[Fielding H. Yost]]. Yost directed his \"Point-a-Minute\" teams to four consecutive national titles from 1901 to 1904, amassing a record of 41\u20130\u20131. Yost also led Michigan to national titles in 1918 and 1923. Yost was instrumental in the creation of [[Michigan Stadium]] and designed it to permit its expansion to expand to a capacity of over 150,000. Yost's legacy also lives on with [[Yost Ice Arena]], where Michigan's men's ice hockey team plays their home games. Michigan football has won five more national titles since Yost permanently retired in 1926. The Wolverines won back-to-back titles under [[Harry Kipke]] in 1932 and 1933 and two more consecutive championships under [[Fritz Crisler]] and [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] in 1947 and 1948. Michigan won its most recent national title under [[Lloyd Carr]] in 1997.\n\nMichigan's famous football coaches include: Yost, who came to Michigan from [[Stanford University]] in 1901, Fritz Crisler, who guided Michigan to a pair of Big Ten Conference championships and the 1947 national title, has his name carried by the home of Michigan men's basketball team, [[Bo Schembechler]] won 13 Big Ten titles in his 21 seasons as head coach between 1969 and 1989, the first in 1969 when he beat his friend and mentor [[Woody Hayes]], beginning of \"The Ten Year War\" era of the [[Michigan \u2013 Ohio State football rivalry]], Lloyd Carr won five Big Ten titles in his 13 seasons at the helm and posted a winning percentage of .753. His winning percentage of .779 in conference play trails only that of Schembechler in Michigan history, [[Rich Rodriguez]] succeeded Carr following his retirement in 2007. Rodriguez coached the Wolverines through the 2010 season, compiling a record of 15\u201322. Rodriguez would be followed by coach [[Brady Hoke]] who would go onto coach four seasons. Hoke would end with a record of 31-20. Alumnus [[Jim Harbaugh]] would replace Hoke for the 2015 season. \n\n====Rivalries====\n{{See also|Michigan\u2013Ohio State football rivalry}}\n[[File:MichiganStadium2010UConn.JPG|200px|left|thumb|A football game at [[Michigan Stadium]]]]\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; width:250px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center\" |'''Heisman Trophy winners'''\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''Player'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n----\n|-\n| 1940 || [[Tom Harmon]]\n|-\n| 1991 || [[Desmond Howard]]\n|-\n| 1997 || [[Charles Woodson]]\n|}\nMichigan has a major rivalry with [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]], considered one of the fiercest rivalries in American sports.
