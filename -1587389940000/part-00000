Most brands phased out the use of [[hydrogenated oil]]s and became [[trans fat]] free. Many brands launched refrigerator-stable margarine spreads that contain only 1/3 of the fat and calorie content of traditional spreads. Other varieties of spreads include those with added [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]s, low or no salt, added [[Phytosterol|plant sterols]] (claimed to reduce [[blood cholesterol]]), [[olive oil]], or certified [[vegan]] oils. In the early 21st century, manufacturers provided margarines in plastic [[squeeze bottle]]s to ease dispensing and offered pink margarine as a novelty.<ref name=rupp/>\n\n==Manufacturing process==\nThe basic method of making margarine today consists of emulsifying a blend of oils and fats from vegetable and animal sources, which can be modified using [[fractionation]], [[interesterification]] or [[hydrogenation]], with skimmed milk which may be fermented or soured, salt, citric or lactic acid, chilling the mixture to solidify it, and working it to improve the texture.<ref name=\"Food Industries Manual\" /><ref name=\"Clay1920\">{{cite book |title=Margarine |last=Clayton |first=William |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co. |year=1920 |url=https://archive.org/details/margarine00clayuoft}}</ref> Margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 to 90% fat, depending on dietary marketing and purpose (spreading, cooking or baking). The softer tub margarines are made with less hydrogenated, more liquid, oils than block margarines.<ref name=\"through the ages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/margarine.html|title=Margarine|last=Anon|work=Butter through the ages|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=10 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThree types of margarine are common:\n* Bottled liquid margarine to cook or top dishes.\n* Soft vegetable fat spreads, high in mono- or polyunsaturated fats, which are made from [[safflower]], [[sunflower]], [[soybean]], [[cottonseed]], [[rapeseed]], or [[olive]] oil.\n* Hard margarine (sometimes uncolored) for cooking or baking. \n\nTechnically, margarine is a form of [[Shortening]], but the commercial products sold as \u201cshortening\u201d are generally uncolored and do not taste like butter.  \n\nTo produce margarine, first oils and fats are [[Cooking_oil#Extraction|extracted]], e.g. by pressing from seeds, and then [[Cooking_oil#Refinement|refined]]. Oils may undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them. The milk/water mixture is kept separate from the oil mixture until the emulsion step. The fats are warmed so that they are liquid during the mixing process. The water soluble additives are added to the water or milk mixture, and [[emulsifiers]] such as [[lecithin]] are added to help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil. Other water soluble additives include powdered skim milk, salt, citric acid, lactic acid, and preservatives such as [[potassium sorbate]]. The fat soluble additives are mixed into the oil. These include carotenoids for coloring and antioxidants. Then the two mixtures are emulsified by slowly adding the oil into the milk/water mixture with constant stirring. Next, the mixture is cooled. Rapid chilling avoids the production of large crystals and results in a smooth texture. The product is then rolled or kneaded. Finally, the product may be aerated with nitrogen to facilitate spreading it.\n\n===Hydrogenation===\n{{Main|Hydrogenation}}\n[[File:H2forMargerin.png|thumb|320px|Partial [[hydrogenation]] of a typical plant oil to a typical component of margarine.  Most of the C=C double bonds are removed in this process, which elevates the melting point of the product.]]\nVegetable and animal fats are similar compounds with different [[melting point]]s. Fats that are liquid at room temperature are generally known as [[oil]]s. The melting points are related to the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds in the fatty acids components. A higher number of double bonds gives a lower melting point. Oils can be converted into substances solid at room temperature through hydrogenation.\n\nCommonly, natural oils are hydrogenated by passing [[hydrogen]] gas through the oil in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]], under controlled conditions.{{cn|date=March 2020}} The addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds (alkenic double C=C bonds) results in saturated C-C bonds, effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus \"hardening\" it. This is due to the increase in [[van der Waals' force]]s between the saturated molecules compared with the unsaturated molecules. However, as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet, the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture. Margarines made in this way are said to contain hydrogenated fat.<ref name=\"chemguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/alkenes/hydrogenation.html|title=The Hydrogenation of Alkenes:Margarine Manufacture|last=Clark|first=Jim|work=Chemguide: Helping you to understand Chemistry|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref> This method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as [[palladium]].<ref name=\"Food Industries Manual\" /> If hydrogenation is incomplete (partial hardening), the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the \"trans\" form.

Some widely grown vegetable oils, such as [[rapeseed]] (and its variant [[canola]]), [[sunflower]], [[safflower]], and [[olive]] oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fats.<ref name=fatoils /> During the manufacture of margarine, makers may convert some unsaturated fat into hydrogenated fats or [[trans fats]] to give them a higher melting point so they stay solid at room temperatures.\n\n* '''Omega-3 fatty acids''' {{Main article|Omega-3 fatty acids}} Omega-3 fatty acids are a family of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]]. This is one of the two [[essential fatty acid]]s, so called because humans cannot manufacture it and must get it from food. Omega-3 fatty acids are mostly obtained from [[oily fish]] caught in high-latitude waters. They are comparatively uncommon in vegetable sources, including margarine. However, one type of omega-3 fatty acid, [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA) can be found in some vegetable oils. [[Flax oil]] contains 30-50% of ALA, and is becoming a popular dietary supplement to rival fish oils; both are often added to premium margarines. An ancient oil plant, ''[[Camelina sativa]]'', has recently gained popularity because of its high omega-3 content (30-45%), and it has been added to some margarines. [[Hemp oil]] contains about 20% ALA. Small amounts of ALA are found in vegetable oils such as [[soybean oil]] (7%), rapeseed oil (7%) and [[wheat germ oil]] (5%).\n* '''Omega-6 fatty acids''' {{Main article|Omega-6 fatty acids}} Omega-6 fatty acids are also important for health. They include the essential fatty acid [[linoleic acid]] (LA), which is abundant in vegetable oils grown in temperate climates. Some, such as [[hemp]] (60%) and the common margarine oils corn (60%), cottonseed (50%) and sunflower (50%), have large amounts, but most temperate oil seeds have over 10% LA. Margarine is very high in omega-6 fatty acids. Modern Western diets are frequently quite high in omega-6 but very deficient in omega-3. The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is typically 5:1 to 10:1. Large amounts of omega-6 decreases the effect of omega-3. Therefore, it is recommended that the ratio in the diet should be less than 4:1, although the optimal ratio may be closer to 1:1.<ref name=\"ClearSpringsPress\">{{cite web |url=http://www.advance-health.com/efa.html |title=Omega-3 and Omega-6 Essential fatty Acids (EFA)|author=Clear Springs Press |year=2006 |accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Chico\">{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/agr/grassfedbeef/health-benefits/index.html |title=Grass Fed Beef \u2013 Health Benefits |author=Chico College of Agriculture |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706021024/http://www.csuchico.edu/agr/grassfedbeef/health-benefits/index.html |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Trans fat===\n{{Main article|Trans fat}}\n\nUnlike essential fatty acids, trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health besides providing calories.

If margarine were colored the same as butter, consumers would see it as being virtually the same thing as butter, and as a natural product. Bans on adding color became commonplace in the United States, Canada, and Denmark and, in some cases, those bans endured for almost 100 years.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] lifted the margarine ban in 1948 in the [[Margarine Reference]]. That year, Newfoundland negotiated its entry into the Canadian Confederation, and one of its three non-negotiable conditions for union with Canada was a constitutional protection for the new province's right to manufacture margarine.<ref>[https://www.gov.nl.ca/publicat/royalcomm/section2.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn 1950, as a result of a court ruling giving provinces the right to regulate the product, rules were implemented in much of Canada regarding margarine's color, requiring that it be bright yellow or orange in some provinces or colorless in others.

The law, \"to prevent deception in sales of butter,\" required retailers to provide customers with a slip of paper that identified the \"imitation\" product as margarine. This law proved ineffective, as it would have required an army of inspectors and chemists to enforce it. By the mid-1880s, the U.S. federal government had introduced a tax of two cents per pound, and manufacturers needed an expensive license to make or sell the product. The simple expedient of requiring oleo manufacturers to color their product distinctively was, however, left out of early federal legislation. But individual states began to require the clear labeling of margarine. The color bans, drafted by the butter lobby, began in the dairy states of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. In several states, legislatures enacted laws to require margarine manufacturers to add pink colorings to make the product look unpalatable, despite the objections of the oleo manufacturers that butter dairies themselves added [[annatto]] to their product to imitate the yellow of mid-summer butter.<ref name=Okun1986>\n{{cite book\n  |first=Mitchell|last=Okun\n  |title=Fair Play in the Marketplace: The First Battle for Pure Food and Drugs\n  |url=https://archive.org/details/fairplayinmarket0000okun|url-access=registration|year=1986\n  |publisher=Northern Illiinois University Press\n  |isbn=9780875801155\n  |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fairplayinmarket0000okun/page/254 254], 263, 266\n}}</ref>\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, eight out of ten Americans could not buy yellow margarine, and those who could had to pay a hefty tax on it. [[Counterfeit|Bootleg]] colored margarine became common, and manufacturers began to supply food-coloring capsules so the consumer could knead the yellow color into margarine before serving it. Nevertheless, the regulations and taxes had a significant effect: the 1902 restrictions on margarine color, for example, cut annual consumption in the United States from {{convert|120000000|to| 48000000|lb|t|-3}}.\n\nWith the coming of [[World War I]], margarine consumption increased enormously, even in countries away from the front, such as the United States. In the countries closest to the fighting, dairy products became almost unobtainable and were strictly [[rationing|rationed]]. The [[United Kingdom]], for example, depended on imported butter from Australia and New Zealand, and the risk of [[submarine]] attacks meant little arrived.\n\nThe long-running battle between the margarine and dairy lobbies continued: in the United States, the [[Great Depression]] brought a renewed wave of pro-dairy legislation; the [[Second World War]], a swing back to margarine. Post-war, the margarine lobby gained power and, little by little, the main margarine restrictions were lifted, the most recent states to do so being [[Minnesota]] in 1963 and [[Wisconsin]] in 1967.<ref>Dupre R: \"Margarine Regulation in North America Since 1886\", ''Journal of Economic History'', vol. 59, no. 2 (June 1999), pp. 353-371.</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Gerry|last=Strey|url=http://wisconsinhistory.org/wmh/pdf/wmh_autumn01_strey.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040902025018/http://wisconsinhistory.org/wmh/pdf/wmh_autumn01_strey.pdf|archivedate=2 September 2004|title=The \"Oleo Wars\": Wisconsin's Fight over the Demon Spread|work=Wisconsin Magazine of History|volume=85|number=1|date=Autumn 2001|pages=2\u201315}}</ref> Lois Dowdle Cobb (1889\u20131987) of [[Atlanta]], wife of the agricultural publisher [[Cully Cobb]], led the move in the United States to lift the restrictions on margarine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobb.msstate.edu/cobbfndr.html|title=The Founders of the Cobb Institute of Archaeology|publisher=msstate.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507013011/http://www.cobb.msstate.edu/cobbfndr.html|archive-date=2019-05-07|accessdate=16 July 2010}}</ref> Some unenforced laws remain on the books.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?browsePath=Title+21%2FChapter+9%2FSubchapter+IV%2FSec.+347&granuleId=USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapIV-sec347&packageId=USCODE-2010-title21&collapse=true&fromBrowse=true|title=21 U.S.C. 347 - Intrastate sales of colored oleomargarine|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2008-12-16-butter-crime_N.htm?csp=34\n|title=Yellow margarine: I Can't Believe It's Not Legal! |publisher=AP / USA Today |date=16 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[:Category:Margarine brands|Margarine brands (Category)]]\n* [[Spread (food)]]\n* [[Cooking oil]]\n* [[List of spreads]]\n* [[Amlu]]\n\n===Commercial oils===\n\n* [[Canola oil]]\n* [[Coconut oil]]\n* [[Colza oil]]\n* [[Corn oil]]\n* [[Olive oil]]\n* [[Palm oil]]\n* [[Soybean oil]]\n* [[Sunflower oil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071019005545/http://www.cjly.net/deconstructingdinner/090607.htm One-hour Radio Broadcast on Margarine in Canada (Deconstructing Dinner)]\n* [http://www.hyfoma.com/en/content/food-branches-processing-manufacturing/oil-margarines-sauces/margarine/ Hyfoma about margarine]\n* [http://www.imace.org International Margarine Association of the Countries of Europe]\n\n{{fats and oils}}\n{{Milk substitutes}}\n{{Vegetarianism}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1869 introductions]]\n[[Category:Animal product analogs]]\n[[Category:Cooking fats]]\n[[Category:French inventions]]\n[[Category:Spreads (food)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Semi-solid oily spread often used as a butter substitute}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}{{Infobox prepared food\n| name             = Margarine\n| image            = Margarine.jpg\n| image_size       = 250px\n| caption          = Margarine in a tub\n| alternate_name   = Marge, oleo, oleomargarine\n| country          = France\n| region           = \n| creator          = [[Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s]]\n| course           = \n| type             = Spread\n| served           = \n| main_ingredient  = Vegetable oils\n| variations       = \n| calories         = \n| other            = \n}}\n\n'''Margarine''' ({{IPAc-en|'|m|a:r|dZ|@|r|i:|n}}, <small>also</small> {{IPAc-en|uk|'|m|a:r|g|@|-|,_|,|m|a:r|g|@|'|r|i:|n|,_|,|m|a:r|dZ|@|-}}, {{IPAc-en|us|\u02c8|m|\u0251\u02d0r|d\u0292|\u0259|r|\u026a|n|audio=En-us-margarine.ogg}})<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John|authorlink=John C.

Most brands phased out the use of [[hydrogenated oil]]s and became [[trans fat]] free. Many brands launched refrigerator-stable margarine spreads that contain only 1/3 of the fat and calorie content of traditional spreads. Other varieties of spreads include those with added [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]s, low or no salt, added [[Phytosterol|plant sterols]] (claimed to reduce [[blood cholesterol]]), [[olive oil]], or certified [[vegan]] oils. In the early 21st century, manufacturers provided margarines in plastic [[squeeze bottle]]s to ease dispensing and offered pink margarine as a novelty.<ref name=rupp/>\n\n==Manufacturing process==\nThe basic method of making margarine today consists of emulsifying a blend of oils and fats from vegetable and animal sources, which can be modified using [[fractionation]], [[interesterification]] or [[hydrogenation]], with skimmed milk which may be fermented or soured, salt, citric or lactic acid, chilling the mixture to solidify it, and working it to improve the texture.<ref name=\"Food Industries Manual\" /><ref name=\"Clay1920\">{{cite book |title=Margarine |last=Clayton |first=William |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co. |year=1920 |url=https://archive.org/details/margarine00clayuoft}}</ref> Margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 to 90% fat, depending on dietary marketing and purpose (spreading, cooking or baking). The softer tub margarines are made with less hydrogenated, more liquid, oils than block margarines.<ref name=\"through the ages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/margarine.html|title=Margarine|last=Anon|work=Butter through the ages|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=10 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThree types of margarine are common:\n* Bottled liquid margarine to cook or top dishes.\n* Soft vegetable fat spreads, high in mono- or polyunsaturated fats, which are made from [[safflower]], [[sunflower]], [[soybean]], [[cottonseed]], [[rapeseed]], or [[olive]] oil.\n* Hard margarine (sometimes uncolored) for cooking or baking. \n\nTechnically, margarine is a form of [[Shortening]], but the commercial products sold as \u201cshortening\u201d are generally uncolored and do not taste like butter.  \n\nTo produce margarine, first oils and fats are [[Cooking_oil#Extraction|extracted]], e.g. by pressing from seeds, and then [[Cooking_oil#Refinement|refined]]. Oils may undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them. The milk/water mixture is kept separate from the oil mixture until the emulsion step. The fats are warmed so that they are liquid during the mixing process. The water soluble additives are added to the water or milk mixture, and [[emulsifiers]] such as [[lecithin]] are added to help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil. Other water soluble additives include powdered skim milk, salt, citric acid, lactic acid, and preservatives such as [[potassium sorbate]]. The fat soluble additives are mixed into the oil. These include carotenoids for coloring and antioxidants. Then the two mixtures are emulsified by slowly adding the oil into the milk/water mixture with constant stirring. Next, the mixture is cooled. Rapid chilling avoids the production of large crystals and results in a smooth texture. The product is then rolled or kneaded. Finally, the product may be aerated with nitrogen to facilitate spreading it.\n\n===Hydrogenation===\n{{Main|Hydrogenation}}\n[[File:H2forMargerin.png|thumb|320px|Partial [[hydrogenation]] of a typical plant oil to a typical component of margarine.  Most of the C=C double bonds are removed in this process, which elevates the melting point of the product.]]\nVegetable and animal fats are similar compounds with different [[melting point]]s. Fats that are liquid at room temperature are generally known as [[oil]]s. The melting points are related to the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds in the fatty acids components. A higher number of double bonds gives a lower melting point. Oils can be converted into substances solid at room temperature through hydrogenation.\n\nCommonly, natural oils are hydrogenated by passing [[hydrogen]] gas through the oil in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]], under controlled conditions.{{cn|date=March 2020}} The addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds (alkenic double C=C bonds) results in saturated C-C bonds, effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus \"hardening\" it. This is due to the increase in [[van der Waals' force]]s between the saturated molecules compared with the unsaturated molecules. However, as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet, the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture. Margarines made in this way are said to contain hydrogenated fat.<ref name=\"chemguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/alkenes/hydrogenation.html|title=The Hydrogenation of Alkenes:Margarine Manufacture|last=Clark|first=Jim|work=Chemguide: Helping you to understand Chemistry|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref> This method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as [[palladium]].<ref name=\"Food Industries Manual\" /> If hydrogenation is incomplete (partial hardening), the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the \"trans\" form.

Some widely grown vegetable oils, such as [[rapeseed]] (and its variant [[canola]]), [[sunflower]], [[safflower]], and [[olive]] oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fats.<ref name=fatoils /> During the manufacture of margarine, makers may convert some unsaturated fat into hydrogenated fats or [[trans fats]] to give them a higher melting point so they stay solid at room temperatures.\n\n* '''Omega-3 fatty acids''' {{Main article|Omega-3 fatty acids}} Omega-3 fatty acids are a family of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]]. This is one of the two [[essential fatty acid]]s, so called because humans cannot manufacture it and must get it from food. Omega-3 fatty acids are mostly obtained from [[oily fish]] caught in high-latitude waters. They are comparatively uncommon in vegetable sources, including margarine. However, one type of omega-3 fatty acid, [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA) can be found in some vegetable oils. [[Flax oil]] contains 30-50% of ALA, and is becoming a popular dietary supplement to rival fish oils; both are often added to premium margarines. An ancient oil plant, ''[[Camelina sativa]]'', has recently gained popularity because of its high omega-3 content (30-45%), and it has been added to some margarines. [[Hemp oil]] contains about 20% ALA. Small amounts of ALA are found in vegetable oils such as [[soybean oil]] (7%), rapeseed oil (7%) and [[wheat germ oil]] (5%).\n* '''Omega-6 fatty acids''' {{Main article|Omega-6 fatty acids}} Omega-6 fatty acids are also important for health. They include the essential fatty acid [[linoleic acid]] (LA), which is abundant in vegetable oils grown in temperate climates. Some, such as [[hemp]] (60%) and the common margarine oils corn (60%), cottonseed (50%) and sunflower (50%), have large amounts, but most temperate oil seeds have over 10% LA. Margarine is very high in omega-6 fatty acids. Modern Western diets are frequently quite high in omega-6 but very deficient in omega-3. The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is typically 5:1 to 10:1.

If margarine were colored the same as butter, consumers would see it as being virtually the same thing as butter, and as a natural product. Bans on adding color became commonplace in the United States, Canada, and Denmark and, in some cases, those bans endured for almost 100 years.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] lifted the margarine ban in 1948 in the [[Margarine Reference]]. That year, Newfoundland negotiated its entry into the Canadian Confederation, and one of its three non-negotiable conditions for union with Canada was a constitutional protection for the new province's right to manufacture margarine.<ref>[https://www.gov.nl.ca/publicat/royalcomm/section2.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn 1950, as a result of a court ruling giving provinces the right to regulate the product, rules were implemented in much of Canada regarding margarine's color, requiring that it be bright yellow or orange in some provinces or colorless in others.

The law, \"to prevent deception in sales of butter,\" required retailers to provide customers with a slip of paper that identified the \"imitation\" product as margarine. This law proved ineffective, as it would have required an army of inspectors and chemists to enforce it. By the mid-1880s, the U.S. federal government had introduced a tax of two cents per pound, and manufacturers needed an expensive license to make or sell the product. The simple expedient of requiring oleo manufacturers to color their product distinctively was, however, left out of early federal legislation. But individual states began to require the clear labeling of margarine. The color bans, drafted by the butter lobby, began in the dairy states of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. In several states, legislatures enacted laws to require margarine manufacturers to add pink colorings to make the product look unpalatable, despite the objections of the oleo manufacturers that butter dairies themselves added [[annatto]] to their product to imitate the yellow of mid-summer butter.<ref name=Okun1986>\n{{cite book\n  |first=Mitchell|last=Okun\n  |title=Fair Play in the Marketplace: The First Battle for Pure Food and Drugs\n  |url=https://archive.org/details/fairplayinmarket0000okun|url-access=registration|year=1986\n  |publisher=Northern Illiinois University Press\n  |isbn=9780875801155\n  |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fairplayinmarket0000okun/page/254 254], 263, 266\n}}</ref>\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, eight out of ten Americans could not buy yellow margarine, and those who could had to pay a hefty tax on it. [[Counterfeit|Bootleg]] colored margarine became common, and manufacturers began to supply food-coloring capsules so the consumer could knead the yellow color into margarine before serving it. Nevertheless, the regulations and taxes had a significant effect: the 1902 restrictions on margarine color, for example, cut annual consumption in the United States from {{convert|120000000|to| 48000000|lb|t|-3}}.\n\nWith the coming of [[World War I]], margarine consumption increased enormously, even in countries away from the front, such as the United States. In the countries closest to the fighting, dairy products became almost unobtainable and were strictly [[rationing|rationed]]. The [[United Kingdom]], for example, depended on imported butter from Australia and New Zealand, and the risk of [[submarine]] attacks meant little arrived.\n\nThe long-running battle between the margarine and dairy lobbies continued: in the United States, the [[Great Depression]] brought a renewed wave of pro-dairy legislation; the [[Second World War]], a swing back to margarine. Post-war, the margarine lobby gained power and, little by little, the main margarine restrictions were lifted, the most recent states to do so being [[Minnesota]] in 1963 and [[Wisconsin]] in 1967.<ref>Dupre R: \"Margarine Regulation in North America Since 1886\", ''Journal of Economic History'', vol. 59, no. 2 (June 1999), pp. 353-371.</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Gerry|last=Strey|url=http://wisconsinhistory.org/wmh/pdf/wmh_autumn01_strey.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040902025018/http://wisconsinhistory.org/wmh/pdf/wmh_autumn01_strey.pdf|archivedate=2 September 2004|title=The \"Oleo Wars\": Wisconsin's Fight over the Demon Spread|work=Wisconsin Magazine of History|volume=85|number=1|date=Autumn 2001|pages=2\u201315}}</ref> Lois Dowdle Cobb (1889\u20131987) of [[Atlanta]], wife of the agricultural publisher [[Cully Cobb]], led the move in the United States to lift the restrictions on margarine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobb.msstate.edu/cobbfndr.html|title=The Founders of the Cobb Institute of Archaeology|publisher=msstate.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507013011/http://www.cobb.msstate.edu/cobbfndr.html|archive-date=2019-05-07|accessdate=16 July 2010}}</ref> Some unenforced laws remain on the books.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?browsePath=Title+21%2FChapter+9%2FSubchapter+IV%2FSec.+347&granuleId=USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapIV-sec347&packageId=USCODE-2010-title21&collapse=true&fromBrowse=true|title=21 U.S.C. 347 - Intrastate sales of colored oleomargarine|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2008-12-16-butter-crime_N.htm?csp=34\n|title=Yellow margarine: I Can't Believe It's Not Legal! |publisher=AP / USA Today |date=16 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[:Category:Margarine brands|Margarine brands (Category)]]\n* [[Spread (food)]]\n* [[Cooking oil]]\n* [[List of spreads]]\n* [[Amlu]]\n\n===Commercial oils===\n\n* [[Canola oil]]\n* [[Coconut oil]]\n* [[Colza oil]]\n* [[Corn oil]]\n* [[Olive oil]]\n* [[Palm oil]]\n* [[Soybean oil]]\n* [[Sunflower oil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071019005545/http://www.cjly.net/deconstructingdinner/090607.htm One-hour Radio Broadcast on Margarine in Canada (Deconstructing Dinner)]\n* [http://www.hyfoma.com/en/content/food-branches-processing-manufacturing/oil-margarines-sauces/margarine/ Hyfoma about margarine]\n* [http://www.imace.org International Margarine Association of the Countries of Europe]\n\n{{fats and oils}}\n{{Milk substitutes}}\n{{Vegetarianism}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1869 introductions]]\n[[Category:Animal product analogs]]\n[[Category:Cooking fats]]\n[[Category:French inventions]]\n[[Category:Spreads (food)]]\n", "name_user": "79.66.214.170", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarine"}

All model designations from 707 through [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]] have been assigned, leaving 797 as the only 7X7 model name not assigned to a product.\n\nFor model numbers in the 707 to [[Boeing 777|777]] range, the model number consists of an airplane's model number, for example 707 or [[Boeing 747|747]], followed by a hyphen and three [[Numerical digit|digits]] that represent the series within the model, for example [[Boeing 707-320|707-320]] or [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]]. In aviation circles, a more specific model designation is sometimes used where the last two digits of the series designator are replaced by the two digit, alpha-numeric [[List of Boeing customer codes|Boeing customer code]], for example 747-121, representing a 747-100 originally ordered by [[Pan American World Airways]] (Boeing customer code 21) or 737-7H4, representing a [[Boeing 737-700|737-700]] originally ordered by [[Southwest Airlines]] (Boeing customer code H4). Codes do not change for aircraft transferred from one airline to another. Unlike other models, the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]] uses a single digit to designate the series, for example 787-8. This convention was followed in the development of the newest version of the 747, the 747-8, along with the [[Boeing 737 MAX|737 MAX]] and [[Boeing 777X|777X]] series.\n\nAdditional letters are sometimes appended to the model name as a suffix, including \"ER\" to designate an \"extended range\" version, such as the [[777-300ER]], or \"LR\" to designate a \"long range\" version, for example [[777-200LR]]. Other suffix designators include \"F\" for \"freighter\" ([[Boeing 747-400#747-400F|747-400F]]), \"C\" for \"convertible\" aircraft that can be converted between a passenger and freighter configuration ([[Boeing 727-100C|727-100C]]) and \"M\" for \"combi\" aircraft that are configured to carry both passengers and freight at the same time ([[Boeing 757#757-200M|757-200M]], [[Boeing 747#747-400M|747-400M]]). Passenger aircraft that are originally manufactured as passenger aircraft and later converted to freighter configuration by Boeing carry the suffix \"BCF\" designating a Boeing converted freighter ([[Boeing 747-400BCF|747-400BCF]]).\n\n===Aircraft in production or development===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:96%;\"\n|+'''Product list and details'''\n|- style=\"background:#069;\"\n!

All model designations from 707 through [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]] have been assigned, leaving 797 as the only 7X7 model name not assigned to a product.\n\nFor model numbers in the 707 to [[Boeing 777|777]] range, the model number consists of an airplane's model number, for example 707 or [[Boeing 747|747]], followed by a hyphen and three [[Numerical digit|digits]] that represent the series within the model, for example [[Boeing 707-320|707-320]] or [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]]. In aviation circles, a more specific model designation is sometimes used where the last two digits of the series designator are replaced by the two digit, alpha-numeric [[List of Boeing customer codes|Boeing customer code]], for example 747-121, representing a 747-100 originally ordered by [[Pan American World Airways]] (Boeing customer code 21) or 737-7H4, representing a [[Boeing 737-700|737-700]] originally ordered by [[Southwest Airlines]] (Boeing customer code H4). Codes do not change for aircraft transferred from one airline to another. Unlike other models, the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]] uses a single digit to designate the series, for example 787-8. This convention was followed in the development of the newest version of the 747, the 747-8, along with the [[Boeing 737 MAX|737 MAX]] and [[Boeing 777X|777X]] series.\n\nAdditional letters are sometimes appended to the model name as a suffix, including \"ER\" to designate an \"extended range\" version, such as the [[777-300ER]], or \"LR\" to designate a \"long range\" version, for example [[777-200LR]]. Other suffix designators include \"F\" for \"freighter\" ([[Boeing 747-400#747-400F|747-400F]]), \"C\" for \"convertible\" aircraft that can be converted between a passenger and freighter configuration ([[Boeing 727-100C|727-100C]]) and \"M\" for \"combi\" aircraft that are configured to carry both passengers and freight at the same time ([[Boeing 757#757-200M|757-200M]], [[Boeing 747#747-400M|747-400M]]). Passenger aircraft that are originally manufactured as passenger aircraft and later converted to freighter configuration by Boeing carry the suffix \"BCF\" designating a Boeing converted freighter ([[Boeing 747-400BCF|747-400BCF]]).\n\n===Aircraft in production or development===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:96%;\"\n|+'''Product list and details'''\n|- style=\"background:#069;\"\n!

Kani also received an [[Olivier Award]] nomination for his role in ''My Children!

These two plays were presented in repertory at the [[Edison Theatre]] for a total of 52 performances.\n\nIn 1987 Kani played [[Othello (character)|Othello]] in a performance of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play [[Othello|of the same name]] in South Africa, which was still under [[apartheid]]. \"At least I'll be able to kiss [[Desdemona]] without leaving a smudge,\" he said then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-26-20-bizarre-apartheid-moments |title=[From our archives&#93; 20 bizarre apartheid moments &#124; Opinion &#124; Analysis &#124; M&G |website=Mg.co.za |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2016-05-11}}</ref>\n\n''Nothing but the Truth'' (2002) was his debut as sole playwright and was first performed in the [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]] in [[Johannesburg]]. This play takes place in post-apartheid South Africa and does not concern the conflicts between whites and blacks, but the rift between blacks who stayed in South Africa to fight apartheid, and those who left only to return when the hated regime folded. It won the 2003 [[Fleur du Cap Awards]] for best actor and best new South African play. In the same year he was also awarded a special [[Obie Award]] for his extraordinary contribution to theatre in the United States.\n\nKani is executive trustee of the John Kani Theatre Foundation, founder and director of the John Kani Theatre Laboratory and chairman of the National Arts Council of SA. He starred as [[T'Chaka]] in the [[Marvel Studios]] blockbusters ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) and ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018).\n\nIn 2019, Kani voiced [[Rafiki (The Lion King)|Rafiki]] in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|CGI remake]] ''[[The Lion King]]'', directed by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/john-kani-rafiki-lion-king/|last1=Gonzalez |first1=Umberto|last2=Verhoeven|first2=Beatrice|title=\u2018Lion King\u2019 Rafiki Casting: John Kani, \u2018Civil War\u2019 Star, to Play Wise Baboon (Exclusive)|website=[[TheWrap]]|date=August 7, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKani's play, ''Kunene and the King'', a co-production for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and Fugard Theatre, played in the [[Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon|Swan Theatre]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in 2019 before transferring back to Cape Town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsc.org.uk/kunene-and-the-king/about-the-play|title=About the play &#124; Kunene and the King &#124; Royal Shakespeare Company|website=rsc.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Other recognition and awards==\nOn 20 February 2010, Kani received a [[South African Film and Television Awards|SAFTA]] Life Time award.

In the same year he was also awarded a special [[Obie Award]] for his extraordinary contribution to theatre in the United States.\n\nKani is executive trustee of the John Kani Theatre Foundation, founder and director of the John Kani Theatre Laboratory and chairman of the National Arts Council of SA.

Many species of [[bird]] migrate. [[Animal migration|Migration]] carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of [[food]]. It occurs mainly in the [[northern hemisphere]], where birds are funneled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] or the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nMigration of species such as [[stork]]s, [[European turtle dove|turtle doves]], and [[swallow]]s was recorded as many as 3,000 years ago by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] authors, including [[Homer]] and [[Aristotle]], and in the [[Book of Job]]. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and modern scientific studies have used techniques including [[bird ringing]] and [[Animal migration tracking#Satellite tracking|satellite tracking]] to trace migrants. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.\n\nThe [[Arctic tern]] holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling between [[Arctic]] breeding grounds and the [[Antarctic]] each year. Some species of tubenoses ([[Procellariiformes]]) such as [[albatross]]es circle the earth, flying over the southern oceans, while others such as [[Manx shearwaters]] migrate {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including [[altitudinal migration]]s on mountains such as the Andes and [[Himalayas]].\n\nThe timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length. Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars, the earth's magnetic field, and mental maps.\n\n==Historical views==\nIn the Pacific, traditional landfinding techniques used by Micronesians and Polynesians suggest that bird migration was observed and interpreted for more than 3000 years. In Samoan tradition, for example, Tagaloa sent his daughter Sina to Earth in the form of a bird, Tuli, to find dry land, the word tuli referring specifically to landfinding waders, often to the Pacific golden plover.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crowe |first1=Andrew |title=Pathway of the Birds: The Voyaging Achievements of M\u0101ori and their Polynesian Ancestors |date=2018 |publisher=Bateman |location=Auckland, New Zealand |isbn=9781869539610}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2019|reason=Popular science, non-expert author}} Records of bird migration were also known in Europe from at least 3,000 years ago as indicated by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writers [[Hesiod]], [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Aristotle]]. The Bible also notes migrations, as in the [[Book of Job]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Job|39:26|KJV}}</ref> where the inquiry is made: \"Is it by your insight that the hawk hovers, spreads its wings southward?\" The author of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|8:7|KJV}}</ref> wrote: \"Even the [[stork]] in the heavens know its seasons, and the [[European turtle dove|turtle dove]], the [[swift]] and the [[Crane (bird)|crane]] keep the time of their arrival.\"\n\nAristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of [[Scythia]] to marshes at the headwaters of the [[Nile]].

Massive numbers of large [[Bird of prey|raptors]] and storks pass through areas such as the [[Strait of Messina]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfbirds.com/mb/Features/messina/messina-0302.html|title=European Birding Hot Spot: The Strait of Messina, southern Italy|author=Corso, Andrea}}</ref> [[Gibraltar]], [[Falsterbo]], and the [[Bosphorus]] at migration times. More common species, such as the [[European honey buzzard]] ''Pernis apivorus'', can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the [[Central America]]n migratory bottleneck.

A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's [[magnetic field]], but does not know how far the journey will be. It does this through a [[radical pair mechanism]] whereby chemical reactions in special [[biological pigment|photo pigments]] sensitive to [[Color#Physics|short wavelengths]] are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a [[Boy Scout]] with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this \"mapping\" is done by [[magnetite]]s in the [[trigeminal system]], which tell the bird how strong the field is.

migration routes]]\n\n'''Bird migration''' is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south along a [[flyway]], between [[Breeding in the wild|breeding]] and [[wintering]] grounds. Many species of [[bird]] migrate. [[Animal migration|Migration]] carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of [[food]]. It occurs mainly in the [[northern hemisphere]], where birds are funneled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] or the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nMigration of species such as [[stork]]s, [[European turtle dove|turtle doves]], and [[swallow]]s was recorded as many as 3,000 years ago by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] authors, including [[Homer]] and [[Aristotle]], and in the [[Book of Job]]. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and modern scientific studies have used techniques including [[bird ringing]] and [[Animal migration tracking#Satellite tracking|satellite tracking]] to trace migrants. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.\n\nThe [[Arctic tern]] holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling between [[Arctic]] breeding grounds and the [[Antarctic]] each year. Some species of tubenoses ([[Procellariiformes]]) such as [[albatross]]es circle the earth, flying over the southern oceans, while others such as [[Manx shearwaters]] migrate {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including [[altitudinal migration]]s on mountains such as the Andes and [[Himalayas]].\n\nThe timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length. Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars, the earth's magnetic field, and mental maps.\n\n==Historical views==\nIn the Pacific, traditional landfinding techniques used by Micronesians and Polynesians suggest that bird migration was observed and interpreted for more than 3000 years. In Samoan tradition, for example, Tagaloa sent his daughter Sina to Earth in the form of a bird, Tuli, to find dry land, the word tuli referring specifically to landfinding waders, often to the Pacific golden plover.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crowe |first1=Andrew |title=Pathway of the Birds: The Voyaging Achievements of M\u0101ori and their Polynesian Ancestors |date=2018 |publisher=Bateman |location=Auckland, New Zealand |isbn=9781869539610}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2019|reason=Popular science, non-expert author}} Records of bird migration were also known in Europe from at least 3,000 years ago as indicated by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writers [[Hesiod]], [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Aristotle]]. The Bible also notes migrations, as in the [[Book of Job]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Job|39:26|KJV}}</ref> where the inquiry is made: \"Is it by your insight that the hawk hovers, spreads its wings southward?\" The author of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|8:7|KJV}}</ref> wrote: \"Even the [[stork]] in the heavens know its seasons, and the [[European turtle dove|turtle dove]], the [[swift]] and the [[Crane (bird)|crane]] keep the time of their arrival.\"\n\nAristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of [[Scythia]] to marshes at the headwaters of the [[Nile]].

Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat, or weather.  Sometimes, journeys are not termed \"true migration\" because they are irregular (nomadism, invasions, irruptions) or in only one direction (dispersal, movement of young away from natal area).

The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or [[Arctic]] summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south.  Of course, in the southern hemisphere the directions are reversed, but there is less land area in the far south to support long-distance migration.<ref name=\"newton\" />\n\nThe primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hummingbirds.net/migration.html | title=Migration Basics | publisher=Hummingbirds.net | accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>  Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] birds to feed their young. This helps [[Diurnality|diurnal]] birds to produce larger [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics.

However, many Holarctic [[wildfowl]] and [[Fringillidae|finch]] (Fringillidae) species winter in the [[North Temperate Zone]], in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the [[pink-footed goose]] migrates from [[Iceland]] to [[Great Britain|Britain]] and neighbouring countries, whilst the [[dark-eyed junco]] migrates from [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] and [[tundra climate|arctic climates]] to the contiguous United States<ref>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Dark-eyed_Junco/id Dark-Eyed Junco]</ref> and the American goldfinch <!--''Spinus tristis''--> from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the [[Southern United States|American South]] northwestward to [[Western Oregon]].<ref>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Goldfinch/id American Goldfinch]</ref> Some ducks, such as the [[garganey]] ''Anas querquedula'', move completely or partially into the tropics. The [[European pied flycatcher]] ''Ficedula hypoleuca'' also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.\n\nMigration routes and wintering grounds are both genetically and traditionally determined depending on the social system of the species.

Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers or towards suitable stopover habitat. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist of seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, a lack of stopover or feeding sites, or a lack of [[thermal column]]s (important for broad-winged birds).<ref name=\"Berthold\" /> Additionally, many migration routes are circuitous due to evolutionary history: the breeding range of [[Northern wheatear]]s ''Oenanthe oenanthe'' has expanded to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere, but the species still migrates up to 14,500&nbsp;km to reach ancestral wintering grounds in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] rather than establish new wintering grounds closer to breeding areas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bairlein F. |author2=Norris D.

Often quoted as the predecessor to traditional endorsed and/or contract [[advertising]]; which would instead be featuring celebrities, sponsored content has indubitably become more and more popular on social media platforms in recent years likely due to their cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, as well as the ability to receive instant feedback on the marketability of a product or service.\n\nA technique often used in traditional sponsored advertising is direct and indirect [[product placement]] (embedded marketing).

The underlying motives of sponsored content, however, is similar to that of native advertising- which is to inhibit a consumers' ad recognition by blending the ad into the native content of the platform, making many consumers unaware they are looking at an ad to begin with. The sponsored content on social media, like any other type of native advertising, can be difficult to be properly identified by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] because of their rather ambiguous nature.

Because the Federal Trade Commission can bring cases concerning practices that mislead a substantial minority of consumers, the authors conclude that many native advertising campaigns are probably deceptive under federal law. The authors also explain two theories of why native advertising is deceptive. First, the [[schema theory]] suggests that advertorials mislead by causing consumers not to trigger their innate skepticism to advertising. Second, advertorials also cause source-based misleadingness problems by imbuing advertising material with the authority normally assigned to editorial content.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://techscience.org/a/2015121503/|title = Native Advertising and Endorsement: Schema, Source-Based Misleadingness, and Omission of Material Facts|last = Hoofnagle|first = Chris|date = December 15, 2015|journal = Technology Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = December 19, 2015|first2 = Eduard|last2 = Meleshinsky}}</ref> Recognition percentages remain low even as native advertising has expanded in pervasiveness.

A category that rose to popularity through sites like [[Upworthy]] and [[BuzzFeed|Buzzfeed]]'s sponsored articles due to its effectiveness, In-Feed has also been the source of controversy for native marketing, as it is here the distinction between native and content marketing is typically asserted.\n# '''Search Ads:''' Appearing in the list of search results, these are generally found above or below the organic search results or in favorable position, having been sold to advertisers with a guarantee for optimal placement on the search engine page. They usually possess an identical appearance as other results on the page with the exception of disclosure aspects.\n# '''Recommendation Widgets:''' Although these ads are part of the content of the site, these do not tend to appear in like manner to the content of the editorial feed. Typically delivered through a widget, recommendation ads are generally recognizable by words which imply external reference, suggestions, and tangentially related topics. \"You might also like\"; \"You might like\"; \u201cElsewhere from around the web\"; \"From around the web\"; \"You may have missed\", or \"Recommended for you\" typically characterize these units.\n# '''Promoted Listings:''' Usually featured on websites that are not content based, such as e-commerce sites, promoted listings are presented in identical fashion with the products or services offered on the given site. Similarly justified as search ads, sponsored products are considered native to the experience in much the same way as search ads.\n# '''In-Ad (IAB Standard):''' An In-Ad fits in a standard IAB container found outside the feed, containing \"...contextually relevant content within the ad, links to an offsite page, has been sold with a guaranteed placement, and is measured on brand metrics such as interaction and brand lift.\"\n# '''Custom / Can't be Contained:''' This category is left for the odd ends and ads that do not conform to any of the other content categories.\n\n==Digital platforms==\nNative advertising platforms are classified into two categories, commonly referred to as \"open\" and \"closed\" platforms, but hybrid options are also utilized with some frequency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iprospect.com/native-advertising-a-powerful-performance-driver|title=Native Advertising: A Powerful Performance Driver|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sharethrough.com/2013/03/what-is-native-advertising/|title=What is native advertising?|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2013|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508054244/https://www.sharethrough.com/2013/03/what-is-native-advertising/|archive-date=May 8, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pando.com/2012/09/07/native-ads-part-deux-the-growth-of-open-native-advertising/|title=Native Ads Part Deux: The Growth of Open Native Advertising|date=September 7, 2014|author=Mark Chu Cheong|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''Closed platforms''' are formats created by brands for the purpose of promoting their own content intrinsically on their websites. Advertisements seen on these platforms will not be seen on others, as these ad types are generated for its sole use, and structured around exhibiting ad units within the confines of the website's specific agendas. Namely, advertisements distributed on closed platforms originate from the platform's brand itself. Popular examples include Promoted Tweets on Twitter, Sponsored Stories on Facebook, and TrueView Video Ads on [[YouTube]].\n\n'''Open platforms''' are defined by the promotion of the same piece of [[branded content]] across multiple platforms ubiquitously, but through some variation of native ad formats. Unlike closed platforms, the content itself lives outside any given website that it appears on, and is usually distributed across multiple sites by a third party company, meaning that the advertisements appearing on open platforms namely are placed there by an advertiser.\n\n'''Hybrid platforms''' allow the content publishing platforms to install a private marketplace where advertisers have the option to bid on the inventory of ad space either through direct sales or programmatic auction through what is known as [[Real-Time Bidding]] (RTB). Therefore, advertisements distributed on hybrid platforms are placed there by the platform itself, the space having been sold to an open platform advertiser.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Branded content]]\n* [[Content marketing]]\n* [[Contextual advertising]]\n* [[Digital marketing]] \n* [[Digital promotion]]\n* [[Integrated marketing communications]]\n* [[Listicle]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Online advertising]]\n* [[Product placement|Embedded marketing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [[John Oliver (comedian)|Oliver, John]], [http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/episodes/1/13-august-3-2014/video/ep-13-clip-native-advertising.html#/ ''Native Advertising''], ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', 3 August 2014\n* Khan, Fahad, \"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fahad-khan/toward-redefining-native-_b_3860826.html Toward (Re) Defining Native Advertising]\", Huffington Post, 3 September 2013.\n* {{cite web|last=Joel |first=Mitch |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/02/we-need-a-better-definition-of/ |title=We Need a Better Definition of \"Native Advertising\" |publisher=Harvard Business Review Blog |date=13 February 2013}}\n* [[Felix Salmon|Salmon, Felix]], [http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/04/09/the-disruptive-potential-of-native-advertising/ \"The disruptive potential of native advertising\"], ''Reuters'' blogpost, 9 April 2013.\n* Rice, Andrew, [http://nymag.com/news/features/buzzfeed-2013-4/ ''Does BuzzFeed know the secret?''], ''[[New York Magazine]]'', 7 April 2013\n\n[[Category:Advertising techniques]]\n[[Category:Advertising by type]]\n[[Category:Online advertising methods]]\n[[Category:Online advertising]]\n[[Category:Media manipulation]]\n[[Category:Promotion and marketing communications]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Sponsored content||Sponsored Content}}\n{{Internet Marketing}}\n\n'''Native advertising''' is a type of [[advertising]] that matches the form and function of the platform upon which it appears.

First, the [[schema theory]] suggests that advertorials mislead by causing consumers not to trigger their innate skepticism to advertising. Second, advertorials also cause source-based misleadingness problems by imbuing advertising material with the authority normally assigned to editorial content.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://techscience.org/a/2015121503/|title = Native Advertising and Endorsement: Schema, Source-Based Misleadingness, and Omission of Material Facts|last = Hoofnagle|first = Chris|date = December 15, 2015|journal = Technology Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = December 19, 2015|first2 = Eduard|last2 = Meleshinsky}}</ref> Recognition percentages remain low even as native advertising has expanded in pervasiveness.

A category that rose to popularity through sites like [[Upworthy]] and [[BuzzFeed|Buzzfeed]]'s sponsored articles due to its effectiveness, In-Feed has also been the source of controversy for native marketing, as it is here the distinction between native and content marketing is typically asserted.\n# '''Search Ads:''' Appearing in the list of search results, these are generally found above or below the organic search results or in favorable position, having been sold to advertisers with a guarantee for optimal placement on the search engine page. They usually possess an identical appearance as other results on the page with the exception of disclosure aspects.\n# '''Recommendation Widgets:''' Although these ads are part of the content of the site, these do not tend to appear in like manner to the content of the editorial feed. Typically delivered through a widget, recommendation ads are generally recognizable by words which imply external reference, suggestions, and tangentially related topics. \"You might also like\"; \"You might like\"; \u201cElsewhere from around the web\"; \"From around the web\"; \"You may have missed\", or \"Recommended for you\" typically characterize these units.\n# '''Promoted Listings:''' Usually featured on websites that are not content based, such as e-commerce sites, promoted listings are presented in identical fashion with the products or services offered on the given site. Similarly justified as search ads, sponsored products are considered native to the experience in much the same way as search ads.\n# '''In-Ad (IAB Standard):''' An In-Ad fits in a standard IAB container found outside the feed, containing \"...contextually relevant content within the ad, links to an offsite page, has been sold with a guaranteed placement, and is measured on brand metrics such as interaction and brand lift.\"\n# '''Custom / Can't be Contained:''' This category is left for the odd ends and ads that do not conform to any of the other content categories.\n\n==Digital platforms==\nNative advertising platforms are classified into two categories, commonly referred to as \"open\" and \"closed\" platforms, but hybrid options are also utilized with some frequency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iprospect.com/native-advertising-a-powerful-performance-driver|title=Native Advertising: A Powerful Performance Driver|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sharethrough.com/2013/03/what-is-native-advertising/|title=What is native advertising?|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2013|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508054244/https://www.sharethrough.com/2013/03/what-is-native-advertising/|archive-date=May 8, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pando.com/2012/09/07/native-ads-part-deux-the-growth-of-open-native-advertising/|title=Native Ads Part Deux: The Growth of Open Native Advertising|date=September 7, 2014|author=Mark Chu Cheong|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''Closed platforms''' are formats created by brands for the purpose of promoting their own content intrinsically on their websites. Advertisements seen on these platforms will not be seen on others, as these ad types are generated for its sole use, and structured around exhibiting ad units within the confines of the website's specific agendas. Namely, advertisements distributed on closed platforms originate from the platform's brand itself. Popular examples include Promoted Tweets on Twitter, Sponsored Stories on Facebook, and TrueView Video Ads on [[YouTube]].\n\n'''Open platforms''' are defined by the promotion of the same piece of [[branded content]] across multiple platforms ubiquitously, but through some variation of native ad formats. Unlike closed platforms, the content itself lives outside any given website that it appears on, and is usually distributed across multiple sites by a third party company, meaning that the advertisements appearing on open platforms namely are placed there by an advertiser.\n\n'''Hybrid platforms''' allow the content publishing platforms to install a private marketplace where advertisers have the option to bid on the inventory of ad space either through direct sales or programmatic auction through what is known as [[Real-Time Bidding]] (RTB). Therefore, advertisements distributed on hybrid platforms are placed there by the platform itself, the space having been sold to an open platform advertiser.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Branded content]]\n* [[Content marketing]]\n* [[Contextual advertising]]\n* [[Digital marketing]] \n* [[Digital promotion]]\n* [[Integrated marketing communications]]\n* [[Listicle]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Online advertising]]\n* [[Product placement|Embedded marketing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [[John Oliver (comedian)|Oliver, John]], [http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/episodes/1/13-august-3-2014/video/ep-13-clip-native-advertising.html#/ ''Native Advertising''], ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', 3 August 2014\n* Khan, Fahad, \"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fahad-khan/toward-redefining-native-_b_3860826.html Toward (Re) Defining Native Advertising]\", Huffington Post, 3 September 2013.\n* {{cite web|last=Joel |first=Mitch |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/02/we-need-a-better-definition-of/ |title=We Need a Better Definition of \"Native Advertising\" |publisher=Harvard Business Review Blog |date=13 February 2013}}\n* [[Felix Salmon|Salmon, Felix]], [http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/04/09/the-disruptive-potential-of-native-advertising/ \"The disruptive potential of native advertising\"], ''Reuters'' blogpost, 9 April 2013.\n* Rice, Andrew, [http://nymag.com/news/features/buzzfeed-2013-4/ ''Does BuzzFeed know the secret?''], ''[[New York Magazine]]'', 7 April 2013\n\n[[Category:Advertising techniques]]\n[[Category:Advertising by type]]\n[[Category:Online advertising methods]]\n[[Category:Online advertising]]\n[[Category:Media manipulation]]\n[[Category:Promotion and marketing communications]]\n", "name_user": "Enan1234", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAdvertising disclosure)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising"}

While it is true that the company has neither lost a [[Jet aircraft|jet airliner]] nor had any jet fatalities, it had eight fatal accidents and an aircraft shot down between 1927 and 1945, with the loss of 63&nbsp;people. Half of these accidents and the shoot-down occurred during World War&nbsp;II, when the Qantas aircraft were operating on behalf of Allied military forces. Post-war, it lost another four aircraft (one was owned by BOAC and operated by Qantas in a pooling arrangement) with a total of 21 people killed.
