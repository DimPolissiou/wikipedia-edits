A previously little known politician, Ciolacu came into national prominence when he was propped up by a former leader of the Social-Democratic Party to become deputy prime minister in 2018 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Mihai Tudose]]. Initially given this office in order to control Tudose and report of his activities to Liviu Dragnea<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.g4media.ro/cine-e-marcel-ciolacu-omul-care-vrea-sa-i-ia-locul-lui-dancila-la-sefia-psd.html|title=Cine e Marcel Ciolacu, omul care a mazilit-o pe D\u0103ncil\u0103|date=November 26, 2019|website=G4Media.ro}}</ref> (who had been unable to become prime minister himself and was wary of Tudose becoming a power player in the party), Ciolacu soon broke with Dragnea and became an ally of Tudose against Dragnea's leadership. When Tudose was forced to resign from office due to Dragnea's scheming, Ciolacu was marginalized. \n\nHe once more returned to prominence in 2019 after Liviu Dragnea had been convicted on corruption charges and sent to prison to serve a 3 years, 6 months sentence. With the Social Democrats still controlling a weak majority both in the Chamber and in the Senate, Ciolacu was propped up by the new leadership to become the President of the Chamber of Deputies, succeeding Dragnea himself just one day after the latter's incarceration. \n\nCiolacu maintained a low profile until the new leader of the PSD [[Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103]] was overwhelmingly defeated in the [[2019 Romanian presidential election]]. He joined with other PSD territory leaders to stage her downfall. On 25 November 2019, one day after the presidential election, Ciolacu visited D\u0103ncil\u0103 at home in order to convince her to step down as party leader. Seemingly unsuccessful, Ciolacu and other party leaders forced a special party committee, where D\u0103ncil\u0103 and the rest of her leadership were convinced to resign, lest they be excluded from the party. In the aftermath, Ciolacu was named leader of the party ad-interim, until a party congress would select a leader in February 2020. \n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\nMarcel Ciolacu was born in Buz\u0103u as the son of Ion Ciolacu, a career military pilot. In 1995 he is thought to have graduated the Ecological University of Bucharest, even though that university only received its authorization later that year. In 2008 he attended a programme in Security and National Defence at the National College of Defence in Bucharest, a university regarded in the Romanian press as \"diploma-factory\", where many other high and low-profile politicians have also received allegedly fraudulent degrees. In 2012 he completed a master's programme in the Management of the Public Sector at the [[National University of Political Studies and Public Administration]]. \n===Political career===\nCiolacu is a founding member of PSD, back when the party was known as the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], in the aftermath of the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]. During the early nineties, Ciolacu climbed the steps in local politics and by 1996 he became the second-in-command of the Youth Organization of the party. His political mentors were Senator Ion Vasile and Buz\u0103u Mayor Constantin Bo\u0219codeal\u0103. He remained little known, however, until the mid-2000s. In 2005 he was for several months the interim prefect of Buzau, after which he became, in turn, director of Urbis Serv and deputy mayor of Buzau (2008-2012). As deputy mayor, he was the close associate of Constantin Bo\u0219codeal\u0103, mayor of Buzau 1996-2016. Bo\u0219codeal\u0103 was convicted in 2015 for abuse of office during the period 2002-2008, by diverting public funds to a football team and other private companies of which he was a shareholder. Bo\u0219codeal\u0103 was condemned to 5 years imprisonment (later suspended) and prohibition from future public office. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnews.ro/ancheta-15757026-dosarul-gloria-buzau-constantin-boscodeala-primarul-buzaului.htm|title=Dosar finalizat in 2899 zile de la inceperea urmaririi penale Dosarul \"Gloria Buzau\" - Constantin Boscodeala, primarul Buzaului|website=hotnews.ro|}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://justitiecurata.ro/tovarasii-de-vanatoare-ai-lui-omar-hayssam-deschid-listele-parlamentare-la-buzau/|title=Tovar\u0103\u0219ii de v\u00e2n\u0103toare ai lui Omar Hayssam deschid listele parlamentare la Buz\u0103u|website=justitiecurata.ro/|date=2016}}</ref> \n\nCiolacu entered national politics in 2012 when he was first elected for a deputy seat in Parliament.

Dragnea, unable to become prime minister himself in the aftermath of the landslide victory of PSD in the [[2016 Romanian legislative election]] because of a suspended conviction for electoral fraud in 2012, was forced to find a suitable candidate for the office of prime minister, but he needed that someone to be loyal to him on a personal level. Grindeanu gradually broke off with Dragnea during his premiership, and by May 2017 the relationship between the two had deteriorated irreparably. As a consequence, Grindeanu was ordered to resign by Dragnea, an order which he refused, citing his responsibility as leader of the Executive, and not merely a party pawn. Unable to find other ways to replace Grindeanu, Dragnea ordered all other ministers in his cabinet to resign, which they did on 15 June, but not even this could make Grindeanu resign. Grindeanu was determined to fight with Dragnea until the end for control of both the party and his premiership. Nevertheless, a motion of no confidence instigated by PSD against its own government was successful. It passed with 241 votes, 8 votes more than the required 233 threshold. \n\nGrindeanu's ousting did not leave Dragnea's power unquestioned. Previously, the government had held a 295 majority, now it was reduced to a mere 241. For the first time, Dragnea was facing strong dissent in the party at the prospect that President [[Klaus Iohannis]] would not name another PSD member to become prime minister, electing instead to force early elections. Since the procedure of calling early elections laid down in the [[Constitution of Romania]] is complicated and difficult to trigger, and seeing PSD still had the necessary majority to form another government, the president decided to name Mihai Tudose, Dragnea's newest proposal as prime minister. Tudose was not, however, Dragnea's first choice and the PSD leader needed to find ways to control him better than Grindeanu, who had shown him that the office of prime minister was strong enough to allow its holder to wrestle his power in the party away from him. For this reason, Ciolacu was named deputy prime minister in the Tudose Cabinet, in order to become Dragnea's ears in the government. \n\nLike Tudose himself and Grindeanu before him, however, Ciolacu did not stay loyal to Dragnea for long. By the autumn of 2017, Ciolacu had entered Tudose's grasp and was now fully loyal to the prime minister. The relationship between Tudose and Dragnea started deteriorating rapidly, as had been the case with Grindeanu, but the two maintained publicly that there was no strain between them. By then, Ciolacu was firmly in the Tudose camp. \n\nTudose soon declared publicly that there was only one person whom he would not tolerate being removed from his cabinet: Ciolacu. In January 2018, Tudose attempted to take full control of his government by asking the resignation of his Interior minister, [[Carmen Dan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/politica/mihai-tudose-nu-mai-am-cum-sa-lucrez-cu-carmen-dan-857928|title=Premierul: Un ministru de interne care \u00ee\u015fi permite s\u0103 m\u0103 mint\u0103 \u00een halul \u0103sta, nu mai am ce lucra cu domnia sa|website=www.digi24.ro}}</ref>, a Dragnea mouthpiece and loyal lieutenant.

In October 2019, a motion of no confidence was initiated by the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-led opposition that successfully removed D\u0103ncil\u0103 from power, even though Ciolacu maintained that the [[D\u0103ncil\u0103 Cabinet]] would not fall. Subsequently, he reluctantly supported Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103's bid to the presidency of Romania but after her failure and her historically weak result, Ciolacu went on to take control of the party. On 25 November 2019, one day after the presidential election, Marcel Ciolacu personally visited D\u0103ncil\u0103 in her home and asked her to peacefully resign from the party's leadership, offering her a MP seat in the next [[Next Romanian legislative election|legislative election]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/politica/surse-baronii-psd-incearca-sa-o-convinga-pe-viorica-dancila-sa-demisioneze-maine-in-locul-ei-conducere-colectiva-1222214|title=Surse: Baronii PSD \u00eencearc\u0103 s\u0103 o conving\u0103 pe Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 s\u0103 demisioneze m\u00e2ine. \u00cen locul ei - conducere colectiv\u0103|website=www.digi24.ro}}</ref> \n\nHaving initially refused, D\u0103ncil\u0103 mulled the offer throughout the day, and on 26 November 2019 she decided to call another special party meeting where she hoped to convince the local party leaders, who were determined to oust her, to let her retain the leadership of the PSD. Ciolacu's plan was to force the dissolution of the entire leadership, so that he could become the party's interim leader. Several local party leaders resigned during the meeting in order to force D\u0103ncil\u0103's resignation. D\u0103ncil\u0103, after changing her mind twice throughout the day, decided to finally resign. Even though by the party's statute, the next in line to assume the interim leadership of the party was [[Eugen Teodorovici]], a D\u0103ncil\u0103 loyalist and former Minister of Finance, Ciolacu was able to become the party's leader by securing the dissolution of the entire party leadership.

A previously little known politician, Ciolacu came into national prominence when he was propped up by a former leader of the Social-Democratic Party to become deputy prime minister in 2018 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Mihai Tudose]]. Initially given this office in order to control Tudose and report of his activities to Liviu Dragnea<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.g4media.ro/cine-e-marcel-ciolacu-omul-care-vrea-sa-i-ia-locul-lui-dancila-la-sefia-psd.html|title=Cine e Marcel Ciolacu, omul care a mazilit-o pe D\u0103ncil\u0103|date=November 26, 2019|website=G4Media.ro}}</ref> (who had been unable to become prime minister himself and was wary of Tudose becoming a power player in the party), Ciolacu soon broke with Dragnea and became an ally of Tudose against Dragnea's leadership.

With the Social Democrats still controlling a weak majority both in the Chamber and in the Senate, Ciolacu was propped up by the new leadership to become the President of the Chamber of Deputies, succeeding Dragnea himself just one day after the latter's incarceration. \n\nCiolacu maintained a low profile until the new leader of the PSD [[Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103]] was overwhelmingly defeated in the [[2019 Romanian presidential election]]. He joined with other PSD territory leaders to stage her downfall. On 25 November 2019, one day after the presidential election, Ciolacu visited D\u0103ncil\u0103 at home in order to convince her to step down as party leader. Seemingly unsuccessful, Ciolacu and other party leaders forced a special party committee, where D\u0103ncil\u0103 and the rest of her leadership were convinced to resign, lest they be excluded from the party. In the aftermath, Ciolacu was named leader of the party ad-interim, until a party congress would select a leader in February 2020. \n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\nMarcel Ciolacu was born in Buz\u0103u as the son of Ion Ciolacu, a career military pilot. In 1995 he is thought to have graduated the Ecological University of Bucharest, even though that university only received its authorization later that year. In 2008 he attended a programme in Security and National Defence at the National College of Defence in Bucharest, a university regarded in the Romanian press as \"diploma-factory\", where many other high and low-profile politicians have also received allegedly fraudulent degrees. In 2012 he completed a master's programme in the Management of the Public Sector at the [[National University of Political Studies and Public Administration]]. \n===Political career===\nCiolacu is a founding member of PSD, back when the party was known as the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], in the aftermath of the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]. During the early nineties, Ciolacu climbed the steps in local politics and by 1996 he became the second-in-command of the Youth Organization of the party. His political mentors were Senator Ion Vasile and Buz\u0103u Mayor Constantin Bo\u0219codeal\u0103. He remained little known, however, until the mid-2000s. In 2005 he was for several months the interim prefect of Buzau, after which he became, in turn, director of Urbis Serv and deputy mayor of Buzau (2008-2012). As deputy mayor, he was the close associate of Constantin Bo\u0219codeal\u0103, mayor of Buzau 1996-2016. Bo\u0219codeal\u0103 was convicted in 2015 for abuse of office during the period 2002-2008, by diverting public funds to a football team and other private companies of which he was a shareholder. Bo\u0219codeal\u0103 was condemned to 5 years imprisonment (later suspended) and prohibition from future public office. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnews.ro/ancheta-15757026-dosarul-gloria-buzau-constantin-boscodeala-primarul-buzaului.htm|title=Dosar finalizat in 2899 zile de la inceperea urmaririi penale Dosarul \"Gloria Buzau\" - Constantin Boscodeala, primarul Buzaului|website=hotnews.ro|}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://justitiecurata.ro/tovarasii-de-vanatoare-ai-lui-omar-hayssam-deschid-listele-parlamentare-la-buzau/|title=Tovar\u0103\u0219ii de v\u00e2n\u0103toare ai lui Omar Hayssam deschid listele parlamentare la Buz\u0103u|website=justitiecurata.ro/|date=2016}}</ref> \n\nCiolacu entered national politics in 2012 when he was first elected for a deputy seat in Parliament.

The party's new leader, [[Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103]], the third prime minister named by Dragnea, was now looking for ways to cement her leadership of the party. For this, she sought the support of Ciolacu and other former opponents of Dragnea. Ciolacu accepted her offer to sponsor him as president of the Chamber of Deputies, succeeding Dragnea himself. On 29 May 2019, Ciolacu was voted the new head of the Chamber.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/politica/marcel-ciolacu-este-nou-presedinte-al-camerei-deputatilor-1139600|title=Marcel Ciolacu este noul pre\u0219edinte al Camerei Deputa\u021bilor|website=www.digi24.ro}}</ref> However, his election was won only narrowly and with the support of the PSD-breakaway party, [[PRO Romania]], and its member, former Prime Minister [[Mihai Tudose]].\n\n===Controversies===\n==== Mecan Construct Investigation ====\nIn 2009, the Court of Accounts Buzau found that a construction company in the municipality of Buzau, Urbis Serv, headed by Marcel Ciolacu between 2007 and 2008, caused an approximately \u20ac1.3 million overcharge for street and sidewalk construction projects through an illegal contract with a company owned by a party colleague.

In October 2019, a motion of no confidence was initiated by the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-led opposition that successfully removed D\u0103ncil\u0103 from power, even though Ciolacu maintained that the [[D\u0103ncil\u0103 Cabinet]] would not fall. Subsequently, he reluctantly supported Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103's bid to the presidency of Romania but after her failure and her historically weak result, Ciolacu went on to take control of the party. On 25 November 2019, one day after the presidential election, Marcel Ciolacu personally visited D\u0103ncil\u0103 in her home and asked her to peacefully resign from the party's leadership, offering her a MP seat in the next [[Next Romanian legislative election|legislative election]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/politica/surse-baronii-psd-incearca-sa-o-convinga-pe-viorica-dancila-sa-demisioneze-maine-in-locul-ei-conducere-colectiva-1222214|title=Surse: Baronii PSD \u00eencearc\u0103 s\u0103 o conving\u0103 pe Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 s\u0103 demisioneze m\u00e2ine. \u00cen locul ei - conducere colectiv\u0103|website=www.digi24.ro}}</ref> \n\nHaving initially refused, D\u0103ncil\u0103 mulled the offer throughout the day, and on 26 November 2019 she decided to call another special party meeting where she hoped to convince the local party leaders, who were determined to oust her, to let her retain the leadership of the PSD. Ciolacu's plan was to force the dissolution of the entire leadership, so that he could become the party's interim leader. Several local party leaders resigned during the meeting in order to force D\u0103ncil\u0103's resignation. D\u0103ncil\u0103, after changing her mind twice throughout the day, decided to finally resign. Even though by the party's statute, the next in line to assume the interim leadership of the party was [[Eugen Teodorovici]], a D\u0103ncil\u0103 loyalist and former Minister of Finance, Ciolacu was able to become the party's leader by securing the dissolution of the entire party leadership.
