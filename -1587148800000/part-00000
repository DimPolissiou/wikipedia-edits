The film stars [[Ralph Macchio]], [[Pat Morita]], [[Robyn Lively]], and [[Thomas Ian Griffith]] in his film debut. As was the case with the first two films in the series, it was directed by [[John G. Avildsen]] and written by [[Robert Mark Kamen]], with stunts choreographed by [[Pat E. Johnson]] and the music composed by [[Bill Conti]]. In the film, the returning John Kreese, with the help of his best friend Terry Silver, attempts to gain revenge on Daniel and Mr. Miyagi which involves hiring a ruthless martial artist and harming their relationship.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words -->\nIn September 1985, John Kreese, now broke and destitute, visits his [[Vietnam War]] comrade, Terry Silver, a wealthy businessman who founded the Cobra Kai and now owns a toxic-waste disposal business. Silver vows to personally help him get revenge on Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and re-establish the Cobra Kai, sending Kreese on vacation to [[Tahiti]] to rest and recuperate.\n\nUpon returning to [[Los Angeles]] from [[Okinawa]], Daniel and Miyagi discover that the South Seas apartment complex is being demolished, leaving Miyagi unemployed and Daniel homeless. They also learn that Daniel's mother, Lucille, is in [[New Jersey]] taking care of Daniel\u2019s ill uncle. Miyagi invites Daniel to stay at his house, and Daniel uses his college funds to help finance Miyagi's dream of opening a [[bonsai]] shop. As thanks, Miyagi makes him a partner at the business. When Daniel visits a pottery store across the street, he meets Jessica Andrews; though Daniel has a brief crush on her, she tells him that she has a boyfriend back home in [[Columbus, Ohio]], but they still remain friends.\n\nSilver hires Mike Barnes, a vicious [[karate]] prospect nicknamed \"Karate's Badboy\", to challenge Daniel at the upcoming All-Valley Karate Tournament. Silver sneaks into Miyagi's house to gather information and overhears Daniel telling Miyagi that he will not defend his title at the tournament. Barnes and his henchmen harass Daniel in an attempt to force him to enter the tournament, but Daniel still refuses, and Barnes departs in a rage. The next morning, as Daniel and Miyagi are practicing [[kata]], Silver interrupts and lies about John Kreese suffering a fatal [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after losing his students, and begs forgiveness for Kreese's behavior. Barnes and his henchmen return to make Daniel sign up for the tournament; when Daniel again refuses, a fight ensues until Miyagi arrives and fends off the three men. After driving Jessica home, Daniel and Miyagi return to find their stock of bonsai trees missing and a tournament application hanging in place.\n\nTo replace the missing trees, Daniel and Jessica decide to dig up and sell a valuable bonsai tree that Miyagi brought from [[Okinawa, Okinawa|Okinawa]], and planted halfway down a cliff. As they retrieve it, Barnes and his henchmen appear and shake their climbing ropes, leaving Daniel no choice but to sign up for the tournament. After pulling them back up, Barnes breaks the tree. Daniel returns to the shop with Miyagi's damaged bonsai, which Miyagi attempts to mend. Miyagi tells Daniel that he sold his truck to buy a new stock of trees, and refuses to train him for the tournament.\n\nSilver offers to \"train\" Daniel for the tournament at the Cobra Kai dojo with a series of brutal, violent, and offensive techniques. He derides Miyagi's kata forms and pressures Daniel to destroy a wooden practice dummy, causing him to bear several injuries in the process. Throughout his training, Daniel's frustration alienates him from Miyagi. While Daniel and Jessica are at a nightclub, Silver bribes a random man into provoking a fight with Daniel, who responds by punching the man and breaking his nose. Shocked by his aggressive behavior, Daniel apologizes and makes amends with Jessica and Miyagi.\n\nDaniel visits Silver to inform him that he will not compete at the tournament, but Silver reveals his true agenda to Daniel as Barnes enters the dojo. Daniel attempts to leave, but Kreese appears to intercept him, revealing himself to have been alive all along. After Barnes viciously attacks Daniel, Miyagi intervenes and easily defeats Kreese, Silver, and Barnes. Miyagi finally agrees to train Daniel after revealing their plot. They replant the healed bonsai and begin training.\n\nAt the tournament, Barnes reaches the final round to challenge Daniel. Silver and Kreese instruct Barnes to inflict serious damage on Daniel, keep the score a tie, and finally beat him in the sudden death round. Barnes gains the upper hand during the fight while physically taunting Daniel relentlessly. Although, Silver and Kreese praise Barnes for doing what Barnes has been told to, the referee tells Barnes that he made two illegal attacks against Daniel during the match and Barnes is one violation away from being disqualified from the tournament and Daniel winning by default. When the initial round concludes, Daniel wants to quit thinking he is unable to win, but Mr. Miyagi urges him to continue and perform kata which is what Mr. Miyagi taught Daniel just before the tournament. In the sudden death round, Daniel performs the kata. When Barnes lunges toward him, Daniel flips him to the ground and punches him in the ribs and wins the tournament. An enraged Barnes slams on the mat but in pain about the strike Daniel delivered while a disgusted Silver leaves a stunned Kreese while audience members throw Cobra Kai merchandise at Kreese, implying that Cobra Kai is finished forever. Additionally, due to the poor conduct by Silver, Kreese and Barnes, Cobra Kai is forever banned from competing in the All-Valley Tournament ever again. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi hug each other in celebration as the audience cheers wildly for Daniel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main article|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Robyn Lively]] as Jessica Andrews\n* [[Thomas Ian Griffith]] as Terry Silver\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]]\n* [[Sean Kanan]] as Mike Barnes\n* Jonathan Avildsen as Snake\n* [[Randee Heller]] as Lucille LaRusso\n* [[Pat E.

This made Neeraj very popular at the school.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nLuckily, a lot of Gujarati drama stalwarts followed his father's work and knew him personally, following which he got inclined towards Gujarati theatre. His love for theatre began at the age of 6, and when his father discovered this at the age of 13, he supported Vora and asked him to follow his passion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Acting===\nDuring his college days, he started working professionally as an actor and he received intercollegiate awards for drama.

Neeraj Vora, who had written the script, played the role to finish shooting. After seeing that scene, [[Anil Kapoor]] and [[Priyadarshan]] called him for ''[[Virasat (1997 film)|Virasat]]'', followed by Aamir for ''[[Mann (film)|Mann]]'' and several other projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0903423|title=Neeraj Vora|website=IMDb|access-date=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Drama===\nHis 1992 Gujarati play ''Aflatoon'', which was a superhit was adopted by [[Rohit Shetty]] for ''[[Golmaal: Fun Unlimited|Golmaal]]''. The play was written and directed by Neeraj Vora. It was adapted from Harsh Shivsharan's original Marathi play ''Ghar-Ghar''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Writing===\nAfter ''Circus'' in 1993, Neeraj Vora, [[Ashutosh Gowarikar]] and [[Deepak Tijori]] got together and made ''[[Pehla Nasha]]'', with Deepak Tijori as lead actor. Neeraj Vora was the writer and his he along with his brother directed music as Neeraj-Uttank.

The neighbourhood contains some groups of houses designed on [[Radburn principles]] to separate the inhabitants from traffic.<ref>Ten Years of Housing in Sheffield 1953-1963, The Housing Committee of the Corporation of Sheffield, April 1962</ref>\n\nGreenhill, generally pronounced \"grennell\" after new residents moved into the council estate after 1952,  or \"greenhill\" if you lived there before the post WW2 council estate was built, has a [[library]], [[primary education|primary]] school, [[church (building)|church]] and [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shops]]. There are also several [[bus]] routes which service the area including the 76, 86, 25, 25A, M17 and 293; the last service of which even goes into Derbyshire.\n\n===Chancet Wood===\n{{gbmapping|SK342821}}\n\n===Lowedges===\n'''Lowedges''' ({{gbmapping|SK351806}}) has some 3,000 homes and is located at the southern edge of the city on the boundary with [[Derbyshire]]. Lowedges is formed of council and private houses and flats as well as a good selection of shops and one public house, The Grennel Mower. It is home to the Transport Recreation Ground, Lowedges Fire Station, Greenhill Park, Greenhill and Bradway Youth Club, a Tenants' Meeting Hall, and three churches. Lowedges is a very vibrant community with over fifty activities for residents to engage in.\n\nIt is also home to The Terminus Initiative formed by the co-operation of four local churches to build an organisation capable of helping residents engage in projects and activities and provide help where needed. The Terminus Initiative runs The Terminus Cafe which is a regular meeting place for residents run by volunteers.  It is a world-renowned venture and has been visited by delegations from both UK based and overseas organisations.\n\nThe original name \"Lowedges\" was given to a farm located on the east side of the Sheffield to Derby Turnpike, now called [[Chesterfield Road (Sheffield)|Chesterfield Road]].  The farm itself was made up of several strips, located on both sides of the Turnpike which had in their names the word Lowedge. \"Lowedge\" in this context, is a description rather than a name, \"low\" being the Derbyshire name for a hill and \"edge\", meaning just that, a strip on the edge of a hill or low.  Renting some of these strips and bring them together into a single farming unit would have prompted the tenant, one William Webster, to call this new farm \"Lowedges\".\n\nA map of Greenhill derived from a survey made by W & J Fairbank in 1804 and 1805 shows and names the strips. Five of the seven strips rented by William Webster include the word Lowedge. In addition, the map depicts a \"Lowedge Lane\" running adjacent to the east of those strips.  In total there are nine fields shown with Lowedge in their name. The strip names were made up of an additional descriptor, such as \"Long\", \"Top\", \"Nether\", \"Upper\", \"Five Acre\" and \"Four Acre\". It is possible that more strips existed to the east of Lowedge Lane, that being the eastern extent of the map.  The map is available from Sheffield City Libraries.\n\nA single row of terrace houses along the west side of the southern part of [[Chesterfield Road (Sheffield)|Chesterfield Road]] forms one of the most southerly groups of buildings in Sheffield, and is the second place to carry the name Lowedges. This terrace of houses was built between 1905 and 1910 when Lowedges Farm still existed. When the terrace was built the name Lowedges became the name of this hamlet, including both the farm and the houses.\n\n[[Image:Kirkhill Home, Lowedges, Sheffield.JPG|thumb|Old people's home which has closed, Lowedges, Sheffield February 2014]]\n\nLocal Transport - [[First South Yorkshire]] 76 (Meadowhall\u2013Lowedges via City Centre) and 24 (Woodhouse\u2013Lowedges\u2013Bradway via City Centre but only goes to Bradway evenings and all day Sunday) terminate at Lowedges Terminus.

{"title_page": "Pakistani rug", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2015}}\nA '''Pakistani rug''' ('''Pak Persian Rug''' or '''Pakistani carpet''') is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally made in [[Pakistan]].\n\n== History ==\nThe art of weaving developed in the region comprising Pakistan at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at Moenjodaro and Harappa - ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley civilization]] - have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles.<ref name=\"indusvalleytextiles1\">Ancient Textiles of the Indus Valley Region, by Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, published 2004 (in Tana Bana: The woven soul of Pakistan by Koel Publications, Karachi), University of Wisconsin, Madison.

It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of [[List of Mughal emperors|the Mughal Dynasty]] in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, [[Babur]], extended his rule from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] and founded the [[Mughal Empire]]. Under the patronage of the Mughals, local craftsmen adopted [[Persian carpet|Persian]] techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] at that time (often called '''Lahore carpets''' today) made use of motifs and decorative styles found in [[Mughal architecture]].\n\n[[File:Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873]]\nDuring the Mughal period, the carpets made on the [[South Asia]] became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets boasted distinctive designs and high knot densities. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]], were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet-weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.\n\nThe carpets woven in Lahore were the first to reach European markets, including [[England]], as far back as Seventeenth century. During the British colonial era, prison weaving was established in district and female jails in cities such as [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]].

Excavations at Moenjodaro and Harappa - ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley civilization]] - have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nCarpet weaving may have been introduced into the area of present-day Pakistan as far back as the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the Afghan Ghaznavids and the Ghaurids. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of [[List of Mughal emperors|the Mughal Dynasty]] in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, [[Babur]], extended his rule from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] and founded the [[Mughal Empire]]. Under the patronage of the Mughals, local craftsmen adopted [[Persian carpet|Persian]] techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] at that time (often called '''Lahore carpets''' today) made use of motifs and decorative styles found in [[Mughal architecture]].\n\n[[File:Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873]]\nDuring the Mughal period, the carpets made on the [[South Asia]] became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets boasted distinctive designs and high knot densities. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]], were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet-weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.\n\nThe carpets woven in Lahore were the first to reach European markets, including [[England]], as far back as Seventeenth century. During the British colonial era, prison weaving was established in district and female jails in cities such as [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]]. Carpet-weaving outside of jails was revived after the [[Partition of India|independence]] when Pakistan's carpet-weaving industry flourished.<ref name=\"jailweaving\">Excerpts from the book, Oriental Rugs, by John Kimberly Mumford, published 1900, Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, New York.
