Founded in the 17th century as a plantation town, it now holds both local industry and commuter housing.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nVirginia was founded in the early 17th century,<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia.ie - History of Virginia|url=http://www.virginia.ie/index.php?page=history-of-virginia}}</ref> at Aghanure ({{Irish place name|Achadh an I\u00fair|field of the yew}}),<ref name=logainm/> during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and was named Virginia after [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]], the \"Virgin Queen.\"\n\nThe settlement was started where an English adventurer named John Ridgeway was granted [[the Crown]] patent in August 1612 to build a new town, situated upon the Great Road, approximately midway between the towns of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] and Cavan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/plantationpaper00whiggoog/plantationpaper00whiggoog_djvu.txt Hill, George (Rev.), \"Plantation papers: containing a summary sketch of the great Ulster plantation in the year 1610\"]</ref> The chosen site was, according to tradition, where a ruined ''[[O'Reilly|\u00d3 Raghallaigh]]'' (O'Reilly) castle stood, and was then described as Aghaler, a location once set within the ancient [[Lurgan]] parish townland of Ballaghanea. The patented conditions of settlement were to introduce [[English people|English]] settlers to the area and build the town to incorporated [[borough]] status. Ridgeway had difficulty in attracting sufficient English tradespeople and settler families into what was then regarded as a hostile territory outside of the protection of [[the Pale]], so he only managed to build a few wooden cabins and a corn mill near to the castle. His new town was situated close to the shores of [[Lough Ramor]].\n\nRidgeway passed the patent on to another Englishman, [[Captain (British Army)|Captain]] Hugh Culme, who already possessed lands beside [[Lough Oughter]] in County Cavan and had access to building timber. Culme persuaded the Plantation Commission to move the location of Virginia to its present location close to the Blackwater tributary river, whereupon he built a number of cabins for the settlers but still failed to meet the Commissions time frame for developing the town further before giving up on the task, probably for the same reasons as his predecessor.\n\n===The Plunketts===\nDuring November 1622, the Virginia estate came into the possession of [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall|The 10th Baron Killeen]] (who was created The 1st [[Earl of Fingall]] in 1628), who also held extensive lands around County Meath. Lord Killeen, who was a Catholic [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Peer of the realm|peer]] of [[Normans|Norman]] descent, whose family had come to Ireland in the twelfth century, undertook to complete the patented project.\nComplaints from the Virginia inhabitants about the lack of development progress reached the Commission by 1638 whereupon [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|The 2nd Earl of Fingall]] (who had succeeded his father in the [[earldom]] in 1637) was ordered to submit a substantial bond with the Commission's court, and to build the church in Virginia or face forfeiture of his County Cavan lands. The Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], [[William Bedell]], undertook to lay out the town in accordance with the Commission requirement. However, events which led to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]] enveloped Virginia causing widespread destruction and de-population. The summer of 1642 saw the outright destruction by government forces of the castle along with the burning of stocks of hay, corn and turf in a bid to punish the outlawed [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|Lord Fingall]] for his role in the [[Siege of Drogheda (1641)]].\n\nWhat remained of Virginia after the wars can be assessed through [[hearth tax]] records from the 1660s, indicating a small resident community. During the following century estate surveys were undertaken for the absentee landlord (exiled since the Williamite wars of 1688-91) which tell of a wayside Inn that existed since the earliest times (exact location unknown), operated then in 1727 by a Cornelius Donnellan and was frequented around that time by [[Jonathan Swift]] during his several excursions to Co. Cavan.\n\n===The Taylours===\nThe Virginia estate was eventually sold around the year 1750, on behalf of the Plunketts, to pay off mounting debts, with a new landlord family, the Taylors (later spelled as Taylour), taking over.  Virginia and its surrounding estate was particularly developed by [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Thomas Taylor]] (1724-1795), who built up the town and succeeded where others had failed. Taylor (who changed the spelling of the family surname to Taylour) succeeded his father in the [[baronetcy]] in 1757. The then Sir Thomas Taylour, 3rd [[Baronet|Bt.]], was created 1st [[Baron Headfort]] in 1760, and 1st [[Viscount Headfort]] in 1762. Lord Headfort was further advanced in the [[Peerage of Ireland|peerage]] to become The 1st [[Earl of Bective]] in 1766. It is recorded that [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Lord Bective]]'s great-grandfather, also a Thomas Taylor, was a [[cartographer]] who assisted [[Sir William Petty]] with the [[Down Survey]] during the previous century.\n\nThe Taylor (later Taylour) family had built a substantial mansion, [[Headfort House]] (now a school), beside [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] in the north of [[County Meath]]. The family (who were granted the title [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquis of Headfort]] in 1800) now turned their attention to making the unproductive lands around Virginia into profitable farms through land drainage and afforestation of low-lying areas, resulting also in increases in rent paid by the farm tenants. While this in itself was not unique among Irish landlords, an acre of land at twenty old pennies (20>240) became fifteen shillings (180>240) per acre before the end of the century with a premium paid by flax growers. The results of which brought employment and management to the Headfort estates and quickly led to the setting up of markets and fairs in Virginia where local produce including flax yarn and linen was traded on the streets. Virginia's population doubled  between the census years of 1821 to 1841, and there was rapid construction in the town, leading to the Main Street as it is seen today. Successive [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquesses of Headfort]] created their own private demesne and a hunting lodge (now Park Hotel) overlooking Lough Ramor.\n\n===Famine and emigration===\nThe [[Great Hunger]], caused by successive failures in the potato crop, brought with it extreme hardship for the poorer classes, with death due to diseases like [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], prevalent due to poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water and other poor living conditions. Starvation, which impacted many parts of the country, was averted in Virginia due to the efforts of the local Famine Relief Committee, who made extra rations of Indian meal available in return for hard labour, this included women and children breaking stones for making roads and the building of the local Catholic church which took place during 1845 on lands donated by the landlord.\n\nIn subsequent years Virginia prospered with the introduction of a butter market in 1856, followed by the opening of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) line between Kells and [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] in March 1863. Cattle and livestock could then be moved for export, however this also meant that produce such as coal and beer could be transported from the larger towns into rural areas which led to the closure of the local malt brewery and several bakeries in the town.\n\nPerhaps the most famous (and controversial) Virginia emigrant was [[General (United States)|General]] [[Philip H. Sheridan]] (1831-1888), whose parents came from nearby [[Killinkere]], left Ireland around 1830 and settled in America. Sheridan achieved success, and notoriety, through a military career, particularly during the [[American Civil War]]. President Lincoln stated, \"this Sheridan is a little Irishman, but a big fighter\", eventually became commanding General of the US Army and had many honours bestowed upon him.\n\nThe closure of the Virginia Roads railway station, and GNR line, in 1958, came about as Ireland's population fell to its lowest levels - the 1951 census lists Virginia with a population of just 297 persons.\n\n===Modern development===\nIn 2007 the local Development Association submitted a proposal to have a new Regional Hospital built near Virginia, on a site owned by [[Cavan County Council]]. Although widely supported by the community and the region's political representatives, the bid was abandoned with a government announcement that there was not a 'red penny' available for such a project. Road transport links to Virginia have seen some improvement since the opening during 2010 of the M3 motorway linking Virginia to Dublin. This has led to a continued rise in local developments, with many new houses and commercial business being built.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Virginia Cavan.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Virginia by Lough Ramor]]\nThe town is situated close to [[Lough Ramor]], one of the larger lakes in County Cavan, stretching approximately 7&nbsp;km in length by 1&nbsp;km at the narrowest point, and feeding into the Blackwater and Boyne river systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=The size and length of Lough Ramor and what rivers it feeds in to|url=http://virginia.ie/index.php?page=about-virginia}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nVirginia is on the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 route]] approximately 85&nbsp;km northwest of [[Dublin]], and was once a staging and rest point for the coaches plying between [[Enniskillen]] and Dublin. Virginia is connected to Dublin by an hourly bus service from Cavan town [[Bus \u00c9ireann]]. The [[N3 road (Ireland)#M3 motorway|M3 motorway]] was completed in 2010 and links the North-West of Dublin to the nearby town of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], 20&nbsp;km from Virginia. This has cut journey times to Dublin considerably and has made the town more favourable for commuters.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nA 12.5&nbsp;km long bypass for the town of type 2 dual carriageway, intended to reduce congestion going through the town centre was planned but suspended in the late 2000s. In February 2018, the project was placed as a key project in the National Development Plan, part of 'Project Ireland 2040'.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.anglocelt.ie/news/roundup/articles/2018/02/16/4152334-virginia-bypass-included-in-national-development-plan/|title=Anglo Celt - Virginia by-pass included in National Development Plan|work=Anglo Celt|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nRegarded these days as a [[commuter town]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/property-mortgages/how-much-is-your-house-worth/cavan-virginia-the-crown-jewel-of-cavans-property-recovery-36497978.html|title=Cavan: Virginia the crown jewel of Cavan's property recovery - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref> with its proximity to larger trading towns east and west, the local industry consists mainly of farming and milk processing at the local [[Glanbia]] factory (formerly Virginia Milk Products), which produces skim milk powder and cream for the world-renowned brand [[Baileys Irish Cream]] liqueur.

The school's population is over 400 pupils. The primary school received an extension in 2014.\n\n[[Virginia College, Cavan]], formerly Virginia Vocational School, is the only secondary school in Virginia. Situated beside Lough Ramor, it is a mixed school educating approximately 740 pupils.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Virginia College, About Us|url=https://virginiacollege.ie/about/school-history|website=virginiacollege.ie|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> With three extensions built over the years (most recent in 2012), the school now has three ICT suites, and a language lab. The Virginia school celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2012, this was later followed by a visit to the school by the [[President of Ireland]], [[Michael D. Higgins]].\n\n==Common surnames==\nThe most common Virginia surnames to appear during the census of 1901/1911 were: Kellett, Fitzsimons, Sheridan, Smith, Reilly, Carroll, O'Reilly, Lynch, Brady, Reynolds, Duffy, Hopkins, Soden, McNamee, Preston, McEnroe, Skelly.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Jonathan Swift]] (1667\u20131745), penned his well-known novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' while staying nearby at Quilca, the home of his cleric friend Thomas Sheridan.\n*[[Thomas Sheridan (divine)|Thomas Sheridan]] (1687-1738), who kept a classics school and later became headmaster of Cavan's Royal School. \n*[[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] (1751\u20131816), playwright and grandson to Thomas Sheridan.\n*[[Thomas Fitzpatrick (London physician)|Thomas Fitzpatrick]] (1832-1900), a noted London physician.\n*[[Sir Josias Rowley, 1st Baronet|Sir Josias Rowley]] (1765-1842), 1st [[Baronet|Bt.]] and [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Royal Navy Admiral]], who was a native of [[County Leitrim]], had links here through his brother [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] John Rowley.

Virginia's population doubled  between the census years of 1821 to 1841, and there was rapid construction in the town, leading to the Main Street as it is seen today. Successive [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquesses of Headfort]] created their own private demesne and a hunting lodge (now Park Hotel) overlooking Lough Ramor.\n\n===Famine and emigration===\nThe [[Great Hunger]], caused by successive failures in the potato crop, brought with it extreme hardship for the poorer classes, with death due to diseases like [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], prevalent due to poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water and other poor living conditions. Starvation, which impacted many parts of the country, was averted in Virginia due to the efforts of the local Famine Relief Committee, who made extra rations of Indian meal available in return for hard labour, this included women and children breaking stones for making roads and the building of the local Catholic church which took place during 1845 on lands donated by the landlord.\n\nIn subsequent years Virginia prospered with the introduction of a butter market in 1856, followed by the opening of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) line between Kells and [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] in March 1863. Cattle and livestock could then be moved for export, however this also meant that produce such as coal and beer could be transported from the larger towns into rural areas which led to the closure of the local malt brewery and several bakeries in the town.\n\nPerhaps the most famous (and controversial) Virginia emigrant was [[General (United States)|General]] [[Philip H. Sheridan]] (1831-1888), whose parents came from nearby [[Killinkere]], left Ireland around 1830 and settled in America. Sheridan achieved success, and notoriety, through a military career, particularly during the [[American Civil War]]. President Lincoln stated, \"this Sheridan is a little Irishman, but a big fighter\", eventually became commanding General of the US Army and had many honours bestowed upon him.\n\nThe closure of the Virginia Roads railway station, and GNR line, in 1958, came about as Ireland's population fell to its lowest levels - the 1951 census lists Virginia with a population of just 297 persons.\n\n===Modern development===\nIn 2007 the local Development Association submitted a proposal to have a new Regional Hospital built near Virginia, on a site owned by [[Cavan County Council]]. Although widely supported by the community and the region's political representatives, the bid was abandoned with a government announcement that there was not a 'red penny' available for such a project. Road transport links to Virginia have seen some improvement since the opening during 2010 of the M3 motorway linking Virginia to Dublin. This has led to a continued rise in local developments, with many new houses and commercial business being built.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Virginia Cavan.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Virginia by Lough Ramor]]\nThe town is situated close to [[Lough Ramor]], one of the larger lakes in County Cavan, stretching approximately 7&nbsp;km in length by 1&nbsp;km at the narrowest point, and feeding into the Blackwater and Boyne river systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=The size and length of Lough Ramor and what rivers it feeds in to|url=http://virginia.ie/index.php?page=about-virginia}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nVirginia is on the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 route]] approximately 85&nbsp;km northwest of [[Dublin]], and was once a staging and rest point for the coaches plying between [[Enniskillen]] and Dublin. Virginia is connected to Dublin by an hourly bus service from Cavan town [[Bus \u00c9ireann]]. Unfortunately, the aforementioned [[Bus  \u00c9ireann]] has a reputation for being of somewhat poor quality.  The [[N3 road (Ireland)#M3 motorway|M3 motorway]] was completed in 2010 and links the North-West of Dublin to the nearby town of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], 20&nbsp;km from Virginia. This has cut journey times to Dublin considerably and has made the town more favourable for commuters.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nA 12.5&nbsp;km long bypass for the town of type 2 dual carriageway, intended to reduce congestion going through the town centre was planned but suspended in the late 2000s. In February 2018, the project was placed as a key project in the National Development Plan, part of 'Project Ireland 2040'.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.anglocelt.ie/news/roundup/articles/2018/02/16/4152334-virginia-bypass-included-in-national-development-plan/|title=Anglo Celt - Virginia by-pass included in National Development Plan|work=Anglo Celt|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nRegarded these days as a [[commuter town]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/property-mortgages/how-much-is-your-house-worth/cavan-virginia-the-crown-jewel-of-cavans-property-recovery-36497978.html|title=Cavan: Virginia the crown jewel of Cavan's property recovery - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref> with its proximity to larger trading towns east and west, the local industry consists mainly of farming and milk processing at the local [[Glanbia]] factory (formerly Virginia Milk Products), which produces skim milk powder and cream for the world-renowned brand [[Baileys Irish Cream]] liqueur.

He served as a [[United States Congressman]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] from 1949 to 1955 and as the first chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] from 1965 to 1966. Roosevelt also ran for [[Governor of New York]] twice. He was a son of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and served as an officer in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>\n\n==Early life==\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. was born on August 17, 1914, the fifth of six children born to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1882\u20131945) and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (1884\u20131962).  At the time of his birth, his father was [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/> He was born at his parents' summer home at [[Campobello Island]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada, which is now an [[Roosevelt Campobello International Park|international historical park]].\n\nHis siblings were: [[Anna Roosevelt Halsted|Anna Eleanor Roosevelt]] (1906\u20131975), [[James Roosevelt|James Roosevelt II]] (1907\u20131991), Franklin Roosevelt (1909), a [[Necronym|brother of the same name]] who died in infancy in November 1909, having lived only several months, [[Elliott Roosevelt]] (1910\u20131990), and [[John Aspinwall Roosevelt|John Aspinwall Roosevelt II]] (1916\u20131981).<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>\n\nAs a young man in 1936, he contracted a [[Strep throat|streptococcal throat infection]] and developed life-threatening complications. His successful treatment with [[Prontosil]], the first commercially available [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] drug, avoided a risky surgical procedure which the [[White House]] medical staff had considered, and the subsequent headlines in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other prominent newspapers heralded the start of the era of [[antibiotics|antibacterial chemotherapy]] in the United States.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771900,00.html Medicine: Prontosil], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', December 28, 1936</ref>\n\n===Education===\nHe graduated from [[Groton School]] in 1933, [[Harvard University]] in 1937, and from the [[University of Virginia School of Law|University of Virginia]] in June 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Jr. (1914\u20131988)|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=R000425|work=Biographical Directory of Congress|publisher=Office of Art and Archives, Office of the Historian, United States House of Representatives|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"WaPoObit\"/>\n\nThe family thought that FDR Jr. was the one most like his father in appearance and behavior. James said, \"Franklin is the one who came closest to being another FDR. He had father's looks, his speaking voice, his smile, his charm, his charisma.\"<ref>Roosevelt, 313</ref>\n\n==U.S. Navy service==\n[[File:Elliot Roosevelt and FDR Jr - NARA - 195327.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Elliot Roosevelt]] and FDR Jr., far right, in Casablanca]]\n\n===World War II===\nRoosevelt was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Navy Reserve on June 11, 1940. He was a junior naval officer in [[World War II]] and was decorated for bravery in the battle of [[Naval Battle of Casablanca|Casablanca]].\n\nAt the request of his father, along with brother [[Elliott Roosevelt]], he attended both the Argentia ([[Atlantic Charter]]) summit with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in August 1941, and the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943. Franklin also met FDR in Africa prior to the [[Tehran Conference]]. Returning from [[Argentia]], he sailed with Churchill and stood with him at parades in newly American-occupied [[Reykjavik, Iceland]], to symbolize American solidarity with England, Scotland, and Wales.<ref>Hansen, 211\u201312, 262</ref>\n\nBrother [[James Roosevelt]] summarized \"Brud's\" naval service: \"Franklin served on a destroyer that dodged torpedoes from Iceland to Minsk [sic!]. He became executive officer of the destroyer {{USS|Mayrant|DD-402}}, which was bombed at [[Palermo]] in the Sicilian invasion. The famed war correspondent [[Quentin Reynolds]] went out of his way to write mother how bravely Franklin performed in that bloody ordeal, in which he was awarded the [[Silver Star Medal]] for exposing himself under fire to carry a critically wounded sailor to safety.\" <ref>Roosevelt, 269.</ref>\n\nLater, as a lieutenant commander, to which he was promoted to on March 1, 1944, Franklin became the commanding officer of his own destroyer escort, [[USS Ulvert M. Moore (DE-442)|USS ''Ulvert M. Moore'' (DE-442)]] on July 18, 1944.  The ''Moore'' served in the Pacific and shot down two Japanese aircraft and sank a Japanese submarine.  The ship was in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945.

When brother [[James Roosevelt]] was elected to the House, Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] told him to \"not waste our time like your brother did.\" James wrote that Franklin \"had a dreadful record in Congress. He was smart, but not smart enough. He had good ideas and the power of persuasion, but he did not put them to good use.

He served as a [[United States Congressman]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] from 1949 to 1955 and as the first chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] from 1965 to 1966. Roosevelt also ran for [[Governor of New York]] twice. He was a son of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and served as an officer in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>\n\n==Early life==\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. was born on August 17, 1914, the fifth of six children born to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1882\u20131945) and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (1884\u20131962).  At the time of his birth, his father was [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/> He was born at his parents' summer home at [[Campobello Island]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada, which is now an [[Roosevelt Campobello International Park|international historical park]].\n\nHis siblings were: [[Anna Roosevelt Halsted|Anna Eleanor Roosevelt]] (1906\u20131975), [[James Roosevelt|James Roosevelt II]] (1907\u20131991), Franklin Roosevelt (1909), a [[Necronym|brother of the same name]] who died in infancy in November 1909, having lived only several months, [[Elliott Roosevelt]] (1910\u20131990), and [[John Aspinwall Roosevelt|John Aspinwall Roosevelt II]] (1916\u20131981).<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>\n\nAs a young man in 1936, he contracted a [[Strep throat|streptococcal throat infection]] and developed life-threatening complications. His successful treatment with [[Prontosil]], the first commercially available [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] drug, avoided a risky surgical procedure which the [[White House]] medical staff had considered, and the subsequent headlines in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other prominent newspapers heralded the start of the era of [[antibiotics|antibacterial chemotherapy]] in the United States.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771900,00.html Medicine: Prontosil], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', December 28, 1936</ref>\n\n===Education===\nHe graduated from [[Groton School]] in 1933, [[Harvard University]] in 1937, and from the [[University of Virginia School of Law|University of Virginia]] in June 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Jr. (1914\u20131988)|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=R000425|work=Biographical Directory of Congress|publisher=Office of Art and Archives, Office of the Historian, United States House of Representatives|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"WaPoObit\"/>\n\nThe family thought that FDR Jr. was the one most like his father in appearance and behavior. James said, \"Franklin is the one who came closest to being another FDR. He had father's looks, his speaking voice, his smile, his charm, his charisma.\"<ref>Roosevelt, 313</ref>\n\n==U.S. Navy service==\n[[File:Elliot Roosevelt and FDR Jr - NARA - 195327.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Elliot Roosevelt]] and FDR Jr., far right, in Casablanca]]\n\n===World War II===\nRoosevelt was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Navy Reserve on June 11, 1940. He was a junior naval officer in [[World War II]] and was decorated for bravery in the battle of [[Naval Battle of Casablanca|Casablanca]].\n\nAt the request of his father, along with brother [[Elliott Roosevelt]], he attended both the Argentia ([[Atlantic Charter]]) summit with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in August 1941, and the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943. Franklin also met FDR in Africa prior to the [[Tehran Conference]]. Returning from [[Argentia]], he sailed with Churchill and stood with him at parades in newly American-occupied [[Reykjavik, Iceland]], to symbolize American solidarity with England, Scotland, and Wales.<ref>Hansen, 211\u201312, 262</ref>\n\nBrother [[James Roosevelt]] summarized \"Brud's\" naval service: \"Franklin served on a destroyer that dodged torpedoes from Iceland to Minsk [sic!]. He became executive officer of the destroyer {{USS|Mayrant|DD-402}}, which was bombed at [[Palermo]] in the Sicilian invasion. The famed war correspondent [[Quentin Reynolds]] went out of his way to write mother how bravely Franklin performed in that bloody ordeal, in which he was awarded the [[Silver Star Medal]] for exposing himself under fire to carry a critically wounded sailor to safety.\" <ref>Roosevelt, 269.</ref>\n\nLater, as a lieutenant commander, to which he was promoted to on March 1, 1944, Franklin became the commanding officer of his own destroyer escort, [[USS Ulvert M. Moore (DE-442)|USS ''Ulvert M. Moore'' (DE-442)]] on July 18, 1944.  The ''Moore'' served in the Pacific and shot down two Japanese aircraft and sank a Japanese submarine.  The ship was in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945. James Roosevelt remembered that his brother was known as \"Big Moose\" to the men who served under him, he did \"a tremendous job\".\n\n===Military awards===\nRoosevelt's military decorations and awards include:\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Silver_Star_ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Legion of Merit ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Bronze Star ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Purple Heart BAR.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy and Marine Corps Commendation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=American Campaign Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=4|type=service-star|ribbon=European-African-Middle_Eastern_Campaign_ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=8|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Army of Occupation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Phliber rib.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-align=center\n|[[Silver Star]]<ref name=\"WaPoObit\"/>\n|[[Legion of Merit]]<ref name=\"WaPoObit\"/>\n|[[Bronze Star Medal]]\n|-align=center\n|[[Purple Heart]]<ref name=\"WaPoObit\"/>\n|[[Navy Commendation Medal]]\n|[[American Defense Service Medal]]<br />with [[Service star|{{frac|3|16}}\" bronze star]]\n|-align=center\n|[[American Campaign Medal]]\n|[[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal|European-African-Middle Eastern<br />Campaign Medal]] with <br />four [[Service star|campaign stars]]\n|[[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]]<br />with eight campaign stars\n|-align=center\n|[[World War II Victory Medal]]\n|[[Navy Occupation Medal]]\n|[[Philippine Liberation Medal]]<ref>Sons of the American Revolution Membership Application</ref>\n|-\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Post-war career==\n===Law practice===\nRoosevelt served in several New York law offices after the war.

He triggered controversy for representing Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] in the U.S., and dropped the account before Trujillo's assassination in 1961.\n\n===Politics===\nRoosevelt was also involved in political affairs. He served on the [[President's Committee on Civil Rights]] in 1946 for President [[Harry Truman]]. Along with his brothers, he declared for [[Dwight D.

When brother [[James Roosevelt]] was elected to the House, Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] told him to \"not waste our time like your brother did.\" James wrote that Franklin \"had a dreadful record in Congress. He was smart, but not smart enough. He had good ideas and the power of persuasion, but he did not put them to good use.

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.\" The university's first Charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern Charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 Trustees, customarily including the President, who serves ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]''. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the Board in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the President, are nominated by the Trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for Trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.<ref name=\"Columbia.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University Senate was established by the Trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the Provost, the Deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the President, from the university's administration. The President serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university.

[[WKCR]], the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]]. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/history|title=\"The Original FM\": The Columbia University Radio Club|publisher=Columbia University|year=2009|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at [[4 Times Square]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]].

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.\" The university's first Charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern Charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 Trustees, customarily including the President, who serves ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]''. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the Board in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the President, are nominated by the Trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for Trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.<ref name=\"Columbia.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University Senate was established by the Trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the Provost, the Deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the President, from the university's administration. The President serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university.

[[WKCR]], the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]]. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/history|title=\"The Original FM\": The Columbia University Radio Club|publisher=Columbia University|year=2009|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at [[4 Times Square]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]].

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 59v 3.png|thumb|left|160px|[[Pittacus of Mytilene]] (c. 640 \u2013 568 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]\n[[File:Port Mytilene.jpg|thumb|View of the port, with the dome of Saint Therapon.]]\n[[File:Lesbos Mytilene01.JPG|thumb|The church of [[Saint Therapon (Mytilene)|Saint Therapon]] at the port]]\n\nAs an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to Lesbos, creating a north and south harbor. The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

The Athenian public assembly voted to massacre all the men of the city and to sell the women and children into slavery but the next day in the [[Mytilenian Debate]] changed its mind. A fast [[trireme]] sailed the {{convert|186|nmi|km}} in less than a day and brought the decision to cancel the general massacre, but a thousand citizens were executed for taking part in the rebellion.\n\n[[Aristotle]] lived on Mytilene for two years, 337\u2013335 BC, with his friend and successor, [[Theophrastus]] (a native of the island), after being the tutor to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], son of King [[Philip II of Macedon]].<ref>[http://www.ivu.org/history/greece_rome/theophrastus.html Bio of Theophrastus] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/authors/about_aristotle.html Grade Saver bio on Aristotle] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><!---but not Alexander the Great just yet.

From Mytilene they continued towards [[Chios]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|20:15|KJV}}).\n\nThe novel ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Longus]], is set in the country around it and opens with a description of the city.\n\nScholar and historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], also known as Zacharias of Mytilene was from Mytilene and lived from 465 to around 536. He was made Bishop of Mytilene and may have been a [[Chalcedonian Christian]].

The [[Church of St. Symeon, Mytilene]] venerates one of the three brothers.\n\nCatching the eye of the Empress [[Zo\u00eb Porphyrogenita]], [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] was exiled to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos by her second husband, [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]].

In 1198, the [[Republic of Venice]] obtained the right to commerce from the city's port.\n\nIn the 13th century, it was captured by the [[Emperor of Nicaea]], [[Theodore I Laskaris]].  In 1335, the Byzantines, with the help of Ottoman forces, reconquered the island, then property of the Genoese nobleman [[Domenico Cattaneo]]. In 1355, emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] gave it to the Genoese adventurer [[Francesco I Gattilusio|Francesco Gattilusio]], who married the emperor's sister, Maria.

Facing economic crises, oppressive governments, violence, and war, thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, and other countries have decided to leave their homes and seek safety in Europe. As the capital of Lesbos, the city of Mytilene has become a primary entry point for refugees and migrants who seek to pass through Greece to resettle elsewhere in Europe.\n\nA refugee's journey to Mytilene involves a series of strategic steps. Individuals often travel by foot, car, bus, and boat to reach Turkey before taking boats across the Aegean Sea to Lesbos. Mytilene serves as a doorway to the Greek mainland and thus to the European countries, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany, in which refugees often desire to settle. In the past two years, over half a million people have arrived in Lesbos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/refugee-flows-lesvos-evolution-humanitarian-response|title=Refugee Flows to Lesvos: Evolution of a Humanitarian Response|date=2016-01-28|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en}}</ref> Some have drowned on the journey, because of the dangerous nature of traveling by boat without lifejackets and also because they have been sold faulty lifejackets by smugglers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://theworldwidetribe.com/2016/01/fake-life-jackets/|title=Fake Life Jackets|date=2016-01-19|work=The Worldwide Tribe|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-US}}</ref> Others have suffered from hypothermia.\n\nThe number of individuals coming through Lesbos has dwindled since the signing of the controversial [[EU-Turkey deal]] which restricted the number of refugees that could legally resettle in Europe. The deal stated that persons arriving in Greece by first traveling through Turkey would, after March 20, 2016, be deported from Greece and sent back to Turkey if Greece did not confer them asylum status.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/qa-eu-turkey-deal-2090291043|title=Q&A: EU-Turkey refugee deal explained|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017|7}}, seventy to eighty refugees are still arriving in Greece daily despite the deal and \"many of them on Lesbos\", according to Daniel Esdras, the chief of the [[International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine|International Organization for Migration (IOM)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/violence-becoming-commonplace-in-moria-refugee-camp/a-39793594|title=Violence becoming commonplace in Moria refugee camp {{!}} Germany Guide for Refugees {{!}} DW {{!}} 21.07.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-12-10}}</ref>\n\n===Moria===\nMoria ({{lang-el|\u039c\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1}} \u2013 ''M\u00f3ria'') refugee camp is the biggest refugee camp in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/protection/operations/5645ddbc6/greece-factsheet-lesvos-island.html|title=LESVOS ISLAND - GREECE|last=|first=|date=|website=UNHCR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Formerly a prison, Moria is a refugee camp located outside Moria village near Mytilene, the main city on the island.

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 59v 3.png|thumb|left|160px|[[Pittacus of Mytilene]] (c. 640 \u2013 568 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]\n[[File:Port Mytilene.jpg|thumb|View of the port, with the dome of Saint Therapon.]]\n[[File:Lesbos Mytilene01.JPG|thumb|The church of [[Saint Therapon (Mytilene)|Saint Therapon]] at the port]]\n\nAs an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to Lesbos, creating a north and south harbor. The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

The Athenian public assembly voted to massacre all the men of the city and to sell the women and children into slavery but the next day in the [[Mytilenian Debate]] changed its mind. A fast [[trireme]] sailed the {{convert|186|nmi|km}} in less than a day and brought the decision to cancel the general massacre, but a thousand citizens were executed for taking part in the rebellion.\n\n[[Aristotle]] lived on Mytilene for two years, 337\u2013335 BC, with his friend and successor, [[Theophrastus]] (a native of the island), after being the tutor to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], son of King [[Philip II of Macedon]].<ref>[http://www.ivu.org/history/greece_rome/theophrastus.html Bio of Theophrastus] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/authors/about_aristotle.html Grade Saver bio on Aristotle] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><!---but not Alexander the Great just yet.

From Mytilene they continued towards [[Chios]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|20:15|KJV}}).\n\nThe novel ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Longus]], is set in the country around it and opens with a description of the city.\n\nScholar and historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], also known as Zacharias of Mytilene was from Mytilene and lived from 465 to around 536. He was made Bishop of Mytilene and may have been a [[Chalcedonian Christian]].

The [[Church of St. Symeon, Mytilene]] venerates one of the three brothers.\n\nCatching the eye of the Empress [[Zo\u00eb Porphyrogenita]], [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] was exiled to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos by her second husband, [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]]. The death of Michael IV and the overthrow of Michael V in 1042 led to Constantine being recalled from his place of exile and appointed as a judge in Greece.<ref>Finlay George \"History of the Byzantine Empire from 716 \u2013 1057\" William Blackwood & Sons, 1853</ref>\n \nLesbos and Mytilene had an established [[Jews|Jewish population]] since ancient times.

In 1198, the [[Republic of Venice]] obtained the right to commerce from the city's port.\n\nIn the 13th century, it was captured by the [[Emperor of Nicaea]], [[Theodore I Laskaris]].  In 1335, the Byzantines, with the help of Ottoman forces, reconquered the island, then property of the Genoese nobleman [[Domenico Cattaneo]]. In 1355, emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] gave it to the Genoese adventurer [[Francesco I Gattilusio|Francesco Gattilusio]], who married the emperor's sister, Maria.  They renovated the fortress in 1373, and it remained in Genoese hands until 1462, when it was [[Ottoman conquest of Lesbos#Siege|besieged and captured]] by the Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]].\n\nMytilene along with the rest of Lesbos remained under Ottoman control until the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, when in November it became part of the [[Kingdom of Greece]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{wide image|Panorama Mytilini.jpg|900px|align-cap=center|View of the seafront}}\n\nMytilene is located in the southeastern part of the island, north and east of the Bay of Gera.

Facing economic crises, oppressive governments, violence, and war, thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, and other countries have decided to leave their homes and seek safety in Europe. As the capital of Lesbos, the city of Mytilene has become a primary entry point for refugees and migrants who seek to pass through Greece to resettle elsewhere in Europe.\n\nA refugee's journey to Mytilene involves a series of strategic steps. Individuals often travel by foot, car, bus, and boat to reach Turkey before taking boats across the Aegean Sea to Lesbos. Mytilene serves as a doorway to the Greek mainland and thus to the European countries, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany, in which refugees often desire to settle. In the past two years, over half a million people have arrived in Lesbos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/refugee-flows-lesvos-evolution-humanitarian-response|title=Refugee Flows to Lesvos: Evolution of a Humanitarian Response|date=2016-01-28|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en}}</ref> Some have drowned on the journey, because of the dangerous nature of traveling by boat without lifejackets and also because they have been sold faulty lifejackets by smugglers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://theworldwidetribe.com/2016/01/fake-life-jackets/|title=Fake Life Jackets|date=2016-01-19|work=The Worldwide Tribe|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-US}}</ref> Others have suffered from hypothermia.\n\nThe number of individuals coming through Lesbos has dwindled since the signing of the controversial [[EU-Turkey deal]] which restricted the number of refugees that could legally resettle in Europe. The deal stated that persons arriving in Greece by first traveling through Turkey would, after March 20, 2016, be deported from Greece and sent back to Turkey if Greece did not confer them asylum status.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/qa-eu-turkey-deal-2090291043|title=Q&A: EU-Turkey refugee deal explained|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017|7}}, seventy to eighty refugees are still arriving in Greece daily despite the deal and \"many of them on Lesbos\", according to Daniel Esdras, the chief of the [[International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine|International Organization for Migration (IOM)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/violence-becoming-commonplace-in-moria-refugee-camp/a-39793594|title=Violence becoming commonplace in Moria refugee camp {{!}} Germany Guide for Refugees {{!}} DW {{!}} 21.07.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-12-10}}</ref>\n\n===Moria===\nMoria ({{lang-el|\u039c\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1}} \u2013 ''M\u00f3ria'') refugee camp is the biggest refugee camp in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/protection/operations/5645ddbc6/greece-factsheet-lesvos-island.html|title=LESVOS ISLAND - GREECE|last=|first=|date=|website=UNHCR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Formerly a prison, Moria is a refugee camp located outside Moria village near Mytilene, the main city on the island.

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].

It is one [[Phase (matter)|state]] of water within the [[hydrosphere]]. Water [[vapor]] can be produced from the [[evaporation]] or [[boiling]] of liquid water or from the [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of [[ice]]. Water vapor is transparent, like most constituents of the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Water Vapor?|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_water_vapor.htm|accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by [[condensation]]. It is less dense than most of the other constituents of [[air]] and triggers [[convection]] currents that can lead to clouds.\n\nBeing a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in [[Earth's atmosphere]], where it acts as the most potent [[greenhouse gas]], stronger than other gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. Use of water vapor, as [[steam]], has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]]. If you are reading this go bigger or go home because there is someone out there for so go do whatever you can just go\n\nWater vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the [[solar atmosphere]] as well as every planet in the [[Solar System]] and many [[astronomical object]]s including [[natural satellite]]s, [[comet]]s and even large [[asteroid]]s. Likewise the detection of [[Extrasolar object|extrasolar]] water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems. Water vapor is significant in that it can be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects.\n\n== Properties ==\n=== Evaporation ===\nWhenever a water molecule leaves a surface and diffuses into a surrounding gas, it is said to have [[Evaporation|evaporated]]. Each individual water molecule which transitions between a more associated (liquid) and a less associated (vapor/gas) state does so through the absorption or release of [[kinetic energy]]. The aggregate measurement of this kinetic energy transfer is defined as thermal energy and occurs only when there is differential in the temperature of the water molecules. Liquid water that becomes water vapor takes a parcel of heat with it, in a process called [[evaporative cooling]].<ref>{{harvp|Schroeder|2000|p=36}}</ref> The amount of water vapor in the air determines how frequently molecules will return to the surface. When a net evaporation occurs, the body of water will undergo a net cooling directly related to the loss of water.\n\nIn the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized \"pan\" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grow.arizona.edu/Grow--GrowResources.php?ResourceId%3D208 |accessdate=April 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412215652/http://www.grow.arizona.edu/Grow--GrowResources.php?ResourceId=208 |archivedate=April 12, 2008 }}</ref> The measurements range from under 30 to over 120&nbsp;inches per year. Formulas can be used for calculating the rate of evaporation from a water surface such as a swimming pool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thermexcel.com/english/program/pool.htm|title=swimming, pool, calculation, evaporation, water, thermal, temperature, humidity, vapor, excel|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rlmartin.com/rspec/whatis/equations.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324232701/http://www.rlmartin.com/rspec/whatis/equations.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2008 |title=Summary of Results of all Pool Evaporation Rate Studies |publisher=R. L. Martin & Associates}}</ref> In some countries, the evaporation rate far exceeds the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] rate.\n\nEvaporative cooling is restricted by [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|atmospheric conditions]]. [[Humidity]] is the amount of water vapor in the air. The vapor content of air is measured with devices known as [[hygrometer]]s. The measurements are usually expressed as [[specific humidity]] or percent [[relative humidity]]. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition is often referred to as complete saturation. Humidity ranges from 0&nbsp;gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30&nbsp;grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-53259/climate#292984.hook|title=climate - meteorology|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = horizontal\n |align     = right\n |width1    = 165\n |width2    = 176\n |image1    = Meteorite Recovery Antarctica (retouched).jpg\n |image2    = Tightjunction BBB.jpg\n |caption1  = Recovery of [[meteorite]]s in Antarctica ([[ANSMET]])\n |caption2  = [[Electron micrograph]] of freeze-etched [[capillary]] tissue\n}}\n\n=== Sublimation ===\n[[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] is when water molecules directly leave the surface of ice without first becoming liquid water. Sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting. [[Antarctica]] shows this effect to a unique degree because it is by far the continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on Earth. As a result, there are large areas where [[Millennium|millennial]] layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained. This is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of [[meteorite]]s that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.\n\nSublimation is important in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Typically the specimens are prepared by [[cryofixation]] and [[Electron microscope|freeze-fracture]], after which the broken surface is freeze-etched, being eroded by exposure to vacuum till it shows the required level of detail. This technique can display protein molecules, [[organelle]] structures and [[lipid bilayer]]s with very low degrees of distortion.\n\n=== Condensation ===\n[[File:Above the Clouds.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clouds, formed by condensed water vapour]]\n\nWater vapour will only condense onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the [[dew point]] temperature, or when the [[saturation vapour pressure|water vapour equilibrium]] in air has been exceeded. When water vapour condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, the temperature of the atmosphere drops slightly.<ref>{{harvp|Schroeder|2000|p=19}}</ref> In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by [[cloud condensation nuclei]]). The [[dew point]] of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapour in the air begins to condense concluding water vapour is a type of water or rain.\n\nAlso, a net condensation of water vapour occurs on surfaces when the temperature of the surface is at or below the dew point temperature of the atmosphere. [[Deposition (meteorology)|Deposition]] is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapour. [[Frost]] and snow are examples of deposition.\n\nThere are many mechanism of cooling by which condensation occurs \n1.direct loss of heat known as radiation cooling.\n2.cooling with upliftment of air known as adiabatic cooling.\nthere are 4 types of upliftment of air:\na. orographic upliftment- mountains work as barrier for upliftment of air\nb. convectional upliftment- upliftment of air due to pressure difference \nc. frontal upliftment- upliftment of air due to temp difference\nd. cyclonic upliftment but not related to temp\n3.advective cooling- cooling due to horizontal movement of air.\n\n=== Chemical reactions ===\nA number of chemical reactions have water as a product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the dew point local condensation will occur. Typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrocarbon]]s in air or other [[oxygen]] containing gas mixtures, or as a result of reactions with oxidizers.\n\nIn a similar fashion other chemical or physical reactions can take place in the presence of water vapor resulting in new chemicals forming such as [[rust]] on iron or steel, polymerization occurring (certain [[polyurethane]] foams and [[cyanoacrylate]] glues cure with exposure to atmospheric humidity) or forms changing such as where anhydrous chemicals may absorb enough vapor to form a crystalline structure or alter an existing one, sometimes resulting in characteristic color changes that can be used for [[humidity indicator card|measurement]].\n\n=== Measurement ===\nMeasuring the quantity of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely with varying degrees of accuracy. Remote methods such [[Electromagnetic absorption by water|electromagnetic absorption]] are possible from satellites above planetary atmospheres. Direct methods may use electronic transducers, moistened thermometers or hygroscopic materials measuring changes in physical properties or dimensions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 85%; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em\" |\n! medium\n! temperature range (degC)\n! measurement [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]]\n! typical measurement frequency\n! system cost\n! notes\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Hygrometer#sling psychrometer|Sling psychrometer]]\n| air\n| \u221210 to 50\n| low to moderate\n| hourly\n| low\n|\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Satellite-based spectroscopy\n| air\n| \u221280 to 60\n| low\n|\n| very high\n|\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Hygrometer#capacitive|Capacitive]] sensor\n| air/gases\n| \u221240 to 50\n| moderate\n| 2 to 0.05&nbsp;Hz\n| medium\n| prone to becoming saturated/contaminated over time\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Warmed capacitive sensor\n| air/gases\n| \u221215 to 50\n| moderate to low\n| 2 to 0.05&nbsp;Hz (temp dependant)\n| medium to high\n| prone to becoming saturated/contaminated over time\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[hygrometer#resistive|Resistive]] sensor\n| air/gases\n| \u221210 to 50\n| moderate\n| 60 seconds\n| medium\n| prone to contamination\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lithium chloride [[dewcell]]\n| air\n| \u221230 to 50\n| moderate\n| continuous\n| medium\n| see [[dewcell]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Cobalt(II) chloride]]\n| air/gases\n| 0 to 50\n| high\n| 5 minutes\n| very low\n| often used in [[Humidity indicator card]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Absorption spectroscopy]]\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| high\n|\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Aluminum oxide\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| medium\n| see [[Moisture analysis]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Silicon oxide\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| medium\n| see [[Moisture analysis]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Piezoelectric sorption\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| medium\n| see [[Moisture analysis]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Electrolytic\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| medium\n| see [[Moisture analysis]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Hygrometer#hair tension|Hair tension]]\n| air\n| 0 to 40\n| high\n| continuous\n| low to medium\n| Affected by temperature.

At max. saturation (i. e. rel. humidity = 100 % at 0 \u00b0C) the density will go down to 28.51 g/mol.\n* STP conditions imply a temperature of 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, at which the ability of water to become vapor is very restricted. Its [[concentration]] in air is very low at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. The red line on the chart to the right is the maximum concentration of water vapor expected for a given temperature. The water vapor concentration increases significantly as the temperature rises, approaching 100% ([[steam]], pure water vapor) at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. However the difference in densities between air and water vapor would still exist (0.598 vs. 1.27 g/l).\n\n==== At equal temperatures ====\nAt the same temperature, a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic [[nitrogen]] and diatomic [[oxygen]] both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] if placed in a larger region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] and [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).\n\n=== Respiration and breathing ===\nWater vapor is a by-product of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] in plants and animals. Its contribution to the pressure, increases as its concentration increases. Its [[partial pressure]] contribution to air pressure increases, lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases [[partial pressure|(Dalton's Law)]]. The total air pressure must remain constant. The presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.\n\nThis can have an effect on respiration. In very warm air (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings.\n\n=== Lifting gas ===\nWater vapor has lower density than that of [[air]] and is therefore [[buoyant]] in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air. When water vapor is used as a [[lifting gas]] by a [[thermal airship]] the water vapor is heated to form steam so that its vapor pressure is greater than the surrounding air pressure in order to maintain the shape of a theoretical \"steam balloon\", which yields approximately 60% the lift of helium and twice that of hot air.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goodey\n|first=Thomas J. |title=Steam Balloons and Steam Airships |url=http://www.flyingkettle.com/jbfa.htm |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== General discussion ===\nThe amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. Dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the [[water cycle]]. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice on top of a mountain. The ''balance'' between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called [[vapor pressure|vapor partial pressure]].\n\nThe maximum partial pressure (''saturation pressure'') of water vapor in air varies with temperature of the air and water vapor mixture. A variety of empirical formulas exist for this quantity; the most used reference formula is the [[Goff-Gratch equation]] for the SVP over liquid water below zero degree Celsius:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\log_{10} \\left( p \\right) =\n& -7.90298 \\left( \\frac{373.16}{T}-1 \\right) + 5.02808 \\log_{10} \\frac{373.16}{T} \\\\\n& - 1.3816 \\times 10^{-7} \\left( 10^{11.344 \\left( 1-\\frac{T}{373.16} \\right)} -1 \\right) \\\\\n& + 8.1328 \\times 10^{-3} \\left( 10^{-3.49149 \\left( \\frac{373.16}{T}-1 \\right)} -1 \\right) \\\\\n& + \\log_{10} \\left( 1013.246 \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|T}}, temperature of the moist air, is given in units of [[kelvin]], and {{mvar|p}} is given in units of [[millibar]]s ([[hectopascal]]s).\n\nThe formula is valid from about \u221250 to 102&nbsp;\u00b0C; however there are a very limited number of measurements of the vapor pressure of water over supercooled liquid water. There are a number of other formulae which can be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/~voemel/vp.html|title=Water Vapor Pressure Formulations|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnder certain conditions, such as when the boiling temperature of water is reached, a net evaporation will always occur during standard atmospheric conditions regardless of the percent of relative humidity. This immediate process will dispel massive amounts of water vapor into a cooler atmosphere.\n\n[[Exhalation|Exhale]]d air is almost fully at equilibrium with water vapor at the body temperature. In the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or [[mist]] of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces. Forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath is the basis of [[exhaled breath condensate]], an evolving medical diagnostic test.\n\nControlling water vapor in air is a key concern in the [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning]] (HVAC) industry. [[Thermal comfort]] depends on the moist air conditions. Non-human comfort situations are called [[refrigeration]], and also are affected by water vapor. For example, many food stores, like supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or ''food cases'', which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity). This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.\n\n== {{anchor|Water vapor in Earth's atmosphere}} In Earth's atmosphere ==\n[[File:BAMS climate assess boulder water vapor 2002.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Evidence for increasing amounts of stratospheric water vapor over time in Boulder, Colorado.]]\n{{further|Atmosphere of Earth}}\n\nGaseous water represents a small but environmentally significant constituent of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42&nbsp;\u00b0C (-44&nbsp;\u00b0F)<ref>{{harvp|McElroy|2002|loc=p. 34, Fig. 4.3a}}</ref> to 4.24% when the dew point is 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (86&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{harvp|McElroy|2002|loc=p. 36 example 4.1}}</ref> Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the [[troposphere]]. The [[condensation]] of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for [[clouds]], rain, snow, and other [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the [[latent heat of vaporization]], which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, is one of the most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric [[convection]] is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as [[tropical cyclones]] and severe [[thunderstorms]]. Water vapor is the most potent [[greenhouse gas]] owing to the presence of the [[hydroxyl]] bond which strongly absorbs in the [[infra-red]] region of the [[light spectrum]].\n\nWater vapor is the \"working medium\" of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine which transforms heat energy from sun irradiation into mechanical energy in the form of winds. Transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy requires an upper and a lower temperature level, as well as a working medium which shuttles forth and back between both. The upper temperature level is given by the soil or water surface of the earth, which absorbs the incoming sun radiation and warms up, evaporating water. The moist and warm air at the ground is lighter than its surrounding and raises up to the upper limit of the troposphere. There the water molecules radiate their thermal energy into outer space, cooling down the surrounding air. The upper atmosphere constitutes the lower temperature level of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine. The water vapor in the now cold air condenses out and falls down to the ground in the form of rain or snow. The now heavier cold and dry air sinks down to ground as well; the atmospheric thermodynamic engine thus establishes a vertical convection, which transports heat from the ground into the upper atmosphere, where the water molecules can radiate it to outer space. Due to the earth rotation and the resulting Coriolis forces, this vertical atmospheric convection is also converted into a horizontal convection, in the form of cyclones and anticyclones, which transport the water evaporated over the oceans into the interior of the continents, enabling vegetation to grow. <ref> https://web.stanford.edu/~ajlucas/The%20Atmosphere%20as%20a%20Heat%20Engine.pdf </ref>\n\nWater in Earth's atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100&nbsp;\u00b0C), but [[Tropopause|at altitude]] it [[Lapse rate|goes below]] its freezing point (0&nbsp;\u00b0C), due to water's [[Hydrogen bond|highly polar attraction]]. When combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant [[dew point]] and [[Dew point#frost point|frost point]], unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane.

In the absence of nuclei, condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures. Under persistent condensation or deposition, cloud droplets or snowflakes form, which [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitate]] when they reach a critical mass.\n\nThe water content of the atmosphere as a whole is constantly depleted by precipitation. At the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from seas, lakes, rivers, and moist earth. Other sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the transpiration of plants, and various other biological and geological processes. The mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25&nbsp;mm deep.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} The mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1 meter, which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air \u2013 on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the [[troposphere]] is about 9 to 10 days.\n\nEpisodes of surface geothermal activity, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers, release variable amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Such eruptions may be large in human terms, and major explosive eruptions may inject exceptionally large masses of water exceptionally high into the atmosphere, but as a percentage of total atmospheric water, the role of such processes is trivial. The relative concentrations of the various gases emitted by [[volcano]]es varies considerably according to the site and according to the particular event at any one site. However, water vapor is consistently the commonest [[volcanic gas]]; as a rule, it comprises more than 60% of total emissions during a [[subaerial eruption]].<ref>{{harvp|Sigurdsson|Houghton|2000}}</ref>\n\nAtmospheric water vapor content is expressed using various measures. These include vapor pressure, [[specific humidity]], mixing ratio, dew point temperature, and [[relative humidity]].\n\n=== Radar and satellite imaging ===\n[[File:MYDAL2 M SKY WV.ogv|thumb|These maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month.(''click for more detail'')]]\n[[File:Atmospheric Water Vapor Mean.2005.030.jpg|thumb|[[MODIS]]/[[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] global mean atmospheric water vapor in atm-cm (centimeters of water in an atmospheric column if it condensed)]]\n\nBecause water molecules [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] [[microwave]]s and other [[radio wave]] frequencies, water in the atmosphere attenuates [[radar]] signals.<ref>{{harvp|Skolnik|1990|p=23.5}}</ref> In addition, atmospheric water will [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] and [[refraction|refract]] signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid or solid.\n\nGenerally, radar signals lose strength progressively the farther they travel through the troposphere. Different frequencies attenuate at different rates, such that some components of air are opaque to some frequencies and transparent to others. Radio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience the same effect.\n\nWater vapor reflects radar to a lesser extent than do water's other two phases. In the form of drops and ice crystals, water acts as a prism, which it does not do as an individual [[molecule]]; however, the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere causes the atmosphere to act as a giant prism.<ref>{{harvp|Skolnik|1990|pp=2.44\u20132.54}}</ref>\n\nA comparison of [[GOES-12]] satellite images shows the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the [[precipitable water]] or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MYDAL2_M_SKY_WV|title=Water Vapor |publisher=Global Maps|accessdate=February 26, 2016|date=2018-07-31 }}</ref>\n\nAs water vapour absorbs light in the visible spectral range, its absorption can be used in spectroscopic applications (such as [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy|DOAS]]) to determine the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.

From [[cloud physics]], usually clouds are the real generators of static [[electric charge|charge]] as found in Earth's atmosphere. The ability of clouds to hold massive amounts of electrical energy is directly related to the amount of water vapor present in the local system.\n\nThe amount of water vapor directly controls the [[permittivity]] of the air. During times of low humidity, static discharge is quick and easy. During times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur. Permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.<ref>{{harvp|Shadowitz|1975|pp=165\u2013171}}</ref>\n\nAfter a cloud, for instance, has started its way to becoming a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or [[electrical insulation|insulator]]) that decreases the ability of the cloud to [[electrostatic discharge|discharge]] its electrical energy. Over a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more [[static electricity]], the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy.<ref>{{harvp|Shadowitz|1975|pp=172\u2013173, 182, 414\u2013416}}</ref> This energy will be released to a local oppositely charged region, in the form of lightning.

It is one [[Phase (matter)|state]] of water within the [[hydrosphere]]. Water [[vapor]] can be produced from the [[evaporation]] or [[boiling]] of liquid water or from the [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of [[ice]]. Water vapor is transparent, like most constituents of the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Water Vapor?|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_water_vapor.htm|accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by [[condensation]]. It is less dense than most of the other constituents of [[air]] and triggers [[convection]] currents that can lead to clouds.\n\nBeing a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in [[Earth's atmosphere]], where it acts as the most potent [[greenhouse gas]], stronger than other gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. Use of water vapor, as [[steam]], has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]].\n\nWater vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the [[solar atmosphere]] as well as every planet in the [[Solar System]] and many [[astronomical object]]s including [[natural satellite]]s, [[comet]]s and even large [[asteroid]]s. Likewise the detection of [[Extrasolar object|extrasolar]] water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems. Water vapor is significant in that it can be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects.\n\n== Properties ==\n=== Evaporation ===\nWhenever a water molecule leaves a surface and diffuses into a surrounding gas, it is said to have [[Evaporation|evaporated]]. Each individual water molecule which transitions between a more associated (liquid) and a less associated (vapor/gas) state does so through the absorption or release of [[kinetic energy]]. The aggregate measurement of this kinetic energy transfer is defined as thermal energy and occurs only when there is differential in the temperature of the water molecules. Liquid water that becomes water vapor takes a parcel of heat with it, in a process called [[evaporative cooling]].<ref>{{harvp|Schroeder|2000|p=36}}</ref> The amount of water vapor in the air determines how frequently molecules will return to the surface. When a net evaporation occurs, the body of water will undergo a net cooling directly related to the loss of water.\n\nIn the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized \"pan\" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grow.arizona.edu/Grow--GrowResources.php?ResourceId%3D208 |accessdate=April 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412215652/http://www.grow.arizona.edu/Grow--GrowResources.php?ResourceId=208 |archivedate=April 12, 2008 }}</ref> The measurements range from under 30 to over 120&nbsp;inches per year. Formulas can be used for calculating the rate of evaporation from a water surface such as a swimming pool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thermexcel.com/english/program/pool.htm|title=swimming, pool, calculation, evaporation, water, thermal, temperature, humidity, vapor, excel|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rlmartin.com/rspec/whatis/equations.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324232701/http://www.rlmartin.com/rspec/whatis/equations.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2008 |title=Summary of Results of all Pool Evaporation Rate Studies |publisher=R. L. Martin & Associates}}</ref> In some countries, the evaporation rate far exceeds the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] rate.\n\nEvaporative cooling is restricted by [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|atmospheric conditions]]. [[Humidity]] is the amount of water vapor in the air. The vapor content of air is measured with devices known as [[hygrometer]]s. The measurements are usually expressed as [[specific humidity]] or percent [[relative humidity]]. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition is often referred to as complete saturation. Humidity ranges from 0&nbsp;gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30&nbsp;grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-53259/climate#292984.hook|title=climate - meteorology|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = horizontal\n |align     = right\n |width1    = 165\n |width2    = 176\n |image1    = Meteorite Recovery Antarctica (retouched).jpg\n |image2    = Tightjunction BBB.jpg\n |caption1  = Recovery of [[meteorite]]s in Antarctica ([[ANSMET]])\n |caption2  = [[Electron micrograph]] of freeze-etched [[capillary]] tissue\n}}\n\n=== Sublimation ===\n[[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] is when water molecules directly leave the surface of ice without first becoming liquid water. Sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting. [[Antarctica]] shows this effect to a unique degree because it is by far the continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on Earth. As a result, there are large areas where [[Millennium|millennial]] layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained. This is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of [[meteorite]]s that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.\n\nSublimation is important in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Typically the specimens are prepared by [[cryofixation]] and [[Electron microscope|freeze-fracture]], after which the broken surface is freeze-etched, being eroded by exposure to vacuum till it shows the required level of detail. This technique can display protein molecules, [[organelle]] structures and [[lipid bilayer]]s with very low degrees of distortion.\n\n=== Condensation ===\n[[File:Above the Clouds.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clouds, formed by condensed water vapour]]\n\nWater vapour will only condense onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the [[dew point]] temperature, or when the [[saturation vapour pressure|water vapour equilibrium]] in air has been exceeded. When water vapour condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, the temperature of the atmosphere drops slightly.<ref>{{harvp|Schroeder|2000|p=19}}</ref> In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by [[cloud condensation nuclei]]). The [[dew point]] of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapour in the air begins to condense concluding water vapour is a type of water or rain.\n\nAlso, a net condensation of water vapour occurs on surfaces when the temperature of the surface is at or below the dew point temperature of the atmosphere. [[Deposition (meteorology)|Deposition]] is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapour. [[Frost]] and snow are examples of deposition.\n\nThere are many mechanism of cooling by which condensation occurs \n1.direct loss of heat known as radiation cooling.\n2.cooling with upliftment of air known as adiabatic cooling.\nthere are 4 types of upliftment of air:\na. orographic upliftment- mountains work as barrier for upliftment of air\nb. convectional upliftment- upliftment of air due to pressure difference \nc. frontal upliftment- upliftment of air due to temp difference\nd. cyclonic upliftment but not related to temp\n3.advective cooling- cooling due to horizontal movement of air.\n\n=== Chemical reactions ===\nA number of chemical reactions have water as a product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the dew point local condensation will occur. Typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrocarbon]]s in air or other [[oxygen]] containing gas mixtures, or as a result of reactions with oxidizers.\n\nIn a similar fashion other chemical or physical reactions can take place in the presence of water vapor resulting in new chemicals forming such as [[rust]] on iron or steel, polymerization occurring (certain [[polyurethane]] foams and [[cyanoacrylate]] glues cure with exposure to atmospheric humidity) or forms changing such as where anhydrous chemicals may absorb enough vapor to form a crystalline structure or alter an existing one, sometimes resulting in characteristic color changes that can be used for [[humidity indicator card|measurement]].\n\n=== Measurement ===\nMeasuring the quantity of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely with varying degrees of accuracy. Remote methods such [[Electromagnetic absorption by water|electromagnetic absorption]] are possible from satellites above planetary atmospheres. Direct methods may use electronic transducers, moistened thermometers or hygroscopic materials measuring changes in physical properties or dimensions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 85%; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em\" |\n! medium\n! temperature range (degC)\n! measurement [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]]\n! typical measurement frequency\n! system cost\n! notes\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Hygrometer#sling psychrometer|Sling psychrometer]]\n| air\n| \u221210 to 50\n| low to moderate\n| hourly\n| low\n|\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Satellite-based spectroscopy\n| air\n| \u221280 to 60\n| low\n|\n| very high\n|\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Hygrometer#capacitive|Capacitive]] sensor\n| air/gases\n| \u221240 to 50\n| moderate\n| 2 to 0.05&nbsp;Hz\n| medium\n| prone to becoming saturated/contaminated over time\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Warmed capacitive sensor\n| air/gases\n| \u221215 to 50\n| moderate to low\n| 2 to 0.05&nbsp;Hz (temp dependant)\n| medium to high\n| prone to becoming saturated/contaminated over time\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[hygrometer#resistive|Resistive]] sensor\n| air/gases\n| \u221210 to 50\n| moderate\n| 60 seconds\n| medium\n| prone to contamination\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lithium chloride [[dewcell]]\n| air\n| \u221230 to 50\n| moderate\n| continuous\n| medium\n| see [[dewcell]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Cobalt(II) chloride]]\n| air/gases\n| 0 to 50\n| high\n| 5 minutes\n| very low\n| often used in [[Humidity indicator card]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Absorption spectroscopy]]\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| high\n|\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Aluminum oxide\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| medium\n| see [[Moisture analysis]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Silicon oxide\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| medium\n| see [[Moisture analysis]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Piezoelectric sorption\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| medium\n| see [[Moisture analysis]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| Electrolytic\n| air/gases\n|\n| moderate\n|\n| medium\n| see [[Moisture analysis]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Hygrometer#hair tension|Hair tension]]\n| air\n| 0 to 40\n| high\n| continuous\n| low to medium\n| Affected by temperature.

At max. saturation (i. e. rel. humidity = 100 % at 0 \u00b0C) the density will go down to 28.51 g/mol.\n* STP conditions imply a temperature of 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, at which the ability of water to become vapor is very restricted. Its [[concentration]] in air is very low at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. The red line on the chart to the right is the maximum concentration of water vapor expected for a given temperature. The water vapor concentration increases significantly as the temperature rises, approaching 100% ([[steam]], pure water vapor) at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. However the difference in densities between air and water vapor would still exist (0.598 vs. 1.27 g/l).\n\n==== At equal temperatures ====\nAt the same temperature, a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic [[nitrogen]] and diatomic [[oxygen]] both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] if placed in a larger region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] and [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).\n\n=== Respiration and breathing ===\nWater vapor is a by-product of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] in plants and animals. Its contribution to the pressure, increases as its concentration increases. Its [[partial pressure]] contribution to air pressure increases, lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases [[partial pressure|(Dalton's Law)]]. The total air pressure must remain constant. The presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.\n\nThis can have an effect on respiration. In very warm air (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings.\n\n=== Lifting gas ===\nWater vapor has lower density than that of [[air]] and is therefore [[buoyant]] in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air. When water vapor is used as a [[lifting gas]] by a [[thermal airship]] the water vapor is heated to form steam so that its vapor pressure is greater than the surrounding air pressure in order to maintain the shape of a theoretical \"steam balloon\", which yields approximately 60% the lift of helium and twice that of hot air.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goodey\n|first=Thomas J. |title=Steam Balloons and Steam Airships |url=http://www.flyingkettle.com/jbfa.htm |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== General discussion ===\nThe amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. Dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the [[water cycle]]. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice on top of a mountain. The ''balance'' between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called [[vapor pressure|vapor partial pressure]].\n\nThe maximum partial pressure (''saturation pressure'') of water vapor in air varies with temperature of the air and water vapor mixture. A variety of empirical formulas exist for this quantity; the most used reference formula is the [[Goff-Gratch equation]] for the SVP over liquid water below zero degree Celsius:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\log_{10} \\left( p \\right) =\n& -7.90298 \\left( \\frac{373.16}{T}-1 \\right) + 5.02808 \\log_{10} \\frac{373.16}{T} \\\\\n& - 1.3816 \\times 10^{-7} \\left( 10^{11.344 \\left( 1-\\frac{T}{373.16} \\right)} -1 \\right) \\\\\n& + 8.1328 \\times 10^{-3} \\left( 10^{-3.49149 \\left( \\frac{373.16}{T}-1 \\right)} -1 \\right) \\\\\n& + \\log_{10} \\left( 1013.246 \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|T}}, temperature of the moist air, is given in units of [[kelvin]], and {{mvar|p}} is given in units of [[millibar]]s ([[hectopascal]]s).\n\nThe formula is valid from about \u221250 to 102&nbsp;\u00b0C; however there are a very limited number of measurements of the vapor pressure of water over supercooled liquid water. There are a number of other formulae which can be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/~voemel/vp.html|title=Water Vapor Pressure Formulations|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnder certain conditions, such as when the boiling temperature of water is reached, a net evaporation will always occur during standard atmospheric conditions regardless of the percent of relative humidity. This immediate process will dispel massive amounts of water vapor into a cooler atmosphere.\n\n[[Exhalation|Exhale]]d air is almost fully at equilibrium with water vapor at the body temperature. In the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or [[mist]] of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces. Forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath is the basis of [[exhaled breath condensate]], an evolving medical diagnostic test.\n\nControlling water vapor in air is a key concern in the [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning]] (HVAC) industry. [[Thermal comfort]] depends on the moist air conditions. Non-human comfort situations are called [[refrigeration]], and also are affected by water vapor. For example, many food stores, like supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or ''food cases'', which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity). This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.\n\n== {{anchor|Water vapor in Earth's atmosphere}} In Earth's atmosphere ==\n[[File:BAMS climate assess boulder water vapor 2002.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Evidence for increasing amounts of stratospheric water vapor over time in Boulder, Colorado.]]\n{{further|Atmosphere of Earth}}\n\nGaseous water represents a small but environmentally significant constituent of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42&nbsp;\u00b0C (-44&nbsp;\u00b0F)<ref>{{harvp|McElroy|2002|loc=p. 34, Fig. 4.3a}}</ref> to 4.24% when the dew point is 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (86&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{harvp|McElroy|2002|loc=p. 36 example 4.1}}</ref> Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the [[troposphere]]. The [[condensation]] of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for [[clouds]], rain, snow, and other [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the [[latent heat of vaporization]], which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, is one of the most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric [[convection]] is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as [[tropical cyclones]] and severe [[thunderstorms]]. Water vapor is the most potent [[greenhouse gas]] owing to the presence of the [[hydroxyl]] bond which strongly absorbs in the [[infra-red]] region of the [[light spectrum]].\n\nWater vapor is the \"working medium\" of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine which transforms heat energy from sun irradiation into mechanical energy in the form of winds. Transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy requires an upper and a lower temperature level, as well as a working medium which shuttles forth and back between both. The upper temperature level is given by the soil or water surface of the earth, which absorbs the incoming sun radiation and warms up, evaporating water. The moist and warm air at the ground is lighter than its surrounding and raises up to the upper limit of the troposphere. There the water molecules radiate their thermal energy into outer space, cooling down the surrounding air. The upper atmosphere constitutes the lower temperature level of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine. The water vapor in the now cold air condenses out and falls down to the ground in the form of rain or snow. The now heavier cold and dry air sinks down to ground as well; the atmospheric thermodynamic engine thus establishes a vertical convection, which transports heat from the ground into the upper atmosphere, where the water molecules can radiate it to outer space. Due to the earth rotation and the resulting Coriolis forces, this vertical atmospheric convection is also converted into a horizontal convection, in the form of cyclones and anticyclones, which transport the water evaporated over the oceans into the interior of the continents, enabling vegetation to grow. <ref> https://web.stanford.edu/~ajlucas/The%20Atmosphere%20as%20a%20Heat%20Engine.pdf </ref>\n\nWater in Earth's atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100&nbsp;\u00b0C), but [[Tropopause|at altitude]] it [[Lapse rate|goes below]] its freezing point (0&nbsp;\u00b0C), due to water's [[Hydrogen bond|highly polar attraction]]. When combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant [[dew point]] and [[Dew point#frost point|frost point]], unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane. Water vapor thus has a [[scale height]] a fraction of that of the bulk atmosphere,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brucegary.net/MTP_tutorial/MTP_ch5.html|title=Ch#5|author=Bruce L.

In the absence of nuclei, condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures. Under persistent condensation or deposition, cloud droplets or snowflakes form, which [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitate]] when they reach a critical mass.\n\nThe water content of the atmosphere as a whole is constantly depleted by precipitation. At the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from seas, lakes, rivers, and moist earth. Other sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the transpiration of plants, and various other biological and geological processes. The mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25&nbsp;mm deep.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} The mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1 meter, which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air \u2013 on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the [[troposphere]] is about 9 to 10 days.\n\nEpisodes of surface geothermal activity, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers, release variable amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Such eruptions may be large in human terms, and major explosive eruptions may inject exceptionally large masses of water exceptionally high into the atmosphere, but as a percentage of total atmospheric water, the role of such processes is trivial. The relative concentrations of the various gases emitted by [[volcano]]es varies considerably according to the site and according to the particular event at any one site. However, water vapor is consistently the commonest [[volcanic gas]]; as a rule, it comprises more than 60% of total emissions during a [[subaerial eruption]].<ref>{{harvp|Sigurdsson|Houghton|2000}}</ref>\n\nAtmospheric water vapor content is expressed using various measures. These include vapor pressure, [[specific humidity]], mixing ratio, dew point temperature, and [[relative humidity]].\n\n=== Radar and satellite imaging ===\n[[File:MYDAL2 M SKY WV.ogv|thumb|These maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month.(''click for more detail'')]]\n[[File:Atmospheric Water Vapor Mean.2005.030.jpg|thumb|[[MODIS]]/[[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] global mean atmospheric water vapor in atm-cm (centimeters of water in an atmospheric column if it condensed)]]\n\nBecause water molecules [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] [[microwave]]s and other [[radio wave]] frequencies, water in the atmosphere attenuates [[radar]] signals.<ref>{{harvp|Skolnik|1990|p=23.5}}</ref> In addition, atmospheric water will [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] and [[refraction|refract]] signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid or solid.\n\nGenerally, radar signals lose strength progressively the farther they travel through the troposphere. Different frequencies attenuate at different rates, such that some components of air are opaque to some frequencies and transparent to others. Radio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience the same effect.\n\nWater vapor reflects radar to a lesser extent than do water's other two phases. In the form of drops and ice crystals, water acts as a prism, which it does not do as an individual [[molecule]]; however, the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere causes the atmosphere to act as a giant prism.<ref>{{harvp|Skolnik|1990|pp=2.44\u20132.54}}</ref>\n\nA comparison of [[GOES-12]] satellite images shows the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the [[precipitable water]] or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MYDAL2_M_SKY_WV|title=Water Vapor |publisher=Global Maps|accessdate=February 26, 2016|date=2018-07-31 }}</ref>\n\nAs water vapour absorbs light in the visible spectral range, its absorption can be used in spectroscopic applications (such as [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy|DOAS]]) to determine the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.

From [[cloud physics]], usually clouds are the real generators of static [[electric charge|charge]] as found in Earth's atmosphere. The ability of clouds to hold massive amounts of electrical energy is directly related to the amount of water vapor present in the local system.\n\nThe amount of water vapor directly controls the [[permittivity]] of the air. During times of low humidity, static discharge is quick and easy. During times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur. Permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.<ref>{{harvp|Shadowitz|1975|pp=165\u2013171}}</ref>\n\nAfter a cloud, for instance, has started its way to becoming a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or [[electrical insulation|insulator]]) that decreases the ability of the cloud to [[electrostatic discharge|discharge]] its electrical energy. Over a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more [[static electricity]], the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy.<ref>{{harvp|Shadowitz|1975|pp=172\u2013173, 182, 414\u2013416}}</ref> This energy will be released to a local oppositely charged region, in the form of lightning.

He began working in private practice for several years while also holding large seminars for patients.\n\nMcGraw's fame began in 1998, when he began making weekly appearances on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. [[Oprah Winfrey]] then helped McGraw launch his own program, ''Dr. Phil'', in September 2002. The show is formatted as an advice show.

''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]''. He holds a doctorate in [[clinical psychology]]. However, he is not licensed to practice. McGraw first gained celebrity status with appearances on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in the late 1990s.\n\nRaised in the [[South Central United States]], McGraw played college football for the [[University of Tulsa]] and [[Midwestern State University]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[psychology]]. He then earned his [[Master of Arts]] in [[experimental psychology]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[clinical psychology]] from the [[University of North Texas]]. He began working in private practice for several years while also holding large seminars for patients.\n\nMcGraw's fame began in 1998, when he began making weekly appearances on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. [[Oprah Winfrey]] then helped McGraw launch his own program, ''Dr. Phil'', in September 2002. The show is formatted as an advice show. In October 2003, he launched the Dr. Phil Foundation which is dedicated toward fighting [[childhood obesity]].\n\n==Early life==\nMcGraw was born in [[Vinita, Oklahoma|Vinita]], Oklahoma, on September 1, 1950, the son of Joseph J.
