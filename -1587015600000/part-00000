They share responsibilities and resources. Intentional communities include [[cohousing]], residential [[trust (property)|land trusts]], [[ecovillage]]s, [[commune (intentional community)|commune]]s, [[kibbutz]]im, [[ashram]]s, and [[housing cooperative]]s. Typically, new members of an intentional community are selected by the community's existing membership, rather than by real estate agents or land owners (if the land is not owned by the community).<ref name=\"Ahomeincommunity\">{{cite web|title=AHI - Intentional Communities|url=http://www.ahomeincommunity.org/resources.html|website=A Home in Community|publisher=A Home in Community|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Hutterite, Austria (16th century) ===\n\nIn [[Hutterites|Hutterite]] communities housing units are built and assigned to individual families, but belong to the colony with little personal property. Meals are taken by the entire colony in a common long room.\n\n=== Oneida Community, [[Oneida, New York]] (1848) ===\nThe [[Oneida Community]] practiced ''[[Communalism]]'' (in the sense of communal property and possessions) and ''Mutual Criticism'', where every member of the community was subject to criticism by committee or the community as a whole, during a general meeting. The goal was to remove bad character traits.\n\n=== Kibbutz (1890) ===\n\nA [[Kibbutz]] is an [[Israel]]i collective community. The movement combines [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]] seeking a form of practical [[Labor Zionism]]. Choosing communal life, and inspired by their own ideology, kibbutz members developed a communal mode of living. The kibbutzim lasted for several generations as [[utopian]] communities, although most became capitalist enterprises and regular towns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-the-kibbutz-movement|title=The Kibbutz & Moshav: History & Overview|last=Rubinstein|first=Amnon|date=July 10, 2007|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref>\n\n===Indigenous Collaboration===\n\nCollaboration in indigenous communities, particularly in the Americas, often involves the entire community working toward a common goal in a horizontal structure with flexible leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching In to Family and Community Endeavors: An Orientation|journal=Human Development|volume=57|issue=2\u20133|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.1159/000356757|year=2014}}</ref> Children in some indigenous American communities collaborate with the adults.

According to Rand, participants in [[capitalism]] are connected through the voluntary division of labor in the free market, where value is exchanged always for value. Rand's theory of [[rational egoism]] claims that acting in one's self-interest entails looking out for others in order to protect the innocent from injustice, and to aid friends, allies, and loved ones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal|date=1966|author=Ayn Rand}}</ref>{{primary-inline|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Game theory===\n[[Game theory]] is a branch of applied mathematics, computer science, and economics that looks at situations where multiple players make decisions in an attempt to maximize their returns. The first documented discussion of game theory is in a letter written by [[James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave]] in 1713. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]]'s ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth'' in 1838 provided the first general theory. In 1928 it became a recognized field when [[John von Neumann]] published a series of papers. Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in the 1944 book The ''Theory of Games and Economic Behavior'' by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/|title=Game Theory|last=Ross|first=Don|date=December 9, 2014|origyear= January 25, 1997 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>\n\n===Military-industrial complex===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2007}}\nThe term [[military-industrial complex]] refers to a close and [[symbiotic]] relationship among a nation's [[armed forces]], its [[private industry]], and associated [[political]] interests. In such a system, the military is dependent on industry to supply material and other support, while the defense industry depends on government for revenue.\n\n=== Skunk Works ===\n[[Skunk Works]] is a term used in engineering and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with advanced or secret projects. One such group was created at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in 1943. The team developed highly innovative aircraft in short time frames, notably beating its first deadline by 37 days.<ref name=\"bennis_biederman\">Bennis, Warren and Patricia :Ward Biederman. ''Organizing Genius: The Secrets of Creative Collaboration.'' Perseus Books, 1997.</ref>\n\n=== Manhattan Project ===\nThe [[Manhattan Project]] was a collaborative project during [[World War II]] among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] that developed the first [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] . It was a collaborative effort by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]].\n\nThe value of this project as an influence on organized collaboration is attributed to [[Vannevar Bush]]. In early 1940, Bush lobbied for the creation of the [[National Defense Research Committee]]. Frustrated by previous bureaucratic failures in implementing technology in World War I, Bush sought to organize the scientific power of the United States for greater success.<ref name=\"bennis_biederman\" />\n\nThe project succeeded in developing and detonating three nuclear weapons in 1945: a [[nuclear testing|test detonation]] of a [[plutonium]] implosion bomb on July 16 (the [[Trinity test]]) near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]; an [[enriched uranium]] bomb code-named \"[[Little Boy]]\" on August 6 over [[Hiroshima]], Japan; and a second [[plutonium]] bomb, code-named \"[[Fat Man]]\" on August 9 over Nagasaki, Japan.\n\n===Project management===\n[[File:SS John W Brown.jpg|thumb|right|The 2,751 [[Liberty ship]]s built in four years by the United States during World War II required new approaches in organization and manufacturing]]\nAs a discipline, Project Management developed from different fields including construction, engineering and defense. In the United States, the forefather of project management is [[Henry Gantt]], who is known for his use of the [[Gantt chart|\"bar\" chart]] as a project management tool, for being an associate of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s theories of [[scientific management]] and for his study of the management of Navy ship building. His work is the forerunner to many modern project management tools including the [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) and resource allocation.\n\nThe 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era. Again, in the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an [[ad hoc]] basis using mostly [[Gantt chart]]s, and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical project scheduling models were developed: (1) the \"[[Program Evaluation and Review Technique]]\" or PERT, developed as part of the [[United States Navy]]'s (in conjunction with the [[Lockheed Corporation]]) [[Polaris missile]] submarine program;<ref>[http://www.boozallen.com/about/history/history_5 Booz Allen Hamilton - History of Booz Allen 1950s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607025332/http://www.boozallen.com/about/history/history_5 |date=2007-06-07 }}</ref> and (2) the \"[[Critical Path Method]]\" (CPM) developed in a joint venture by both [[DuPont|DuPont Corporation]] and [[Remington Rand|Remington Rand Corporation]] for managing plant maintenance projects. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.\n\nIn 1969, the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) was formed to serve the interest of the project management industry. The premise of PMI is that the tools and techniques of project management are common even among the widespread application of projects from the [[software industry]] to the construction industry. In 1981, the PMI Board of Directors authorized the development of what has become ''[[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge]]'' (PMBOK), standards and guidelines of practice that are widely used throughout the profession. The International Project Management Association (IPMA), founded in Europe in 1967, has undergone a similar development and instituted the IPMA Project Baseline. Both organizations are now participating in the development of a global project management standard.\n\nHowever, the exorbitant cost overruns and missed deadlines of large-scale infrastructure, military R&D/procurement and utility projects in the US demonstrates that these advances have not been able to overcome the challenges of such projects.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/07/us-has-epidemic-of-big-project-failures-will-watch-china-press-its-railgun-advantage.html|title=US has epidemic of big project failures \u2013 will watch China press its railgun advantage|date=2018-07-06|work=NextBigFuture.com|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Academia===\n\n==== Black Mountain College ====\nFounded in 1933 by [[John Andrew Rice]], Theodore Dreier and other former faculty of [[Rollins College]], [[Black Mountain College]] was experimental by nature and committed to an [[interdisciplinary]] approach, attracting a faculty which included leading visual artists, poets and designers.\n\nOperating in a relatively isolated rural location with little budget, Black Mountain fostered an informal and [[Collaborative writing|collaborative]] spirit. Innovations, relationships and unexpected connections formed at Black Mountain had a lasting influence on the postwar American art scene, [[high culture]] and eventually [[popular culture|pop culture]]. [[Buckminster Fuller]] met student [[Kenneth Snelson]] at Black Mountain, and the result was the first [[geodesic dome]] (improvised out of slats in the school's back yard); [[Merce Cunningham]] formed his dance company; and [[John Cage]] staged his first [[happening]].\n\nBlack Mountain College was a consciously directed [[liberal arts]] school that grew out of the [[progressive education|progressive education movement]]. In its day it was a unique educational experiment for the artists and writers who conducted it, and as such an important incubator for the American [[avant garde]].\n\n==== Learning ====\n[[File:Evergreen clocktower.jpg|thumb|right|The Evergreen signature clock tower]]\n:Dr. Wolff-Michael Roth and Stuart Lee of the [[University of Victoria]] assert<ref name=\"rothandlee\">{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = W-M. | last2 = Lee | first2 = Y-J. | year = 2006 | title = Contradictions in theorising and implementing communities in education | url = | journal = Educational Research Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201340 | doi=10.1016/j.edurev.2006.01.002}}</ref> that until the early 1990s the individual was the 'unit of instruction' and the focus of research.

For example, [[The Evergreen State College]], which is widely considered a pioneer in this area, established an intercollegiate learning community in 1984. In 1985, this same college established The Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education, which focuses on collaborative education approaches, including learning communities as one of its centerpieces. The school later became notorious for less-successful collaborations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/evergreen-copes-with-fallout-months-after-day-of-absence-sparked-national-debate|title=Evergreen copes with fallout, months after 'Day of Absence' sparked national debate|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-07|date=2018-01-07}}</ref>\n\n===Classical music===\n{{main|Classical music written in collaboration}}\n\nAlthough relatively rare compared with collaboration in popular music, there have been some notable examples of music written collaboratively by classical composers. Perhaps the best-known examples are:\n\n* ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]'', a set of [[Variation (music)|variations]] for solo [[piano]] on a theme from [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[I puritani]]''. It was written and first performed in 1837. The contributors were [[Franz Liszt]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], [[Carl Czerny]], [[Sigismond Thalberg]], [[Johann Peter Pixis]], and [[Henri Herz]].\n* The ''[[F-A-E Sonata]]'', a [[sonata]] for [[violin]] and piano, written in 1853 as a gift for the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. The composers were [[Albert Dietrich]] (first movement), [[Robert Schumann]] (second and fourth movements), and [[Johannes Brahms]] (third movement).\n\n==Occupational examples==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Arts===\n\n==== Figurative arts ====\nThe romanticized notion of a lone, genius artist has existed since the time of [[Giorgio Vasari]]\u2019s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', published in 1568. Vasari promulgated the idea that artistic skill was endowed upon chosen individuals by gods, which created an enduring and largely false popular misunderstanding of many artistic processes. Artists have used collaboration to complete large scale works for centuries, but the myth of the lone artist was not widely questioned until the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Stein, Judith. \"Collaboration.\" The Power of Feminist Art.

Ballet entails music, dancers, costumes, a venue, lighting, etc. Hypothetically, one person could control all of this, but most often every work of ballet is the by-product of collaboration. From the earliest formal works of ballet, to the great 19th century masterpieces of [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] and [[Marius Petipa]], to the 20th century masterworks of [[George Balanchine]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], to today\u2019s ballet companies, feature strong collaborative connections between choreographers, composers and costume designers are essential. Within dance as an art form, there is also the collaboration between choreographer and dancer. The choreographer creates a movement in her/his head and then physically demonstrates the movement to the dancer, which the dancer sees and attempts to either mimic or interpret.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://christopherbest.net/data/articles/dance%20theatre%20jounal.pdf|title=Choreographers and composers, why collaborate?|last=Best|first=Christopher|website=Christopher Best|access-date=2018-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140657/http://christopherbest.net/data/articles/dance%20theatre%20jounal.pdf|archive-date=2018-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Music ====\n{{main|Classical music written in collaboration}}\nMusical collaboration occurs when musicians in different places or groups work on the piece. Typically, multiple parties are involved (singers, songwriters, lyrisits, composers, and producers) come together to create one work. For example, one specific collaboration from recent times (2015) was the song \"[[FourFiveSeconds]]\". This single represents a type of collaboration because it was developed by pop idold [[Rihanna]], [[Paul McCartney]] (former bassist, composer and vocalist for [[The Beatles]]), and rapper/composer [[Kanye West]]. Websites and software  facilitate musical collaboration over the [[Internet]], resulting in the emergence of [[Online Bands]].\n\nSeveral awards exist specifically for collaboration in music:\n\n*[[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]\u2014awarded since 1988\n*[[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]]\u2014awarded since 1995\n*[[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]\u2014awarded since 2002\n\nCollaboration has been a constant feature of Electroacoustic Music, due to the technology's complexity. Embedding technological tools into the process stimulated the emergence of new agents with new expertise: the musical assistant, the technician, the computer music designer, the music mediator (a profession that has been described and defined in different ways over the years) \u2013 aiding with writing, creating new instruments, recording and/or performance. The musical assistant explains developments in musical research and translates artistic ideas into programming languages. Finally, he or she transforms those ideas into a score or a computer program and often performs the musical piece during the concerts.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/1029864915624136|title = A questionnaire-based investigation of the skills and roles of Computer Music Designers| journal=Musicae Scientiae| volume=20| issue=3| pages=436\u2013456|year = 2016|last1 = Zattra|first1 = Laura| last2=Donin| first2=Nicolas}}</ref> Examples of collaboration include [[Pierre Boulez]] and Andrew Gerzso, Alvise Vidolin and [[Luigi Nono]], [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)|Jonathan Harvey]] and Gilbert Nouno, among others.\n\n====Entertainment====\nCollaboration in entertainment dates from the origin of theatrical productions, millennia ago. It takes the form of writers, directors, actors, producers and other individuals or groups work on the same production. In the twenty-first century, new technology has enhanced collaboration. A system developed by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] for the TV series title ''Bar Karma'' on CurrentTV facilitates plot collaboration over the [[Internet]].

Many large companies adopt collaboration platforms to allow employees, customers and partners to intelligently connect and interact.\n\nEnterprise collaboration tools focus on encouraging [[collective intelligence]] and staff collaboration at the organization level, or with partners. These include features such as staff networking, expert recommendations, information sharing, expertise location, [[peer feedback]], and real-time collaboration. At the personal level, this enables employees to enhance social awareness and their profiles and interactions Collaboration encompasses both asynchronous and synchronous methods of communication and serves as an umbrella term for a wide variety of software packages. Perhaps the most commonly associated form of synchronous collaboration is web conferencing, but the term can encompass IP telephony, instant messaging, and rich video interaction with telepresence, as well.\n\nThe effectiveness of a collaborative effort is driven by three critical factors:\n\n* Communication\n* Content Management\n* Workflow\n\n==== The Internet ====\nThe Internet's low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made collaborative work dramatically easier. Not only can a group cheaply communicate, but the wide reach of the Internet allows groups to easily form, particularly among dispersed, niche participants. An example of this is the [[free software movement]] in software development which produced [[GNU]] and [[Linux]] from scratch and has taken over development of [[Mozilla]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] (formerly known as [[Netscape Communicator]] and [[StarOffice]]).\n\n==== Commons-based peer production ====\n[[Commons-based peer production]] is a term coined by [[Yale]] Law professor [[Yochai Benkler]] to describe a new model of economic production in which the creative energy of large numbers of people is coordinated (usually with the aid of the internet) into large, meaningful projects, mostly without hierarchical organization or financial compensation. He compares this to firm production (where a centralized decision process decides what has to be done and by whom) and [[Market economy|market-based production]] (when tagging different prices to different jobs serves as an attractor to anyone interested in doing the job).\n\nExamples of products created by means of commons-based peer production include [[Linux]], a [[computer]] [[operating system]]; [[Slashdot]], a news and announcements website; [[Kuro5hin]], a discussion site for technology and culture; [[Wikipedia]], an online [[encyclopedia]]; and [[Clickworkers]], a collaborative scientific work. Another example is [[Socialtext]], a software solution that uses tools such as wikis and weblogs and helps companies to create a collaborative work environment.\n\n==== Massively distributed collaboration ====\nThe term [[Mass collaboration|massively distributed collaboration]] was coined by [[Mitchell Kapor]], in a presentation at [[UC Berkeley]] on 2005-11-09, to describe an emerging activity of [[wiki]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s and [[blog]]s and other content-creating [[virtual communities]] online.\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|collaboration}}\n{{Wikiversity|Collaborative_play_writing}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Classical music written in collaboration]]\n* [[Collaborative editing]]\n* [[Collaborative governance]]\n* [[Collaborative innovation network]]\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Collaborative search engine]]\n* [[Collaborative software]]\n* [[Collaborative translation]]\n* [[Commons-based peer production]]\n* [[Community film]]\n* [[Conference call]]\n* [[Cooperative gameplay]]\n* [[Critical thinking]]\n* [[Crowdsourcing]]\n* [[Design thinking]]\n* [[Digital collaboration]]\n* [[Facilitation (business)|Facilitation]]\n* [[Intranet portal]]\n* [[Knowledge management]]\n* [[Learning circle]]\n* [[Postpartisan]]\n* [[Role-based collaboration]]\n* [[Sociality]]\n* [[Telepresence]]\n* ''[[The Culture of Collaboration]]''\n* [[Unorganisation]]\n* [[Wikinomics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daugherty, Patricia J, R.

According to Rand, participants in [[capitalism]] are connected through the voluntary division of labor in the free market, where value is exchanged always for value. Rand's theory of [[rational egoism]] claims that acting in one's self-interest entails looking out for others in order to protect the innocent from injustice, and to aid friends, allies, and loved ones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal|date=1966|author=Ayn Rand}}</ref>{{primary-inline|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Game theory===\n[[Game theory]] is a branch of applied mathematics, computer science, and economics that looks at situations where multiple players make decisions in an attempt to maximize their returns. The first documented discussion of game theory is in a letter written by [[James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave]] in 1713. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]]'s ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth'' in 1838 provided the first general theory. In 1928 it became a recognized field when [[John von Neumann]] published a series of papers. Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in the 1944 book The ''Theory of Games and Economic Behavior'' by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/|title=Game Theory|last=Ross|first=Don|date=December 9, 2014|origyear= January 25, 1997 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>\n\n===Military-industrial complex===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2007}}\nThe term [[military-industrial complex]] refers to a close and [[symbiotic]] relationship among a nation's [[armed forces]], its [[private industry]], and associated [[political]] interests. In such a system, the military is dependent on industry to supply material and other support, while the defense industry depends on government for revenue.\n\n=== Skunk Works ===\n[[Skunk Works]] is a term used in engineering and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with advanced or secret projects. One such group was created at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in 1943. The team developed highly innovative aircraft in short time frames, notably beating its first deadline by 37 days.<ref name=\"bennis_biederman\">Bennis, Warren and Patricia :Ward Biederman. ''Organizing Genius: The Secrets of Creative Collaboration.'' Perseus Books, 1997.</ref>\n\n=== Manhattan Project ===\nThe [[Manhattan Project]] was a collaborative project during [[World War II]] among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] that developed the first [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] . It was a collaborative effort by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]].\n\nThe value of this project as an influence on organized collaboration is attributed to [[Vannevar Bush]]. In early 1940, Bush lobbied for the creation of the [[National Defense Research Committee]]. Frustrated by previous bureaucratic failures in implementing technology in World War I, Bush sought to organize the scientific power of the United States for greater success.<ref name=\"bennis_biederman\" />\n\nThe project succeeded in developing and detonating three nuclear weapons in 1945: a [[nuclear testing|test detonation]] of a [[plutonium]] implosion bomb on July 16 (the [[Trinity test]]) near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]; an [[enriched uranium]] bomb code-named \"[[Little Boy]]\" on August 6 over [[Hiroshima]], Japan; and a second [[plutonium]] bomb, code-named \"[[Fat Man]]\" on August 9 over Nagasaki, Japan.\n\n===Project management===\n[[File:SS John W Brown.jpg|thumb|right|The 2,751 [[Liberty ship]]s built in four years by the United States during World War II required new approaches in organization and manufacturing]]\nAs a discipline, Project Management developed from different fields including construction, engineering and defense. In the United States, the forefather of project management is [[Henry Gantt]], who is known for his use of the [[Gantt chart|\"bar\" chart]] as a project management tool, for being an associate of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s theories of [[scientific management]] and for his study of the management of Navy ship building. His work is the forerunner to many modern project management tools including the [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) and resource allocation.\n\nThe 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era. Again, in the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an [[ad hoc]] basis using mostly [[Gantt chart]]s, and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical project scheduling models were developed: (1) the \"[[Program Evaluation and Review Technique]]\" or PERT, developed as part of the [[United States Navy]]'s (in conjunction with the [[Lockheed Corporation]]) [[Polaris missile]] submarine program;<ref>[http://www.boozallen.com/about/history/history_5 Booz Allen Hamilton - History of Booz Allen 1950s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607025332/http://www.boozallen.com/about/history/history_5 |date=2007-06-07 }}</ref> and (2) the \"[[Critical Path Method]]\" (CPM) developed in a joint venture by both [[DuPont|DuPont Corporation]] and [[Remington Rand|Remington Rand Corporation]] for managing plant maintenance projects. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.\n\nIn 1969, the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) was formed to serve the interest of the project management industry. The premise of PMI is that the tools and techniques of project management are common even among the widespread application of projects from the [[software industry]] to the construction industry. In 1981, the PMI Board of Directors authorized the development of what has become ''[[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge]]'' (PMBOK), standards and guidelines of practice that are widely used throughout the profession. The International Project Management Association (IPMA), founded in Europe in 1967, has undergone a similar development and instituted the IPMA Project Baseline. Both organizations are now participating in the development of a global project management standard.\n\nHowever, the exorbitant cost overruns and missed deadlines of large-scale infrastructure, military R&D/procurement and utility projects in the US demonstrates that these advances have not been able to overcome the challenges of such projects.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/07/us-has-epidemic-of-big-project-failures-will-watch-china-press-its-railgun-advantage.html|title=US has epidemic of big project failures \u2013 will watch China press its railgun advantage|date=2018-07-06|work=NextBigFuture.com|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Academia===\n\n==== Black Mountain College ====\nFounded in 1933 by [[John Andrew Rice]], Theodore Dreier and other former faculty of [[Rollins College]], [[Black Mountain College]] was experimental by nature and committed to an [[interdisciplinary]] approach, attracting a faculty which included leading visual artists, poets and designers.\n\nOperating in a relatively isolated rural location with little budget, Black Mountain fostered an informal and [[Collaborative writing|collaborative]] spirit. Innovations, relationships and unexpected connections formed at Black Mountain had a lasting influence on the postwar American art scene, [[high culture]] and eventually [[popular culture|pop culture]]. [[Buckminster Fuller]] met student [[Kenneth Snelson]] at Black Mountain, and the result was the first [[geodesic dome]] (improvised out of slats in the school's back yard); [[Merce Cunningham]] formed his dance company; and [[John Cage]] staged his first [[happening]].\n\nBlack Mountain College was a consciously directed [[liberal arts]] school that grew out of the [[progressive education|progressive education movement]]. In its day it was a unique educational experiment for the artists and writers who conducted it, and as such an important incubator for the American [[avant garde]].\n\n==== Learning ====\n[[File:Evergreen clocktower.jpg|thumb|right|The Evergreen signature clock tower]]\n:Dr. Wolff-Michael Roth and Stuart Lee of the [[University of Victoria]] assert<ref name=\"rothandlee\">{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = W-M. | last2 = Lee | first2 = Y-J. | year = 2006 | title = Contradictions in theorising and implementing communities in education | url = | journal = Educational Research Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201340 | doi=10.1016/j.edurev.2006.01.002}}</ref> that until the early 1990s the individual was the 'unit of instruction' and the focus of research.

For example, [[The Evergreen State College]], which is widely considered a pioneer in this area, established an intercollegiate learning community in 1984. In 1985, this same college established The Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education, which focuses on collaborative education approaches, including learning communities as one of its centerpieces. The school later became notorious for less-successful collaborations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/evergreen-copes-with-fallout-months-after-day-of-absence-sparked-national-debate|title=Evergreen copes with fallout, months after 'Day of Absence' sparked national debate|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-07|date=2018-01-07}}</ref>\n\n===Classical music===\n{{main|Classical music written in collaboration}}\n\nAlthough relatively rare compared with collaboration in popular music, there have been some notable examples of music written collaboratively by classical composers. Perhaps the best-known examples are:\n\n* ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]'', a set of [[Variation (music)|variations]] for solo [[piano]] on a theme from [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[I puritani]]''. It was written and first performed in 1837. The contributors were [[Franz Liszt]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], [[Carl Czerny]], [[Sigismond Thalberg]], [[Johann Peter Pixis]], and [[Henri Herz]].\n* The ''[[F-A-E Sonata]]'', a [[sonata]] for [[violin]] and piano, written in 1853 as a gift for the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. The composers were [[Albert Dietrich]] (first movement), [[Robert Schumann]] (second and fourth movements), and [[Johannes Brahms]] (third movement).\n\n==Occupational examples==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Arts===\n\n==== Figurative arts ====\nThe romanticized notion of a lone, genius artist has existed since the time of [[Giorgio Vasari]]\u2019s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', published in 1568. Vasari promulgated the idea that artistic skill was endowed upon chosen individuals by gods, which created an enduring and largely false popular misunderstanding of many artistic processes. Artists have used collaboration to complete large scale works for centuries, but the myth of the lone artist was not widely questioned until the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Stein, Judith. \"Collaboration.\" The Power of Feminist Art.

Ballet entails music, dancers, costumes, a venue, lighting, etc. Hypothetically, one person could control all of this, but most often every work of ballet is the by-product of collaboration. From the earliest formal works of ballet, to the great 19th century masterpieces of [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] and [[Marius Petipa]], to the 20th century masterworks of [[George Balanchine]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], to today\u2019s ballet companies, feature strong collaborative connections between choreographers, composers and costume designers are essential. Within dance as an art form, there is also the collaboration between choreographer and dancer. The choreographer creates a movement in her/his head and then physically demonstrates the movement to the dancer, which the dancer sees and attempts to either mimic or interpret.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://christopherbest.net/data/articles/dance%20theatre%20jounal.pdf|title=Choreographers and composers, why collaborate?|last=Best|first=Christopher|website=Christopher Best|access-date=2018-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140657/http://christopherbest.net/data/articles/dance%20theatre%20jounal.pdf|archive-date=2018-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Music ====\n{{main|Classical music written in collaboration}}\nMusical collaboration occurs when musicians in different places or groups work on the piece. Typically, multiple parties are involved (singers, songwriters, lyrisits, composers, and producers) come together to create one work. For example, one specific collaboration from recent times (2015) was the song \"[[FourFiveSeconds]]\". This single represents a type of collaboration because it was developed by pop idold [[Rihanna]], [[Paul McCartney]] (former bassist, composer and vocalist for [[The Beatles]]), and rapper/composer [[Kanye West]]. Websites and software  facilitate musical collaboration over the [[Internet]], resulting in the emergence of [[Online Bands]].\n\nSeveral awards exist specifically for collaboration in music:\n\n*[[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]\u2014awarded since 1988\n*[[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]]\u2014awarded since 1995\n*[[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]\u2014awarded since 2002\n\nCollaboration has been a constant feature of Electroacoustic Music, due to the technology's complexity. Embedding technological tools into the process stimulated the emergence of new agents with new expertise: the musical assistant, the technician, the computer music designer, the music mediator (a profession that has been described and defined in different ways over the years) \u2013 aiding with writing, creating new instruments, recording and/or performance. The musical assistant explains developments in musical research and translates artistic ideas into programming languages. Finally, he or she transforms those ideas into a score or a computer program and often performs the musical piece during the concerts.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/1029864915624136|title = A questionnaire-based investigation of the skills and roles of Computer Music Designers| journal=Musicae Scientiae| volume=20| issue=3| pages=436\u2013456|year = 2016|last1 = Zattra|first1 = Laura| last2=Donin| first2=Nicolas}}</ref> Examples of collaboration include [[Pierre Boulez]] and Andrew Gerzso, Alvise Vidolin and [[Luigi Nono]], [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)|Jonathan Harvey]] and Gilbert Nouno, among others.\n\n====Entertainment====\nCollaboration in entertainment dates from the origin of theatrical productions, millennia ago. It takes the form of writers, directors, actors, producers and other individuals or groups work on the same production. In the twenty-first century, new technology has enhanced collaboration. A system developed by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] for the TV series title ''Bar Karma'' on CurrentTV facilitates plot collaboration over the [[Internet]]. Screenwriter organizations bring together professional and amateur writers and filmmakers.\n\n=== Business ===\n{{See also|Management cybernetics}}\n\nCollaboration in business can be found both within and across organizations<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=Andreas B. |last2=Bell |first2=Simon J. |year=2008 |title=Managing Networks of Interorganizational Linkages and Sustainable Firm Performance in Business-to-Business Service Contexts |journal=Journal of Services Marketing |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=494\u2013504 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1747570&show=html |doi=10.1108/08876040810909631}}</ref> and ranges from [[partnership]] and [[crowd funding]] to the complexity of a [[multinational corporation]].

These include features such as staff networking, expert recommendations, information sharing, expertise location, [[peer feedback]], and real-time collaboration. At the personal level, this enables employees to enhance social awareness and their profiles and interactions Collaboration encompasses both asynchronous and synchronous methods of communication and serves as an umbrella term for a wide variety of software packages. Perhaps the most commonly associated form of synchronous collaboration is web conferencing, but the term can encompass IP telephony, instant messaging, and rich video interaction with telepresence, as well.\n\nThe effectiveness of a collaborative effort is driven by three critical factors:\n\n* Communication\n* Content Management\n* Workflow\n\n==== The Internet ====\nThe Internet's low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made collaborative work dramatically easier. Not only can a group cheaply communicate, but the wide reach of the Internet allows groups to easily form, particularly among dispersed, niche participants. An example of this is the [[free software movement]] in software development which produced [[GNU]] and [[Linux]] from scratch and has taken over development of [[Mozilla]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] (formerly known as [[Netscape Communicator]] and [[StarOffice]]).\n\n==== Commons-based peer production ====\n[[Commons-based peer production]] is a term coined by [[Yale]] Law professor [[Yochai Benkler]] to describe a new model of economic production in which the creative energy of large numbers of people is coordinated (usually with the aid of the internet) into large, meaningful projects, mostly without hierarchical organization or financial compensation. He compares this to firm production (where a centralized decision process decides what has to be done and by whom) and [[Market economy|market-based production]] (when tagging different prices to different jobs serves as an attractor to anyone interested in doing the job).\n\nExamples of products created by means of commons-based peer production include [[Linux]], a [[computer]] [[operating system]]; [[Slashdot]], a news and announcements website; [[Kuro5hin]], a discussion site for technology and culture; [[Wikipedia]], an online [[encyclopedia]]; and [[Clickworkers]], a collaborative scientific work. Another example is [[Socialtext]], a software solution that uses tools such as wikis and weblogs and helps companies to create a collaborative work environment.\n\n==== Massively distributed collaboration ====\nThe term [[Mass collaboration|massively distributed collaboration]] was coined by [[Mitchell Kapor]], in a presentation at [[UC Berkeley]] on 2005-11-09, to describe an emerging activity of [[wiki]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s and [[blog]]s and other content-creating [[virtual communities]] online.\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|collaboration}}\n{{Wikiversity|Collaborative_play_writing}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Classical music written in collaboration]]\n* [[Collaborative editing]]\n* [[Collaborative governance]]\n* [[Collaborative innovation network]]\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Collaborative search engine]]\n* [[Collaborative software]]\n* [[Collaborative translation]]\n* [[Commons-based peer production]]\n* [[Community film]]\n* [[Conference call]]\n* [[Cooperative gameplay]]\n* [[Critical thinking]]\n* [[Crowdsourcing]]\n* [[Design thinking]]\n* [[Digital collaboration]]\n* [[Facilitation (business)|Facilitation]]\n* [[Intranet portal]]\n* [[Knowledge management]]\n* [[Learning circle]]\n* [[Postpartisan]]\n* [[Role-based collaboration]]\n* [[Sociality]]\n* [[Telepresence]]\n* ''[[The Culture of Collaboration]]''\n* [[Unorganisation]]\n* [[Wikinomics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daugherty, Patricia J, R.

These groups are unaffiliated with registered political parties, are not registered with Elections Canada, and do not run candidates in Canadian federal elections. Essentially, these parliamentary groups are equivalent to political parties in the legislative context, but do not exist in an electoral capacity.\n\n====House of Commons====\nParliamentary groups in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] are typically made up of MPs that separate from a party over leadership conflicts. Notable past parliamentary groups in the House of Commons include the [[Ginger Group]] (1924-1932; split from [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]]), [[Democratic Representative Caucus]] (2001-2002; split from [[Canadian Alliance]]), and [[Qu\u00e9bec debout]] (2018; split from [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]).\n\n====Senate====\nThe [[Senate of Canada]] currently has three non-party [[parliamentary group]]s: the [[Independent Senators Group]] (ISG), the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]], and, as of November 4, 2019, the [[Canadian Senators Group]] (CSG). The Senate Liberal Caucus is made up of Senators who are personally members of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], but form a group that is organizationally and politically independent of both the Liberal Party structure and the Liberal caucus in the House of Commons. The ISG and the CSG include non-partisan senators who, while not sharing a cohesive ideology, platform, or membership in ''any'' political party, have formed a caucus to provide organizational support and better leverage parliamentary resources. Conservative senators remain formally affiliated with the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Additionally, on January 24, 2020, the Senate Liberal Caucus is expected to lose their status as an official Senate caucus when the caucus is reduced to eight senators with the retirement of Senator [[Joseph A. Day]]. A minimum of nine members is required for official caucus status which entitles the grouping to access to funding for a research budget and other supports and privileges.<ref name=\"nat-post-new-senate-bloc\">{{cite news |author1=Jesse Snyder |author2=Brian Platt |title=New Senate bloc looking to protect 'regional interests' could hamper Trudeau's efforts to pass legislation |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/new-senators-group-of-11-could-complicate-liberal-efforts-to-get-legislation-passed |accessdate=5 November 2019 |publisher=National Post |date=4 November 2019}}</ref> Additionally, [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] party member Senators [[Serge Joyal|Joyal]] and [[Lillian Dyck|Dyck]] will retire from the Senate on February 1, 2020, and August 24, 2020, respectively,<ref name=\"sen-list-sen-canada\">{{cite web |title=Senators List |url=https://sencanada.ca/en/senators-list/ |website=Senate of Canada |accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref> which means that the soon-to-be unofficial parliamentary group will be further reduced to six Senators, who would then be officially styled as non-affiliated Senators regardless of an unofficial parliamentary grouping they ''may'' or ''may not'' opt to maintain.<ref name=\"sen-list-sen-canada\" />\n\nFacing extinction, on November 14, 2019, Senator [[Joseph A. Day|Joseph Day]] announced during a press conference that the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]] had been officially disbanded, with its current complement of nine members forming a brand new, non-partisan [[Parliamentary group|parliamentary group]] in the Progressive Senate Group. Unlike the [[Independent Senators Group]] (ISG) and newly-formed [[Canadian Senators Group]], which impose either prohibitions or limits, respectively, on outside partisan activities, there was no mention that the new Progressive Senate Group would have similar limits; however, Senator [[Joseph A. Day|Day]] confirmed that, like the aforementioned two groups, the PSG would not have whipped votes, and the requirements of membership included supporting or holding \"progressive\" political values, support of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and supporting a new relationship with Canada's Indigenous peoples.<ref name=\"new-senate-can-faction-14nov2019\">{{cite news |last1=Tasker |first1=John Paul (J.P.) |title=There's another new faction in the Senate: the Progressive Senate Group |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/new-faction-progressive-senate-group-1.5358269 |accessdate=14 November 2019 |publisher=CBC News Online |date=14 November 2019}}</ref> With this dissolution, as of November 14, 2019, the Canadian Senate no longer has a Liberal Senator, the first time since Canada's confederation in 1867.<ref name=\"new-senate-can-faction-14nov2019\" /> On November 18, Percy Downe left to join the [[Canadian Senators Group]].

It was founded as the Communist Party of Canada in 1921. From 1938 until 1943 its candidates ran under the banner Unity or United Progressive. In 1943 it adopted the name [[Labor-Progressive Party]]. It won one seat under this name in 1945. In 1959 it reverted to the name Communist Party of Canada and has kept that name to the present.\n\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada unofficially uses the name \"Communist Party of Canada (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\", but Elections Canada does not allow it to be registered by that name because of potential confusion with the Communist Party of Canada.\n\n;Labour Party\nLabour Party candidates ran under numerous different designations:\n* Conservative-Labour (1872-1875)\n* Farmer Labour\n* Farmer-United Labour\n* Labour-Farmer\n* [[Liberal-Labour (Canada)|Liberal-Labour]] (1926-1968)\n* National Labour (1940)\n* United Farmers-Labour (1920)\n* United Farmers of Ontario-Labour (1919-1940)\n\n;Liberal Party\nDuring Robert Borden's coalition government of 1917-1920, the Liberal Party of Canada split into two groups: the [[Liberal\u2013Unionist]] who supported the coalition and the [[Laurier Liberals]] who opposed it.\n\n;Liberal-Progressive\nSome Liberal-Progressive candidates used the designations:\n*Liberal-Labour-Progressive or\n*National Liberal Progressive.\n\n;New Democratic Party\nThe Co-operative Commonwealth Federation used the name [[New Party (Canada)|New Party]] from 1958-1961 while it was transitioning to become the New Democratic Party. In French, the party used a literal translation of its name, ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Commonwealth Coop\u00e9ratif'', from until 1955.\n\n;Progressive Conservative Party\nThe first Conservative Party used several different names during its existence:\n*[[Liberal-Conservative Party]] (some MPs until 1911),\n*[[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist Party]] (1917-1921),\n*[[National Liberal and Conservative Party]] (1920-1921),\n*National Government (1940),\n*[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] (1942-2003)\n\nThe second (and current) Conservative Party of Canada was a merger of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party.\n\n;Progressive Party and United Farmers\nSome candidates for the Progressive Party of Canada used United Farmer designations:\n*[[Farmer (Party)|Farmer]] (1925 & 1930),\n*[[United Farmers of Canada]],\n*[[United Farmers of Alberta]], or\n*[[United Farmers of Ontario]].\n\n;Rhinoceros Party\nThe first Rhinoceros Party disbanded in 1993. When it was revived in 2006 it used the name \"neorhino.ca\". The party changed its name to Rhinoceros Party in 2010.\n\n;Social Credit Party and ''Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste''\nSome ''Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste'' used the name ''Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes'' from 1963 to 1967. One candidate used the designation ''Candidats des \u00e9lecteurs'' in 1957 and 1958. Others used the name Union des \u00e9lecteurs, although this was never formally registered.\n\nIn the 1940 election, 17 candidates ran jointly with the Social Credit Party under the name [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canada|Politics}}\n*[[Federal political financing in Canada]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Elections in Canada}}\n{{Canadian federal political parties}}\n{{Lists of political parties in Canada}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&dir=par&document=index&lang=e\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Federal Political Parties In Canada}}\n[[Category:Canada politics-related lists|Political parties]]\n[[Category:Lists of political parties in Canada|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=January 2019}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2018}}\n}}\nIn contrast with the political party systems of many nations, Canadian political parties at the federal level are often only loosely connected with parties at the provincial level, despite having similar names and policy positions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Christian|first1=William|last2=Jansen|first2=Harold|title=Party System|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/party-system|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=November 7, 2018|language=en|date=December 11, 2015|quote=Although there are often provincial parties with similar names or aims as national political parties, Canadian parties are not generally well-integrated...

Essentially, these parliamentary groups are equivalent to political parties in the legislative context, but do not exist in an electoral capacity.\n\n====House of Commons====\nParliamentary groups in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] are typically made up of MPs that separate from a party over leadership conflicts. Notable past parliamentary groups in the House of Commons include the [[Ginger Group]] (1924-1932; split from [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]]), [[Democratic Representative Caucus]] (2001-2002; split from [[Canadian Alliance]]), and [[Qu\u00e9bec debout]] (2018; split from [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]).\n\n====Senate====\nThe [[Senate of Canada]] currently has three non-party [[parliamentary group]]s: the [[Independent Senators Group]] (ISG), the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]], and, as of November 4, 2019, the [[Canadian Senators Group]] (CSG). The Senate Liberal Caucus is made up of Senators who are personally members of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], but form a group that is organizationally and politically independent of both the Liberal Party structure and the Liberal caucus in the House of Commons. The ISG and the CSG include non-partisan senators who, while not sharing a cohesive ideology, platform, or membership in ''any'' political party, have formed a caucus to provide organizational support and better leverage parliamentary resources. Conservative senators remain formally affiliated with the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Additionally, on January 24, 2020, the Senate Liberal Caucus is expected to lose their status as an official Senate caucus when the caucus is reduced to eight senators with the retirement of Senator [[Joseph A. Day]]. A minimum of nine members is required for official caucus status which entitles the grouping to access to funding for a research budget and other supports and privileges.<ref name=\"nat-post-new-senate-bloc\">{{cite news |author1=Jesse Snyder |author2=Brian Platt |title=New Senate bloc looking to protect 'regional interests' could hamper Trudeau's efforts to pass legislation |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/new-senators-group-of-11-could-complicate-liberal-efforts-to-get-legislation-passed |accessdate=5 November 2019 |publisher=National Post |date=4 November 2019}}</ref> Additionally, [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] party member Senators [[Serge Joyal|Joyal]] and [[Lillian Dyck|Dyck]] will retire from the Senate on February 1, 2020, and August 24, 2020, respectively,<ref name=\"sen-list-sen-canada\">{{cite web |title=Senators List |url=https://sencanada.ca/en/senators-list/ |website=Senate of Canada |accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref> which means that the soon-to-be unofficial parliamentary group will be further reduced to six Senators, who would then be officially styled as non-affiliated Senators regardless of an unofficial parliamentary grouping they ''may'' or ''may not'' opt to maintain.<ref name=\"sen-list-sen-canada\" />\n\nFacing extinction, on November 14, 2019, Senator [[Joseph A. Day|Joseph Day]] announced during a press conference that the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]] had been officially disbanded, with its current complement of nine members forming a brand new, non-partisan [[Parliamentary group|parliamentary group]] in the Progressive Senate Group. Unlike the [[Independent Senators Group]] (ISG) and newly-formed [[Canadian Senators Group]], which impose either prohibitions or limits, respectively, on outside partisan activities, there was no mention that the new Progressive Senate Group would have similar limits; however, Senator [[Joseph A. Day|Day]] confirmed that, like the aforementioned two groups, the PSG would not have whipped votes, and the requirements of membership included supporting or holding \"progressive\" political values, support of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and supporting a new relationship with Canada's Indigenous peoples.<ref name=\"new-senate-can-faction-14nov2019\">{{cite news |last1=Tasker |first1=John Paul (J.P.) |title=There's another new faction in the Senate: the Progressive Senate Group |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/new-faction-progressive-senate-group-1.5358269 |accessdate=14 November 2019 |publisher=CBC News Online |date=14 November 2019}}</ref> With this dissolution, as of November 14, 2019, the Canadian Senate no longer has a Liberal Senator, the first time since Canada's confederation in 1867.<ref name=\"new-senate-can-faction-14nov2019\" /> On November 18, Percy Downe left to join the [[Canadian Senators Group]].

In French, the party used a literal translation of its name, ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Commonwealth Coop\u00e9ratif'', from until 1955.\n\n;Progressive Conservative Party\nThe first Conservative Party used several different names during its existence:\n*[[Liberal-Conservative Party]] (some MPs until 1911),\n*[[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist Party]] (1917-1921),\n*[[National Liberal and Conservative Party]] (1920-1921),\n*National Government (1940),\n*[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] (1942-2003)\n\nThe second (and current) Conservative Party of Canada was a merger of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party.\n\n;Progressive Party and United Farmers\nSome candidates for the Progressive Party of Canada used United Farmer designations:\n*[[Farmer (Party)|Farmer]] (1925 & 1930),\n*[[United Farmers of Canada]],\n*[[United Farmers of Alberta]], or\n*[[United Farmers of Ontario]].\n\n;Rhinoceros Party\nThe first Rhinoceros Party disbanded in 1993. When it was revived in 2006 it used the name \"neorhino.ca\". The party changed its name to Rhinoceros Party in 2010.\n\n;Social Credit Party and ''Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste''\nSome ''Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste'' used the name ''Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes'' from 1963 to 1967. One candidate used the designation ''Candidats des \u00e9lecteurs'' in 1957 and 1958. Others used the name Union des \u00e9lecteurs, although this was never formally registered.\n\nIn the 1940 election, 17 candidates ran jointly with the Social Credit Party under the name [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canada|Politics}}\n*[[Federal political financing in Canada]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Elections in Canada}}\n{{Canadian federal political parties}}\n{{Lists of political parties in Canada}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&dir=par&document=index&lang=e\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Federal Political Parties In Canada}}\n[[Category:Canada politics-related lists|Political parties]]\n[[Category:Lists of political parties in Canada|*]]\n", "name_user": "Chad The Goatman", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing a table error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_parties_in_Canada"}

On March 3, 1991, King was subdued by LAPD officers during his arrest for fleeing and resisting arrest on [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|California State Route 210]]. A civilian, George Holliday, filmed the incident from his nearby balcony and sent the footage to local news station [[KTLA]]. The footage clearly showed King being aggressively subdued by the LAPD, though it didn't show his resisting and attacking officers, and the incident was covered by news media around the world.\n\nThe four officers were tried on charges of use of [[police brutality]]; three were [[Acquittal|acquitted]], and the jury failed to reach a verdict on one charge for the fourth. Within hours of the acquittals, the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] started, sparked by outrage among African Americans over the trial's verdict and related, longstanding social issues. The rioting lasted six days and killed 63 people with 2,383 more injured; it ended only after the [[California Army National Guard]], the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]] provided reinforcements to re-establish control.\n\nThe federal government [[Prosecutor|prosecuted]] a separate civil rights case, obtaining [[grand jury]] indictments of the four officers for violations of King's civil rights. Their trial in a federal district court ended on April 16, 1993, with two of the officers being found guilty and sentenced to serve prison terms. The other two were acquitted of the charges. In a separate suit, the city of Los Angeles awarded King $3.8 million in damages. He attempted to start a business, but was not successful.\n\nIn 2012, he was found dead in his swimming pool two months after publishing his memoir; the coroner found evidence of alcohol and drugs in his system and ruled these and his history of heart problems had likely resulted in an accidental drowning.\n\n==Early life==\nKing was born in [[Sacramento, California]] in 1965, the son of Ronald and Odessa King. He and his four siblings grew up in [[Altadena, California]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rodney King, L.A. police beating victim, dies|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/06/17/MN9T1P3FSA.DTL|accessdate=June 25, 2018|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=June 18, 2012|first=Washington|last=Post}}</ref><ref name=\"Indy\">{{cite news |title=Profile: An icon, anxious and shy: Rodney King \u2013 As he awaits a new trial of the police who beat him, Rodney King has become a hero, a demon, and a gold mine. |author=Phil Reeves |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/profile-an-icon-anxious-and-shy-rodney-king--as-he-awaits-a-new-trial-of-the-police-who-beat-him-rodney-king-has-become-a-hero-a-demon-and-a-gold-mine-phil-reeves-reports-1474406.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=February 21, 1993 |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |location=London}}</ref> King attended John Muir High School and often talked about being inspired by his social science teacher, Robert E.

African-Americans were outraged by the verdicts and began rioting in the streets along with the Latino communities. By the time law enforcement, the [[California Army National Guard]], the [[United States Army]], and the [[United States Marine Corps]] restored order, the riots had resulted in 63 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses.

On May 7, federal prosecutors began presenting evidence to the federal grand jury in Los Angeles. On August 4, the grand jury returned indictments against the three officers for \"willfully and intentionally using unreasonable force\" and against Sergeant Koon for \"willfully permitting and failing to take action to stop the unlawful assault\" on King. Based on these indictments, a trial of the four officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California began on February 25, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Doug|title=The Trials of Los Angeles Police Officers' in Connection with the Beating of Rodney King|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/lapdaccount.html|publisher=law2.umkc.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2014|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nThe federal trial focused more on the incident.{{clarify|reason=Meaning?|date=September 2018}} On March 9 of the 1993 trial, King took the witness stand and described to the jury the events as he remembered them.<ref name=March9>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/us/rodney-king-testifies-on-beating-i-was-just-trying-to-stay-alive.html | title=Rodney King Testifies on Beating: 'I Was Just Trying to Stay Alive' | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 10, 2003 | last=Mydans | first=Seth | accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> The jury found Officer [[Laurence Powell]] and Sergeant [[Stacey Koon]] guilty, and they were subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison.

He strongly criticized King, who he said provoked the officers' initial actions. Davies said that only the final six or so baton blows by Powell were unlawful. The first 55 seconds of the videotaped portion of the incident, during which the vast majority of the blows were delivered, was within the law because the officers were attempting to subdue a suspect who was resisting efforts to take him into custody.<ref name=\"LAT19930805\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-koon-powell-get-two-and-half-years-in-prison-19930805-story.html |title=Koon, Powell get two and half years in prison |last=Newton |first=Jim |date=August 5, 1993 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=March 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDavies found that King's provocative behavior began with his \"remarkable consumption of alcoholic beverage\" and continued through a high-speed chase, refusal to submit to police orders, and an aggressive charge toward Powell. Davies made several findings in support of the officers' version of events.<ref name=\"LAT19930805\"/> He concluded that Officer Powell never intentionally struck King in the head, and \"Powell's baton blow that broke King's leg was not illegal because King was still resisting and rolling around on the ground, and breaking bones in resistant suspects is permissible under police policy.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.policeone.com/less-lethal/articles/3419781-Rodney-King-20-years-later/ |title=Rodney King, 20 years later |last=Meyer |first=Greg |date=March 10, 2011 |website=PoliceOne |language=en |access-date=March 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMitigation cited by the judge in determining the length of the prison sentence included the suffering the officers had undergone because of the extensive publicity their case had received, high legal bills that were still unpaid, the impending loss of their careers as police officers, their higher risks of abuse while in prison, and their undergoing two trials. The judge acknowledged that the two trials did not legally constitute double jeopardy, but nonetheless raised \"the specter of unfairness\".<ref name=\"LAT19930805\"/>\n\nThese mitigations were critical to the validity of the sentences imposed, because federal sentencing guidelines called for much longer prison terms in the range of 70 to 87 months. The low sentences were controversial, and were appealed by the prosecution. In a 1994 ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected all the grounds cited by Judge Davies and extended the terms. The case was appealed by the defense to the U.S. Supreme Court. Both Koon and Powell were released from prison while they appealed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, having served their original 30-month sentences with time off for good behavior. On June 14, 1996, the high court reversed the lower court in a ruling, unanimous in its most important aspects, which gave a strong endorsement to judicial discretion, even under sentencing guidelines intended to produce uniformity.<ref>{{Cite news|title = THE SUPREME COURT: SENTENCING;Court Upholds Sentence in King Case|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/us/the-supreme-court-sentencing-court-upholds-sentence-in-king-case.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = June 14, 1996|access-date = October 5, 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Linda|last = Greenhouse}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:CynthiaKelleyRodneyKingApr2012.jpg|thumb|right|King with fianc\u00e9e Cynthia Kelly in April 2012, two months before his death.

On March 3, 1991, King was violently beaten by LAPD officers during his arrest for fleeing and resisting arrest on [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|California State Route 210]]. A civilian, George Holliday, filmed the incident from his nearby balcony and sent the footage to local news station [[KTLA]]. The footage clearly showed King being beaten repeatedly, and the incident was covered by news media around the world.\n\nThe four officers were tried on charges of use of [[police brutality]]; three were [[Acquittal|acquitted]], and the jury failed to reach a verdict on one charge for the fourth. Within hours of the acquittals, the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] started, sparked by outrage among African Americans over the trial's verdict and related, longstanding social issues. The rioting lasted six days and killed 63 people with 2,383 more injured; it ended only after the [[California Army National Guard]], the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]] provided reinforcements to re-establish control.\n\nThe federal government [[Prosecutor|prosecuted]] a separate civil rights case, obtaining [[grand jury]] indictments of the four officers for violations of King's civil rights. Their trial in a federal district court ended on April 16, 1993, with two of the officers being found guilty and sentenced to serve prison terms. The other two were acquitted of the charges. In a separate suit, the city of Los Angeles awarded King $3.8 million in damages. He attempted to start a business, but was not successful.\n\nIn 2012, he was found dead in his swimming pool two months after publishing his memoir; the coroner found evidence of alcohol and drugs in his system and ruled these and his history of heart problems had likely resulted in an accidental drowning.\n\n==Early life==\nKing was born in [[Sacramento, California]] in 1965, the son of Ronald and Odessa King. He and his four siblings grew up in [[Altadena, California]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rodney King, L.A. police beating victim, dies|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/06/17/MN9T1P3FSA.DTL|accessdate=June 25, 2018|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=June 18, 2012|first=Washington|last=Post}}</ref><ref name=\"Indy\">{{cite news |title=Profile: An icon, anxious and shy: Rodney King \u2013 As he awaits a new trial of the police who beat him, Rodney King has become a hero, a demon, and a gold mine. |author=Phil Reeves |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/profile-an-icon-anxious-and-shy-rodney-king--as-he-awaits-a-new-trial-of-the-police-who-beat-him-rodney-king-has-become-a-hero-a-demon-and-a-gold-mine-phil-reeves-reports-1474406.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=February 21, 1993 |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |location=London}}</ref> King attended John Muir High School and often talked about being inspired by his social science teacher, Robert E.

Davies made several findings in support of the officers' version of events.<ref name=\"LAT19930805\"/> He concluded that Officer Powell never intentionally struck King in the head, and \"Powell's baton blow that broke King's leg was not illegal because King was still resisting and rolling around on the ground, and breaking bones in resistant suspects is permissible under police policy.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.policeone.com/less-lethal/articles/3419781-Rodney-King-20-years-later/ |title=Rodney King, 20 years later |last=Meyer |first=Greg |date=March 10, 2011 |website=PoliceOne |language=en |access-date=March 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMitigation cited by the judge in determining the length of the prison sentence included the suffering the officers had undergone because of the extensive publicity their case had received, high legal bills that were still unpaid, the impending loss of their careers as police officers, their higher risks of abuse while in prison, and their undergoing two trials. The judge acknowledged that the two trials did not legally constitute double jeopardy, but nonetheless raised \"the specter of unfairness\".<ref name=\"LAT19930805\"/>\n\nThese mitigations were critical to the validity of the sentences imposed, because federal sentencing guidelines called for much longer prison terms in the range of 70 to 87 months. The low sentences were controversial, and were appealed by the prosecution. In a 1994 ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected all the grounds cited by Judge Davies and extended the terms. The case was appealed by the defense to the U.S. Supreme Court. Both Koon and Powell were released from prison while they appealed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, having served their original 30-month sentences with time off for good behavior. On June 14, 1996, the high court reversed the lower court in a ruling, unanimous in its most important aspects, which gave a strong endorsement to judicial discretion, even under sentencing guidelines intended to produce uniformity.<ref>{{Cite news|title = THE SUPREME COURT: SENTENCING;Court Upholds Sentence in King Case|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/us/the-supreme-court-sentencing-court-upholds-sentence-in-king-case.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = June 14, 1996|access-date = October 5, 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Linda|last = Greenhouse}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:CynthiaKelleyRodneyKingApr2012.jpg|thumb|right|King with fianc\u00e9e Cynthia Kelly in April 2012, two months before his death.

As described in the 1994 <nowiki>RFC</nowiki> 1737,{{sfnp|RFC 1737|1994}}, and later in the 1997 <nowiki>RFC</nowiki> 2141 {{sfnp|RFC 2141|1997}}, URNs were distinguished from URLs, which identify resources by specifying their locations in the context of a particular access protocol, such as [[HTTP]] or [[FTP]]. In  contrast, URNs were conceived as [[Persistent identifier|persistent]], location-independent identifiers assigned within defined [[namespace]]s, typically by an authority responsible for the namespace, so that they are globally unique and persistent over long periods of time, even after the resource which they identify ceases to exist or becomes unavailable.{{sfnp|RFC 8141|2017}}  \n\nURCs never progressed past the conceptual stage,{{sfnp|W3C/IETF|2001}} and other technologies such as the [[Resource Description Framework]] later took their place.  Since <nowiki>RFC</nowiki> 3986{{sfnp|RFC 3986|2005}} in 2005, use of the terms \"Uniform Resource Name\" and \"Uniform Resource Locator\" has been deprecated in technical standards in favor of the term Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which encompasses both, a view proposed in 2001 by a joint working group between the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) and [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).{{sfnp|W3C/IETF|2001}}\n\nA URI is a [[character string (computer science)|string]] of [[character (computing)|character]]s used to [[identifier|identify]] a [[name]]  or [[web resource|resource]]. URIs are used in many Internet protocols to refer to and access information resources. URI schemes include the familiar <code>http</code>, as well as hundreds of others.\n\nIn the \"contemporary view\", as it is called, all URIs identify or name resources, perhaps uniquely and persistently, with some of them also being \"locators\" which are resolvable in conjunction with a specified protocol to a representation of the resources.\n\nOther URIs are not locators and are not necessarily resolvable within the bounds of the systems where they are found.  These URIs may serve as names or identifiers of resources.  Since resources can move, opaque identifiers which ''are not'' locators and are not bound to particular locations are arguably more likely than identifiers which ''are'' locators to remain unique and persistent over time.  But whether a URI is resolvable depends on many operational and practical details, irrespective of whether it is called a \"name\" or a \"locator\". In the contemporary view, there is no bright line between \"names\" and \"locators\".\n\nIn accord with this way of thinking, the distinction between Uniform Resource ''Names'' and Uniform Resource ''Locators'' is now no longer used in formal [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] technical standards, though the latter term, URL, is still in wide informal use.\n\nThe term \"URN\" continues now as one of more than a hundred URI \"schemes\", <code>urn:</code>, paralleling <code>http:</code>, <code>ftp:</code>, and so forth.  URIs of the <code>urn:</code> scheme are not locators, are not required to be associated with a particular protocol or access method, and need not be resolvable. They should be assigned by a procedure which provides some assurance that they will remain unique and identify the same resource persistently over a prolonged period.  Some namespaces under the <code>urn:</code> scheme, such as <code>[[UUID|urn:uuid:]]</code> assign identifiers in a manner which does not require a registration authority, but most of them do. A typical URN namespace is <code>[[ISBN|urn:isbn]]</code>, for International Standard Book Numbers.  This view is continued in the 2017 <nowiki>RFC</nowiki> 8141 {{sfnp|RFC 8141|2017}}.\n\nThere are other URI schemes, such as <code>[[Tag URI scheme|tag:]]</code>, <code>[[Info URI scheme|info:]]</code> (now largely deprecated), and <code>ni:</code><ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920 |title=Naming Things with Hashes}}</ref> which are similar to the <code>urn:</code> scheme in not being locators and not being associated with particular resolution or access protocols.\n\n==Syntax==\nThe syntax of a urn: scheme URI is represented in the [[augmented Backus\u2013Naur form]] as:{{sfnp|RFC 8141, section 2|2017}}\n\n<source lang=\"abnf\">\n      namestring    = assigned-name\n                      [ rq-components ]\n                      [ \"#\" f-component ]\n      assigned-name = \"urn\" \":\" NID \":\" NSS\n      NID           = (alphanum) 0*30(ldh) (alphanum)\n      ldh           = alphanum / \"-\"\n      NSS           = pchar *(pchar / \"/\")\n      rq-components = [ \"?+\" r-component ]\n                      [ \"?=\" q-component ]\n      r-component   = pchar *( pchar / \"/\" / \"?\" )\n      q-component   = pchar *( pchar / \"/\" / \"?\" )\n      f-component   = fragment\n</source>or, in the form of a [[syntax diagram]], as:\n\n[[File:URN_syntax_diagram_-_namestring.png|800x800px|URN syntax diagram - namestring]]\n\n* The leading scheme ({{code|urn:}})  is case-insensitive.\n* {{code|<NID>}} is the namespace identifier, and may include letters, digits, and <code>-</code>.\n* The NID is followed by the namespace-specific string {{code|<NSS>}}, the interpretation of which depends on the specified namespace. The NSS may contain ASCII letters and digits, and many punctuation and special characters. Disallowed ASCII and [[Unicode]] characters may be included if [[percent-encoded]].\n\nIn 2017 the syntax for URNs was updated as follows:{{sfnp|RFC 8141|2017}}\n\n* The slash character (<code>/</code>) is now allowed in the NSS to represent names containing slashes from non-URN identifier systems.\n* The q-component was added to enable passing of parameters to named resources.\n* The r-component was added to enable passing of parameters to resolvers.  However, the updated specification notes that the r-component should not be used until its semantics are defined via further standardization.\n\n==Namespaces==\nIn order to ensure the global uniqueness of URN namespaces, their identifiers (NIDs) are required to be registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]. Registered namespaces may be \"formal\" or \"informal\". An exception to the registration requirement was formerly made for \"experimental namespaces\"{{sfnp|RFC 3406|2002}}, since rescinded by <nowiki>RFC</nowiki> 8141.{{sfnp|RFC 8141|2017}}\n\n===Formal===\nApproximately sixty formal URN namespace identifiers have been registered.
