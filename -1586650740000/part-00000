Radio X launched nationally on 21 September 2015 as a rebrand of '''Xfm''' and superseded Xfm London and [[Xfm Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/09/radio-x-confirmed-in-single-chris-moyles-tweet/|title=Radio X confirmed in single Chris Moyles tweet|date=6 September 2015|work=RadioToday}}</ref>\n\nThe station has employed a number of DJs that have since gone on to greater fame including [[Russell Brand]], [[Karl Pilkington]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Stephen Merchant]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[Christian O'Connell]], [[Justin Lee Collins]], [[Adam and Joe]], [[Alex Zane]], [[Tim Lovejoy]], [[Dermot O'Leary]] and [[Josh Widdicombe]].\n\n==History==\nXfm was created in London in 1992 by Sammy Jacob (who founded its precursor Q102)<ref>{{cite news|title=My Life In Media: Sammy Jacob|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-life-in-media-sammy-jacob-842666.html|accessdate=1 November 2009|work=The Independent|date=8 June 2008}}</ref> and [[Chris Parry (producer)|Chris Parry]]. The station became full-time on 1 September 1997. During the following year the station played a range of music from its studios in 97 [[Charlotte Street]]. Jacob would later go on to co-found [[NME Radio]] and CDNX (Camden Experience) in 2008 and 2015 respectively.\n\nIn 1998, Xfm was acquired by the [[GCap Media|Capital Radio Group]] (now part of [[Global Radio]]) and relocated from Charlotte Street to Capital's headquarters at [[Leicester Square]], where it remains today. On 23 August of that year, Xfm was closed down for four days, during which a test tape featuring mainstream soft-rock acts was looped. The station subsequently relaunched with a more mainstream format, and a new advert featuring a cartoon radio saying \"Don't be afraid!\", which referred to the perceived inaccessibility of its old format.{{according to whom|date=March 2015}} The soft-rock revamp was not a success, culminating in listener-led protests outside the Capital Radio studios. Listeners also lodged objections with the [[Radio Authority]], which found XFM to be acting in a manner contrary to its licence requirements, and a degree of alternative output was eventually restored, particularly through night-time playlists and specialist shows.{{according to whom|date=March 2015}}\n\nFollowing the take-over by Capital, the station dropped its wide-ranging music policy, which was replaced by a format based on USA college stations. The first audience figures after this change showed a sharp decline. The DJs were no longer able to select some of their own tracks, and specialist shows were dropped. The station soon became more male-orientated and featured [[Association football|football]] coverage and \"laddish\" output. This came to an end after the Radio Authority fined XFM \u00a350,000 for breakfast presenter [[Tom Binns]]'s joking about [[bestiality]] on air.\n\nCapital Radio attempted to increase XFM's listening figures, recruiting DJs such as [[Zoe Ball]], former [[BBC Radio 1]] presenter, and re-recruiting comedians [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]] who took voluntary redundancy when Capital bought the station, after the pair rose to significance with the first airing of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Together with talent such as [[Zane Lowe]] and [[Christian O'Connell]], this yielded growing listening figures. The music was, and is today, a play-listed mix of popular indie and soft rock.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} \n\nHost John Kennedy is the only member of the current presenter lineup that has been with the radio station since its very first broadcasts. <ref>https://completemusicupdate.com/article/qa-john-kennedy-xfm/</ref> His new music show, X-Posure is the station's longest running show and is credited as being the first to give radio play to artists including [[Adele]], [[Florence and the Machine]], [[Razorlight]] and [[Mumford & Sons]].<ref>https://www.radiox.co.uk/news/john-kennedy-wins-arqiva-music-champion-award/</ref>\n\n===Expansion of the Xfm Network===\n[[File:XFM logo.png|thumb|Xfm logo used from 2004\u201315.]]\nXfm has held 28-day [[Restricted Service Licence]] FM broadcasts in a number of British cities, including [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Glasgow]].\n\nIn 2000, Xfm London was added to a number of [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] multiplexes around the country, and in January 2006 its reach expanded when it replaced [[The Storm (radio station)|The Storm]] on a number of other local multiplexes, creating near-national coverage. It was at one point reported that this 'national' version of Xfm London (known as ''Xfm UK'') would have local content drop-ins within it (e.g. news, travel) over time, but this ultimately never came to pass. Most [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] coverage of XFM carried the London version of the station, but for a time some multiplexes in the North of England instead received a feed of XFM Manchester.\n\nIn 2001, Xfm rehired Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant to run the Saturday afternoon show. Karl Pilkington joined them to 'just push the buttons' but eventually became the focal point of the show. The trio often called the station a 'tin pot station', 'shoddy' and 'not just a small station in London but the smallest station in that building'.\n\nBy 2002, the station had added many specialist shows, such as 'London Express', 'The A-Z of Alternative Music' and 'The Remix'. Afternoon and early-evening shows with Zane Lowe and [[Tim Lovejoy]] were innovative and although the daytime playlist consisted of 40 current releases, these were changed frequently, and the overall playlist contained about 90 records. However, in time the specialist shows gradually declined in number, and the playlist was again restricted in number.\n\nOn 9 June 2005, the group was awarded a permanent FM broadcasting licence to serve the city of [[Manchester]] as Xfm Manchester. This station went on air in March 2006. Also in 2005, Xfm was among the bidders for the regional North East franchise on 97.5 FM,<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/car/ifmapps/northeast/xfm.pdf XFM application for North East licence from Ofcom site (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202011110/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/car/ifmapps/northeast/xfm.pdf |date=2 December 2008 }}</ref> but this licence was ultimately awarded to [[Smooth Radio]] by [[Ofcom]].\n\nOn 4 January 2006, [[GCap Media]] relaunched its Central Scotland regional station [[Galaxy Scotland|Beat 106]] as Xfm Scotland.\n\nIn 2007, a fourth station joined the network with the launch of a new regional Xfm for south Wales, based at the [[Cardiff]] studio also home to Red Dragon FM (now [[Capital South Wales]]).\n\n===Output changes===\nIn May 2007, in an attempt to cut costs, the parent company of Xfm, [[GCap Media]], announced that they would be removing all presenters from the daytime (10 am\u20134 pm) lineup and replacing them with a jukebox based upon listener requests through their websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.1967 |title=Radio Today: XFM drops daytime jocks |accessdate=17 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519092328/http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.1967 |archivedate=19 May 2007 }}</ref> On 6 March 2008 an announcement was made reversing the decision to remove daytime presenters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1033420&c=1 | title = Music Week - XFM brings back daytime DJs | accessdate = 19 March 2008}}</ref> From 25 March 2008 a new schedule restoring daytime schedules was put in place.<ref name=\"radiotoday.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.3134.2 |title=Radio Today: DJs return to Xfm daytime |accessdate=19 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310234142/http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.3134.2 |archivedate=10 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA new schedule was launched on 12 January 2009. Changes at this date included [[Jo Good]] leaving the ''Afternoon Show, including Afternoon X List'', and new signing [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] taking over the ''Morning Show'' from [[Rick Shaw]]. The times of the shows were also adjusted, with the morning show only becoming a two-hour show (previously a three-hour show) and the afternoon show becoming a four-hour show (previously a 3-hour show). The weekend schedule was also adjusted at this time, with Rick Shaw moving to present the ''Weekend Morning Show'' on Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 2 pm and [[Lliana Bird]] taking over the afternoon slots. This led to other changes in the weekend schedule, such as [[Marsha Shandur]]'s ''Sunday Brunch'' ending, and the air times of [[Marc Haynes]] ''Certificate X'' changing (from 1 pm \u2013 3 pm to 6 pm \u2013 8 pm). Jo Good left the station during these changes, but rejoined at the end of 2012.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn 11 February 2008 GCap Media announced that they would be selling the analogue licence for the Manchester, Scotland and South Wales stations,<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/11/gcapmedia.digitaltvradio | title = DAB 'not economically viable' | accessdate = 11 February 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=11 February 2008}}</ref> retaining only XFM London. This decision was made in an attempt to shore up profits and concentrate on 'winning brands', calling the former nationalisation strategy into question. After this announcement, in early 2008, breakfast show host Alex Zane admitted on air that the future of the London station was also being reviewed, even making jokey references to perhaps being out of a job soon. The sale of the South Wales station went ahead, with [[Town and Country Broadcasting]] relaunching this as [[Nation Radio]]; the sale of the Scotland and Manchester stations was suspended when Global Radio entered into discussions to purchase GCap Media.\n\nThe re-appointment of a previous Programme Controller in 2011 led to a number of changes to Xfm's output. Specialist shows such as ''Music:Response'' and ''Mix Master Mike Show'' returned, as did presenter [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/04/yes-man-danny-wallace-joins-xfm | title = Yes Man author Danny Wallace joins Xfm London as breakfast host | accessdate = 4 July 2011 | work=The Guardian | first=Jason | last=Deans | date=4 July 2011}}</ref> In September 2011 a new Xfm schedule began, and included [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] moving to a re-launched evening show, ''Music:Response''.

Smart's show ended in October 2013 when he left to join the ''Scottish Sun'' as editor.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} As part of the 2013 schedule [[Jon Holmes]] took over the breakfast show. Comedian [[Josh Widdicombe]] presented a show on Saturdays between 10 am and 1 pm.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It was announced in March 2015 that [[Russell Brand]] would be hosting a new Sunday night show, which was to first air on 15 March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nme.com/filmandtv/news/russell-brand-to-make-radio-return-with-xfm-sunday/371885|title=Russell Brand to make radio return with XFM Sunday evening show|author=NME.COM|work=NME.COM}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Heart and Galaxy owner Global's takeover of GCap Media, Xfm Scotland became Galaxy (it went on to become [[Capital Scotland]] in 2011), leaving just Manchester and London with local Xfm stations.\n\nFollowing Global's acquisition of [[GMG Radio|Real and Smooth Ltd]], the Paisley/Renfrewshire 96.3 FM service previously broadcast as Real Radio XS became a new XFM Scotland in 2014. This service was available across central Scotland over DAB.\n\nUp until the end of the Xfm branding, the London, Manchester and Scotland stations broadcast 43 hours a week of local programming \u2013 weekday breakfast and drive, and four hours a day at weekends \u2013 with networked programming, primarily from London, at other times. TV platforms followed the London output and all three stations were streamed online.\n\n===Rebrand as Radio X===\nOn 7 September 2015, it was announced that Xfm would be rebranded as ''Radio X'' on 21 September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/09/full-line-up-for-globals-radio-x-confirmed/ |title=Full line-up for Global's Radio X confirmed |publisher=RadioToday |date=7 September 2015 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> The rebrand was carried out in partnership with creative agency We Are MBC. The rebranded station launched with new presenters including [[Chris Moyles]], [[Vernon Kay]], [[Johnny Vaughan]] and [[Ricky Wilson (English singer)|Ricky Wilson]] joining some existing XFM presenters on a refreshed schedule.\n\nXFM aired its last day of programming on Sunday 13 September 2015. XFM Scotland ceased broadcasting entirely on the same day with Global Radio handing back the Paisley licence to Ofcom.\n\nA 'holding' service of music and announcements began transmitting on national DAB under the Radio X title the following day, with this service also taking the place of XFM on FM, TV and online until the full launch of the new Radio X at 6:30{{nbsp}}am on Monday 21 September 2015.\n\nThe first song played on the rebranded Radio X, by Chris Moyles just before 7{{nbsp}}am on 21 September 2015, was \"[[Love Machine (Girls Aloud song)|Love Machine]]\" by [[Girls Aloud]], an off-format nod to media reports of a male bias by the new station.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shepherd|first1=Jack|title=Chris Moyles hosts comeback Radio X show: Dismisses 'male-focussed' agenda and plays Love Machine by Girls Aloud|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/chris-moyles-hosts-comeback-radio-x-show-dismisses-male-focussed-agenda-and-plays-love-machine-by-10510945.html|accessdate=19 November 2015|work=The Independent|date=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nRadio X is now available nationally via [[Digital One]] national [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], with all local-layer XFM carriage dropped (replaced in many cases by [[Gold (radio)|Gold]]). The new national Radio X also replaced XFM on FM in London and Manchester, and on other platforms including TV and online. There is no longer any local output on the Manchester station, and the only variance between the UK, London and Manchester services is split advertising and top-of-the-hour news intros.\n\n==Stations==\nThe stations which formerly comprised the Xfm network were:\n*XFM London, which has been broadcasting on 104.9 FM in the Greater London area full-time since 1997 (and by Restricted Service Licence from 1992).\n*[[XFM Manchester]], which was launched on 97.7 FM on 15 March 2006.\n\n==Notable presenters and programming==\n<!--Any non-notable presenters (those without Wikipedia articles) added here are liable to be removed - if someone is considered notable (red linking is not enough), please write a Wikipedia article on them first, or provide multiple reputable independent sources to show they deserve an article and are associated with the station.

Radio X launched nationally on 21 September 2015 as a rebrand of '''Xfm''' and superseded Xfm London and [[Xfm Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/09/radio-x-confirmed-in-single-chris-moyles-tweet/|title=Radio X confirmed in single Chris Moyles tweet|date=6 September 2015|work=RadioToday}}</ref>\n\nThe station has employed a number of DJs that have since gone on to greater fame including [[Russell Brand]], [[Karl Pilkington]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Stephen Merchant]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[Christian O'Connell]], [[Justin Lee Collins]], [[Adam and Joe]], [[Alex Zane]], [[Tim Lovejoy]], [[Dermot O'Leary]] and [[Josh Widdicombe]].\n\n==History==\nXfm was created in London in 1992 by Sammy Jacob (who founded its precursor Q102)<ref>{{cite news|title=My Life In Media: Sammy Jacob|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-life-in-media-sammy-jacob-842666.html|accessdate=1 November 2009|work=The Independent|date=8 June 2008}}</ref> and [[Fiction Records|Chris Parry]]. The station became full-time on 1 September 1997. During the following year the station played a range of music from its studios in 97 [[Charlotte Street]]. Jacob would later go on to co-found [[NME Radio]] and CDNX (Camden Experience) in 2008 and 2015 respectively.\n\nIn 1998, Xfm was acquired by the [[GCap Media|Capital Radio Group]] (now part of [[Global Radio]]) and relocated from Charlotte Street to Capital's headquarters at [[Leicester Square]], where it remains today. On 23 August of that year, Xfm was closed down for four days, during which a test tape featuring mainstream soft-rock acts was looped. The station subsequently relaunched with a more mainstream format, and a new advert featuring a cartoon radio saying \"Don't be afraid!\", which referred to the perceived inaccessibility of its old format.{{according to whom|date=March 2015}} The soft-rock revamp was not a success, culminating in listener-led protests outside the Capital Radio studios. Listeners also lodged objections with the [[Radio Authority]], which found XFM to be acting in a manner contrary to its licence requirements, and a degree of alternative output was eventually restored, particularly through night-time playlists and specialist shows.{{according to whom|date=March 2015}}\n\nFollowing the take-over by Capital, the station dropped its wide-ranging music policy, which was replaced by a format based on USA college stations. The first audience figures after this change showed a sharp decline. The DJs were no longer able to select some of their own tracks, and specialist shows were dropped. The station soon became more male-orientated and featured [[Association football|football]] coverage and \"laddish\" output. This came to an end after the Radio Authority fined XFM \u00a350,000 for breakfast presenter [[Tom Binns]]'s joking about [[bestiality]] on air.\n\nCapital Radio attempted to increase XFM's listening figures, recruiting DJs such as [[Zoe Ball]], former [[BBC Radio 1]] presenter, and re-recruiting comedians [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]] who took voluntary redundancy when Capital bought the station, after the pair rose to significance with the first airing of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Together with talent such as [[Zane Lowe]] and [[Christian O'Connell]], this yielded growing listening figures. The music was, and is today, a play-listed mix of popular indie and soft rock.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} \n\nHost John Kennedy is the only member of the current presenter lineup that has been with the radio station since its very first broadcasts. <ref>https://completemusicupdate.com/article/qa-john-kennedy-xfm/</ref> His new music show, X-Posure is the station's longest running show and is credited as being the first to give radio play to artists including [[Adele]], [[Florence and the Machine]], [[Razorlight]] and [[Mumford & Sons]].<ref>https://www.radiox.co.uk/news/john-kennedy-wins-arqiva-music-champion-award/</ref>\n\n===Expansion of the Xfm Network===\n[[File:XFM logo.png|thumb|Xfm logo used from 2004\u201315.]]\nXfm has held 28-day [[Restricted Service Licence]] FM broadcasts in a number of British cities, including [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Glasgow]].\n\nIn 2000, Xfm London was added to a number of [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] multiplexes around the country, and in January 2006 its reach expanded when it replaced [[The Storm (radio station)|The Storm]] on a number of other local multiplexes, creating near-national coverage. It was at one point reported that this 'national' version of Xfm London (known as ''Xfm UK'') would have local content drop-ins within it (e.g. news, travel) over time, but this ultimately never came to pass. Most [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] coverage of XFM carried the London version of the station, but for a time some multiplexes in the North of England instead received a feed of XFM Manchester.\n\nIn 2001, Xfm rehired Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant to run the Saturday afternoon show. Karl Pilkington joined them to 'just push the buttons' but eventually became the focal point of the show. The trio often called the station a 'tin pot station', 'shoddy' and 'not just a small station in London but the smallest station in that building'.\n\nBy 2002, the station had added many specialist shows, such as 'London Express', 'The A-Z of Alternative Music' and 'The Remix'. Afternoon and early-evening shows with Zane Lowe and [[Tim Lovejoy]] were innovative and although the daytime playlist consisted of 40 current releases, these were changed frequently, and the overall playlist contained about 90 records. However, in time the specialist shows gradually declined in number, and the playlist was again restricted in number.\n\nOn 9 June 2005, the group was awarded a permanent FM broadcasting licence to serve the city of [[Manchester]] as Xfm Manchester. This station went on air in March 2006. Also in 2005, Xfm was among the bidders for the regional North East franchise on 97.5 FM,<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/car/ifmapps/northeast/xfm.pdf XFM application for North East licence from Ofcom site (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202011110/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/car/ifmapps/northeast/xfm.pdf |date=2 December 2008 }}</ref> but this licence was ultimately awarded to [[Smooth Radio]] by [[Ofcom]].\n\nOn 4 January 2006, [[GCap Media]] relaunched its Central Scotland regional station [[Galaxy Scotland|Beat 106]] as Xfm Scotland.\n\nIn 2007, a fourth station joined the network with the launch of a new regional Xfm for south Wales, based at the [[Cardiff]] studio also home to Red Dragon FM (now [[Capital South Wales]]).\n\n===Output changes===\nIn May 2007, in an attempt to cut costs, the parent company of Xfm, [[GCap Media]], announced that they would be removing all presenters from the daytime (10 am\u20134 pm) lineup and replacing them with a jukebox based upon listener requests through their websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.1967 |title=Radio Today: XFM drops daytime jocks |accessdate=17 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519092328/http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.1967 |archivedate=19 May 2007 }}</ref> On 6 March 2008 an announcement was made reversing the decision to remove daytime presenters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1033420&c=1 | title = Music Week - XFM brings back daytime DJs | accessdate = 19 March 2008}}</ref> From 25 March 2008 a new schedule restoring daytime schedules was put in place.<ref name=\"radiotoday.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.3134.2 |title=Radio Today: DJs return to Xfm daytime |accessdate=19 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310234142/http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.3134.2 |archivedate=10 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA new schedule was launched on 12 January 2009. Changes at this date included [[Jo Good]] leaving the ''Afternoon Show, including Afternoon X List'', and new signing [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] taking over the ''Morning Show'' from [[Rick Shaw]]. The times of the shows were also adjusted, with the morning show only becoming a two-hour show (previously a three-hour show) and the afternoon show becoming a four-hour show (previously a 3-hour show). The weekend schedule was also adjusted at this time, with Rick Shaw moving to present the ''Weekend Morning Show'' on Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 2 pm and [[Lliana Bird]] taking over the afternoon slots. This led to other changes in the weekend schedule, such as [[Marsha Shandur]]'s ''Sunday Brunch'' ending, and the air times of [[Marc Haynes]] ''Certificate X'' changing (from 1 pm \u2013 3 pm to 6 pm \u2013 8 pm). Jo Good left the station during these changes, but rejoined at the end of 2012.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn 11 February 2008 GCap Media announced that they would be selling the analogue licence for the Manchester, Scotland and South Wales stations,<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/11/gcapmedia.digitaltvradio | title = DAB 'not economically viable' | accessdate = 11 February 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=11 February 2008}}</ref> retaining only XFM London. This decision was made in an attempt to shore up profits and concentrate on 'winning brands', calling the former nationalisation strategy into question. After this announcement, in early 2008, breakfast show host Alex Zane admitted on air that the future of the London station was also being reviewed, even making jokey references to perhaps being out of a job soon. The sale of the South Wales station went ahead, with [[Town and Country Broadcasting]] relaunching this as [[Nation Radio]]; the sale of the Scotland and Manchester stations was suspended when Global Radio entered into discussions to purchase GCap Media.\n\nThe re-appointment of a previous Programme Controller in 2011 led to a number of changes to Xfm's output. Specialist shows such as ''Music:Response'' and ''Mix Master Mike Show'' returned, as did presenter [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/04/yes-man-danny-wallace-joins-xfm | title = Yes Man author Danny Wallace joins Xfm London as breakfast host | accessdate = 4 July 2011 | work=The Guardian | first=Jason | last=Deans | date=4 July 2011}}</ref> In September 2011 a new Xfm schedule began, and included [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] moving to a re-launched evening show, ''Music:Response''.

Smart's show ended in October 2013 when he left to join the ''Scottish Sun'' as editor.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} As part of the 2013 schedule [[Jon Holmes]] took over the breakfast show. Comedian [[Josh Widdicombe]] presented a show on Saturdays between 10 am and 1 pm.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It was announced in March 2015 that [[Russell Brand]] would be hosting a new Sunday night show, which was to first air on 15 March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nme.com/filmandtv/news/russell-brand-to-make-radio-return-with-xfm-sunday/371885|title=Russell Brand to make radio return with XFM Sunday evening show|author=NME.COM|work=NME.COM}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Heart and Galaxy owner Global's takeover of GCap Media, Xfm Scotland became Galaxy (it went on to become [[Capital Scotland]] in 2011), leaving just Manchester and London with local Xfm stations.\n\nFollowing Global's acquisition of [[GMG Radio|Real and Smooth Ltd]], the Paisley/Renfrewshire 96.3 FM service previously broadcast as Real Radio XS became a new XFM Scotland in 2014. This service was available across central Scotland over DAB.\n\nUp until the end of the Xfm branding, the London, Manchester and Scotland stations broadcast 43 hours a week of local programming \u2013 weekday breakfast and drive, and four hours a day at weekends \u2013 with networked programming, primarily from London, at other times. TV platforms followed the London output and all three stations were streamed online.\n\n===Rebrand as Radio X===\nOn 7 September 2015, it was announced that Xfm would be rebranded as ''Radio X'' on 21 September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/09/full-line-up-for-globals-radio-x-confirmed/ |title=Full line-up for Global's Radio X confirmed |publisher=RadioToday |date=7 September 2015 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> The rebrand was carried out in partnership with creative agency We Are MBC. The rebranded station launched with new presenters including [[Chris Moyles]], [[Vernon Kay]], [[Johnny Vaughan]] and [[Ricky Wilson (English singer)|Ricky Wilson]] joining some existing XFM presenters on a refreshed schedule.\n\nXFM aired its last day of programming on Sunday 13 September 2015. XFM Scotland ceased broadcasting entirely on the same day with Global Radio handing back the Paisley licence to Ofcom.\n\nA 'holding' service of music and announcements began transmitting on national DAB under the Radio X title the following day, with this service also taking the place of XFM on FM, TV and online until the full launch of the new Radio X at 6:30{{nbsp}}am on Monday 21 September 2015.\n\nThe first song played on the rebranded Radio X, by Chris Moyles just before 7{{nbsp}}am on 21 September 2015, was \"[[Love Machine (Girls Aloud song)|Love Machine]]\" by [[Girls Aloud]], an off-format nod to media reports of a male bias by the new station.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shepherd|first1=Jack|title=Chris Moyles hosts comeback Radio X show: Dismisses 'male-focussed' agenda and plays Love Machine by Girls Aloud|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/chris-moyles-hosts-comeback-radio-x-show-dismisses-male-focussed-agenda-and-plays-love-machine-by-10510945.html|accessdate=19 November 2015|work=The Independent|date=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nRadio X is now available nationally via [[Digital One]] national [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], with all local-layer XFM carriage dropped (replaced in many cases by [[Gold (radio)|Gold]]). The new national Radio X also replaced XFM on FM in London and Manchester, and on other platforms including TV and online. There is no longer any local output on the Manchester station, and the only variance between the UK, London and Manchester services is split advertising and top-of-the-hour news intros.\n\n==Stations==\nThe stations which formerly comprised the Xfm network were:\n*XFM London, which has been broadcasting on 104.9 FM in the Greater London area full-time since 1997 (and by Restricted Service Licence from 1992).\n*[[XFM Manchester]], which was launched on 97.7 FM on 15 March 2006.\n\n==Notable presenters and programming==\n<!--Any non-notable presenters (those without Wikipedia articles) added here are liable to be removed - if someone is considered notable (red linking is not enough), please write a Wikipedia article on them first, or provide multiple reputable independent sources to show they deserve an article and are associated with the station.

It was inaugurated in 1942 and replaced by two [[photojournalism]] prizes in 1968: the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography]] and \"Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography\", which was later renamed [[Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography]] in 2000.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prizes were established by the bequest of [[Joseph Pulitzer]], which suggested four journalism awards, and were inaugurated beginning 1917. By 1942 there were eight Pulitzers for journalism; for several years now there have been 14 including the two for photojournalism.\n\n==Winners==\nThere were 26 simple Photography prizes awarded in 26 years including two in 1944 (for 1943 work) and none in 1946.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Photography \"Photography\"].

Art-directed by [[Rudy VanderLans]] using fonts designed by his wife, [[Zuzana Licko]], ''Emigre'' was one of the first publications to use [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into [[desktop publishing]] (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.\n\nThe focus of ''Emigre'' was both redundant and wandering\u2014both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared ([[Gail Swanlund]], Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and [[Jeffery Keedy]] reappeared throughout the magazine's history.\n\nThe magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.\n\nBeginning with Issue 9\u2014devoted to the art of [[Vaughan Oliver]] at [[4AD]]\u2014the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]], the [[Macintosh]], type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]].\n\nIncreasingly, ''Emigre'' became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of ''Emigre'' came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.\n\nEmigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD (''Catfish'', an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of [[Honey Barbara]], [[The Grassy Knoll (band)|The Grassy Knoll]] and Scenic).\n\nIn its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of ''Emigre'' were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]] as small softcover books.

Art-directed by [[Rudy VanderLans]] using fonts designed by his wife, [[Zuzana Licko]], ''Emigre'' was one of the first publications to use [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into [[desktop publishing]] (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.\n\nThe focus of ''Emigre'' was both redundant and wandering\u2014both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared ([[Gail Swanlund]], Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and [[Jeffery Keedy]] reappeared throughout the magazine's history.\n\nThe magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.\n\nBeginning with Issue 9\u2014devoted to the art of [[Vaughan Oliver]] at [[4AD]]\u2014the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]], the [[Macintosh]], type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]].\n\nIncreasingly, ''Emigre'' became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of ''Emigre'' came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.\n\nEmigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD (''Catfish'', an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of [[Honey Barbara]], [[The Grassy Knoll (band)|The Grassy Knoll]] and Scenic).\n\nIn its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of ''Emigre'' were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]] as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.\n\n==Formats==\nThe magazine changed formats several times: it was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285&nbsp;mm \u00d7 425&nbsp;mm (slightly shorter than 11\u2033 \u00d7 17\u2033 or US ledger/tabloid size); starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5\u2033 \u00d7 11\u2033 (US letter size); it changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133&nbsp;mm \u00d7 210&nbsp;mm, plus a [[CD]] or [[DVD]]) starting with issue 60; and finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133&nbsp;mm \u00d7 210&nbsp;mm.
