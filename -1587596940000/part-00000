The celebration opens the annual carnival and the feast of Mother Cabrini was added to the celebration of St. Donato because she personally established the school and worshipped in the lower Church, and her Sisters remain active with the parish.\n\nIn 2013 the Archdiocese announced that the St. Donato congregation was merging into Our Lady of Lourdes Church.<ref>{{cite web|author=Loeb, Pat|url=https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/02/04/st-donatos-parish-in-overbrook-to-be-merged/|title=St. Donato\u2019s Parish, in Overbrook, To Be Merged|publisher=[[CBS Philadelphia]]|date=2013-02-04|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> Members of the community unsuccessfully petitioned for the congregation to remain open.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://philadelphianeighborhoods.com/2013/02/19/overbrook-saint-donato-fights-archdiocese-to-remain-open/|title=Overbrook: Saint Donato Fights Archdiocese to Remain Open|work=Philadelphia Neighborhoods|publisher=Department of Journalism, Lew Klein College of Media and Communication, [[Temple University]]|date=2013-02-19|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> St. Donato, as of 2013, is to be used periodically for church services.<ref name=GambinoBaldwin>{{cite web|author=Gambino, Matthew|author2=Lou Baldwin|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2013/02/news/local-news/st-donato-parish-to-close-will-merge-with-our-lady-of-lourdes-inwest-philadelphia/|title=St. Donato Parish to merge with Our Lady of Lourdes in West Philadelphia|publisher=Catholicphilly.com|date=2013-12-04|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> Our Lady of Lourdes has the parish records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archphila.org/parish/st-donato-philadelphia/|title=St. Donato (Italian) (1910-2013)|publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nSt. Donato had its own parish school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090324151931/http://www.archdiocese-phl.org/parishes/7770.htm|title=St. Donato (Italian) |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]|date=2009-03-24|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> Later the designated school was St. Frances Cabrini Regional School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120826225239/http://archphila.org/parishes/7770.php|title=St. Donato (Italian)|publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]|date=2012-08-26|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> The school remained in operation after the end of the congregation.<ref name=GambinoBaldwin/>\n\n==Notable parishioners==\n* [[Louis A.

Only the [[five-star rank]] of [[Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force]] is higher, but it has only been held in a ceremonial capacity. As there are currently no appointments in the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) at the five-star level, there is no prospect of a RAAF officer achieving the rank in a professional (i.e. non-ceremonial) capacity. Additionally, Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force is generally considered to be a marshal rank as opposed to an air marshal rank and so the only two individuals ever to hold the rank, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], are not listed in a separate section. With the current structure of the ADF, the rank of air chief marshal is only held when an officer of the RAAF is appointed as [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]]. As of June 2018, only four officers have obtained the rank of air chief marshal in the RAAF, the first being [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] in 1965 who was also the first non-Army officer in the Australian military to reach [[four-star rank]]. [[Mark Binskin]] is the recently promoted of the four, having been advanced to air chief marshal in June 2014.<ref name=\"ACMs\">{{Cite news|first=Chris|last=Clark|title=Air Force Defence chiefs of the past|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm|publisher=Air Force News|date=19 May 2005|accessdate=14 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608112946/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm|archivedate=8 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rayner|1992|pp=298\u2013299}}</ref>\n\nAir chief marshals of the Royal Australian Air Force are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |title=Air Chief Marshals |accessdate=14 July 2010 |work=Air Marshals of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force Air Power Development Centre |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525185205/http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |archivedate=25 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Senior command(s) and notes\n|-\n| |{{sortname|Mark|Binskin}} || 1960 || {{center|\u2014}}  || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (2014\u201318), [[Vice Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Vice Chief of the Defence Force]] (2011\u201314), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (2008\u201311), [[RAAF Air Command|Air Commander Australia]] (2007\u201308)\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sir Angus|Houston|Angus Houston}} || 1947 || {{center|\u2014}} || Chief of the Defence Force (2005\u201311), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (2001\u201305)\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sir Neville|McNamara|Neville McNamara}} || 1923 || 2014 || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force Staff]] (1982\u201384), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (1979\u201382), Commander, RAAF Forces Vietnam (1971\u201372)\n|-\n| {{nowrap|{{sortname|Sir Frederick|Scherger|Frederick Scherger}}}} || 1904 || 1984 || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee]] (1961\u201366), Chief of the Air Staff (1957\u201361)\n|}\n\n==Air marshals==\n[[File:RAAF O9.jpg|thumb|alt=A black shoulder board with the word \"AUSTRALIA\" across the bottom.

Only the [[five-star rank]] of [[Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force]] is higher, but it has only been held in a ceremonial capacity. As there are currently no appointments in the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) at the five-star level, there is no prospect of a RAAF officer achieving the rank in a professional (i.e. non-ceremonial) capacity. Additionally, Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force is generally considered to be a marshal rank as opposed to an air marshal rank and so the only two individuals ever to hold the rank, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], are not listed in a separate section. With the current structure of the ADF, the rank of air chief marshal is only held when an officer of the RAAF is appointed as [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]]. As of June 2018, only four officers have obtained the rank of air chief marshal in the RAAF, the first being [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] in 1965 who was also the first non-Army officer in the Australian military to reach [[four-star rank]]. [[Mark Binskin]] is the recently promoted of the four, having been advanced to air chief marshal in June 2014.<ref name=\"ACMs\">{{Cite news|first=Chris|last=Clark|title=Air Force Defence chiefs of the past|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm|publisher=Air Force News|date=19 May 2005|accessdate=14 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608112946/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm|archivedate=8 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rayner|1992|pp=298\u2013299}}</ref>\n\nAir chief marshals of the Royal Australian Air Force are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |title=Air Chief Marshals |accessdate=14 July 2010 |work=Air Marshals of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force Air Power Development Centre |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525185205/http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |archivedate=25 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Senior command(s) and notes\n|-\n| |{{sortname|Mark|Binskin}} || 1960 || {{center|\u2014}}  || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (2014\u201318), [[Vice Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Vice Chief of the Defence Force]] (2011\u201314), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (2008\u201311), [[RAAF Air Command|Air Commander Australia]] (2007\u201308)\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sir Angus|Houston|Angus Houston}} || 1947 || {{center|\u2014}} || Chief of the Defence Force (2005\u201311), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (2001\u201305)\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sir Neville|McNamara|Neville McNamara}} || 1923 || 2014 || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force Staff]] (1982\u201384), [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (1979\u201382), Commander, RAAF Forces Vietnam (1971\u201372)\n|-\n| {{nowrap|{{sortname|Sir Frederick|Scherger|Frederick Scherger}}}} || 1904 || 1984 || [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee]] (1961\u201366), Chief of the Air Staff (1957\u201361)\n|}\n\n==Air marshals==\n[[File:RAAF O9.jpg|thumb|alt=A black shoulder board with the word \"AUSTRALIA\" across the bottom.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

The [[screenplay]] was by [[Paul Schrader]], from a story by De Palma and Schrader. [[Bernard Herrmann]] provided the film's [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] prior to his death in 1975. The story is about a [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] businessman who is haunted by guilt following the death of his wife and daughter during a kidnapping-rescue attempt gone wrong. Years after the tragedy, he meets and falls in love with a young woman who is the exact [[look-alike]] of his long dead wife.\n\nBoth De Palma and Schrader have pointed to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) as the major inspiration for ''Obsession'''s [[narrative]] and [[theme (literature)|thematic]] concerns. Schrader's script  was extensively rewritten and pared down by De Palma prior to shooting, causing the screenwriter to proclaim a complete lack of interest in the film's subsequent production and release. Completed in 1975, [[Columbia Pictures]] picked up the distribution rights but demanded that minor changes be made to reduce potentially [[controversial]] aspects of the [[plot (narrative)|plot]]. When finally released in the late summer of 1976, it became De Palma's first substantial [[box office]] success and received a mixed response from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1959, Michael Courtland (Robertson), a New Orleans [[real estate]] developer, has his life shattered when his wife Elizabeth (Bujold) and young daughter Amy are kidnapped. The police recommend that he provide the kidnappers with a briefcase of shredded blank paper instead of the demanded ransom, as the kidnappers will then be more likely to surrender when cornered, rather than attempt to escape with cash in hand. Courtland agrees to this plan. This leads to a bungled car chase in which both kidnappers and victims are killed in a spectacular explosion. Courtland blames himself for the deaths of his wife and daughter.\n\nSkipping forward sixteen years later in 1975, Courtland is morbidly obsessed with his dead wife, and regularly visits a monument he has had built in her memory. The monument is a replica of the church ([[Basilica di San Miniato al Monte]]) where he and Elizabeth had met many years before in [[Florence, Italy]]. His real estate partner Robert LaSalle (Lithgow) convinces Courtland to tag along on a business trip back to Florence. While there, Courtland revisits the church, and suddenly comes face to face with a young woman named Sandra (Bujold in a dual role) who looks exactly like his late wife. The already slightly unhinged Courtland begins to court the young woman, and subtly attempts to transform her into a perfect mirror image of his dead wife.\n[[File:SanMiniatoalMontenew.jpg|alt=San Miniato al Monte, Florence|left|thumb|300x300px|Facade of the basilica [[San Miniato al Monte]] in Florence, one of the important settings of the film.]]\nCourtland returns to New Orleans with Sandra so they can marry. On their wedding night, Sandra is kidnapped and a ransom note is left behind by her abductors. It is an exact replica of the kidnappers' message from sixteen years before. This time, Courtland decides to deliver the demanded cash. He withdraws massive quantities of money from his accounts and business holdings, financially ruining him and forcing him to sign over his interest in the real estate business to LaSalle. In the process, he discovers that his entire ordeal, including the original kidnapping, had been engineered by LaSalle as a way to gain sole control of Courtland's company share holdings. The now nearly insane Courtland stabs LaSalle to death.\n\nKnowing that Sandra must have been a willing accomplice in the plot against him, he goes to the airport to kill the escaping woman. On the plane, Sandra has a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to her part in the scheme; she is in fact Courtland's daughter: following the original kidnapping LaSalle concealed her survival and sent her to live in secret with an Italian caretaker who raised Amy as her own child and gave her the name of Sandra. Over the years, LaSalle has told her lies about Courtland, convincing her that her father had not paid the ransom because he did not love her. Sandra, who has come to love Courtland, attempts suicide on the plane and is taken off the flight in a wheelchair. Courtland sees her and runs toward her, gun drawn. A security guard attempts to stop him but Courtland smashes the briefcase full of money against the guard's head, knocking him unconscious. The briefcase breaks open and all of the money flies out. Sandra, seeing the fluttering bills, stands up and shouts: \"Daddy! You brought the money!\" Courtland now realizes for the first time who Sandra really is, and father and daughter fall into a deep embrace.\n\n==Production==\nDe Palma and Schrader devised a story with a narrative inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'', a film that both of them admired. Schrader's  original screenplay, titled ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'', was reportedly much longer than the final film, with a coda that extended another ten years beyond where the film now ends. De Palma ultimately found Schrader's screenplay unfilmable due to its length, and rewrote and condensed the finale himself after Schrader refused to make the requested changes. According to De Palma, \"Paul Schrader's ending actually went on for another act of obsession. I felt it was much too complicated, and wouldn't sustain, so I abbreviated it.\"<ref name=\"Childs\">Childs, Mike  and Jones, Alan. ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' Magazine, Volume 6, Number 1, 1977, pgs. 4 - 13. \"DePalma Has The Power!\"</ref>  The film's composer, Bernard Herrmann, agreed that the original ending should be jettisoned, telling De Palma, after reading Schrader's version, \"Get rid of it \u2014 that'll never work\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.briandepalma.net/obsess/obsess2.htm|title=The Making of Obsession|last=Fentum|first=Bill|accessdate=2006-12-14|publisher=www.briandepalma.net |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061027165900/http://briandepalma.net/obsess/obsess2.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}</ref>  Schrader remained resentful of De Palma's rewrite for years, and claimed to have lost all interest in the project once the change was made. Schrader indicated that \"the original three part story conclude with a section set in the future (1985). My original idea in the script was to write an obsessive love where transcended the normal strictures of time.\"<ref>\"Obsession\" an essay by Brad Stevens, Arrow Blu-Ray, 2011</ref>\n\nDe Palma said, \"It made Schrader very unhappy: he thought I'd truncated his masterpiece. He's never been the same since.\"<ref name=\"Childs\" /> Schrader stated that \"the future section was cut from the script for budgetary reasons\" however rumor had it that Bernard Herrmann suggested the cuts when he was working on the score for the film because he felt the last third set in the future didn't work.<ref>\"Obsession: An Essay\" by Brad Stevens, Arrow video, Blu-Ray, 2011</ref> In 2011 Schrader's full three part script was released as part of the Arrow Video Blu-ray.\n\nAfter the film was completed, Bernard Herrmann considered it the finest film in his musical career.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/10Yp86YwDVsz34Xnq8YmsM6/bernard-herrmann-s-magnificent-obsession BBC]</ref> [I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUUT THIS SENENCE.  DID HERRMANN CONSIDER OBSESSION THE FINEST FILM HE HAD WORKED ON?  MY GUESS IS THAT HE CONSIDERED THE SCORE HIS FINEST, BUT THAT ISN'T WHAT THE SENTENCE TELLS ME.]   \n\nColumbia executives expressed unease over the [[incest]] theme, especially as it was portrayed in such a heavily romanticized manner. Consequently, a few minor changes were made to a pivotal sequence between Robertson and Bujold, in which dissolves and visual \"ripples\" were inserted over the wedding and post-wedding scenes to suggest that the consummation of their marriage only took place in a dream sequence. The film's editor, [[Paul Hirsch (film editor)|Paul Hirsch]], agreed with the decision to obscure the incest theme, noting, \"I thought it was a mistake to drag incest into what was basically a romantic mystery, so I suggested to Brian, 'What if it never happened? What if instead of having them get married, Michael only dreams of getting married? We have this shot of Cliff Robertson asleep. We could use that and then cut to the wedding sequence.' And that's what we did. It became a projection of his desires rather than actual fact.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.briandepalma.net/obsess/obsess2.htm|title=The Making of Obsession|last=Fentum|first=Bill|accessdate=2006-12-14|publisher=www.briandepalma.net |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061027165900/http://briandepalma.net/obsess/obsess2.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the documentary ''[[De Palma (film)|De Palma]]'', the director indicated that he felt the major flaw of the film was in casting Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson. De Palma felt that Robertson couldn't play the anguish of the character.

The [[screenplay]] was by [[Paul Schrader]], from a story by De Palma and Schrader. [[Bernard Herrmann]] provided the film's [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] prior to his death in 1975. The story is about a [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] businessman who is haunted by guilt following the death of his wife and daughter during a kidnapping-rescue attempt gone wrong. Years after the tragedy, he meets and falls in love with a young woman who is the exact [[look-alike]] of his long dead wife.\n\nBoth De Palma and Schrader have pointed to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) as the major inspiration for ''Obsession'''s [[narrative]] and [[theme (literature)|thematic]] concerns. Schrader's script  was extensively rewritten and pared down by De Palma prior to shooting, causing the screenwriter to proclaim a complete lack of interest in the film's subsequent production and release. Completed in 1975, [[Columbia Pictures]] picked up the distribution rights but demanded that minor changes be made to reduce potentially [[controversial]] aspects of the [[plot (narrative)|plot]]. When finally released in the late summer of 1976, it became De Palma's first substantial [[box office]] success and received a mixed response from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1959, Michael Courtland (Robertson), a New Orleans [[real estate]] developer, has his life shattered when his wife Elizabeth (Bujold) and young daughter Amy are kidnapped. The police recommend that he provide the kidnappers with a briefcase of shredded blank paper instead of the demanded ransom, as the kidnappers will then be more likely to surrender when cornered, rather than attempt to escape with cash in hand. Courtland agrees to this plan. This leads to a bungled car chase in which both kidnappers and victims are killed in a spectacular explosion. Courtland blames himself for the deaths of his wife and daughter.\n\nSkipping forward sixteen years later in 1975, Courtland is morbidly obsessed with his dead wife, and regularly visits a monument he has had built in her memory. The monument is a replica of the church ([[Basilica di San Miniato al Monte]]) where he and Elizabeth had met many years before in [[Florence, Italy]]. His real estate partner Robert LaSalle (Lithgow) convinces Courtland to tag along on a business trip back to Florence. While there, Courtland revisits the church, and suddenly comes face to face with a young woman named Sandra (Bujold in a dual role) who looks exactly like his late wife. The already slightly unhinged Courtland begins to court the young woman, and subtly attempts to transform her into a perfect mirror image of his dead wife.\n[[File:SanMiniatoalMontenew.jpg|alt=San Miniato al Monte, Florence|left|thumb|300x300px|Facade of the basilica [[San Miniato al Monte]] in Florence, one of the important settings of the film.]]\nCourtland returns to New Orleans with Sandra so they can marry. On their wedding night, Sandra is kidnapped and a ransom note is left behind by her abductors. It is an exact replica of the kidnappers' message from sixteen years before. This time, Courtland decides to deliver the demanded cash. He withdraws massive quantities of money from his accounts and business holdings, financially ruining him and forcing him to sign over his interest in the real estate business to LaSalle. In the process, he discovers that his entire ordeal, including the original kidnapping, had been engineered by LaSalle as a way to gain sole control of Courtland's company share holdings. The now nearly insane Courtland stabs LaSalle to death.\n\nKnowing that Sandra must have been a willing accomplice in the plot against him, he goes to the airport to kill the escaping woman. On the plane, Sandra has a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to her part in the scheme; she is in fact Courtland's daughter: following the original kidnapping LaSalle concealed her survival and sent her to live in secret with an Italian caretaker who raised Amy as her own child and gave her the name of Sandra. Over the years, LaSalle has told her lies about Courtland, convincing her that her father had not paid the ransom because he did not love her. Sandra, who has come to love Courtland, attempts suicide on the plane and is taken off the flight in a wheelchair. Courtland sees her and runs toward her, gun drawn. A security guard attempts to stop him but Courtland smashes the briefcase full of money against the guard's head, knocking him unconscious. The briefcase breaks open and all of the money flies out. Sandra, seeing the fluttering bills, stands up and shouts: \"Daddy! You brought the money!\" Courtland now realizes for the first time who Sandra really is, and father and daughter fall into a deep embrace.\n\n==Production==\nDe Palma and Schrader devised a story with a narrative inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'', a film that both of them admired. Schrader's  original screenplay, titled ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'', was reportedly much longer than the final film, with a coda that extended another ten years beyond where the film now ends. De Palma ultimately found Schrader's screenplay unfilmable due to its length, and rewrote and condensed the finale himself after Schrader refused to make the requested changes. According to De Palma, \"Paul Schrader's ending actually went on for another act of obsession. I felt it was much too complicated, and wouldn't sustain, so I abbreviated it.\"<ref name=\"Childs\">Childs, Mike  and Jones, Alan. ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' Magazine, Volume 6, Number 1, 1977, pgs. 4 - 13. \"DePalma Has The Power!\"</ref>  The film's composer, Bernard Herrmann, agreed that the original ending should be jettisoned, telling De Palma, after reading Schrader's version, \"Get rid of it \u2014 that'll never work\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.briandepalma.net/obsess/obsess2.htm|title=The Making of Obsession|last=Fentum|first=Bill|accessdate=2006-12-14|publisher=www.briandepalma.net |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061027165900/http://briandepalma.net/obsess/obsess2.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}</ref>  Schrader remained resentful of De Palma's rewrite for years, and claimed to have lost all interest in the project once the change was made. Schrader indicated that \"the original three part story conclude with a section set in the future (1985). My original idea in the script was to write an obsessive love where transcended the normal strictures of time.\"<ref>\"Obsession\" an essay by Brad Stevens, Arrow Blu-Ray, 2011</ref>\n\nDe Palma said, \"It made Schrader very unhappy: he thought I'd truncated his masterpiece. He's never been the same since.\"<ref name=\"Childs\" /> Schrader stated that \"the future section was cut from the script for budgetary reasons\" however rumor had it that Bernard Herrmann suggested the cuts when he was working on the score for the film because he felt the last third set in the future didn't work.<ref>\"Obsession: An Essay\" by Brad Stevens, Arrow video, Blu-Ray, 2011</ref> In 2011 Schrader's full three part script was released as part of the Arrow Video Blu-ray.\n\nAfter the film was completed, Bernard Herrmann considered it the finest film in his musical career.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/10Yp86YwDVsz34Xnq8YmsM6/bernard-herrmann-s-magnificent-obsession BBC]</ref>\n\nColumbia executives expressed unease over the [[incest]] theme, especially as it was portrayed in such a heavily romanticized manner. Consequently, a few minor changes were made to a pivotal sequence between Robertson and Bujold, in which dissolves and visual \"ripples\" were inserted over the wedding and post-wedding scenes to suggest that the consummation of their marriage only took place in a dream sequence. The film's editor, [[Paul Hirsch (film editor)|Paul Hirsch]], agreed with the decision to obscure the incest theme, noting, \"I thought it was a mistake to drag incest into what was basically a romantic mystery, so I suggested to Brian, 'What if it never happened? What if instead of having them get married, Michael only dreams of getting married? We have this shot of Cliff Robertson asleep. We could use that and then cut to the wedding sequence.' And that's what we did. It became a projection of his desires rather than actual fact.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.briandepalma.net/obsess/obsess2.htm|title=The Making of Obsession|last=Fentum|first=Bill|accessdate=2006-12-14|publisher=www.briandepalma.net |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061027165900/http://briandepalma.net/obsess/obsess2.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the documentary ''[[De Palma (film)|De Palma]]'', the director indicated that he felt the major flaw of the film was in casting Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson.
