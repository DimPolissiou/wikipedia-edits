The game was a crucial game in the end of the regular season, as the Los Angeles Lakers hoped to keep first place in the Western Conference with a record of 55-25. Spike Lee explained in an interview why he chose Kobe Bryant as the subject for this documentary: \"I'm a big basketball fan. It was obvious. He was having an MVP-type year, in which he did win the MVP. Also the Lakers looked like they were going to take it to the Finals. And I wanted them to beat the [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]]. I hate the Celtics. But the Celtics won. But I don't think I was taking a gamble by choosing Kobe.\" (Lee, NBA.com)3. Also, according to Spike Lee, \"He (Kobe) said several times how much fun it was just doing it.\" (Lee, NBA.com)3. \n\nThe 84-minute documentary ran on ESPN commercial free.[3] The documentary also focuses on Bryant and the team in huddles and during time-outs. The cameras also get full access of coach [[Phil Jackson]] in the locker room with the team during half-time.[4] Bryant provided the voice-over for the documentary on February 2, 2009, hours after he scored 61 points against the [[New York Knicks]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], (then a single-game record at the arena, which has been broken since).[5] Spike Lee said that he was excited for Bryant to do the commentary following a game at Madison Square Garden, but no one expected a 61-point performance from Bryant. \"I know that if he had a terrible game the commentary would not have been the same. Guaranteed. But Kobe said he made a point to make sure not to lose the game or he would hear it from me.\" (Lee, 8th paragraph)3. Bryant indeed said in an after game interview that he was going to give the game his all in order to show Spike Lee a thing or two about Bryant's skills on the court against the Knicks. \"On a lighter note, I'm going to review this documentary I'm doing with Spike Lee tonight after the game and I didn't feel like sitting next to him and hearing him talking trash about the Knicks, so that was added incentive as well.

Some languages make a distinction between answers to affirmative versus negative questions, thus they may have triplets or quadruplets of words instead. English originally used a four-form system up to and including [[Early Middle English]] but [[Modern English]] has reduced this to a two-form system consisting of just 'yes' and 'no'. It exists in many facets of communication, such as: eye blink communication, head movements, Morse Code, and sign language.  \n\nSome languages do not answer yesses with single words meaning 'yes' or 'no'. [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are among the languages that typically employ echo answers (repeating the verb with either an affirmative or negative form) rather than using words for 'yes' and 'no', though such languages can also have words broadly similar to 'yes' and 'no'. Other languages have systems named two-form, three-form, and four-form systems, depending on how many words for yes and no they employ. Some languages, such as Latin, do not have yes-no word systems.\n\nThe words ''[[wikt:yes#English|yes]]'' and ''[[wikt:no#English|no]]'' are not easily classified into any of the eight conventional [[parts of speech]]. Although sometimes classified as [[interjection]]s, they do not qualify as such, and they are not [[adverb]]s. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right, [[sentence word]]s, [[word sentences]], or [[pro-sentence]]s, although that category contains more than ''yes'' and ''no'' and not all linguists include them in their lists of sentence words. Sentences consisting solely of one of these two words are classified as [[minor sentence]]s.\n\nThe differences among languages, the fact that in different languages the various words for ''yes'' and ''no'' have different parts of speech and different usages, and that some languages lack a 'yes-no' word system, makes idiomatic translation very difficult.\n\n== Classification of English grammar ==\nAlthough sometimes classified as [[interjection]]s, these words do not express emotion or act as calls for attention; they are not [[adverb]]s because they do not qualify any verb, adjective, or adverb. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right: sentence words or word sentences.<ref name=Sonnenschein>{{cite book|title=A New English Grammar Based on the Recommendations of the Joint Committee on Grammatical Terminology|author=E.

Both Sweet and Wegener include ''yes'' and ''no'' in this category, with Sweet treating them separately from both imperatives and interjections, although Gabelentz does not.<ref>{{cite book|title=200 Years of Syntax|author=Giorgio Graffi|page=121|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|year=2001|isbn=1-58811-052-4}}</ref>\n\nWatts<ref>{{cite book|title=Linguistics Across Historical and Geographical Boundaries|editor1=Dieter Kastovsky |editor2=A.

He also notes their relationship to the interjections ''[[wikt:oh#English|oh]]'' and ''[[wikt:ah#English|ah]]'', which is that the interjections can precede ''yes'' and ''no'' but not follow them. ''Oh'' as an interjection expresses surprise, but in the combined forms ''oh yes'' and ''oh no'' merely acts as an [[intensifier]]; but ''ah'' in the combined forms ''ah yes'' and ''ah no'' retains its standalone meaning, of focusing upon the previous speaker's or writer's last statement. The forms ''*yes oh'', ''*yes ah'', ''*no oh'', and ''*no ah'' are grammatically ill-formed.

When used as [[Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channel]] items, he classifies them as interjections; but when they are used as the responses to a [[yes-no question]], he classifies them as formulaic words. The distinction between an interjection and a formula is, in Ameka's view, that the former does not have an addressee (although it may be directed at a person), whereas the latter does. The ''yes'' or ''no'' in response to the question is addressed at the interrogator, whereas ''yes'' or ''no'' used as a back-channel item is a ''feedback usage'', an utterance that is said to oneself. However, Sorjonen criticizes this analysis as lacking empirical work on the other usages of these words, in addition to interjections and feedback uses.<ref name=Sorjonen>{{cite book|title=Responding in Conversation|author=Marja-Leena Sorjonen|page=19|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2001|isbn=978-90-272-5085-8}}</ref>\n\nBloomfield and Hockett classify the words, when used to answer yes-no questions, as ''special completive interjections''. They classify sentences comprising solely one of these two words as [[minor sentence]]s.<ref name=BloomfieldHockett />\n\nSweet classifies the words in several ways. They are sentence-modifying adverbs, adverbs that act as modifiers to an entire sentence. They are also sentence words, when standing alone. They may, as question responses, also be absolute forms that correspond to what would otherwise be the ''not'' in a negated echo response. For example, a \"No.\" in response to the question \"Is he here?\" is equivalent to the echo response \"He is not here.\" Sweet observes that there is no correspondence with a simple ''yes'' in the latter situation, although the sentence-word \"Certainly.\" provides an absolute form of an emphatic echo response \"He is certainly here.\" Many other adverbs can also be used as sentence words in this way.<ref name=Sweet>{{cite book|title=A New English Grammar|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/anewenglishgram03sweegoog|author=Henry Sweet|chapter=Adverbs|pages=126\u2013127|year=1900|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn= 1-4021-5375-9|author-link=Henry Sweet}}</ref>\n\nUnlike ''yes'', ''no'' can also be an adverb of degree, applying to adjectives solely in the comparative (e.g. ''no greater'', ''no sooner'', but not ''no soon'' or ''no soonest''), and an adjective when applied to nouns (e.g. \"He is no fool.\" and Dyer's \"No clouds, no vapours intervene.\").<ref name=Sweet /><ref>{{cite book|title=The First Lines of English Grammar|author1=Henry Kiddle  |author2=Goold Brown |lastauthoramp=yes |page=102|location=New York|publisher=William Wood and Co.|year=1867|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Brown%2C%20Goold%2C%201791-1857}}</ref>\n\nGrammarians of other languages have created further, similar, special classifications for these types of words. Tesni\u00e8re classifies the French ''oui'' and ''non'' as ''phrasillons logiques'' (along with ''[[wikt:voici#French|voici]]''). Fonagy observes that such a classification may be partly justified for the former two, but suggests that ''[[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] [[holophrase]]s'' is more appropriate.<ref name=\"Fonagy\">{{cite book|title=Languages Within Language|author=Ivan Fonagy|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|year=2001|isbn=0-927232-82-0|page=66}}</ref>\n\n== The Early English four-form system ==\nWhile Modern English has a ''two-form system'' of ''yes'' and ''no'' for affirmatives and negatives, earlier forms of English had a ''four-form system'', comprising the words ''yea'', ''[[wikt:nay#Early Modern English|nay]]'', ''yes'', and ''no''. In essence, ''yes'' and ''no'' were the responses to a question posed in the negative, whereas ''yea'' and ''nay'' were the responses to positively framed questions.\n\n:Will they not go? \u2014 Yes, they will.\n:Will they not go? \u2014 No, they will not.\n:Will they go? \u2014 Yea, they will.\n:Will they go? \u2014 Nay, they will not.\n\nThis is exemplified by the following passage from [[Much Ado about Nothing]]:<ref name=Furness>{{cite book|title=Much Ado about Nothing|author=William Shakespeare|editor=Horace Howard Furness|location=Philadelphia|year=1900|publisher=J. B. Lippincott Co.|page=25}} (editorial footnotes)</ref>\n{{quote|<poem>\n'''Claudio:''' Can the world buie such a iewell?

A. Wright \"Shakespeare does not always observe this rule, and even in the earliest times the usage appears not to have been consistent.\" Furness gives as an example the following, where Hermia's answer should, in following the rule, have been ''yes'':<ref name=Furness /><ref name=Marsh />\n{{quote|<poem>\n'''Demetrius:''' Do not you thinke, The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?\n'''Hermia:''' Yea, and my Father.\n</poem>|sign=[[William Shakespeare]]|source=''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''<ref name=Furness />}}\n\nThis subtle grammatical feature of Early Modern English is recorded by Sir [[Thomas More]] in his critique of [[William Tyndale]]'s translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English, which was then quoted as an authority by later scholars:<ref name=Furness />\n\n{{quote|I would not here note by the way that Tyndale here translateth ''no'' for ''nay'', for it is but a trifle and mistaking of the Englishe worde : saving that ye shoulde see that he whych in two so plain Englishe wordes, and so common as in ''naye'' and ''no'' can not tell when he should take the one and when the tother, is not for translating into Englishe a man very mete. For the use of these two wordes in aunswering a question is this. ''No'' aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative. As for ensample if a manne should aske Tindall himselfe: ys an heretike meete to translate Holy Scripture into Englishe ?

To this question if he will aunswere trewe Englishe, he must aunswere ''no'' and not ''nay''. And a lyke difference is there betwene these two adverbs ''ye'' and ''yes''.

This went unnoticed by scholars such as [[Horne Tooke]], [[Robert Gordon Latham]], and Trench, and was first pointed out by [[George Perkins Marsh]] in his ''Century Dictionary'', where he corrects More's incorrect statement of the first rule, \"''No'' aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative.\", to read ''nay''. That even More got the rule wrong, even while himself dressing down Tyndale for getting it wrong, is seen by Furness as evidence that the four word system was \"too subtle a distinction for practice\".\n\nMarsh found no evidence of a four-form system in [[Moesogoths|M\u0153so-Gothic]], although he reported finding \"traces\" in [[Old English]]. He observed that in the Anglo-Saxon Gospels,\n*positively phrased questions are answered positively with ''[[wikt:gea#Old English|gea]]'' (John 21:15,16, [[King James Version]]: \"Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee\" etc.)\n*and negatively with ''[[wikt:ne#Old English|ne]]'' (Luke 12:51, KJ: \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division\"; 13:4,5, KJ: \"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\"), ''[[wikt:nese#Old English|nese]]'' (John 21:5 \"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.\"; Matthew 13:28,29, KJ: \"The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\"), and ''[[wikt:nic#Old English|nic]]'' meaning \"not I\" (John 18:17, KJ: \"Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.\");\n*while negatively phrased questions are answered positively with ''[[wikt:gyse#Old English|gyse]]'' (Matthew 17:25, KJ: \"they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? He saith, Yes.\")\n*and negatively for example with ''[[wikt:na#Old English|n\u00e2]]'', meaning \"no one\" (John 8:10,11, \"he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord.\").<ref name=Marsh>{{cite book|title=Lectures on the English Language|author=George Perkins Marsh|location=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner &amp; Co.|year=1867|pages=578\u2013583|chapter=Affirmative and Negative Particles|author-link=George Perkins Marsh}}</ref>\n\nMarsh calls this four-form system of Early Modern English a \"needless subtlety\". Tooke called it a \"ridiculous distinction\", with Marsh concluding that Tooke believed Thomas More to have simply made this rule up and observing that Tooke is not alone in his disbelief of More. Marsh, however, points out (having himself analyzed the works of [[John Wycliffe]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Gower]], [[John Skelton]], and [[Robert of Gloucester (historian)|Robert of Gloucester]], and ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' and ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'') that the distinction both existed and was generally and fairly uniformly observed in Early Modern English from the time of Chaucer to the time of Tyndale. But after the time of Tyndale, the four-form system was rapidly replaced by the modern two-form system.<ref name=Marsh />\n\n== Three-form systems ==\nSeveral languages have a ''three-form system'', with two affirmative words and one negative. In a three-form system, the affirmative response to a positively phrased question is the [[markedness|unmarked]] affirmative, the affirmative response to a negatively phrased question is the [[markedness|marked]] affirmative, and the negative response to both forms of question is the (single) negative. For example, in Norwegian the affirmative answer to \"Snakker du norsk?\" (\"Do you speak Norwegian?\") is \"Ja\", and the affirmative answer to \"Snakker du ikke norsk?\" (\"Do you not speak Norwegian?\") is \"Jo\", while the negative answer to ''both'' questions is \"Nei\".<ref name=Marsh /><ref>{{cite book|title=Norwegian|author1=\u00c5se-Berit Strandskogen  |author2=Rolf Strandskogen |lastauthoramp=yes |page=146|year=1986|publisher=Oris Forlag|isbn=0-415-10979-5}}</ref><ref name=HolmesHinchliffe1 /><ref name=Armstrong>{{cite book|title=Translation, Linguistics, Culture|author=Nigel Armstrong|page=95|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85359-805-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Germany|author=Greg Nees|page=74|publisher=Intercultural Press|year=2000|isbn=978-1-877864-75-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] all have three-form systems.

Though, technically Malayalam is a multi-form system of Yes and No as can be seen from below, the former are the formal words for Yes and No.\n\nSwedish, and to some extent Danish and Norwegian, also has additional forms ''[[wikt:javisst#Swedish|javisst]]'' and ''[[wikt:jovisst#Swedish|jovisst]]'', analogous to ''ja'' and ''jo'', to indicate a strong affirmative response. Swedish (and Danish slang) also have the forms ''joho'' and ''nehej'', which both indicate stronger response than ''jo'' or ''nej''.

These words also sound more polite as they don't sound like curt when saying \"No!\" or \"Yes!\". \u0d09\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f means \"it is there\" and the word behaves as an affirmative response like \u0d05\u0d24\u0d47. The usage of \u0d0f\u0d2f\u0d4d to simply mean \"No\" or \"No way!\", is informal and may be casual or sarcastic, while \u0d05\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32 is the more formal way of saying \"false\", \"incorrect\" or that \"it is not\" and is a negative response for questions. The word \u0d05\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32 has a stronger meaning than \u0d05\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32. \u0d36\u0d30\u0d3f is used to mean \"OK\" or \"correct\", with the opposite \u0d36\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32 meaning \"not OK\" or \"not correct\". It is used to answer affirmatively to questions to confirm any action by the asker, but to answer negatively one says \u0d35\u0d47\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d3e. \u0d35\u0d47\u0d23\u0d02 and \u0d35\u0d47\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f both mean to \"want\" and to \"not want\".\n\n== Other languages with four-form systems ==\nLike Early Modern English, the [[Romanian language]] has a four-form system. The affirmative and negative responses to positively phrased questions are ''[[wikt:da#Romanian|da]]'' and ''[[wikt:nu#Romanian|nu]]'', respectively. But in responses to negatively phrased questions they are prefixed with ''[[wikt:ba#Romanian|ba]]'' (i.e. ''ba da'' and ''ba nu''). ''nu'' is also used as a negation adverb, infixed between subject and verb. Thus, for example, the affirmative response to the negatively phrased question \"N-ai pl\u0103tit?\" (\"Didn't you pay?\") is \"Ba da.\" (\"Yes.\"\u2014i.e. \"I did pay.\"), and the negative response to a positively phrased question beginning \"Se poate s\u0103 ...?\" (\"Is it possible to ...?\") is \"Nu, nu se poate.\" (\"No, it is not possible.\"\u2014note the use of ''nu'' for both ''no'' and negation of the verb.)<ref>{{cite book|title=Romanian|author=Ramona G\u00f6ncz\u00f6l-Davies|page=135|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-33825-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Rumanian|author=Graham Mallinson|chapter=answers to yes-no questions|page=21|isbn=0-7099-3537-4|publisher=Croom Helm Ltd|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Clitics Between Syntax and Lexicon|author=Birgit Gerlach|page=60|chapter=The status of Romance clitics between words and affixes|publisher=John Benjamins BV|year=2002|isbn=90-272-2772-1}}</ref>\n\n== Related words in other languages and translation problems ==\nBloomfield and Hockett observe that not all languages have ''special completive interjections''.\n\n=== Finnish ===\n[[Finnish language|Finnish]] does not generally answer yes-no questions with either adverbs or interjections but answers them with a repetition of the verb in the question,<ref name=\"Aveneca_Yes_No systems\">{{cite web |title=Yes/No systems |url=http://aveneca.com/yesno.html |website=Aveneca |accessdate=16 June 2018}}</ref> negating it if the answer is the negative.

The answer to \"Tuletteko kaupungista?\" (\"Are you coming from town?\") is the verb form itself, \"Tulemme.\" (\"We are coming.\") However, in spoken Finnish simple \"Yes\" answer is far more common, \"Joo.\"\n\nNegative questions are answered similarly. Negative answers are just the negated verb form. The answer to \"Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?\" (\"Do you know Mr Lehto?\") is \"En tunne\" (\"I don't know.\") or simply \"En.\" (\"I don't.\").<ref name=BloomfieldHockett /><ref>{{cite book|title=English-Russian Grammar|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/englishrussiagra00reif|author=Carl Philipp Reiff|page=[https://archive.org/details/englishrussiagra00reif/page/134 134]|chapter=The Adverb and the Gerund|year=1862|location=Paris|publisher=Maisonneuve and Co.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Questions and Questioning|editor=Michel Meyer|author1=Wendy G.

A yes-no question can be answered \"yes\" with either \"kyll\u00e4\" or \"joo\", which are not conjugated according to the person and plurality of the verb. \"Ei\", however, is always conjugated and means \"no\".\n\n===Estonian===\n\n[[Estonian language|Estonian]] has a structure similar to Finnish, with both repetitions and interjections. \"Jah\" means \"yes\". Unlike Finnish, the negation particle is always \"ei\", regardless of person and plurality. \"Ei ole\" (\"am/are/is not\") can be replaced by \"pole\" (a contraction of the ancient expression \"ep ole\", meaning the same).\n\nThe word \"k\u00fcll\", cognate to Finnish \"kyll\u00e4\", can be used to reply positively to a negative question: \"Kas sa ei r\u00e4\u00e4gi soome keelt?\" \"R\u00e4\u00e4gin k\u00fcll!\" (\"You don't speak Finnish?\" \"Yes, I do!\") It can also be used to approve a positive statement: \"Sa tulidki kaasa!\" \"Tulin k\u00fcll.\" (\"You (unexpectedly) came along!\" \"Yes I did.\")\n\n=== Latvian ===\nUp until the 16th century [[Latvian language|Latvian]] also didn't have a word for \"yes\" and the common way of responding affirmatively to a question was by repeating the question's verb, just like in Finnish. The modern day \"j\u0101\" was borrowed from [[Middle High German]] \"ja\" and first appeared in 16th-century religious texts, especially [[catechism]]s, in answers to questions about faith. At that time such works were usually translated from German by non-Latvians that had learned Latvian as a foreign language. By the 17th century \"j\u0101\" was being used by some Latvian speakers that lived near the cities, and more frequently when speaking to non-Latvians, but they would revert to agreeing by repeating the question verb when talking among themselves. By the 18th century the use of \"j\u0101\" was still of low frequency, and in Northern Vidzeme the word was almost non-existent till the 18th and early 19th century. Only in the mid-19th century did \"j\u0101\" really become usual everywhere.<ref>{{Cite-book |last=Karulis |first=Konstant\u012bns |title=Latvie\u0161u Etimolo\u0123ijas V\u0101rdn\u012bca |trans-title=The Etymological dictionary of Latvian |language=Latvian |location=R\u012bga |publisher=Avots |year=1992 |page= |isbn=9984-700-12-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Welsh ===\nIt is often said falsely that [[Welsh language|Welsh]] has no words at all for ''yes'' and ''no''. It has ''[[wikt:ie#Welsh|ie]]'' and ''[[wikt:nage#Welsh|nage]]''.  However, these are used only in specialized circumstances and are but some of the ''many'' ways in Welsh of saying yes or no. As in Finnish, the main way to state yes or no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. So the answers to \"''{{lang|cy|Ydy Ffred yn dod?}}''\" (\"Is Ffred coming?\") are either \"''{{lang|cy|Ydy}}''\" (\"He is (coming).\") or \"''{{lang|cy|Nac ydy}}''\" (\"He is not (coming)\"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with ''[[wikt:nag#Welsh|nag]]''. As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned ''yes'' means in response to a negative question. While a ''yes'' response to the question \"You don't like strawberries?\" is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response ''{{lang|cy|ydw}}'' has no ambiguity. The same would apply for Finnish, where the question would be answered with ''{{lang|fi|en}}'' (I don't). For more information on ''yes'' and ''no'' answers to yes-no questions in Welsh, see Jones, listed in [[#Further reading|further reading]].<ref name=\"Goddard\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Basic Welsh|author=Gareth King|chapter=Yes/no answers|page=111|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=978-0-415-12096-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How to say \"Yes\" and \"No\"|work=A Welsh Course|author=Mark H Nodine|date=2003-06-14|url=http://cs.cf.ac.uk./fun/welsh/Lesson02.html|publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science, [[Cardiff University]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Galician and Portuguese ===\n\nThese languages have words for ''yes'' and ''no'', namely ''si'' and ''non'' in [[Galician language|Galician]] and ''sim'' and ''n\u00e3o'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. However answering a question with them is considered less idiomatic than answering with the verb in the proper conjugation.\n\n=== Goidelic languages ===\nThe [[Goidelic languages]] ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]) do not have words for \"yes\" or \"no\" at all. Instead, an [[echo response]] of the main verb used to ask the question is used. Sometimes, one of the words meaning \"to be\" (Irish ''{{lang|ga|t\u00e1}}'' or ''{{lang|ga|is}}'', see [[Irish syntax#The forms meaning \"to be\"|Irish syntax \u00a7 The forms meaning \"to be\"]]; Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|tha}}'' or ''{{lang|gd|is}}'' see [[Scottish Gaelic grammar#verbs|Scottish Gaelic grammar \u00a7 verbs]]; Manx ''{{lang|gv|ta}}'' or ''{{lang|gv|is}}'') is used. For example, the Irish question \"''{{lang|ga|An '''bhfuil''' s\u00e9 ag teacht?}}''\" (\"'''Is''' he coming?\") may be answered ''\"{{lang|ga|T\u00e1}}\"'' (\"Is\") or ''\"{{lang|ga|N\u00edl}}\"'' (\"Is not\"). More frequently, another verb will be used. For example, to respond to \"''{{lang|ga|Ar '''chuala''' s\u00e9?}}''\" (\"Did he '''hear'''?\"), \"''{{lang|ga|Chuala}}''\" (\"Heard\") or \"''{{lang|ga|N\u00edor chuala}}''\" (\"Did not hear\") are used. Irish people frequently give echo answers in English as well, e.g. \"Did you hear?\" Answer \"I heard/I did\".\n\n=== Latin ===\n[[Latin language|Latin]] has no single words for ''yes'' and ''no''.

Echo responses are not uncommon in Japanese.\n\n=== Spanish ===\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the words ''s\u00ed'' (yes) and ''no'' (no) are unambiguously classified as adverbs: not only do they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs. The affirmative ''s\u00ed'' can replace the verb after a negation (''Yo no tengo coche, pero \u00e9l '''s\u00ed''''' = ''I don't own a car, but he '''does''''') or intensify it (''I don't believe he owns a car. / He '''does''' own one!'' = ''No creo que \u00e9l tiene coche. / \u00a1'''S\u00ed''' lo tiene!''). The word ''no'' is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it (''Yo '''no''' tengo coche'' = ''I '''don't''' own a car''). Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation (''No tengo ning\u00fan coche'' = ''I own no car'').\n\n=== Complications ===\nThese differences between languages make translation difficult. No two languages are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], even at the elementary level of words for ''yes'' and ''no''. Translation from two-form to three-form systems is something that English-speaking schoolchildren learning French or German soon encounter. But the mapping is not even as simple as converting two forms into three. There are many idioms, such as reduplication (in French, German, and Italian) of affirmatives for emphasis (the German ''ja ja ja'').\n\nFurthermore, the mappings are one-to-many in both directions. The German ''ja'' has no fewer than 13 English equivalents that vary according to context and usage (''yes'', ''yeah'', and ''no'' when used as an answer; ''well'', ''all right'', ''so'', and ''now'', when used for segmentation; ''oh'', ''ah'', ''uh'', and ''eh'' when used an interjection; and ''do you'', ''will you'', and their various inflections when used as a marker for [[tag question]]s) for example. Moreover, both ''ja'' and ''doch'' are frequently used as [[German modal particle|additional particle]]s for conveying nuanced meaning where, in English, no such particle exists. Straightforward, non-idiomatic, translations from German to English and then back to German can often result in the loss of all of the modal particles such as ''ja'' and ''doch'' from a text.<ref>{{cite book|title=Starting English Teaching|author=Robert Jeffcoate|page=213|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=0-415-05356-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Deaf Way|author1=Carol Erting |author2=Robert C.

Some languages make a distinction between answers to affirmative versus negative questions, thus they may have triplets or quadruplets of words instead. English originally used a four-form system up to and including [[Early Middle English]] but [[Modern English]] has reduced this to a two-form system consisting of just 'yes' and 'no'. It exists in many facets of communication, such as: eye blink communication, head movements, Morse Code, and sign language.  \n\nSome languages do not answer yesses with single words meaning 'yes' or 'no'. [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are among the languages that typically employ echo answers (repeating the verb with either an affirmative or negative form) rather than using words for 'yes' and 'no', though such languages can also have words broadly similar to 'yes' and 'no'. Other languages have systems named two-form, three-form, and four-form systems, depending on how many words for yes and no they employ. Some languages, such as Latin, do not have yes-no word systems.\n\nThe words ''[[wikt:yes#English|yes]]'' and ''[[wikt:no#English|no]]'' are not easily classified into any of the eight conventional [[parts of speech]]. Although sometimes classified as [[interjection]]s, they do not qualify as such, and they are not [[adverb]]s. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right, [[sentence word]]s, [[word sentences]], or [[pro-sentence]]s, although that category contains more than ''yes'' and ''no'' and not all linguists include them in their lists of sentence words. Sentences consisting solely of one of these two words are classified as [[minor sentence]]s.\n\nThe differences among languages, the fact that in different languages the various words for ''yes'' and ''no'' have different parts of speech and different usages, and that some languages lack a 'yes-no' word system, makes idiomatic translation very difficult.\n\n== Classification of English grammar ==\nAlthough sometimes classified as [[interjection]]s, these words do not express emotion or act as calls for attention; they are not [[adverb]]s because they do not qualify any verb, adjective, or adverb. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right: sentence words or word sentences.<ref name=Sonnenschein>{{cite book|title=A New English Grammar Based on the Recommendations of the Joint Committee on Grammatical Terminology|author=E.

He also notes their relationship to the interjections ''[[wikt:oh#English|oh]]'' and ''[[wikt:ah#English|ah]]'', which is that the interjections can precede ''yes'' and ''no'' but not follow them. ''Oh'' as an interjection expresses surprise, but in the combined forms ''oh yes'' and ''oh no'' merely acts as an [[intensifier]]; but ''ah'' in the combined forms ''ah yes'' and ''ah no'' retains its standalone meaning, of focusing upon the previous speaker's or writer's last statement. The forms ''*yes oh'', ''*yes ah'', ''*no oh'', and ''*no ah'' are grammatically ill-formed.

When used as [[Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channel]] items, he classifies them as interjections; but when they are used as the responses to a [[yes-no question]], he classifies them as formulaic words. The distinction between an interjection and a formula is, in Ameka's view, that the former does not have an addressee (although it may be directed at a person), whereas the latter does. The ''yes'' or ''no'' in response to the question is addressed at the interrogator, whereas ''yes'' or ''no'' used as a back-channel item is a ''feedback usage'', an utterance that is said to oneself. However, Sorjonen criticizes this analysis as lacking empirical work on the other usages of these words, in addition to interjections and feedback uses.<ref name=Sorjonen>{{cite book|title=Responding in Conversation|author=Marja-Leena Sorjonen|page=19|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2001|isbn=978-90-272-5085-8}}</ref>\n\nBloomfield and Hockett classify the words, when used to answer yes-no questions, as ''special completive interjections''. They classify sentences comprising solely one of these two words as [[minor sentence]]s.<ref name=BloomfieldHockett />\n\nSweet classifies the words in several ways. They are sentence-modifying adverbs, adverbs that act as modifiers to an entire sentence. They are also sentence words, when standing alone. They may, as question responses, also be absolute forms that correspond to what would otherwise be the ''not'' in a negated echo response. For example, a \"No.\" in response to the question \"Is he here?\" is equivalent to the echo response \"He is not here.\" Sweet observes that there is no correspondence with a simple ''yes'' in the latter situation, although the sentence-word \"Certainly.\" provides an absolute form of an emphatic echo response \"He is certainly here.\" Many other adverbs can also be used as sentence words in this way.<ref name=Sweet>{{cite book|title=A New English Grammar|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/anewenglishgram03sweegoog|author=Henry Sweet|chapter=Adverbs|pages=126\u2013127|year=1900|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn= 1-4021-5375-9|author-link=Henry Sweet}}</ref>\n\nUnlike ''yes'', ''no'' can also be an adverb of degree, applying to adjectives solely in the comparative (e.g. ''no greater'', ''no sooner'', but not ''no soon'' or ''no soonest''), and an adjective when applied to nouns (e.g. \"He is no fool.\" and Dyer's \"No clouds, no vapours intervene.\").<ref name=Sweet /><ref>{{cite book|title=The First Lines of English Grammar|author1=Henry Kiddle  |author2=Goold Brown |lastauthoramp=yes |page=102|location=New York|publisher=William Wood and Co.|year=1867|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Brown%2C%20Goold%2C%201791-1857}}</ref>\n\nGrammarians of other languages have created further, similar, special classifications for these types of words. Tesni\u00e8re classifies the French ''oui'' and ''non'' as ''phrasillons logiques'' (along with ''[[wikt:voici#French|voici]]'').

In essence, ''yes'' and ''no'' were the responses to a question posed in the negative, whereas ''yea'' and ''nay'' were the responses to positively framed questions.\n\n:Will they not go? \u2014 Yes, they will.\n:Will they not go? \u2014 No, they will not.\n:Will they go? \u2014 Yea, they will.\n:Will they go? \u2014 Nay, they will not.\n\nThis is exemplified by the following passage from [[Much Ado about Nothing]]:<ref name=Furness>{{cite book|title=Much Ado about Nothing|author=William Shakespeare|editor=Horace Howard Furness|location=Philadelphia|year=1900|publisher=J.

A. Wright \"Shakespeare does not always observe this rule, and even in the earliest times the usage appears not to have been consistent.\" Furness gives as an example the following, where Hermia's answer should, in following the rule, have been ''yes'':<ref name=Furness /><ref name=Marsh />\n{{quote|<poem>\n'''Demetrius:''' Do not you thinke, The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?\n'''Hermia:''' Yea, and my Father.\n</poem>|sign=[[William Shakespeare]]|source=''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''<ref name=Furness />}}\n\nThis subtle grammatical feature of Early Modern English is recorded by Sir [[Thomas More]] in his critique of [[William Tyndale]]'s translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English, which was then quoted as an authority by later scholars:<ref name=Furness />\n\n{{quote|I would not here note by the way that Tyndale here translateth ''no'' for ''nay'', for it is but a trifle and mistaking of the Englishe worde : saving that ye shoulde see that he whych in two so plain Englishe wordes, and so common as in ''naye'' and ''no'' can not tell when he should take the one and when the tother, is not for translating into Englishe a man very mete. For the use of these two wordes in aunswering a question is this. ''No'' aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative. As for ensample if a manne should aske Tindall himselfe: ys an heretike meete to translate Holy Scripture into Englishe ? Lo to thys question if he will aunswere trew Englishe, he must aunswere ''nay'' and not ''no''. But and if the question be asked hym thus lo: is not an heretike mete to translate Holy Scripture into Englishe ? To this question if he will aunswere trewe Englishe, he must aunswere ''no'' and not ''nay''. And a lyke difference is there betwene these two adverbs ''ye'' and ''yes''. For if the question bee framed unto Tindall by the affirmative in thys fashion. If an heretique falsely translate the New Testament into Englishe, to make his false heresyes seem the word of Godde, be his bokes worthy to be burned ? To this questyon asked in thys wyse, yf he will aunswere true Englishe, he must aunswere ''ye'' and not ''yes''. But now if the question be asked him thus lo; by the negative. If an heretike falsely translate the Newe Testament into Englishe to make his false heresyee seme the word of God, be not hys bokes well worthy to be burned ? To thys question in thys fashion framed if he will aunswere trewe Englishe he may not aunswere ''ye'' but he must answere ''yes'', and say yes marry be they, bothe the translation and the translatour, and al that wyll hold wyth them.|sign=[[Thomas More]]|source=''The Confutation of Tyndale's Answer'', pp. 430<ref>{{cite book|title=The English language|url=https://archive.org/details/lathamenglishlan00lath|author=Robert Gordon Latham|page=[https://archive.org/details/lathamenglishlan00lath/page/497 497]|location=London|publisher=Taylor, Walton, and Maberly|year=1850|author-link=Robert Gordon Latham}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=An Answer to Sir Thomas More's Dialogue|url=https://archive.org/details/ananswertosirth00tracgoog|author=William Tyndale|editor=[[Henry Walter (antiquarian)|Henry Walter]]|location=Cambridge|publisher=The University Press|year=1850|author-link=William Tyndale}}</ref>}}\n\nIn fact, More's exemplification of the rule actually contradicts his statement of what the rule is. This went unnoticed by scholars such as [[Horne Tooke]], [[Robert Gordon Latham]], and Trench, and was first pointed out by [[George Perkins Marsh]] in his ''Century Dictionary'', where he corrects More's incorrect statement of the first rule, \"''No'' aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative.\", to read ''nay''. That even More got the rule wrong, even while himself dressing down Tyndale for getting it wrong, is seen by Furness as evidence that the four word system was \"too subtle a distinction for practice\".\n\nMarsh found no evidence of a four-form system in [[Moesogoths|M\u0153so-Gothic]], although he reported finding \"traces\" in [[Old English]]. He observed that in the Anglo-Saxon Gospels,\n*positively phrased questions are answered positively with ''[[wikt:gea#Old English|gea]]'' (John 21:15,16, [[King James Version]]: \"Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee\" etc.)\n*and negatively with ''[[wikt:ne#Old English|ne]]'' (Luke 12:51, KJ: \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division\"; 13:4,5, KJ: \"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\"), ''[[wikt:nese#Old English|nese]]'' (John 21:5 \"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.\"; Matthew 13:28,29, KJ: \"The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\"), and ''[[wikt:nic#Old English|nic]]'' meaning \"not I\" (John 18:17, KJ: \"Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.\");\n*while negatively phrased questions are answered positively with ''[[wikt:gyse#Old English|gyse]]'' (Matthew 17:25, KJ: \"they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? He saith, Yes.\")\n*and negatively for example with ''[[wikt:na#Old English|n\u00e2]]'', meaning \"no one\" (John 8:10,11, \"he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord.\").<ref name=Marsh>{{cite book|title=Lectures on the English Language|author=George Perkins Marsh|location=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner &amp; Co.|year=1867|pages=578\u2013583|chapter=Affirmative and Negative Particles|author-link=George Perkins Marsh}}</ref>\n\nMarsh calls this four-form system of Early Modern English a \"needless subtlety\". Tooke called it a \"ridiculous distinction\", with Marsh concluding that Tooke believed Thomas More to have simply made this rule up and observing that Tooke is not alone in his disbelief of More. Marsh, however, points out (having himself analyzed the works of [[John Wycliffe]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Gower]], [[John Skelton]], and [[Robert of Gloucester (historian)|Robert of Gloucester]], and ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' and ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'') that the distinction both existed and was generally and fairly uniformly observed in Early Modern English from the time of Chaucer to the time of Tyndale. But after the time of Tyndale, the four-form system was rapidly replaced by the modern two-form system.<ref name=Marsh />\n\n== Three-form systems ==\nSeveral languages have a ''three-form system'', with two affirmative words and one negative. In a three-form system, the affirmative response to a positively phrased question is the [[markedness|unmarked]] affirmative, the affirmative response to a negatively phrased question is the [[markedness|marked]] affirmative, and the negative response to both forms of question is the (single) negative. For example, in Norwegian the affirmative answer to \"Snakker du norsk?\" (\"Do you speak Norwegian?\") is \"Ja\", and the affirmative answer to \"Snakker du ikke norsk?\" (\"Do you not speak Norwegian?\") is \"Jo\", while the negative answer to ''both'' questions is \"Nei\".<ref name=Marsh /><ref>{{cite book|title=Norwegian|author1=\u00c5se-Berit Strandskogen  |author2=Rolf Strandskogen |lastauthoramp=yes |page=146|year=1986|publisher=Oris Forlag|isbn=0-415-10979-5}}</ref><ref name=HolmesHinchliffe1 /><ref name=Armstrong>{{cite book|title=Translation, Linguistics, Culture|author=Nigel Armstrong|page=95|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85359-805-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Germany|author=Greg Nees|page=74|publisher=Intercultural Press|year=2000|isbn=978-1-877864-75-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] all have three-form systems.

Though, technically Malayalam is a multi-form system of Yes and No as can be seen from below, the former are the formal words for Yes and No.\n\nSwedish, and to some extent Danish and Norwegian, also has additional forms ''[[wikt:javisst#Swedish|javisst]]'' and ''[[wikt:jovisst#Swedish|jovisst]]'', analogous to ''ja'' and ''jo'', to indicate a strong affirmative response. Swedish (and Danish slang) also have the forms ''joho'' and ''nehej'', which both indicate stronger response than ''jo'' or ''nej''.

These words also sound more polite as they don't sound like curt when saying \"No!\" or \"Yes!\". \u0d09\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f means \"it is there\" and the word behaves as an affirmative response like \u0d05\u0d24\u0d47. The usage of \u0d0f\u0d2f\u0d4d to simply mean \"No\" or \"No way!\", is informal and may be casual or sarcastic, while \u0d05\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32 is the more formal way of saying \"false\", \"incorrect\" or that \"it is not\" and is a negative response for questions. The word \u0d05\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32 has a stronger meaning than \u0d05\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32. \u0d36\u0d30\u0d3f is used to mean \"OK\" or \"correct\", with the opposite \u0d36\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32 meaning \"not OK\" or \"not correct\". It is used to answer affirmatively to questions to confirm any action by the asker, but to answer negatively one says \u0d35\u0d47\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d3e. \u0d35\u0d47\u0d23\u0d02 and \u0d35\u0d47\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f both mean to \"want\" and to \"not want\".\n\n== Other languages with four-form systems ==\nLike Early Modern English, the [[Romanian language]] has a four-form system. The affirmative and negative responses to positively phrased questions are ''[[wikt:da#Romanian|da]]'' and ''[[wikt:nu#Romanian|nu]]'', respectively. But in responses to negatively phrased questions they are prefixed with ''[[wikt:ba#Romanian|ba]]'' (i.e. ''ba da'' and ''ba nu''). ''nu'' is also used as a negation adverb, infixed between subject and verb. Thus, for example, the affirmative response to the negatively phrased question \"N-ai pl\u0103tit?\" (\"Didn't you pay?\") is \"Ba da.\" (\"Yes.\"\u2014i.e. \"I did pay.\"), and the negative response to a positively phrased question beginning \"Se poate s\u0103 ...?\" (\"Is it possible to ...?\") is \"Nu, nu se poate.\" (\"No, it is not possible.\"\u2014note the use of ''nu'' for both ''no'' and negation of the verb.)<ref>{{cite book|title=Romanian|author=Ramona G\u00f6ncz\u00f6l-Davies|page=135|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-33825-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Rumanian|author=Graham Mallinson|chapter=answers to yes-no questions|page=21|isbn=0-7099-3537-4|publisher=Croom Helm Ltd|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Clitics Between Syntax and Lexicon|author=Birgit Gerlach|page=60|chapter=The status of Romance clitics between words and affixes|publisher=John Benjamins BV|year=2002|isbn=90-272-2772-1}}</ref>\n\n== Related words in other languages and translation problems ==\nBloomfield and Hockett observe that not all languages have ''special completive interjections''.\n\n=== Finnish ===\n[[Finnish language|Finnish]] does not generally answer yes-no questions with either adverbs or interjections but answers them with a repetition of the verb in the question,<ref name=\"Aveneca_Yes_No systems\">{{cite web |title=Yes/No systems |url=http://aveneca.com/yesno.html |website=Aveneca |accessdate=16 June 2018}}</ref> negating it if the answer is the negative.

The answer to \"Tuletteko kaupungista?\" (\"Are you coming from town?\") is the verb form itself, \"Tulemme.\" (\"We are coming.\") However, in spoken Finnish simple \"Yes\" answer is far more common, \"Joo.\"\n\nNegative questions are answered similarly. Negative answers are just the negated verb form. The answer to \"Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?\" (\"Do you know Mr Lehto?\") is \"En tunne\" (\"I don't know.\") or simply \"En.\" (\"I don't.\").<ref name=BloomfieldHockett /><ref>{{cite book|title=English-Russian Grammar|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/englishrussiagra00reif|author=Carl Philipp Reiff|page=[https://archive.org/details/englishrussiagra00reif/page/134 134]|chapter=The Adverb and the Gerund|year=1862|location=Paris|publisher=Maisonneuve and Co.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Questions and Questioning|editor=Michel Meyer|author1=Wendy G.

A yes-no question can be answered \"yes\" with either \"kyll\u00e4\" or \"joo\", which are not conjugated according to the person and plurality of the verb. \"Ei\", however, is always conjugated and means \"no\".\n\n===Estonian===\n\n[[Estonian language|Estonian]] has a structure similar to Finnish, with both repetitions and interjections. \"Jah\" means \"yes\". Unlike Finnish, the negation particle is always \"ei\", regardless of person and plurality. \"Ei ole\" (\"am/are/is not\") can be replaced by \"pole\" (a contraction of the ancient expression \"ep ole\", meaning the same).\n\nThe word \"k\u00fcll\", cognate to Finnish \"kyll\u00e4\", can be used to reply positively to a negative question: \"Kas sa ei r\u00e4\u00e4gi soome keelt?\" \"R\u00e4\u00e4gin k\u00fcll!\" (\"You don't speak Finnish?\" \"Yes, I do!\") It can also be used to approve a positive statement: \"Sa tulidki kaasa!\" \"Tulin k\u00fcll.\" (\"You (unexpectedly) came along!\" \"Yes I did.\")\n\n=== Latvian ===\nUp until the 16th century [[Latvian language|Latvian]] also didn't have a word for \"yes\" and the common way of responding affirmatively to a question was by repeating the question's verb, just like in Finnish. The modern day \"j\u0101\" was borrowed from [[Middle High German]] \"ja\" and first appeared in 16th-century religious texts, especially [[catechism]]s, in answers to questions about faith. At that time such works were usually translated from German by non-Latvians that had learned Latvian as a foreign language. By the 17th century \"j\u0101\" was being used by some Latvian speakers that lived near the cities, and more frequently when speaking to non-Latvians, but they would revert to agreeing by repeating the question verb when talking among themselves. By the 18th century the use of \"j\u0101\" was still of low frequency, and in Northern Vidzeme the word was almost non-existent till the 18th and early 19th century. Only in the mid-19th century did \"j\u0101\" really become usual everywhere.<ref>{{Cite-book |last=Karulis |first=Konstant\u012bns |title=Latvie\u0161u Etimolo\u0123ijas V\u0101rdn\u012bca |trans-title=The Etymological dictionary of Latvian |language=Latvian |location=R\u012bga |publisher=Avots |year=1992 |page= |isbn=9984-700-12-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Welsh ===\nIt is often said falsely that [[Welsh language|Welsh]] has no words at all for ''yes'' and ''no''. It has ''[[wikt:ie#Welsh|ie]]'' and ''[[wikt:nage#Welsh|nage]]''.  However, these are used only in specialized circumstances and are but some of the ''many'' ways in Welsh of saying yes or no. As in Finnish, the main way to state yes or no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. So the answers to \"''{{lang|cy|Ydy Ffred yn dod?}}''\" (\"Is Ffred coming?\") are either \"''{{lang|cy|Ydy}}''\" (\"He is (coming).\") or \"''{{lang|cy|Nac ydy}}''\" (\"He is not (coming)\"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with ''[[wikt:nag#Welsh|nag]]''. As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned ''yes'' means in response to a negative question. While a ''yes'' response to the question \"You don't like strawberries?\" is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response ''{{lang|cy|ydw}}'' has no ambiguity. The same would apply for Finnish, where the question would be answered with ''{{lang|fi|en}}'' (I don't). For more information on ''yes'' and ''no'' answers to yes-no questions in Welsh, see Jones, listed in [[#Further reading|further reading]].<ref name=\"Goddard\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Basic Welsh|author=Gareth King|chapter=Yes/no answers|page=111|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=978-0-415-12096-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How to say \"Yes\" and \"No\"|work=A Welsh Course|author=Mark H Nodine|date=2003-06-14|url=http://cs.cf.ac.uk./fun/welsh/Lesson02.html|publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science, [[Cardiff University]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Galician and Portuguese ===\n\nThese languages have words for ''yes'' and ''no'', namely ''si'' and ''non'' in [[Galician language|Galician]] and ''sim'' and ''n\u00e3o'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. However answering a question with them is considered less idiomatic than answering with the verb in the proper conjugation.\n\n=== Goidelic languages ===\nThe [[Goidelic languages]] ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]) do not have words for \"yes\" or \"no\" at all. Instead, an [[echo response]] of the main verb used to ask the question is used. Sometimes, one of the words meaning \"to be\" (Irish ''{{lang|ga|t\u00e1}}'' or ''{{lang|ga|is}}'', see [[Irish syntax#The forms meaning \"to be\"|Irish syntax \u00a7 The forms meaning \"to be\"]]; Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|tha}}'' or ''{{lang|gd|is}}'' see [[Scottish Gaelic grammar#verbs|Scottish Gaelic grammar \u00a7 verbs]]; Manx ''{{lang|gv|ta}}'' or ''{{lang|gv|is}}'') is used. For example, the Irish question \"''{{lang|ga|An '''bhfuil''' s\u00e9 ag teacht?}}''\" (\"'''Is''' he coming?\") may be answered ''\"{{lang|ga|T\u00e1}}\"'' (\"Is\") or ''\"{{lang|ga|N\u00edl}}\"'' (\"Is not\"). More frequently, another verb will be used. For example, to respond to \"''{{lang|ga|Ar '''chuala''' s\u00e9?}}''\" (\"Did he '''hear'''?\"), \"''{{lang|ga|Chuala}}''\" (\"Heard\") or \"''{{lang|ga|N\u00edor chuala}}''\" (\"Did not hear\") are used. Irish people frequently give echo answers in English as well, e.g. \"Did you hear?\" Answer \"I heard/I did\".\n\n=== Latin ===\n[[Latin language|Latin]] has no single words for ''yes'' and ''no''. Their functions as [[intensifier]]s and interjections are taken up by using the [[vocative case]]. Their functions as word sentence responses to yes-no questions are taken up by ''sentence adverbs'', single adverbs that are sentence modifiers and also used as word sentences. There are several such adverbs classed as [[truth-value]] adverbs\u2014including ''[[wikt:certe#Latin|certe]]'', ''[[wikt:fortasse#Latin|fortasse]]'', ''[[wikt:nimirum#Latin|nimirum]]'', ''[[wikt:plane#Latin|plane]]'', ''[[wikt:vero#Latin|vero]]'', ''[[wikt:etiam#Latin|etiam]]'', ''[[wikt:sane#Latin|sane]]'', ''[[wikt:minime#Latin|minime]]'', and ''[[wikt:videlicet#Latin|videlicet]]''. They express the speaker's/writer's feelings about the truth value of a proposition. They, in conjunction with the negator ''[[wikt:non#Latin|non]]'', are used as responses to yes-no questions.<ref name=BloomfieldHockett /><ref>{{cite book|title=Latin Grammar|author=Dirk G. J.

Echo responses are not uncommon in Japanese.\n\n=== Spanish ===\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the words ''s\u00ed'' (yes) and ''no'' (no) are unambiguously classified as adverbs: not only do they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs. The affirmative ''s\u00ed'' can replace the verb after a negation (''Yo no tengo coche, pero \u00e9l '''s\u00ed''''' = ''I don't own a car, but he '''does''''') or intensify it (''I don't believe he owns a car. / He '''does''' own one!'' = ''No creo que \u00e9l tiene coche. / \u00a1'''S\u00ed''' lo tiene!''). The word ''no'' is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it (''Yo '''no''' tengo coche'' = ''I '''don't''' own a car''). Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation (''No tengo ning\u00fan coche'' = ''I own no car'').\n\n=== Complications ===\nThese differences between languages make translation difficult. No two languages are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], even at the elementary level of words for ''yes'' and ''no''. Translation from two-form to three-form systems is something that English-speaking schoolchildren learning French or German soon encounter. But the mapping is not even as simple as converting two forms into three. There are many idioms, such as reduplication (in French, German, and Italian) of affirmatives for emphasis (the German ''ja ja ja'').\n\nFurthermore, the mappings are one-to-many in both directions. The German ''ja'' has no fewer than 13 English equivalents that vary according to context and usage (''yes'', ''yeah'', and ''no'' when used as an answer; ''well'', ''all right'', ''so'', and ''now'', when used for segmentation; ''oh'', ''ah'', ''uh'', and ''eh'' when used an interjection; and ''do you'', ''will you'', and their various inflections when used as a marker for [[tag question]]s) for example. Moreover, both ''ja'' and ''doch'' are frequently used as [[German modal particle|additional particle]]s for conveying nuanced meaning where, in English, no such particle exists. Straightforward, non-idiomatic, translations from German to English and then back to German can often result in the loss of all of the modal particles such as ''ja'' and ''doch'' from a text.<ref>{{cite book|title=Starting English Teaching|author=Robert Jeffcoate|page=213|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=0-415-05356-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Deaf Way|author1=Carol Erting |author2=Robert C.

It dissipates the proton gradient across [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]] membranes, collapsing the [[proton motive force]] that the cell uses to produce most of its [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] chemical energy. Instead of producing ATP, the energy of the proton gradient is lost as heat.<ref name=\"3550200Tab1\" />\n\nDNP is often used in [[biochemistry]] research to help explore the [[bioenergetics]] of [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] and other [[membrane transport]] processes.\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\nDNP acts as a [[protonophore]], allowing protons to leak across the inner [[mitochondrial membrane]] and thus bypass [[ATP synthase]]. This makes ATP energy production less efficient. In effect, part of the energy that is normally produced from cellular respiration is wasted as heat. The inefficiency is proportional to the dose of DNP that is taken. As the dose increases and energy production is made more inefficient, metabolic rate increases (and more fat is burned) in order to compensate for the inefficiency and to meet energy demands. DNP is probably the best known agent for [[uncoupler|uncoupling]] [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The \"[[phosphorylation]]\" of [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) by ATP synthase gets disconnected or \"uncoupled\" from oxidation.\n\n\"Dinitrophenol uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, causes release of calcium from mitochondrial stores and prevents calcium re-uptake. This leads to free intracellular calcium and causes muscle contraction and hyperthermia. [[Dantrolene]] inhibits calcium release from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which reduces intracellular calcium. The resulting muscle relaxation allows heat dissipation. There is little risk to dantrolene administration. Since dantrolene may be effective in reducing hyperthermia caused by agents that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, early administration may improve outcome.\"<ref name=\"pmid16749560\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Barker K, Seger D, Kumar S|year=2006|title=Comment on \"Pediatric fatality following ingestion of Dinitrophenol: postmortem identification of a 'dietary supplement'\"|journal=Clin Toxicol|volume=44|issue=3|pages=351|doi=10.1080/15563650600584709|pmid=16749560}}</ref>\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nInformation about [[pharmacokinetics]] of DNP in humans is limited.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] | title = Ambient water quality criteria for nitrophenols, 440/5-80-063 | url = http://www.epa.gov/ost/pc/ambientwqc/nitrophenols80.pdf | year = 1980| accessdate= 9 June 2008 }}</ref> The [[ATSDR]]'s Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols remarks that DNP elimination appears to be rapid except when liver function is impaired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=729&tid=132|title=Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols|author1=Harris, M.

It dissipates the proton gradient across [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]] membranes, collapsing the [[proton motive force]] that the cell uses to produce most of its [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] chemical energy. Instead of producing ATP, the energy of the proton gradient is lost as heat.<ref name=\"3550200Tab1\" />\n\nDNP is often used in [[biochemistry]] research to help explore the [[bioenergetics]] of [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] and other [[membrane transport]] processes.\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\nDNP acts as a [[protonophore]], allowing protons to leak across the inner [[mitochondrial membrane]] and thus bypass [[ATP synthase]]. This makes ATP energy production less efficient. In effect, part of the energy that is normally produced from cellular respiration is wasted as heat. The inefficiency is proportional to the dose of DNP that is taken. As the dose increases and energy production is made more inefficient, metabolic rate increases (and more fat is burned) in order to compensate for the inefficiency and to meet energy demands. DNP is probably the best known agent for [[uncoupler|uncoupling]] [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The \"[[phosphorylation]]\" of [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) by ATP synthase gets disconnected or \"uncoupled\" from oxidation.\n\n\"Dinitrophenol uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, causes release of calcium from mitochondrial stores and prevents calcium re-uptake. This leads to free intracellular calcium and causes muscle contraction and hyperthermia. [[Dantrolene]] inhibits calcium release from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which reduces intracellular calcium. The resulting muscle relaxation allows heat dissipation. There is little risk to dantrolene administration. Since dantrolene may be effective in reducing hyperthermia caused by agents that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, early administration may improve outcome.\"<ref name=\"pmid16749560\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Barker K, Seger D, Kumar S|year=2006|title=Comment on \"Pediatric fatality following ingestion of Dinitrophenol: postmortem identification of a 'dietary supplement'\"|journal=Clin Toxicol|volume=44|issue=3|pages=351|doi=10.1080/15563650600584709|pmid=16749560}}</ref>\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nInformation about [[pharmacokinetics]] of DNP in humans is limited.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] | title = Ambient water quality criteria for nitrophenols, 440/5-80-063 | url = http://www.epa.gov/ost/pc/ambientwqc/nitrophenols80.pdf | year = 1980| accessdate= 9 June 2008 }}</ref> The [[ATSDR]]'s Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols remarks that DNP elimination appears to be rapid except when liver function is impaired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=729&tid=132|title=Toxicological Profile for Dinitrophenols|author1=Harris, M.

The petals are typically yellow, white, or orange, and the sepals are yellow, orange, green, or reddish brown.  The petals and sepals may be marked sparsely or densely with red, reddish purple, purple, or reddish brown spots. The [[Labellum (botany)|lip]] (ventral petal) may be very similar to the other two petals, as in ''[[Lycaste aromatica]]'' or ''Lycaste brevispatha'', or colored quite distinctively, as in several subspecies and varieties of ''[[Lycaste macrophylla]]''.  Most ''Lycaste'' flowers are medium in size, averaging about 5 to 10&nbsp;cm, but ''Lyc. schilleriana'' is 16\u201318&nbsp;cm across.  Some ''Lycaste'' blooms have a unique fragrance - the scent of ''Lyc. aromatica'' has been variously described as cinnamon or clove.  The blooms of the species ''Lyc. cochleata'', ''consobrina'', and ''[[Lycaste cruenta|cruenta]]'' also have a pleasant scent.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe ''World Checklist of Selected Plant Families'', maintained by the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens]] at Kew, is recognized by the American Orchid Society as the definitive authority on [[orchid taxonomy]]. The ''Checklist'' currently acknowledges 31 species of ''Lycaste'', 3 natural hybrids, 2 [[subspecies]] (and 1 [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate subspecies]]), and 1 [[Variety (botany)|variety]]. Orchid growers and orchid collectors, who tend to be taxonomic \"splitters\" more often than \"lumpers\" (see [[lumpers and splitters]]), recognize additional subspecies and varieties of ''Lycaste'', as well as alba (white) forms of several species.\n=== Sections ===\nThe ''Lycastes'' have been divided into four sections, one of which has two subsections:\n*Section Deciduosae - [[deciduous]], that is, they usually lose their leaves during an annual [[Dormancy|dormant period]]\n**Subsection Xanthanthae - have yellow to orange blooms; the name is from xantho - yellow, and anthos - flower\n**Subsection Paradeciduosae - have pink-marked white blooms; the name is from para- similar or near, and deciduosae- deciduous ones\n*Section Longisepalae - has very long sepals\n*Section Macrophyllae - keep their leaves during dormancy; the name is from macro- large and phyllae- leaves\n*Section Fimbriatae - typically have fringed lips\n\nAll but two of the ''Deciduosae'' have [[Spine (botany)|spine]]s at the apices of their [[pseudobulb]]s, that become exposed when the leaves are dropped - the exceptions are a ''Xanthanthae'' species, ''Lycaste lasioglossa'', and a ''Paradeciduosae'' species, ''Lycaste tricolor''.  Both of these species lack spines, and may bloom when leaves are still present.\n== List of species by section ==\nThe recognized Xanthanthae species include:\n\n*''[[Lycaste aromatica]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste bradeorum]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste campbelli]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste cochleata]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste consobrina]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste crinita]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste cruenta]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste deppei]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste lasioglossa]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste macrobulbon]]''.\n[[Image:Lycaste aromatica.jpg | thumb | right | 225px | Lycaste aromatica]]\n\nThe ''Paradeciduosae'' species include:\n*''[[Lycaste brevispatha]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste tricolor]]''.\n[[Image:Lycaste-Cassiopeia.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Lycaste Cassipeia \"Autumn glow\" (a cultivar)]]\n\nThe ''Macrophyllae'' form a large complex, with subspecies and varieties that can be considered to be in the process of differentiating into new full species.  The ''Macrophyllae'' species include:\n[[Image:Lycaste Xytriophora.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''Lycaste xytriophora'']]\n[[File:Lycaste dowiana - Flickr 003.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''L. dowiana'']]\n*''[[Lycaste dowiana]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste leucantha]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste macrophylla]]''\n** ''Lycaste macrophylla'' var.

The petals are typically yellow, white, or orange, and the sepals are yellow, orange, green, or reddish brown.  The petals and sepals may be marked sparsely or densely with red, reddish purple, purple, or reddish brown spots. The [[Labellum (botany)|lip]] (ventral petal) may be very similar to the other two petals, as in ''[[Lycaste aromatica]]'' or ''Lycaste brevispatha'', or colored quite distinctively, as in several subspecies and varieties of ''[[Lycaste macrophylla]]''.  Most ''Lycaste'' flowers are medium in size, averaging about 5 to 10&nbsp;cm, but ''Lyc. schilleriana'' is 16\u201318&nbsp;cm across.  Some ''Lycaste'' blooms have a unique fragrance - the scent of ''Lyc. aromatica'' has been variously described as cinnamon or clove.  The blooms of the species ''Lyc. cochleata'', ''consobrina'', and ''[[Lycaste cruenta|cruenta]]'' also have a pleasant scent.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe ''World Checklist of Selected Plant Families'', maintained by the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens]] at Kew, is recognized by the American Orchid Society as the definitive authority on [[orchid taxonomy]]. The ''Checklist'' currently acknowledges 31 species of ''Lycaste'', 3 natural hybrids, 2 [[subspecies]] (and 1 [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate subspecies]]), and 1 [[Variety (botany)|variety]]. Orchid growers and orchid collectors, who tend to be taxonomic \"splitters\" more often than \"lumpers\" (see [[lumpers and splitters]]), recognize additional subspecies and varieties of ''Lycaste'', as well as alba (white) forms of several species.\n=== Sections ===\nThe ''Lycastes'' have been divided into four sections, one of which has two subsections:\n*Section Deciduosae - [[deciduous]], that is, they usually lose their leaves during an annual [[Dormancy|dormant period]]\n**Subsection Xanthanthae - have yellow to orange blooms; the name is from xantho - yellow, and anthos - flower\n**Subsection Paradeciduosae - have pink-marked white blooms; the name is from para- similar or near, and deciduosae- deciduous ones\n*Section Longisepalae - has very long sepals\n*Section Macrophyllae - keep their leaves during dormancy; the name is from macro- large and phyllae- leaves\n*Section Fimbriatae - typically have fringed lips\n\nAll but two of the ''Deciduosae'' have [[Spine (botany)|spine]]s at the apices of their [[pseudobulb]]s, that become exposed when the leaves are dropped - the exceptions are a ''Xanthanthae'' species, ''Lycaste lasioglossa'', and a ''Paradeciduosae'' species, ''Lycaste tricolor''.  Both of these species lack spines, and may bloom when leaves are still present.\n== List of species by section ==\nThe recognized Xanthanthae species include:\n\n*''[[Lycaste aromatica]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste bradeorum]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste campbelli]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste cochleata]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste consobrina]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste crinita]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste cruenta]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste deppei]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste lasioglossa]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste macrobulbon]]''.\n[[Image:Lycaste aromatica.jpg | thumb | right | 225px | Lycaste aromatica]]\n\nThe ''Paradeciduosae'' species include:\n*''[[Lycaste brevispatha]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste tricolor]]''.\n[[Image:Lycaste-Cassiopeia.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Lycaste Cassipeia \"Autumn glow\" (a cultivar)]]\n\nThe ''Macrophyllae'' form a large complex, with subspecies and varieties that can be considered to be in the process of differentiating into new full species.  The ''Macrophyllae'' species include:\n[[Image:Lycaste Xytriophora.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''Lycaste xytriophora'']]\n[[File:Lycaste dowiana - Flickr 003.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''L. dowiana'']]\n*''[[Lycaste dowiana]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste leucantha]]'', \n*''[[Lycaste macrophylla]]''\n** ''Lycaste macrophylla'' var.
