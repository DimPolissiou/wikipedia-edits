[[Hearst Corporation|Hearts Magazines UK]]|last=Corner|first=Lewis}}</ref> Randall Roberts from ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in-depth about the repercussions of Swift using dubstep in her songs, and her departure from country music with the songs from ''Red'':\n<blockquote>\nIt's unfair to criticize a 22-year-old for adapting with the times, though, especially considering the sound in question is merely one part of a precision-built machine that is 'I Knew You Were Trouble'. After all, Swift is the pop moment, and the ways in which she and her peers adapt new sounds and vibes into their work is the lifeblood of pop innovation. Even if the bass drop in question is a conceit \u2013 it's not like the song is going to be a hit among dudes rocking to Rusko \u2013 the Max Martin/Shellback collaboration is made better by the bass (as is usually the case).\n\nIt's for that reason that Swift\u2019s use of it has prompted so much discussion. Pop has been sonically conservative for the past half-decade (at least). Any hint at evolution or surprise from the upper echelons of the charts is a welcome development. And even if said surprise is little and relatively inconsequential, it serves as a reminder of pop's fluidity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/09/entertainment/la-et-ms-first-take-taylor-swift-accents-new-single-with-hint-of-dubstep-20121009|title=First take: Taylor Swift accents new single with hint of dubstep|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=December 11, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[MTV News]]' Jocelyn Vena described the track as \"chaotic\", commenting on how \"the song touches on all genres of music, with moments of straight-up Top 40 pop, country and even dance, with its grinding effects, especially on the bumping chorus.\"<ref name=\"chaos\">{{cite news|title=Taylor Swift Debuts \"Chaotic\" Red Track \"I Knew You Were Trouble\"|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1695154/taylor-swift-red-i-knew-you-were-trouble.jhtml|publisher=MTV News.

Swift wakes up on an abandoned desert, surrounded by trash and debris, and wearing dark makeup. Flashbacks show Swift and her boyfriend engaging in various stunts, along with a few tender moments, such as when Swift's boyfriend gives her a necklace as a gift. After a while of what seems to be a good relationship, she begins to realize something is wrong. While in his parked car, he leans over to kiss her when some police pull up for him. He starts a fight in a club, which results in the both of them being injured. There are also scenes of her in a grimy small bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror. While at an outdoor concert, she sees him kissing a large number of different girls. He then looks at her in a nonchalant fashion. She falls asleep in the desert where the party is being held, and wakes up alone the next morning. The video ends with her letting go of the necklace he gave her.\n\n==Live performances and covers==\n\nSwift premiered the song at the [[American Music Awards of 2012|40th Annual American Music Awards]]. Swift traveled to Australia on a promotional tour, which featured performances on ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'', followed by a performance at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2012|ARIA Music Awards 2012]].

It was released on October 9, 2012, in the [[United States]] by [[Big Machine Records]] as the third [[Promotional recording#Countdown to album release programs|promotional single]] from the album. <!--- THIS IS A TAYLOR SWIFT SONG, NOT A LOSTPROPHETS SONG!!! ADDING SUCH INFORMATION TO ARTICLES IS UNACCEPTABLE  --->Later, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" was released as the third single from ''Red'' on November 27, 2012, in the United States.

After all, Swift is the pop moment, and the ways in which she and her peers adapt new sounds and vibes into their work is the lifeblood of pop innovation. Even if the bass drop in question is a conceit \u2013 it's not like the song is going to be a hit among dudes rocking to Rusko \u2013 the Max Martin/Shellback collaboration is made better by the bass (as is usually the case).\n\nIt's for that reason that Swift\u2019s use of it has prompted so much discussion. Pop has been sonically conservative for the past half-decade (at least). Any hint at evolution or surprise from the upper echelons of the charts is a welcome development. And even if said surprise is little and relatively inconsequential, it serves as a reminder of pop's fluidity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/09/entertainment/la-et-ms-first-take-taylor-swift-accents-new-single-with-hint-of-dubstep-20121009|title=First take: Taylor Swift accents new single with hint of dubstep|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=December 11, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[MTV News]]' Jocelyn Vena described the track as \"chaotic\", commenting on how \"the song touches on all genres of music, with moments of straight-up Top 40 pop, country and even dance, with its grinding effects, especially on the bumping chorus.\"<ref name=\"chaos\">{{cite news|title=Taylor Swift Debuts \"Chaotic\" Red Track \"I Knew You Were Trouble\"|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1695154/taylor-swift-red-i-knew-you-were-trouble.jhtml|publisher=MTV News.

Swift wakes up on an abandoned desert, surrounded by trash and debris, and wearing dark makeup. Flashbacks show Swift and her boyfriend engaging in various stunts, along with a few tender moments, such as when Swift's boyfriend gives her a necklace as a gift. After a while of what seems to be a good relationship, she begins to realize something is wrong. While in his parked car, he leans over to kiss her when some police pull up for him. He starts a fight in a club, which results in the both of them being injured. There are also scenes of her in a grimy small bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror. While at an outdoor concert, she sees him kissing a large number of different girls. He then looks at her in a nonchalant fashion. She falls asleep in the desert where the party is being held, and wakes up alone the next morning. The video ends with her letting go of the necklace he gave her.\n\n==Live performances and covers==\n\nSwift premiered the song at the [[American Music Awards of 2012|40th Annual American Music Awards]].

behavior. For one study, subjects took part in a behavioral experiment where the distribution of a real amount of money was decided. The rules allowed both fair and unfair offers. The negotiating partner could subsequently accept or decline the offer. The fairer the offer, the less probable a refusal by the negotiating partner. If no agreement was reached, neither party earned anything. Test subjects with an artificially enhanced testosterone level generally made better, fairer offers than those who received placebos, thus reducing the risk of a rejection of their offer to a minimum.

He lives in Yorkshire. He is around 40 years old. He is desperate for cash, and uses his strong military planning experience and intelligence to raid several sub post offices in remote moorland villages. He is seen scurrying away over rooftops by witnesses, and becomes known as The Black Panther, due to his black chilling hood, and ability to disappear into the night. He murders three postmasters who attempt to apprehend him during nocturnal robberies. (In those days, cash was routinely held on Post Office Premises, and weak windows and doors allowed easy access for a highly skilled military man like Nielson.) He is clearly a psychopath, and displays obsessive personality traits.\n\nHe reads in a newspaper of the wealthy Whittle family, and Lesley, age 17, the heiress. He travels to Highley, Shropshire and kidnaps her from her bed, silently. He drives her to Bathpoool Park, Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. He takes her 60 feet underground into a reservoir drainage shaft system. He puts her on a narrow ledge, with food and drink, so that nobody can possibly hear or find her. He puts a steel ligature on her neck to stop her escaping while he is away arranging the ransom.\n\nHe sends a ransom demand by means of plastic tape placed in a telephone box, and her brother Ronald is to deliver \u00a350k in a case to Bathpool Park. The family decide to inform the police. Ronald is to drop the case into another shaft, nearby, at Bathpool, where Nielson has cut away a steel bar, enabling the case to fit into the gap. Ronald gets lost, cannot find Bathpool Park, total confusion ensues, the police are in a complete shambles, completely outwitted by Nielson. \n\n==Cast==\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] \u2013 [[Donald Neilson]] \n* Debbie Farrington \u2013 [[Lesley Whittle]] \n* [[Marjorie Yates]] \u2013 Neilson's Wife \n* Sylvia O'Donnell \u2013 Neilson's Daughter \n* [[Andrew Burt]] \u2013 Lesley's Brother \n* Alison Key \u2013 Lesley's Sister-In-Law \n* [[Ruth Dunning]] \u2013 Lesley's Mother \n* [[David Swift (actor)|David Swift]] \u2013 Detective Chief Superintendent\n* [[Michael Barrington]]\n* [[Barbara New]]\n* [[Peter Copley]]\n* [[Brenda Cowling]]\n* [[Paul Luty]]\n* [[Edwin Apps]]\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2012, the film was remastered and resurrected into the [[British Film Institute]] ''Archives and Hall of Fame'', as an important British film to rave reviews.

It was directed and produced by Ian Merrick, his first feature,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Black Panther(1977)|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/the-black-panther/|publisher=Yahoo movies|accessdate=4 June 2012}}</ref> and stars [[Donald Sumpter]], Debbie Farrington and [[Marjorie Yates]].<ref>''[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/60258 The Black Panther]'' (1996 [1977]), BFI Film & TV database</ref><ref>Chibnall & Petley p.225</ref> It was seen as exploitative, as the film was released in a short time after the occurrence of the events depicted i.e. the crimes of serial killer [[Donald Neilson]].\n\nThe film featured the kidnap of a young girl, [[Kidnapping and murder of Lesley Whittle| Lesley Whittle]]. It was controversial on its release and was slandered by media figures such as  [[Sue Lawley]] of ''[[Tonight (1975 TV series)|Tonight]]''. Subsequently, the film was effectively banned from viewing.<ref name=\"Patterson\">John Patterson [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jun/06/the-black-panther-donald-neilson \"Why The Black Panther can hold its head up high\"], ''The Guardian'' (blog), 6 June 2012</ref> \nIn 2012, the film was remastered and resurrected into the [[British Film Institute]] ''Archives and Hall of Fame'', as an important British film to rave reviews. John Patterson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that ''The Black Panther'' \"emerges as a meticulous, tactful, well made and highly responsible true crime movie\".<ref name=\"Patterson\"/> The film was released on DVD in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n{{no plot|date=October 2018}}\nA gung-ho ex-military man pursues a secret life of crime, culminating in the kidnapping of a teenage heiress.\n\nNielson has had a string of business failures, is a loner, although married with a teenage daughter. He lives in Yorkshire. He is around 40 years old. He is desperate for cash, and uses his strong military planning experience and intelligence to raid several sub post offices in remote moorland villages. He is seen scurrying away over rooftops by witnesses, and becomes known as The Black Panther, due to his black chilling hood, and ability to disappear into the night. He murders three postmasters who attempt to apprehend him during nocturnal robberies. (In those days, cash was routinely held on Post Office Premises, and weak windows and doors allowed easy access for a highly skilled military man like Nielson.) He is clearly a psychopath, and displays obsessive personality traits.\n\nHe reads in a newspaper of the wealthy Whittle family, and Lesley, age 17, the heiress. He travels to Highley, Shropshire and kidnaps her from her bed, silently. He drives her to Bathpoool Park, Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. He takes her 60 feet underground into a reservoir drainage shaft system. He puts her on a narrow ledge, with food and drink, so that nobody can possibly hear or find her. He puts a steel ligature on her neck to stop her escaping while he is away arranging the ransom.\n\nHe sends a ransom demand by means of plastic tape placed in a telephone box, and her brother Ronald is to deliver \u00a350k in a case to Bathpool Park. The family decide to inform the police. Ronald is to drop the case into another shaft, nearby, at Bathpool, where Nielson has cut away a steel bar, enabling the case to fit into the gap. Ronald gets lost, cannot find Bathpool Park, total confusion ensues, the police are in a complete shambles, completely outwitted by Nielson. \n\n==Cast==\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] \u2013 [[Donald Neilson]] \n* Debbie Farrington \u2013 [[Lesley Whittle]] \n* [[Marjorie Yates]] \u2013 Neilson's Wife \n* Sylvia O'Donnell \u2013 Neilson's Daughter \n* [[Andrew Burt]] \u2013 Lesley's Brother \n* Alison Key \u2013 Lesley's Sister-In-Law \n* [[Ruth Dunning]] \u2013 Lesley's Mother \n* [[David Swift (actor)|David Swift]] \u2013 Detective Chief Superintendent\n* [[Michael Barrington]]\n* [[Barbara New]]\n* [[Peter Copley]]\n* [[Brenda Cowling]]\n* [[Paul Luty]]\n* [[Edwin Apps]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Chibnall, Steve & Petley, Julian.

''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|rank of the SS]]. The longest serving and most noteworthy ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was [[Heinrich Himmler]].\n\n==Definition==\n''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was both a title and a rank. The title of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'' was first created in 1926 by the second commander of the SS, [[Joseph Berchtold]].{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=30}} [[Julius Schreck]], founder of the SS and Berchtold's predecessor, never referred to himself as ''Reichsf\u00fchrer''. Yet, the title was retroactively applied to him in later years.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=16, 17}} In 1929, Heinrich Himmler became ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' and referred to himself by his title instead of his regular SS rank of ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=18, 29}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=47}} This set the precedent for the commander of the SS to be called ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS''.\n\nPrior to the [[Night of the Long Knives]], the SS was an elite corps of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA or storm troopers), and the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was subordinate to the SA's operating head, the ''[[Stabschef]]''. On 20 July 1934, as part of the purge of the SA, the SS was made an independent branch of the [[Nazi Party]], responsible only to Hitler. From that point on, the title of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' became an actual rank, and in fact the highest rank of the SS.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314, 316}} In this position, Himmler was on paper the equivalent of a ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' in the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]]. As Himmler's position and authority grew in [[Nazi Germany]], so did his rank in a \"de facto\" sense.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 17, 26\u201327, 30, 46\u201347}} Further, there was never more than one ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' at any one time, with Himmler holding the position as his personal title from 1929 (becoming his actual rank in 1934) until April 1945.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 17}}\n\n==Duties==\nUnder its original inception, the title and rank of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was the designation for the head of the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]'' (General-SS).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=313, 316}} In this capacity, the SS Reich Leader was the direct commander of the SS Senior District Leaders (''SS-Oberabschnitt F\u00fchrer''); by 1936, the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was head of the three main SS branches: the ''Allgemeine-SS'', ''[[SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT; Political Action Troops), and the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV; Concentration Camp Service).{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=156}}\n\nDuring the Second World War, the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' in effect held several additional roles and wielded enormous personal power. He was responsible for all internal security within [[Nazi Germany]]. He was overseer of the concentration camps, extermination camps (through the [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]] and SS-TV), and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' mobile death squads (through the [[RSHA]]).{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 35\u201336, 46\u201347}} Over time, his influence on both civil and foreign policy became marked, as the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'' reported directly to Hitler and his actions were not tempered by checks and balances. This meant the office holder could implement broad policy, such as the [[Final Solution|Nazi plan]] for the [[Genocide]] or extermination of the [[Jews]], or order criminal acts such as the [[Stalag Luft III murders|''Stalag Luft III'' murders]], without impediment.\n\nIt is difficult to separate the office from the duties assigned to the individual. As of 20 April 1934, Himmler in his position of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' already controlled the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] and [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} On 17 June 1936 Himmler was named chief of all German police, thereby placing all uniformed police ([[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]]) and criminal police ([[Kriminalpolizei|Kripo]]) in Germany under his control. In the latter role, he was nominally subordinate to the Interior Minister, [[Wilhelm Frick]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 46\u201347}} It is not clear how much of this power would technically reside in the office of the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' were those duties to be split up.<ref group=\"Note\">As noted in ''The SS'' (Time-Life, pp. 70\u201373.): \"Himmler...was now the head of two important, '''separate''' organizations \u2013 the SS and the national police (emphasis added).\" Much of his power and influence as ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' resided from control of the police, duties separate, yet linked.</ref> These questions became moot by the time Himmler became the Interior Minister in 1943.\n\nIt is difficult to define precisely the full detailed duties and responsibilities of the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' beyond that of leader and senior member of the SS, since, in the words of historian [[Martin Windrow]], \"by the outbreak of the (Second World) war it would have been impossible to define exactly the role within the state\" of the entire SS itself.{{sfn|Windrow|1982|p=7}}\n\n==Relationship with the Waffen-SS==\nThe rank of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was defined in the SS hierarchy as the highest possible rank of the ''Allgemeine-SS''. The exact position of the rank within the military [[Waffen-SS]] evolved over many years, ranging from clearly defined to vaguely associated. The Waffen-SS was originally a small armed SS unit called the ''SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe'', and in the 1930s was under the command of Himmler who, in his position as ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'', issued directives and orders to SS-VT commanders. Hold-outs existed for some aspects of the armed SS however, as well as within the special bodyguard unit known as the ''[[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|SS-Leibstandarte]]''. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, [[Sepp Dietrich]] was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=19, 33}}\n\nThe Waffen-SS eventually grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions and served alongside the German Army, but was never formally part of it.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 35\u201336, 46\u201347, 61, 64, 66\u201370}} During World War II, the authority of the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' over the Waffen-SS was mainly administrative in that certain General-SS offices controlled supply and logistics aspects of the Waffen-SS. Himmler also held authority to create new Waffen-SS divisions as well as order the formation of various smaller SS combat units. The daily association with the Waffen-SS, however, encompassed primarily inspecting ''Waffen-SS'' troops and presenting high-ranking medals to its members.\n\nThe ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' further never exercised direct operational authority over Waffen-SS units until the very end of the war and then only through his capacity as an Army Group commander and not as the head of the SS. Top Waffen-SS commanders, such as Sepp Dietrich, [[Wilhelm Bittrich]], and [[Matthias Kleinheisterkamp]], further held a certain derision for Himmler, describing him as \"sly and unmilitary\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Messenger|first1=Charles|title=Hitler's Gladiator|date=26 September 2005|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=London|isbn=1844860221|page=51|edition=Re-issue}}</ref>\n\n== ''Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' ==\n{{Main|Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS}}\nAttached to the office was the 18,438-strong SS formations managed by the ''[[Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' (\"Command Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\") reporting directly to Himmler. To head the Command Staff, Himmler appointed career army officer Kurt Knoblauch, who acted as chief of staff for the units.{{sfn|Hale|2011|pp=160\u2013162}} Prior to the launch of the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, these formations included two motorized SS-Infantry Brigades, two SS-Cavalry Regiments combined into the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]], a bodyguard battalion, flak units and a number of companies of support troops. Units were temporarily placed under army command for operations, but the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'' could call them back at any time. Despite the name, it was not employed as a unified HQ unit.

''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|rank of the SS]]. The longest serving and most noteworthy ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was [[Heinrich Himmler]].\n\n==Definition==\n''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was both a title and a rank. The title of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'' was first created in 1926 by the second commander of the SS, [[Joseph Berchtold]].{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=30}} [[Julius Schreck]], founder of the SS and Berchtold's predecessor, never referred to himself as ''Reichsf\u00fchrer''. Yet, the title was retroactively applied to him in later years.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=16, 17}} In 1929, Heinrich Himmler became ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' and referred to himself by his title instead of his regular SS rank of ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=18, 29}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=47}} This set the precedent for the commander of the SS to be called ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS''.\n\nPrior to the [[Night of the Long Knives]], the SS was an elite corps of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA or storm troopers), and the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was subordinate to the SA's operating head, the ''[[Stabschef]]''. On 20 July 1934, as part of the purge of the SA, the SS was made an independent branch of the [[Nazi Party]], responsible only to Hitler. From that point on, the title of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' became an actual rank, and in fact the highest rank of the SS.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314, 316}} In this position, Himmler was on paper the equivalent of a ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' in the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]]. As Himmler's position and authority grew in [[Nazi Germany]], so did his rank in a \"de facto\" sense.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 17, 26\u201327, 30, 46\u201347}} Further, there was never more than one ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' at any one time, with Himmler holding the position as his personal title from 1929 (becoming his actual rank in 1934) until April 1945.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 17}}\n\n==Duties==\nUnder its original inception, the title and rank of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was the designation for the head of the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]'' (General-SS).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=313, 316}} In this capacity, the SS Reich Leader was the direct commander of the SS Senior District Leaders (''SS-Oberabschnitt F\u00fchrer''); by 1936, the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was head of the three main SS branches: the ''Allgemeine-SS'', ''[[SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT; Political Action Troops), and the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV; Concentration Camp Service).{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=156}}\n\nDuring the Second World War, the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' in effect held several additional roles and wielded enormous personal power. He was responsible for all internal security within [[Nazi Germany]]. He was overseer of the concentration camps, extermination camps (through the [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]] and SS-TV), and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' mobile death squads (through the [[RSHA]]).{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 35\u201336, 46\u201347}} Over time, his influence on both civil and foreign policy became marked, as the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'' reported directly to Hitler and his actions were not tempered by checks and balances. This meant the office holder could implement broad policy, such as the [[Final Solution|Nazi plan]] for the [[Genocide]] or extermination of the [[Jews]], or order criminal acts such as the [[Stalag Luft III murders|''Stalag Luft III'' murders]], without impediment.\n\nIt is difficult to separate the office from the duties assigned to the individual. As of 20 April 1934, Himmler in his position of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' already controlled the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] and [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} On 17 June 1936 Himmler was named chief of all German police, thereby placing all uniformed police ([[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]]) and criminal police ([[Kriminalpolizei|Kripo]]) in Germany under his control. In the latter role, he was nominally subordinate to the Interior Minister, [[Wilhelm Frick]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 46\u201347}} It is not clear how much of this power would technically reside in the office of the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' were those duties to be split up.<ref group=\"Note\">As noted in ''The SS'' (Time-Life, pp. 70\u201373.): \"Himmler...was now the head of two important, '''separate''' organizations \u2013 the SS and the national police (emphasis added).\" Much of his power and influence as ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' resided from control of the police, duties separate, yet linked.</ref> These questions became moot by the time Himmler became the Interior Minister in 1943.\n\nIt is difficult to define precisely the full detailed duties and responsibilities of the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' beyond that of leader and senior member of the SS, since, in the words of historian [[Martin Windrow]], \"by the outbreak of the (Second World) war it would have been impossible to define exactly the role within the state\" of the entire SS itself.{{sfn|Windrow|1982|p=7}}\n\n==Relationship with the Waffen-SS==\nThe rank of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was defined in the SS hierarchy as the highest possible rank of the ''Allgemeine-SS''. The exact position of the rank within the military [[Waffen-SS]] evolved over many years, ranging from clearly defined to vaguely associated. The Waffen-SS was originally a small armed SS unit called the ''SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe'', and in the 1930s was under the command of Himmler who, in his position as ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'', issued directives and orders to SS-VT commanders. Hold-outs existed for some aspects of the armed SS however, as well as within the special bodyguard unit known as the ''[[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|SS-Leibstandarte]]''. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, [[Sepp Dietrich]] was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=19, 33}}\n\nThe Waffen-SS eventually grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions and served alongside the German Army, but was never formally part of it.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 35\u201336, 46\u201347, 61, 64, 66\u201370}} During World War II, the authority of the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' over the Waffen-SS was mainly administrative in that certain General-SS offices controlled supply and logistics aspects of the Waffen-SS. Himmler also held authority to create new Waffen-SS divisions as well as order the formation of various smaller SS combat units. The daily association with the Waffen-SS, however, encompassed primarily inspecting ''Waffen-SS'' troops and presenting high-ranking medals to its members.\n\nThe ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' further never exercised direct operational authority over Waffen-SS units until the very end of the war and then only through his capacity as an Army Group commander and not as the head of the SS. Top Waffen-SS commanders, such as Sepp Dietrich, [[Wilhelm Bittrich]], and [[Matthias Kleinheisterkamp]], further held a certain derision for Himmler, describing him as \"sly and unmilitary\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Messenger|first1=Charles|title=Hitler's Gladiator|date=26 September 2005|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=London|isbn=1844860221|page=51|edition=Re-issue}}</ref>\n\n== ''Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' ==\n{{Main|Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS}}\nAttached to the office was the 18,438-strong SS formations managed by the ''[[Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' (\"Command Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\") reporting directly to Himmler. To head the Command Staff, Himmler appointed career army officer Kurt Knoblauch, who acted as chief of staff for the units.{{sfn|Hale|2011|pp=160\u2013162}} Prior to the launch of the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, these formations included two motorized SS-Infantry Brigades, two SS-Cavalry Regiments combined into the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]], a bodyguard battalion, flak units and a number of companies of support troops. Units were temporarily placed under army command for operations, but the ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'' could call them back at any time. Despite the name, it was not employed as a unified HQ unit.
