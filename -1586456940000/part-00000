She was a founding member of the [[Society of Woman Geographers]].\n\n== Early Life and Expeditions ==\nBorn Mary Blair Beebe, Blair was born on ''The Oaks,'' her parents' plantation in Staunton, Virginia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldhalifax.com/county/SouthIsle.htm|title=Staunton River Tour|last=|first=|date=|website=Old Halifax|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> She was educated at home by her mother, Marie Gordon \"Gordy\" Rice, who taught a night school for her four children and children of the sharecroppers.

Within the first year of their  marriage, they went on three honeymoon expeditions: to Nova Scotia, Oak Lodge,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beebe|first=William|date=|title=The Home of the Brown Pelican|url=|journal=Zoological Society Bulletin|volume=1904:12|pages=134|via=}}</ref> a boarding house for naturalists on the Indian River in Florida, and to Cobb Island, Virginia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beebe|first=William|date=|title=A Bug\u2019s Eye: Five Days Among the Birds on Cobb Island, Virginia|url=|journal=Eighth Annual Report of the New York Zoological Society|volume=April 1, 1904|pages=161\u2013167|via=}}</ref> In 1904, they traveled to Mexico,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beebe|first=William|title=Two Bird-Lovers in Mexico|publisher=The Riverside Press|year=1905|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=}}</ref> and in 1908 and 1909, they traveled to Venezuela and British Guyana to scout out a location for a Tropical Research Station to be sponsored by the Bronx Zoo.

Kuser|Anthony Kuser]] to underwrite an eighteen-month expedition to Asia to study and collect pheasants. In December 1910, they boarded the [[RMS Lusitania|R.M.S. Lusitania]] to start the [https://sites.google.com/site/cwilliambeebe/Home/pheasantexpedition pheasant expedition]. They traveled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Burma (Myanmar), India, China, Borneo, Indonesia, Malay, Japan, and Singapore.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beebe|first=William|title=Pheasant Jungles|publisher=Blue Ribbon Books|year=1926|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Divorce and Suffrage ==\nIn 1913, Blair traveled to Reno to divorce William Beebe on the grounds of cruelty. A few days after the divorce, she married architect Robert \"Robin\" Niles. For a few years, she worked in the suffrage movement and was a New York delegate to the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]].\n\n== Writing career ==\nIn the early 1920s, Blair began writing travel books. In 1923, she published ''Casual Wanderings in Ecuador''. ''Colombia: Land of Miracles'' followed in 1924, and ''Peruvian Pageant'' in 1937.  She developed a new approach to writing travel books, which she called \"the human travel book\" in which she linked contemporary culture with the past by exploring history, traditions, and legends.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Niles|first=Blair|url=|title=Human Travel Books|date=December 7, 1924|work=The New York Herald|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Her breakthrough book was ''Black Haiti: A Biography of Africa's Eldest Daughter'' (1926), which told the story of the largest slave revolt in history led by [[Toussaint Louverture|Toussaint L'Overture]]. This book was closely followed by ''Condemned to Devil's Island'' (1928), the bestselling fictionalized account of the escapes of [[Ren\u00e9 Belbeno\u00eet]], a prisoner on the [[Devil's Island]] penal colony in French Guiana. The book was made into a Hollywood movie, ''[[Condemned (1929 film)|Condemned]]''. Blair was the first woman to visit Devil's Island. Her book is credited with drawing public attention to the prison, resulting in its eventual closure.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Book Has Influence|date=March 30, 1929|work=The News Journal, Wilmington, Del.|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> When the Depression hit, Blair looked for places closer too home to investigate. In 1931, she published ''[[Strange Brother]]'', the first book to compassionately portray gay men in Harlem. Blair then turned to writing books about Latin America, with a focus on the ancient Aztec, Incan, and Quiche civilizations.\n\nOn the centennial of the Supreme Court's ''[[United States v. The Amistad]]'' decision, Blair wrote a novel that introduced to a new generation to the Court's decision, which held that kidnapped Africans were not the property of their \u201cowners.\u201d The book, called ''East by Day'', was selected as one of twenty books by readers of the ''New York Herald'' for Great Britain readers. It served as her atonement for her grandfather's role in the Civil War. She knew that her grandfather, [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], spoke in Charleston, South Carolina urging the Confederates to open fire on Fort Sumter to force Virginia into secession. According to ''The New York Times'', this speech was the \u201cmatch that exploded the powder magazine and brought on the war.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Gen. Roger A.

Pryor, C.S.A.|publisher=Archon Books|year=1976|isbn=|location=Hamden, Ct.|pages=}}</ref> This book motivated Blair to write ''East by Day.''\n\n== Society of Woman Geographers ==\nIn 1925, during tea with [[Marguerite Harrison]], Blair suggested the formation of a society for woman explorers because the all-men [[The Explorers Club|Explorers Club]] banned women from membership. Marguerite endorsed the idea and they presented it to [[Gertrude Emerson Sen]] and Gertrude Mathews Shelby, also explorers. They recruited [[Harriet Chalmers Adams]] as president of the newly formed [[Society of Woman Geographers]]. The organization grew rapidly and admitted as members such illustrious women as [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Martin and Osa Johnson|Osa Johnson]], [[Annie Smith Peck]], [[Louise Arner Boyd]], [[Josephine Diebitsch Peary|Josephine Peary]], [[Pearl S. Buck]], [[Malvina Hoffman]], [[Gloria Hollister]], [[Anna Heyward Taylor]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and [[Te Ata Fisher|Te Ata]], Membership was not limited to explorers, but included anyone whose published works (including art and music) contributed to the understanding of the countries on which the member specialized. The Society is still in existence today. More recent members include [[Jane Goodall]], [[Sylvia Earle]], and [[Kathryn D. Sullivan|Kathryn Sullivan]].\n\n== Ancestry ==\nIn 1859, Blair's grandfather, [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], was  appointed to fill a vacant seat in the United States House of Representatives, representing Virginia. Later he became a judge in New York State.\n\nBlair Niles was the granddaughter of [[Sara Agnes Rice Pryor|Sara Rice Pryor]] and [[Roger Atkinson Pryor|Roger Pryor]], and the daughter of Marie Gordon Pryor. Her unique namesake, \"Mary Blair,\" is shared with her mother's sister, Mary Blair Pryor, her cousin Mary Blair Walker Zimmer, and several other women in her lineage, as documented in *[https://web.archive.org/web/20190425231837/https://www.maryblairdestiny.com/ \"Mary Blair Destiny\"].<ref>Richman, Erin ''Mary Blair Destiny'', Two Goddesses Publishing, page 41-42 {{ISBN|978-1-7330180-0-5}}.</ref> Her grandmother [[Sara Agnes Rice Pryor|Sara Rice Pryor]] was also a widely-read author for her chronicling of life in antebellum Virginia.

She was a founding member of the [[Society of Woman Geographers]]. \n\n== Early Life and Expeditions ==\nBorn Mary Blair Beebe, Blair was born on ''The Oaks,'' her parents' plantation in Staunton, Virginia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldhalifax.com/county/SouthIsle.htm|title=Staunton River Tour|last=|first=|date=|website=Old Halifax|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> She was educated at home by her mother, Marie Gordon \"Gordy\" Rice, who taught a night school for her four children and children of the sharecroppers. At age 14, Blair attended the Northfield Seminary for Young Ladies in Massachusetts<ref>Letter from Gordon Rice to Franklina Barlett (July 19, 1898), Virginia Historical Society, Franklina Bartlett Collection.</ref> and then the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where she studied domestic science.\n\nIn 1902, she married [[William Beebe]], Curator of Birds at the New York Zoological Park, now the Bronx Zoo. Within the first year of their  marriage, they went on three honeymoon expeditions: to Nova Scotia, Oak Lodge<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beebe|first=William|date=|title=The Home of the Brown Pelican|url=|journal=Zoological Society Bulletin|volume=1904:12|pages=134|via=}}</ref>, a boarding house for naturalists on the Indian River in Florida, and to Cobb Island, Virginia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beebe|first=William|date=|title=A Bug\u2019s Eye: Five Days Among the Birds on Cobb Island, Virginia|url=|journal=Eighth Annual Report of the New York Zoological Society|volume=April 1, 1904|pages=161-167|via=}}</ref> In 1904, they traveled to Mexico,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beebe|first=William|title=Two Bird-Lovers in Mexico|publisher=The Riverside Press|year=1905|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=}}</ref> and in 1908 and 1909, they traveled to Venezuela and British Guyana to scout out a location for a Tropical Research Station to be sponsored by the Bronx Zoo.

Kuser|Anthony Kuser]] to underwrite an eighteen-month expedition to Asia to study and collect pheasants. In December 1910, they boarded the [[RMS Lusitania|R.M.S. Lusitania]] to start the [https://sites.google.com/site/cwilliambeebe/Home/pheasantexpedition pheasant expedition]. They traveled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Burma (Myanmar), India, China, Borneo, Indonesia, Malay, Japan, and Singapore.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beebe|first=William|title=Pheasant Jungles|publisher=Blue Ribbon Books|year=1926|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Divorce and Suffrage ==\nIn 1913, Blair traveled to Reno to divorce William Beebe on the grounds of cruelty. A few days after the divorce, she married architect Robert \"Robin\" Niles. For a few years, she worked in the suffrage movement and was a New York delegate to the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage|Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage.]] \n\n== Writing Career ==\nIn the early 1920s, Blair began writing travel books. In 1923, she published ''Casual Wanderings in Ecuador''. ''Colombia: Land of Miracles'' followed in 1924, and ''Peruvian Pageant'' in 1937.  She developed a new approach to writing travel books, which she called \"the human travel book\" in which she linked contemporary culture with the past by exploring history, traditions, and legends.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Niles|first=Blair|url=|title=Human Travel Books|date=December 7, 1924|work=The New York Herald|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Her breakthrough book was ''Black Haiti: A Biography of Africa's Eldest Daughter'' (1926), which told the story of the largest slave revolt in history led by [[Toussaint Louverture|Toussaint L'Overture]]. This book was closely followed by ''Condemned to Devil's Island'' (1928), the bestselling fictionalized account of the escapes of [[Ren\u00e9 Belbeno\u00eet]], a prisoner on the [[Devil's Island]] penal colony in French Guiana. The book was made into a Hollywood movie, [[Condemned (1929 film)|Condemed (1929 film)]]. Blair was the first woman to visit Devil's Island. Her book is credited with drawing public attention to the prison, resulting in its eventual closure.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Book Has Influence|date=March 30, 1929|work=The News Journal, Wilmington, Del.|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> When the Depression hit, Blair looked for places closer too home to investigate. In 1931, she published ''[[Strange Brother]]'', the first book to compassionately portray gay men in Harlem. Blair then turned to writing books about Latin America, with a focus on the ancient Aztec, Incan, and Quiche civilizations.\n\nOn the centennial of the Supreme Court\u2019s ''[[United States v. The Amistad]]'' decision, Blair wrote a novel that introduced to a new generation to the Court\u2019s decision, which held that kidnapped Africans were not the property of their \u201cowners.\u201d The book, called ''East by Day'', was selected as one of twenty books by readers of the ''New York Herald'' for Great Britain readers. It served as her atonement for her grandfather\u2019s role in the Civil War. She knew that her grandfather, [[Roger Atkinson Pryor|Roger Atkinson Pryor,]] spoke in Charleston, South Carolina urging the Confederates to open fire on Fort Sumter to force Virginia into secession. According to ''The New York Times'', this speech was the \u201cmatch that exploded the powder magazine and brought on the war.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Gen. Roger A.

Marguerite endorsed the idea and they presented it to [[Gertrude Emerson Sen]] and Gertrude Mathews Shelby, also explorers. They recruited [[Harriet Chalmers Adams]] as president of the newly formed [[Society of Woman Geographers]]. The organization grew rapidly and admitted as members such illustrious women as [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Martin and Osa Johnson|Osa Johnson]], [[Annie Smith Peck]], [[Louise Arner Boyd]], [[Josephine Diebitsch Peary|Josephine Peary]], [[Pearl S. Buck]], [[Malvina Hoffman]], [[Gloria Hollister]], [[Anna Heyward Taylor]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor Roosevelt,]] and [[Te Ata Fisher|Te Ata]], Membership was not limited to explorers, but included anyone whose published works (including art and music) contributed to the understanding of the countries on which the member specialized. The Society is still in existence today. More recent members include [[Jane Goodall]], [[Sylvia Earle]], and [[Kathryn D. Sullivan|Kathryn Sullivan]].\n\n== Ancestry ==\nIn 1859, Blair's grandfather, [[Roger Atkinson Pryor|Roger Atkinson Pryor,]] was  appointed to fill a vacant seat in the United States House of Representatives, representing Virginia. Later he became a judge in New York State.\n\nBlair Niles was the grand-daughter of [[Sara_Agnes_Rice_Pryor|Sara Rice Pryor]] and [[Roger_Atkinson_Pryor|Roger Pryor]], and the daughter of Marie Gordon Pryor. Her unique namesake, \"Mary Blair,\" is shared with her mother's sister, Mary Blair Pryor, her cousin Mary Blair Walker Zimmer, and several other women in her lineage, as documented in *[https://web.archive.org/web/20190425231837/https://www.maryblairdestiny.com/ \"Mary Blair Destiny\"]. <ref>Richman, Erin ''Mary Blair Destiny'', Two Goddesses Publishing, page 41-42 {{ISBN|978-1-7330180-0-5}}.</ref> Her grandmother [[Sara_Agnes_Rice_Pryor|Sara Rice Pryor]] was also a widely-read author for her chronicling of life in antebellum Virginia.

The carving is known as \"th' Owd Man of [[Bonsall, Derbyshire|Bonsall]].\" The ore was washed out through a sieve, whose iron wire had been drawn in [[Hathersage]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. Smelting took place in [[Bole hill|boles]], hence the name Bolehill. The lead industry, the miner, the ore and the waste were known collectively as \"t'owd man\".\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] granted a charter for a miners' court in the town, the Bar Moot. Anyone had a right to dig for ore wherever he chose, except in churchyards, gardens or roadways. All that was needed for a claim was to place one's stowce (winch) on the site and extract enough ore to pay tribute to the \"barmaster\". The present Bar Moot building dates from 1814. Within is a brass dish for measuring the levy due to the Crown. Even into the 20th century, the penalty for stealing from a mine was to have a hand nailed to the stowce, giving a miscreant the choice of tearing himself loose or starving to death. The [[Barmote Court]] is still held at the Bar Moot hall in Chapel Lane and controls all matters of lead mining.\n\nBy the 18th century there were many thousand lead mines worked individually. Defoe gives a first-hand account of a lead miner's family and the miner himself at work.<ref>Daniel Defoe, (c. 1724) ''A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, divided into circuits or journies: Letter 8, Part 2: The Peak District,'' Reprinted: London: J.

The carving is known as \"th' Owd Man of [[Bonsall, Derbyshire|Bonsall]].\" The ore was washed out through a sieve, whose iron wire had been drawn in [[Hathersage]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. Smelting took place in [[Bole hill|boles]], hence the name Bolehill. The lead industry, the miner, the ore and the waste were known collectively as \"t'owd man\".\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] granted a charter for a miners' court in the town, the Bar Moot. Anyone had a right to dig for ore wherever he chose, except in churchyards, gardens or roadways. All that was needed for a claim was to place one's stowce (winch) on the site and extract enough ore to pay tribute to the \"barmaster\". The present Bar Moot building dates from 1814. Within is a brass dish for measuring the levy due to the Crown. Even into the 20th century, the penalty for stealing from a mine was to have a hand nailed to the stowce, giving a miscreant the choice of tearing himself loose or starving to death. The [[Barmote Court]] is still held at the Bar Moot hall in Chapel Lane and controls all matters of lead mining.\n\nBy the 18th century there were many thousand lead mines worked individually. Defoe gives a first-hand account of a lead miner's family and the miner himself at work.<ref>Daniel Defoe, (c. 1724) ''A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, divided into circuits or journies: Letter 8, Part 2: The Peak District,'' Reprinted: London: J.

Editing source code involves testing, analyzing, refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program. A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer [[programmer]], software developer, and sometimes coder.\n\nThe sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as [[software development]]. The term [[software engineering]] is becoming popular as the process is seen as an [[engineering]] discipline.\n\n===Programming languages===\n{{main|Programming language}}\n[[File:Object-Oriented-Programming-Methods-And-Classes-with-Inheritance.png|thumb|A computer program written in the imperative programming style]]\n\nComputer programs can be categorized by the [[programming language]] [[programming paradigm|paradigm]] used to produce them. Two of the main paradigms are [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[declarative language|declarative]].\n\n====Imperative languages====\n''Imperative programming languages'' specify a sequential [[algorithm#Computer algorithm|algorithm]] using declarations, expressions, and statements:<ref name=\"cpl-ch4-75\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 75\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-56885-1\n}}</ref>\n* A ''declaration'' couples a [[variable (programming)|variable]] name to a [[datatype]] \u2013 for example: <code> var x: integer; </code>\n* An ''expression'' yields a value \u2013 for example: <code> 2 + 2 </code> yields 4\n* A ''statement'' might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's [[control flow]] \u2013 for example: <code>x := 2 + 2; if x = 4 then do_something();</code>\n\nOne criticism of imperative languages is the side effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables.<ref name=\"cpl-ch9-213\" />\n\n====Declarative languages====\n''Declarative programming languages'' describe ''what'' computation should be performed and not ''how'' to compute it. Declarative programs omit the [[control flow]] and are considered ''sets'' of instructions. Two broad categories of declarative languages are [[functional language]]s and [[logical language]]s. The principle behind functional languages (like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is to not allow [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions.<ref name=\"cpl-ch9-213\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 213\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-56885-1\n}}</ref> The principle behind logical languages (like [[Prolog]]) is to define the problem to be solved&nbsp;\u2013 the goal&nbsp;\u2013 and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself.<ref name=\"cpl-ch10-244\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative   Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 244\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-56885-1\n}}</ref> The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is [[backtracking|backtracked]] and another path is systematically attempted.\n\n===Compilation and interpretation===\nA computer program in the form of a [[human-readable]], computer programming language is called [[source code]]. Source code may be converted into an [[Executable file|executable image]] by a [[compiler]] or [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]], or [[execution (computing)|executed]] immediately with the aid of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].\n\nCompilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either [[Object file|object code]] or [[machine code]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a Compiler?|url=http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/notes/node3.html|accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>  Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code consists of the [[central processing unit|central processing unit's]] native instructions, ready for execution. Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as [[Binary file|binaries]]&nbsp;\u2013 a reference to the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[file format]] used to store the executable code.\n\nSome compiled and assembled object programs need to be combined as modules with a [[Linker (computing)|linker]] utility in order to produce an executable program.\n\nInterpreters are used to execute source code from a programming language line-by-line. The interpreter [[Parsing|decodes]] each [[Statement (computer science)|statement]] and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters is that they can easily be extended to an [[REPL|interactive session]]. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.\n\nThe main disadvantage of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode each statement and then perform it. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another disadvantage of interpreters is an interpreter must be present on the executing computer. By contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.\n\n[[just-in-time compilation|Just in time compilers]] pre-compile computer programs just before execution. For example, the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[virtual machine#Process virtual machines|virtual machine]] Hotspot contains a Just In Time Compiler which selectively compiles Java bytecode into machine code \u2013 but only code which Hotspot predicts is likely to be used many times.\n\nEither compiled or interpreted programs might be executed in a [[batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction.\n\n[[Scripting language]]s are often used to create batch processes. One common scripting language is [[Unix shell]], and its executing environment is called the [[command-line interface]].\n\nNo properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. For example, Java is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language, despite the existence of Java compilers and C interpreters.\n\n==Storage and execution==\n[[File:Papertape3.jpg|thumb|In the 1950s, computer programs were stored on [[Punched tape|perforated paper tape]] ]]\n\nTypically, computer programs are stored in [[non-volatile memory]] until requested either directly or indirectly to be [[execution (computing)|executed]] by the computer user. Upon such a request, the program is loaded into [[random-access memory]], by a computer program called an [[operating system]], where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. The central processor then executes (\"runs\") the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. A program in execution is called a [[process (computing)|process]].<ref name=\"osc-ch4-97\">{{cite book\n  | last = Silberschatz\n  | first = Abraham\n  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1994\n  | page = 97\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-50480-4\n}}</ref> Termination is either by normal self-termination, by user intervention, or by error&nbsp;\u2013 software or hardware error.\n\n===Simultaneous execution===\n{{See also|Process (computing)|Multiprocessing}}\n\nMany operating systems support [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] which enables many computer programs to appear to run simultaneously on one computer.  Operating systems may run multiple programs through [[process scheduling]]&nbsp;\u2013 a software mechanism to [[context switch|switch]] the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] among processes often so users can [[time-sharing|interact]] with each program while it runs.<ref name=\"osc-ch4-100\">{{cite book\n  | last = Silberschatz\n  | first = Abraham\n  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1994\n  | page = 100\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-50480-4\n}}</ref> Within hardware, modern day multiprocessor computers or computers with multicore processors may run multiple programs.<ref name=\"mcore\">{{cite book\n  | last = Akhter\n  | first = Shameem\n  | title = Multi-Core Programming\n  | publisher = Richard Bowles (Intel Press)\n  | year = 2006\n  | pages = 11\u201313\n  | isbn = 978-0-9764832-4-3\n}}</ref>\n\n===Self-modifying programs===\n{{Main|Self-modifying code}}\n\nA computer program in [[execution (computing)|execution]] is normally treated as being different from the [[Data (computing)|data]] the program operates on. However, in some cases, this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself. The modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible for programs written in [[machine code]], [[assembly language]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[COBOL]], [[PL/1]], and [[Prolog]].\n\n==Functional categories==\nComputer programs may be categorized along functional lines. The main functional categories are [[application software]] and [[system software]]. System software includes the [[operating system]] which couples [[computer hardware]] with application software.<ref name=\"osc-overview\"/> The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner.<ref name=\"osc-overview\">{{cite book\n  | last = Silberschatz\n  | first = Abraham\n  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1994\n  | page = 1\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-50480-4\n}}</ref> In addition to the operating system, system software includes [[Firmware|embedded programs]], [[Booting|boot programs]], and [[Microcode|micro programs]]. Application software designed for [[end user]]s have a [[Interface (computing)|user interface]]. Application software not designed for the end user includes [[middleware]], which couples one application with another. Application software also includes [[Utility software|utility programs]]. The distinction between system software and application software is under debate.\n\n===Application software===\n{{Main|Application software}}\n[[File:Gcalctool-scientific.png|thumb|Example of an app: [[GCalctool]], a software calculator]]\n\nThere are many types of application software:\n* The word '''app''' came to being in 21st century. It is a [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] of the word \"application\". They have been designed for many platforms, but the word was first used for smaller mobile apps. Desktop apps are traditional computer programs that run on [[desktop computer]]s. [[Mobile app]]s run on [[mobile device]]s. [[Web app]]s run inside a [[web browser]]. Both mobile and desktop apps may be downloaded from the developers' website or purchased from [[app store]]s such as [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]], [[Apple App Store]], [[Mac App Store]], [[Google Play]] or [[Intel AppUp]].\n* An '''[[application suite]]''' consists of multiple applications bundled together. Examples include [[Microsoft Office]], [[LibreOffice]], and [[iWork]]. They bundle a word processor, spreadsheet, and other applications.\n* '''[[Enterprise software|Enterprise applications]]''' bundle accounting, personnel, customer, and vendor applications. Examples include [[enterprise resource planning]], [[customer relationship management]], and [[supply chain management software]].\n* '''Enterprise infrastructure software''' supports the enterprise's [[software systems]]. Examples include databases, email servers, and network servers.\n* '''[[Information worker]] software''' are designed for workers at the departmental level. Examples include [[time management]], [[schedule (workplace)|resource management]], analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information system, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.\n* '''Media development software''' generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. These produce graphics, publications, animations, and videos.\n* '''Product engineering software''' is used to help develop large machines and other application software. Examples includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE), and [[integrated development environment]]s.\n* '''Entertainment Software''' can refer to video games, movie recorders and players, and music recorders and players.\n\n===Utility programs===\n[[Utility software|Utility programs]] are application programs designed to aid [[system administrator]]s and [[computer programmer]]s.\n\n===Operating system===\n{{See also|Operating system}}\n\nAn [[operating system]] is a computer program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.\n<ref name=\"osc-overview\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s, the programmer, who was also the operator, would write a program and run it. After the program finished executing, the output may have been printed, or it may have been punched onto paper tape or cards for later processing.<ref name=\"osc-ch1-p6\"/>\nMore often than not the program did not work.The programmer then looked at the console lights and fiddled with the console switches. If less fortunate, a memory printout was made for further study.In the 1960s, programmers reduced the amount of wasted time by automating the operator's job.

Editing source code involves testing, analyzing, refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program. A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer [[programmer]], software developer, and sometimes coder.\n\nThe sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as [[software development]]. The term [[software engineering]] is becoming popular as the process is seen as an [[engineering]] discipline.\n\n===Programming languages===\n{{main|Programming language}}\n[[File:Object-Oriented-Programming-Methods-And-Classes-with-Inheritance.png|thumb|A computer program written in the imperative programming style]]\n\nComputer programs can be categorized by the [[programming language]] [[programming paradigm|paradigm]] used to produce them. Two of the main paradigms are [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[declarative language|declarative]].\n\n====Imperative languages====\n''Imperative programming languages'' specify a sequential [[algorithm#Computer algorithm|algorithm]] using declarations, expressions, and statements:<ref name=\"cpl-ch4-75\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 75\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-56885-1\n}}</ref>\n* A ''declaration'' couples a [[variable (programming)|variable]] name to a [[datatype]] \u2013 for example: <code> var x: integer; </code>\n* An ''expression'' yields a value \u2013 for example: <code> 2 + 2 </code> yields 4\n* A ''statement'' might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's [[control flow]] \u2013 for example: <code>x := 2 + 2; if x = 4 then do_something();</code>\n\nOne criticism of imperative languages is the side effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables.<ref name=\"cpl-ch9-213\" />\n\n====Declarative languages====\n''Declarative programming languages'' describe ''what'' computation should be performed and not ''how'' to compute it. Declarative programs omit the [[control flow]] and are considered ''sets'' of instructions. Two broad categories of declarative languages are [[functional language]]s and [[logical language]]s. The principle behind functional languages (like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is to not allow [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions.<ref name=\"cpl-ch9-213\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 213\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-56885-1\n}}</ref> The principle behind logical languages (like [[Prolog]]) is to define the problem to be solved&nbsp;\u2013 the goal&nbsp;\u2013 and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself.<ref name=\"cpl-ch10-244\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative   Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 244\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-56885-1\n}}</ref> The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is [[backtracking|backtracked]] and another path is systematically attempted.\n\n===Compilation and interpretation===\nA computer program in the form of a [[human-readable]], computer programming language is called [[source code]]. Source code may be converted into an [[Executable file|executable image]] by a [[compiler]] or [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]], or [[execution (computing)|executed]] immediately with the aid of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].\n\nCompilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either [[Object file|object code]] or [[machine code]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a Compiler?|url=http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/notes/node3.html|accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>  Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code consists of the [[central processing unit|central processing unit's]] native instructions, ready for execution. Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as [[Binary file|binaries]]&nbsp;\u2013 a reference to the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[file format]] used to store the executable code.\n\nSome compiled and assembled object programs need to be combined as modules with a [[Linker (computing)|linker]] utility in order to produce an executable program.\n\nInterpreters are used to execute source code from a programming language line-by-line. The interpreter [[Parsing|decodes]] each [[Statement (computer science)|statement]] and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters is that they can easily be extended to an [[REPL|interactive session]]. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.\n\nThe main disadvantage of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode each statement and then perform it. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another disadvantage of interpreters is an interpreter must be present on the executing computer. By contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.\n\n[[just-in-time compilation|Just in time compilers]] pre-compile computer programs just before execution. For example, the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[virtual machine#Process virtual machines|virtual machine]] Hotspot contains a Just In Time Compiler which selectively compiles Java bytecode into machine code \u2013 but only code which Hotspot predicts is likely to be used many times.\n\nEither compiled or interpreted programs might be executed in a [[batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction.\n\n[[Scripting language]]s are often used to create batch processes. One common scripting language is [[Unix shell]], and its executing environment is called the [[command-line interface]].\n\nNo properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. For example, Java is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language, despite the existence of Java compilers and C interpreters.\n\n==Storage and execution==\n[[File:Papertape3.jpg|thumb|In the 1950s, computer programs were stored on [[Punched tape|perforated paper tape]] ]]\n\nTypically, computer programs are stored in [[non-volatile memory]] until requested either directly or indirectly to be [[execution (computing)|executed]] by the computer user. Upon such a request, the program is loaded into [[random-access memory]], by a computer program called an [[operating system]], where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. The central processor then executes (\"runs\") the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. A program in execution is called a [[process (computing)|process]].<ref name=\"osc-ch4-97\">{{cite book\n  | last = Silberschatz\n  | first = Abraham\n  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1994\n  | page = 97\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-50480-4\n}}</ref> Termination is either by normal self-termination, by user intervention, or by error&nbsp;\u2013 software or hardware error.\n\n===Simultaneous execution===\n{{See also|Process (computing)|Multiprocessing}}\n\nMany operating systems support [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] which enables many computer programs to appear to run simultaneously on one computer.  Operating systems may run multiple programs through [[process scheduling]]&nbsp;\u2013 a software mechanism to [[context switch|switch]] the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] among processes often so users can [[time-sharing|interact]] with each program while it runs.<ref name=\"osc-ch4-100\">{{cite book\n  | last = Silberschatz\n  | first = Abraham\n  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1994\n  | page = 100\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-50480-4\n}}</ref> Within hardware, modern day multiprocessor computers or computers with multicore processors may run multiple programs.<ref name=\"mcore\">{{cite book\n  | last = Akhter\n  | first = Shameem\n  | title = Multi-Core Programming\n  | publisher = Richard Bowles (Intel Press)\n  | year = 2006\n  | pages = 11\u201313\n  | isbn = 978-0-9764832-4-3\n}}</ref>\n\n===Self-modifying programs===\n{{Main|Self-modifying code}}\n\nA computer program in [[execution (computing)|execution]] is normally treated as being different from the [[Data (computing)|data]] the program operates on. However, in some cases, this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself. The modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible for programs written in [[machine code]], [[assembly language]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[COBOL]], [[PL/1]], and [[Prolog]].\n\n==Functional categories==\nComputer programs may be categorized along functional lines. The main functional categories are [[application software]] and [[system software]]. System software includes the [[operating system]] which couples [[computer hardware]] with application software.<ref name=\"osc-overview\"/> The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner.<ref name=\"osc-overview\">{{cite book\n  | last = Silberschatz\n  | first = Abraham\n  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1994\n  | page = 1\n  | isbn = 978-0-201-50480-4\n}}</ref> In addition to the operating system, system software includes [[Firmware|embedded programs]], [[Booting|boot programs]], and [[Microcode|micro programs]]. Application software designed for [[end user]]s have a [[Interface (computing)|user interface]]. Application software not designed for the end user includes [[middleware]], which couples one application with another. Application software also includes [[Utility software|utility programs]]. The distinction between system software and application software is under debate.\n\n===Application software===\n{{Main|Application software}}\n[[File:Gcalctool-scientific.png|thumb|Example of an app: [[GCalctool]], a software calculator]]\n\nThere are many types of application software:\n* The word '''app''' came to being in 21st century. It is a [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] of the word \"application\". They have been designed for many platforms, but the word was first used for smaller mobile apps. Desktop apps are traditional computer programs that run on [[desktop computer]]s. [[Mobile app]]s run on [[mobile device]]s. [[Web app]]s run inside a [[web browser]]. Both mobile and desktop apps may be downloaded from the developers' website or purchased from [[app store]]s such as [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]], [[Apple App Store]], [[Mac App Store]], [[Google Play]] or [[Intel AppUp]].\n* An '''[[application suite]]''' consists of multiple applications bundled together. Examples include [[Microsoft Office]], [[LibreOffice]], and [[iWork]]. They bundle a word processor, spreadsheet, and other applications.\n* '''[[Enterprise software|Enterprise applications]]''' bundle accounting, personnel, customer, and vendor applications. Examples include [[enterprise resource planning]], [[customer relationship management]], and [[supply chain management software]].\n* '''Enterprise infrastructure software''' supports the enterprise's [[software systems]]. Examples include databases, email servers, and network servers.\n* '''[[Information worker]] software''' are designed for workers at the departmental level. Examples include [[time management]], [[schedule (workplace)|resource management]], analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information system, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.\n* '''Media development software''' generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. These produce graphics, publications, animations, and videos.\n* '''Product engineering software''' is used to help develop large machines and other application software. Examples includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE), and [[integrated development environment]]s.\n* '''Entertainment Software''' can refer to video games, movie recorders and players, and music recorders and players.\n\n===Utility programs===\n[[Utility software|Utility programs]] are application programs designed to aid [[system administrator]]s and [[computer programmer]]s.\n\n===Operating system===\n{{See also|Operating system}}\n\nAn [[operating system]] is a computer program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.\n<ref name=\"osc-overview\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s, the programmer, who was also the operator, would write a program and run it. After the program finished executing, the output may have been printed, or it may have been punched onto paper tape or cards for later processing.<ref name=\"osc-ch1-p6\"/>\nMore often than not the program did not work.The programmer then looked at the console lights and fiddled with the console switches. If less fortunate, a memory printout was made for further study.In the 1960s, programmers reduced the amount of wasted time by automating the operator's job. A program called an ''operating system'' was kept in the computer at all times.<ref name=\"sco-ch1-p11\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/structuredcomput00tane/page/11|title=Structured Computer Organization, Third Edition|last=Tanenbaum|first=Andrew S.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1990|isbn=978-0-13-854662-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/structuredcomput00tane/page/11 11]}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, operating systems were programmed in [[assembly language|assembly]]; however, modern operating systems are typically written in [[C (programming language)|C]].\n\n===Boot program===\nA [[stored-program computer]] requires an initial computer program stored in its [[read-only memory]] to [[booting|boot]].
