{"title_page": "History of Chaotic Trading Card Game", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n{{in-universe|date=March 2013}}\n\nBefore its current form the [[Chaotic Trading Card Game]] had several names and versions.  Starting in Denmark, ''Dracco Heads'' was a children's collectors product featuring plastic figurines of strange creatures. In 2000 a [[trading card game]] called ''Grolls & Gorks'' was published featuring characters and creatures from Dracco Heads. The next year the game was redesigned by Bryan C. Gannon and renamed ''Chaotic: Now or Never!'' This version of the card game had many characters and cards on which the current version of the [[Chaotic]] game and the [[Chaotic (TV series)|television series]] are based.\n\n==Dracco Heads==\nDracco Heads was a kids' collectors' product sold by [[Dracco Company]] Ltd. Dracco Heads featured little [[Miniature wargaming|plastic figures]] shaped like heads of strange creatures.<ref name=\"dracco\">http://www.ledo.hr/v4/hr/aktualno/dracco2/hr/loader.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429232755/http://www.ledo.hr/v4/hr/aktualno/dracco2/hr/loader.html |date=2008-04-29 }} Croatian Dracco Heads website</ref> A few of these Dracco Heads were given both names and purposes for game play. Dracco Heads were very similar to Crazy Bones.\n\nOver time, Dracco Company Ltd. started making new sets for the Dracco Heads Collection, such as Jumbo Dracco Heads, Baby Dracco Heads, and the Dracco Heads 2nd Edition. The Jumbo Dracco Heads were identical to the originals except for being three times as large, while the Baby Dracco Heads were smaller and cuter versions of the originals.\n\nThe third Dracco Heads expansion set was called ''Dracco Heads 2''. This set featured 41 entirely new Dracco Heads divided into two factions, the Gorkovi and the Grollovi; in the current ''Chaotic'' mythology, these groups would correspond to the Underworlders and the Overworlders. The expansion also introduced the Dracco Stone, which corresponds to the Cothica.\n\nBeyond the lack of Danians and Mipedians, the most significant difference between the current ''Chaotic'' mythology and the ''Dracco Heads 2'' mythology is their origin stories. In ''Dracco Heads 2'', the Grollovi's spaceship had crash landed on a planet inhabited by the Gorkovi, and in the process, the ship's cargo, the Dracco Stone, was lost. The Gorkovi, upon finding out about the stone, wanted to find it so that they could use it to rule the universe; the Grollovi, on the other hand, simply needed it to give their spaceship enough power to return to their home planet.\n\n==Grolls & Gorks==\nIn 2000 a TCG known as ''Grolls & Gorks'' was born. In this trading card game (TCG) the [[Animal|creature]]s on the cards were mostly from the Dracco Heads 2nd edition,<ref name=\"dracco\"/> though Location cards were a new addition. Grolls & Gorks was not only a TCG but it was also a [[Coin]] Game. It featured plastic coins that had the faces of the Grolls & Gorks creatures on them.\n\nIn the Grolls & Gorks TCG, the words GROLLOVI and GORKOVI refer to the creature types.\nGROLLOVI are the OverWorlder creatures and GORKOVI are the UnderWorlder creatures.\n\n==Chaotic: Now or Never!==\n{{Infobox game\n| title = Chaotic: Now or Never!\n| image_link = \n| image_caption = \n| designer = originally Dracco Company Ltd.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.investors.com/breakingnews.asp?journalid=27541441&rb=1 Investor's Business Daily: Breaking News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216012400/http://www.investors.com/breakingnews.asp?journalid=27541441&rb=1 |date=2007-12-16 }}</ref>\n| illustrator = \n| publisher = [[Apex Marketing, Inc.]]\n| players = 2\n| ages = \n| setup_time = \n| playing_time = \n| random_chance = Medium\n| skills = [[Collectible card game|Card playing]]<br/>[[Mathematics|Arithmetic]]<br>Basic Reading Ability\n| footnotes = }}\n\nIn the year 2001 the Grolls & Gorks TCG was turned into ''Chaotic: Now Or Never!'' It still featured some of the original creatures from Grolls & Gorks, such as Screamer, TwinHead, Gork, Pingo, Wakko (now known as Yokkis), Clapper (now known as Klasp), and many others. There were also some creatures in the ''Chaotic: Now Or Never!'' TCG that came directly from the first edition of ''Dracco Heads'', such as Diablo (now known as Chaor) and Mr. Muscles. Mr. Muscles's name was soon turned into Muxsle, which in 2007 was again changed to Stelgar.\n\n==Now or Never! storyline==\nThe story of Chaotic: Now Or Never! is the [[High fantasy|epic tale]] of two boys, Tom and Kazdan, and their adventures in Perim, a volatile land where fierce battles are fought trying to capture The Chaos Rock and the control of Perim.<ref name=\"NON\">{{Cite web |url=http://chaoticusa.com/mainmovie.swf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630212243/http://chaoticusa.com/mainmovie.swf |archive-date=2007-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOne day, Tom, a smart and curious 12-year-old, finds a pair of rings in his back yard. The rings, Athala and Na'arin (the Ring Of Na'arin is a Battlegear card in the new Chaotic game), are really [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]]al portals to a clandestine realm known as Perim. However, before Tom has the chance to uncover the secret of the rings, the school bully, Kazdan, shows up. Kazdan is a strong 14-year-old boy who is Tom's never-failing rival. Kazdan spots Tom examining one of the rings and manages to steal it from him. Kazdan is unaware of the other ring that is in Tom's backpack. Shortly thereafter, both boys discover that putting on the rings enables them to enter Perim.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\nPerim is a place of great adventures and epic tales. It is inhabited by five tribes of creatures: the Danians, The Deep Ones, the Mipedians, the OverWorlders, and the UnderWorlders. The OverWorlders and UnderWorlders are constantly warring, while the other tribes keep to themselves and have an air of mystery about them. The OverWorlders are good, kind, innovative and curious. The UnderWorlders are evil, malicious, destructive, and dominating. Tom finds his friends among the OverWorlders while Kazdan finds his with the UnderWorlders.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\nThe two tribes are both interested in [[peace]] in Perim, but where the UnderWorlders want peace through supremacy, the OverWorlders want peace through diplomacy. The OverWorlders and the UnderWorlders are of similar strength and size, however individuals in the two tribe vary greatly. To get the upper hand in the struggle between the OverWorld and the UnderWorld, both groups search for the legendary artifact known as the \"Chaos Rock\". With control of the Chaos Rock, either group could rule Perim. Hence the two groups constantly search and battle for the stone.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\nThe Chaos Rock and the struggle to secure it are the catalysts for endless adventures in the world of Perim. Perim has been built with great level of detail permitting all creatures and locations to have their own integrated story; the land has its legends and the places have their pasts.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\n==Now or Never! cards==\n\nThe cards in this game are divided into 3 decks for play. The main deck consists of creatures, locations, weapons, spells. This deck is the source of most game play. The second and third decks contain discipline cards and power cards respectively. These decks are used in determining the outcome of battles between opposing creatures.\n\nAfter 4Kids Entertainment and Bryan C. Gannon signed the contract, the original Chaotic TCG, Chaotic: Now Or Never!, was cancelled and taken off the market.\n\n==Now or Never! characters==\n\n===Tom===\nTom is a happy, good natured 12-year-old who is curious and investigative in nature. Tom has enough faith in himself to stand up for what he believes in, but can come across as shy. In Perim, Tom is never shy; he feels respected for what he does and says. Tom is starting to gain confidence in the real world because of his victorious adventures in Perim. Mad Cap and Intress are Tom's best friends. Tom is a friend of the OverWorlders and an enemy of Kazdan, who supports and helps the UnderWorlders in their quest for the ChaosRock.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\n===Kazdan===\nKazdan is aggressive, destructive and highly methodical.  He is physically strong, but immature.  Kazdan is unable to understand the damage he does, and, at times, can be downright malicious.  He likes the world he lives in and he likes himself the way he is. Kazdan's best friends are Chaor \u2013 the leader of the UnderWorlders, and the young warrior Taki-nom.  Kazdan's enemies are Tom and the OverWorlders, who hate the authoritative approach and despotic rule that Kazdan represents.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\n===Maxxor===\nMaxxor is the leader of the OverWorlders - he is funny and crazy, yet disciplined, heroic and intelligent.  Maxxor above all wants peace, but is unfortunately too unfocused to concentrate on that single goal.  He does, however, realize that the other OverWorlders look up to him for his bravery, magical abilities and strength. Maxxor is constantly arranging adventuring parties to go in search of the Cothica.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\n===Intress===\nIntress is probably the most feminine of the OverWorlders. Her catlike stature and black suit make her an elegant and stealthy ally. Intress' specialty is ranged weapons and she favors protective magic.  On one hand, she is highly charismatic and communicative, but can be secretive and reserved. Her ability to predict and to navigate the opinions and actions of others gives her the upper-hand in critical situations. Her closest ally is MadCap, with whom she forms the perfect team.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\n===Chaor===\nMethodical and ruthless, Chaor is the perfect leader for the UnderWorlders. He is a despotic ruler, a tyrant with brains and an uncontrollable temper. Chaor is a strong, brave and wise leader who expects loyalty above and appreciates when his UnderWorlders go into harm's way to display bravery and loyalty. Chaor's magical powers \u2013 the strongest among UnderWorlders \u2013 are based on fire and power and designed to cause maximum harm.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\n===Taki-nom===\nTaki-nom is an evil UnderWorlder princess with great oriental magic. Taki-nom's greatest asset is her ability to dig up information and she is able to travel both in the UnderWorld and the OverWorld, through blackmail, bribery or intelligence.  She enjoys the respect of other UnderWorlders who fear and admire her ability to influence Chaor's mood.<ref name=\"NON\"/>\n\n==The original six tribes==\nThe storyline of ''Chaotic: Now or Never!'' involved six tribes of Perim, although only five were ever mentioned.\n\nThe first tribe was the Mipedians, which consisted of lizard-like creatures that lived in the Overworld deserts. The second was the Danians, which included ant-like creatures that lived in the Underworld's Mount Pillar location.\n\nThe third and fourth tribes, the Underworlders and the Overworlders, became the backbone of ''Chaotic: Now or Never!'''s storyline. The Underworlders were demon-like creatures that lived underground, while the Overworlders lived on the surface and included such varied classes of creatures as wizards, warriors, animals, and alien-esque beings.\n\nThe fifth tribe, the Deep Ones, lived in the Deepworld and included aquatic creatures. At some point in Perim's history, they were imprisoned in a location known as the Doors of the Deepmines.  In the modern version of ''Chaotic'', the Deep Ones are known as the M'arrillians.\n\nThe sixth tribe, the Frozen, were icy creatures who lived in the Icy Glaciers (known in the modern version of ''Chaotic'' as Glacier Plains).\n\n==Current Chaotic game==\nSoon, [[4kids Entertainment]] signed a contract with Apex Marketing, the creators of ''Chaotic: Now Or Never!'' and ''Grolls & Gorks'', and brought ''Chaotic'' to the US.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In order to keep the popularity up, they changed the names of some of the creature, location, weapon, and spell cards, as well as the card design, appearance, and card types. Weapon cards are now known as battle gear, and spell cards are now known as mugic.\n\nThe story line was also changed for both the game and the TV series. For example, in the original story, Tom and Kazdan were enemies, not friends, and the Cothica was originally known as the Dracco Kamen (meaning \"Dracco Stone\") and later as the Chaos Rock.\n\nAt some point, ChaoticUSA.com was turned into a redirect page for chaoticgame.com and all of the content on the old website was deleted.<ref name=\"NON\"/><ref>http://www.chaoticusa.com/</ref>\n\n==Hiatus==\nAfter a website update in August 2010, the website stopped updating and the card next set in production was indefinitely delayed. The website still remains however, and while no official announcements have been made, some dedicated fans discovered TCDigital and 4kids had engaged in a series of lawsuits over the Chaotic property. \n\nIn spite of this Hiatus, Chaotic still celebrated its 5th anniversary on October 23, 2012 with a staff battle event, and a slight visual change was made to the main website. However, for whatever reason, the announcement on the forums did not effect the \"Mega Roar\" announcement section of the front page (this has since been fixed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://community.chaoticgame.com/forum/Topic2331745-5-1.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414022109/http://community.chaoticgame.com/forum/Topic2331745-5-1.aspx |archive-date=2013-04-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Closure==\n4Kids filed bankruptcy in 2014 and reorganized under the name 4Licensing.\n4Licensing filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2017.\nThis dissolved the company and ended the copyright dispute lawsuit with TC Digital.\nA reboot of the Chaotic franchise is in progress according to the president of TC Digital Games, Bryan C Gannon. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1ZEXoEyJ1Y</ref>\nNo details are available on the expected release of the reboot or how different the reboot will be.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630212243/http://chaoticusa.com/mainmovie.swf Chaotic: Now Or Never!

Hinckley played a prominent part in the [[English Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/civilwarhinckley.html Hinckley in the Civil War] Hinckley Past & Present</ref> Its proximity to several rival strongholds\u2014the royalist garrisons at Caldicote, [[Ashby de la Zouch]] and Leicester, those of the Parliamentarians at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Coventry]], and the presence of parties of troops or brigands occupying several fortified houses in nearby Warwickshire\u2014ensured frequent visits by the warring parties. The local townsfolk were forced to decide whether to declare their allegiances openly or attempt to remain neutral\u2014with the risk of having to pay levies, ransoms, and fines to both sides. In March 1644, Hinckley was occupied by a group of [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops, though they were soon driven out by a force of [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s, who took many prisoners.\n\nThe Civil War years were a particularly unsettled time for the clergy in and around Hinckley. Parsons with parliamentary leanings like Thomas Cleveland, the vicar of Hinckley, suffered [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|sequestration by the Leicester County Committee]], like some of his \"malignant\" neighbours accused of visiting royalist garrisons or preaching against Parliament.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe town was visited by both parliamentary and royalists troops from the rival garrisons, particularly parliamentary troops from Tamworth, Coventry and [[Astley Castle]] in Warwickshire. Troops from Coventry garrison were particularly active in the town, taking horses and \"free quarter\" and availing themselves of 'dyett and Beere', and taking some of the inhabitants hostage for ransom. Royalist troops raided the town to threaten those with parliamentary sympathies. The notorious Lord Hastings of Ashby de la Zouch is recorded to have \"coursed about the country as far as Dunton and Lutterworth and took near upon a hundred of the clergymen and others, and carried them prisoners \u2026 threatening to hang all them that should take the Parliament's Covenant\". Parliamentary newssheets record that on the night of 4 March 1644, Hastings's men brought in \"26 honest countrymen from several towns\" intending to take them to Ashby de la Zouch, along with a huge herd of cattle, oxen and horses from the country people and a minister named Mr Warner. These prisoners were herded into Hinckley church and asked \"in a jeering manner, 'Where are the Round-heads your brethren at Leicester? Why come they not to redeem you?'\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:Davis, Military window inscription.JPG|thumb|left|This inscription is part of a window in St Mary's church, Hinckley]]\nThe Parliamentarians responded in a memorable \"Skirmish or Great Victory for Parliament\". Colonel Grey with 120 foot-soldiers and 30 troopers from Bagworth House rushed to Hinckley and re-took the town, routed the Royalists, rescued the cattle and released their imprisoned countrymen. No doubt the inhabitants of the town were as relieved as any when Ashby finally surrendered, as Vicars records, \"a great mercy and mighty preservation of the peace and tranquility of all those adjacent parts about it.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Hinckley, Leicestershire.jpg|thumb|Map of Hinckley and its surroundings dated 1786]]\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAt the time of the first national census in 1801, Hinckley had a population of 5,158: twenty years later it had increased by about a thousand.

In the district, it was estimated ca. 1830 that 6,000 persons were employed in this work.<ref>Curtis, John (1831) ''A Topographical History of the County of Leicester'' Ashby-de-la-Zouch: W.

It is reputed that, many years ago, one of the itinerant sheep drovers bragged that he could drink a hat full of ale. The local landlord put this man to the test by getting the local blacksmith to make a tin hat, which he then filled with ale. Thereafter, the town became known as \"Tin 'At\". Another explanation is that the people of Hinckley used to place buckets on water pumps to keep them clean and prevent the spread of illness, the bucket obviously being the \"Tin 'At\". A tin hat can be seen on top of the flag pole which sits on the roof of the Coral branch at the corner of Castle Street and Market Place. There is also a pub called The Tin Hat and a fair held annually during December in the town centre called The Tin Hat Fair.<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/hinckley.html Hinckley Folklore]</ref>\n\n== Twinning ==\n\nHinckley is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Le Grand-Quevilly]], France,<ref name=\"Hinckley-Grand-Quevilly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/2|title=Hinckley, UK \u2013 Grand-Quevilly, France twinning|accessdate = 14 July 2013|work=Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-grand-quevilly.fr/international/ |title=Twinning with Le Grand Quevilly (fr) |publisher=Ville-grand-quevilly.fr |date= |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> and joined with [[Herford]], Germany in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Hinckley-Herford\">{{cite web|url = http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/3|title = Hinckley, UK \u2013 Herford, Germany twinning|accessdate = 14 July 2013|work = Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141210231432/http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/3|archive-date = 10 December 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> Hinckley is also twinned with [[Midland, Ohio]], United States.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{commons category-inline|Hinckley, Leicestershire}}\n* [http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org Hinckley Past & Present \u2013 Hinckley Past and Present]\n\n{{Leicestershire}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hinckley| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Hinckley and Bosworth]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Town in Leicestershire, England}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n| country =                England\n| official_name=           Hinckley\n| coordinates = {{coord|52.5413|-1.3725|display=inline,title}}\n| civil_parish=\n| population = 45,249\n| population_ref = ([[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011]])\n| shire_district=          [[Hinckley and Bosworth]]\n| shire_county=            [[Leicestershire]]\n| region=                  East Midlands\n| constituency_westminster= [[Bosworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bosworth]]\n| post_town=                HINCKLEY\n| postcode_district =       LE10\n| postcode_area=            LE\n| dial_code=                01455\n| os_grid_reference=        SP425939\n|static_image_name= Hinckley Town Centre.jpg\n|static_image_caption=  Hinckley town centre\n}}\n\n'''Hinckley''' is a [[market town]] in southwest [[Leicestershire]], England.

Hinckley played a prominent part in the [[English Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/civilwarhinckley.html Hinckley in the Civil War] Hinckley Past & Present</ref> Its proximity to several rival strongholds\u2014the royalist garrisons at Caldicote, [[Ashby de la Zouch]] and Leicester, those of the Parliamentarians at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Coventry]], and the presence of parties of troops or brigands occupying several fortified houses in nearby Warwickshire\u2014ensured frequent visits by the warring parties. The local townsfolk were forced to decide whether to declare their allegiances openly or attempt to remain neutral\u2014with the risk of having to pay levies, ransoms, and fines to both sides. In March 1644, Hinckley was occupied by a group of [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops, though they were soon driven out by a force of [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s, who took many prisoners.\n\nThe Civil War years were a particularly unsettled time for the clergy in and around Hinckley. Parsons with parliamentary leanings like Thomas Cleveland, the vicar of Hinckley, suffered [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|sequestration by the Leicester County Committee]], like some of his \"malignant\" neighbours accused of visiting royalist garrisons or preaching against Parliament.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe town was visited by both parliamentary and royalists troops from the rival garrisons, particularly parliamentary troops from Tamworth, Coventry and [[Astley Castle]] in Warwickshire. Troops from Coventry garrison were particularly active in the town, taking horses and \"free quarter\" and availing themselves of 'dyett and Beere', and taking some of the inhabitants hostage for ransom. Royalist troops raided the town to threaten those with parliamentary sympathies. The notorious Lord Hastings of Ashby de la Zouch is recorded to have \"coursed about the country as far as Dunton and Lutterworth and took near upon a hundred of the clergymen and others, and carried them prisoners \u2026 threatening to hang all them that should take the Parliament's Covenant\". Parliamentary newssheets record that on the night of 4 March 1644, Hastings's men brought in \"26 honest countrymen from several towns\" intending to take them to Ashby de la Zouch, along with a huge herd of cattle, oxen and horses from the country people and a minister named Mr Warner. These prisoners were herded into Hinckley church and asked \"in a jeering manner, 'Where are the Round-heads your brethren at Leicester? Why come they not to redeem you?'\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:Davis, Military window inscription.JPG|thumb|left|This inscription is part of a window in St Mary's church, Hinckley]]\nThe Parliamentarians responded in a memorable \"Skirmish or Great Victory for Parliament\". Colonel Grey with 120 foot-soldiers and 30 troopers from Bagworth House rushed to Hinckley and re-took the town, routed the Royalists, rescued the cattle and released their imprisoned countrymen. No doubt the inhabitants of the town were as relieved as any when Ashby finally surrendered, as Vicars records, \"a great mercy and mighty preservation of the peace and tranquility of all those adjacent parts about it.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Hinckley, Leicestershire.jpg|thumb|Map of Hinckley and its surroundings dated 1786]]\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAt the time of the first national census in 1801, Hinckley had a population of 5,158: twenty years later it had increased by about a thousand.

In the district, it was estimated ca. 1830 that 6,000 persons were employed in this work.<ref>Curtis, John (1831) ''A Topographical History of the County of Leicester'' Ashby-de-la-Zouch: W.

It is reputed that, many years ago, one of the itinerant sheep drovers bragged that he could drink a hat full of ale. The local landlord put this man to the test by getting the local blacksmith to make a tin hat, which he then filled with ale. Thereafter, the town became known as \"Tin 'At\". Another explanation is that the people of Hinckley used to place buckets on water pumps to keep them clean and prevent the spread of illness, the bucket obviously being the \"Tin 'At\". A tin hat can be seen on top of the flag pole which sits on the roof of the Coral branch at the corner of Castle Street and Market Place. There is also a pub called The Tin Hat and a fair held annually during December in the town centre called The Tin Hat Fair.<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/hinckley.html Hinckley Folklore]</ref>\n\n== Twinning ==\n\nHinckley is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Le Grand-Quevilly]], France,<ref name=\"Hinckley-Grand-Quevilly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/2|title=Hinckley, UK \u2013 Grand-Quevilly, France twinning|accessdate = 14 July 2013|work=Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-grand-quevilly.fr/international/ |title=Twinning with Le Grand Quevilly (fr) |publisher=Ville-grand-quevilly.fr |date= |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> and joined with [[Herford]], Germany in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Hinckley-Herford\">{{cite web|url = http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/3|title = Hinckley, UK \u2013 Herford, Germany twinning|accessdate = 14 July 2013|work = Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141210231432/http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/3|archive-date = 10 December 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> Hinckley is also twinned with [[Midland, Ohio]], United States.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{commons category-inline|Hinckley, Leicestershire}}\n* [http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org Hinckley Past & Present \u2013 Hinckley Past and Present]\n\n{{Leicestershire}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hinckley| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Hinckley and Bosworth]]\n", "name_user": "86.8.172.100", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I've reinstated this information because somebody has deleted it for sabotage purposes.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinckley"}

{"title_page": "Signed number representations", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn [[computing]], '''signed number representations''' are required to encode [[negative number]]s in binary number systems.\n\nIn [[mathematics]], negative numbers in any base are represented by prefixing them with a minus sign (\"&minus;\"). However, in [[computer hardware]], numbers are represented only as sequences of [[bit]]s, without extra symbols. The four best-known methods of extending the [[binary numeral system]] to represent [[signed number]]s are: [[#Sign-and-magnitude method|sign-and-magnitude]], [[#Ones' complement|ones' complement]], [[#Two's complement|two's complement]], and [[#Excess-K|offset binary]]. Some of the alternative methods use implicit instead of explicit signs, such as negative binary, using the [[#Base \u22122|base \u22122]]. Corresponding methods can be devised for [[positional notation|other bases]], whether positive, negative, fractional, or other elaborations on such themes.\n\nThere is no definitive criterion by which any of the representations is universally superior. For integers, the representation used in most current computing devices is two's complement, although the [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series|Unisys ClearPath Dorado series]] mainframes use ones' complement.\n<!-- Note: \"For integers\" to exclude the significand and the exponent field of IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. -->\n\n==History==\nThe early days of digital computing were marked by a lot of competing ideas about both hardware technology and mathematics technology (numbering systems). One of the great debates was the format of negative numbers, with some of the era's most expert people having very strong and different opinions.{{Citation needed|reason=Please reference these debates|date=May 2012}} One camp supported [[two's complement]], the system that is dominant today.  Another camp supported ones' complement, where any positive value is made into its negative equivalent by inverting all of the bits in a word.  A third group supported \"sign &amp; magnitude\" (sign-magnitude), where a value is changed from positive to negative simply by toggling the word's sign (high-order) bit.\n\nThere were arguments for and against each of the systems.<!--{{Citation needed|reason=Cite these arguments|date=May 2012}}--the rest of the article gives reasons -->  Sign &amp; magnitude allowed for easier tracing of memory dumps (a common process in the 1960s) as small numeric values use fewer 1 bits.<!-- this is obvious enough --> Internally, these systems did ones' complement math so numbers would have to be converted to ones' complement values when they were transmitted from a register to the math unit and then converted back to sign-magnitude when the result was transmitted back to the register<!--{{Citation needed|reason=Cite one of these systems|date=May 2012}}-- this is the most hardware efficient way to do it. It is likely how they did it-->.  The electronics required more gates than the other systems{{snd}}a key concern when the cost and packaging of discrete transistors were critical.  IBM was one of the early supporters of sign-magnitude, with their [[IBM 704|704]], [[IBM 709|709]] and [[IBM 7090|709x]] series computers being perhaps the best-known systems to use it.\n\nOnes' complement allowed for somewhat simpler hardware designs as there was no need to convert values when passed to and from the math unit.  But it also shared an undesirable characteristic with sign-magnitude{{snd}}the ability to represent [[negative zero]] (\u22120). Negative zero behaves exactly like positive zero; when used as an operand in any calculation, the result will be the same whether an operand is positive or negative zero.  The disadvantage, however, is that the existence of two forms of the same value necessitates two rather than a single comparison when checking for equality with zero.  Ones' complement subtraction can also result in an [[end-around borrow]] (described below).  It can be argued that this makes the addition/subtraction logic more complicated or that it makes it simpler as a subtraction requires simply inverting the bits of the second operand as it is passed to the adder.  The [[PDP-1]], [[CDC 160 series]], [[CDC 3000]] series, [[CDC 6000 series]], [[UNIVAC 1100]] series, and the [[LINC]] computer use ones' complement representation.\n\nTwo's complement is the easiest to implement in hardware, which may be the ultimate reason for its widespread popularity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Two's complement computation sharing multiplier and its applications to high performance DFE|first1=Hunsoo|last1=Choo|first2=K.|last2=Muhammad|first3=K.|last3=Roy|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|volume=51|issue=2|date=February 2003|pages=458-469|doi=10.1109/TSP.2002.806984|url=https://www.academia.edu/29135370/Twos_complement_computation_sharing_multiplier_and_its_applications_to_high_performance_DFE}}</ref> Processors on the early mainframes often consisted of thousands of transistors{{snd}}eliminating a significant number of transistors was a significant cost savings.

The architects of the early integrated circuit-based CPUs ([[Intel 8080]], etc.) chose to use two's complement math.  As IC technology advanced, virtually all adopted two's complement technology.

In this approach, a number's sign is represented with a '''[[sign bit]]''': setting that [[bit]] (often the [[most significant bit]]) to 0 for a positive number or positive zero, and setting it to 1 for a negative number or negative zero.  The remaining bits in the number indicate the magnitude (or [[absolute value]]). For example, in an eight-bit [[byte]], only seven bits represent the magnitude, which can range from 0000000 (0) to 1111111 (127). Thus numbers ranging from &minus;127<sub>10</sub> to +127<sub>10</sub> can be represented once the sign bit (the eighth bit) is added.  For example, &minus;43<sub>10</sub> encoded in an eight-bit byte is <strong>1</strong>0101011 while 43<sub>10</sub> is <strong>0</strong>0101011. Using signed magnitude representation has multiple consequences which makes them more intricate to implement:<ref name=\"cs315\">{{cite web |last1=Bacon |first1=Jason W. |url=http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch04s11.html |title=Computer Science 315 Lecture Notes |accessdate=21 February 2020 |date=2010\u20132011}}</ref>\n\n# There are two ways to represent zero, 00000000 (0) and 10000000 ([[\u22120]]).\n# Addition and subtraction require different behaviour depending on the sign bit, whereas one's complement can ignore the sign bit and just do an end-around carry, and two's complement can ignore the sign bit and depend on the overflow behavior.\n# Comparison also require inspecting the sign bit, whereas in two's complement, one can simply subtract the two numbers, and check if the outcome is positive or negative.\n# The minimum negative number is \u2212127 instead of \u2212128 in the case of two's complement.\n\nThis approach is directly comparable to the common way of showing a sign (placing a \"+\" or \"&minus;\" next to the number's magnitude).

In two's complement, negative numbers are represented by the bit pattern which is one greater (in an unsigned sense) than the ones' complement of the positive value.\n\nIn two's-complement, there is only one zero, represented as 00000000. Negating a number (whether negative or positive) is done by inverting all the bits and then adding one to that result.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two's Complement|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|date=April 2000|author=Thomas Finley|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref> This actually reflects the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure on all integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] [[power of two|2<sup>''N''</sup>]]: <math>\\mathbb{Z}/2^N\\mathbb{Z}</math>. Addition of a pair of two's-complement integers is the same as addition of a pair of [[signedness|unsigned numbers]] (except for detection of [[integer overflow|overflow]], if that is done); the same is true for subtraction and even for ''N'' lowest significant bits of a product (value of multiplication). For instance, a two's-complement addition of 127 and \u2212128 gives the same binary bit pattern as an unsigned addition of 127 and 128, as can be seen from the 8-bit two's complement table.\n\nAn easier method to get the negation of a number in two's complement is as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

A value is represented by the unsigned number which is <var>K</var> greater than the intended value. Thus 0 is represented by <var>K</var>, and &minus;<var>K</var> is represented by the all-zeros bit pattern. This can be seen as a slight modification and generalization of the aforementioned two's-complement, which is virtually the {{nobr|excess-(2<sup><var>N</var>\u22121</sup>)}} representation with [[negated]] [[most significant bit]].\n\nBiased representations are now primarily used for the exponent of [[floating-point]] numbers. The [[IEEE floating-point standard]] defines the exponent field of a [[single-precision]] (32-bit) number as an 8-bit [[excess-127]] field. The [[double-precision]] (64-bit) exponent field is an 11-bit [[excess-1023]] field; see [[exponent bias]]. It also had use for binary-coded decimal numbers as [[excess-3]].\n\n==Base \u22122==\n{{See also|Negative base}}\nIn conventional binary number systems, the base, or [[radix]], is 2; thus the rightmost bit represents 2<sup>0</sup>, the next bit represents 2<sup>1</sup>, the next bit 2<sup>2</sup>, and so on. However, a binary number system with base &minus;2 is also possible.\nThe rightmost bit represents {{nowrap|(&minus;2)<sup>0</sup> {{=}} +1}}, the next bit represents {{nowrap|(&minus;2)<sup>1</sup> {{=}} &minus;2}}, the next bit {{nowrap|(&minus;2)<sup>2</sup> {{=}} +4}} and so on, with alternating sign. The numbers that can be represented with four bits are shown in the comparison table below.\n\nThe range of numbers that can be represented is asymmetric. If the word has an even number of bits, the magnitude of the largest negative number that can be represented is twice as large as the largest positive number that can be represented, and vice versa if the word has an odd number of bits.\n\n==Comparison table==\nThe following table shows the positive and negative integers that can be represented using four bits.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Four-bit integer representations\n|-\n! style=\"width: 7em\" | Decimal\n! style=\"width: 7em\" | Unsigned\n! style=\"width: 7em\" | Sign and magnitude\n! style=\"width: 7em\" | Ones' complement\n! style=\"width: 7em\" | Two's complement\n! style=\"width: 7em\" | Excess-8 (biased)\n! style=\"width: 7em\" | Base  \u22122\n|-\n| align=right|+16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1111\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1110\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1101\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1100\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1011\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1010\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1001\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1000\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 0111\n| 0111\n| 0111\n| 0111\n| 1111\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 0110\n| 0110\n| 0110\n| 0110\n| 1110\n| {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=right|+5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 0101\n| 0101\n| 0101\n| 0101\n| 1101\n| 0101\n|-\n| align=right|+4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 0100\n| 0100\n| 0100\n| 0100\n| 1100\n| 0100\n|-\n| align=right|+3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 0011\n| 0011\n| 0011\n| 0011\n| 1011\n| 0111\n|-\n| align=right|+2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 0010\n| 0010\n| 0010\n| 0010\n| 1010\n| 0110\n|-\n| align=right|+1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 0001\n| 0001\n| 0001\n| 0001\n| 1001\n| 0001\n|-\n| align=right|+0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| rowspan=2 valign=center |0000\n| 0000\n| 0000\n| rowspan=2 valign=center | 0000\n| rowspan=2 valign=center | 1000\n| rowspan=2 valign=center | 0000\n|-\n| align=right|[[Signed zero|\u22120]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| 1000\n| 1111\n|-\n| align=right|\u22121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1001\n| 1110\n| 1111\n| 0111\n| 0011\n|-\n| align=right|\u22122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1010\n| 1101\n| 1110\n| 0110\n| 0010\n|-\n| align=right|\u22123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1011\n| 1100\n| 1101\n| 0101\n| 1101\n|-\n| align=right|\u22124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1100\n| 1011\n| 1100\n| 0100\n| 1100\n|-\n| align=right|\u22125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1101\n| 1010\n| 1011\n| 0011\n| 1111\n|-\n| align=right|\u22126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1110\n| 1001\n| 1010\n| 0010\n| 1110\n|-\n| align=right|\u22127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1111\n| 1000\n| 1001\n| 0001\n| 1001\n|-\n| align=right|\u22128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1000\n| 0000\n| 1000\n|-\n| align=right|\u22129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1011\n|-\n| align=right|\u221210&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| 1010\n|-\n| align=right|\u221211&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n| {{n/a}}\n|}\n\n\nSame table, as viewed from \"given these binary bits, what is the number as interpreted by the representation system\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

However, in [[computer hardware]], numbers are represented only as sequences of [[bit]]s, without extra symbols. The four best-known methods of extending the [[binary numeral system]] to represent [[signed number]]s are: [[#Sign-and-magnitude method|sign-and-magnitude]], [[#Ones' complement|ones' complement]], [[#Two's complement|two's complement]], and [[#Excess-K|offset binary]]. Some of the alternative methods use implicit instead of explicit signs, such as negative binary, using the [[#Base \u22122|base \u22122]]. Corresponding methods can be devised for [[positional notation|other bases]], whether positive, negative, fractional, or other elaborations on such themes.\n\nThere is no definitive criterion by which any of the representations is universally superior. For integers, the representation used in most current computing devices is two's complement, although the [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series|Unisys ClearPath Dorado series]] mainframes use ones' complement.\n<!-- Note: \"For integers\" to exclude the significand and the exponent field of IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. -->\n\n==History==\nThe early days of digital computing were marked by a lot of competing ideas about both hardware technology and mathematics technology (numbering systems). One of the great debates was the format of negative numbers, with some of the era's most expert people having very strong and different opinions.{{Citation needed|reason=Please reference these debates|date=May 2012}} One camp supported [[two's complement]], the system that is dominant today.  Another camp supported ones' complement, where any positive value is made into its negative equivalent by inverting all of the bits in a word.  A third group supported \"sign &amp; magnitude\" (sign-magnitude), where a value is changed from positive to negative simply by toggling the word's sign (high-order) bit.\n\nThere were arguments for and against each of the systems.<!--{{Citation needed|reason=Cite these arguments|date=May 2012}}--the rest of the article gives reasons -->  Sign &amp; magnitude allowed for easier tracing of memory dumps (a common process in the 1960s) as small numeric values use fewer 1 bits.<!-- this is obvious enough --> Internally, these systems did ones' complement math so numbers would have to be converted to ones' complement values when they were transmitted from a register to the math unit and then converted back to sign-magnitude when the result was transmitted back to the register<!--{{Citation needed|reason=Cite one of these systems|date=May 2012}}-- this is the most hardware efficient way to do it. It is likely how they did it-->.  The electronics required more gates than the other systems{{snd}}a key concern when the cost and packaging of discrete transistors were critical.  IBM was one of the early supporters of sign-magnitude, with their [[IBM 704|704]], [[IBM 709|709]] and [[IBM 7090|709x]] series computers being perhaps the best-known systems to use it.\n\nOnes' complement allowed for somewhat simpler hardware designs as there was no need to convert values when passed to and from the math unit.  But it also shared an undesirable characteristic with sign-magnitude{{snd}}the ability to represent [[negative zero]] (\u22120). Negative zero behaves exactly like positive zero; when used as an operand in any calculation, the result will be the same whether an operand is positive or negative zero.  The disadvantage, however, is that the existence of two forms of the same value necessitates two rather than a single comparison when checking for equality with zero.  Ones' complement subtraction can also result in an [[end-around borrow]] (described below).  It can be argued that this makes the addition/subtraction logic more complicated or that it makes it simpler as a subtraction requires simply inverting the bits of the second operand as it is passed to the adder.  The [[PDP-1]], [[CDC 160 series]], [[CDC 3000]] series, [[CDC 6000 series]], [[UNIVAC 1100]] series, and the [[LINC]] computer use ones' complement representation.\n\nTwo's complement is the easiest to implement in hardware, which may be the ultimate reason for its widespread popularity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Two's complement computation sharing multiplier and its applications to high performance DFE|first1=Hunsoo|last1=Choo|first2=K.|last2=Muhammad|first3=K.|last3=Roy|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|volume=51|issue=2|date=February 2003|pages=458-469|doi=10.1109/TSP.2002.806984|url=https://www.academia.edu/29135370/Twos_complement_computation_sharing_multiplier_and_its_applications_to_high_performance_DFE}}</ref> Processors on the early mainframes often consisted of thousands of transistors{{snd}}eliminating a significant number of transistors was a significant cost savings.

In this approach, a number's sign is represented with a '''[[sign bit]]''': setting that [[bit]] (often the [[most significant bit]]) to 0 for a positive number or positive zero, and setting it to 1 for a negative number or negative zero.  The remaining bits in the number indicate the magnitude (or [[absolute value]]). For example, in an eight-bit [[byte]], only seven bits represent the magnitude, which can range from 0000000 (0) to 1111111 (127). Thus numbers ranging from &minus;127<sub>10</sub> to +127<sub>10</sub> can be represented once the sign bit (the eighth bit) is added.  For example, &minus;43<sub>10</sub> encoded in an eight-bit byte is <strong>1</strong>0101011 while 43<sub>10</sub> is <strong>0</strong>0101011. Using signed magnitude representation has multiple consequences which makes them more intricate to implement:<ref name=\"cs315\">{{cite web |last1=Bacon |first1=Jason W. |url=http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch04s11.html |title=Computer Science 315 Lecture Notes |accessdate=21 February 2020 |date=2010\u20132011}}</ref>\n\n# There are two ways to represent zero, 00000000 (0) and 10000000 ([[\u22120]]).\n# Addition and subtraction require different behaviour depending on the sign bit, whereas one's complement can ignore the sign bit and just do an end-around carry, and two's complement can ignore the sign bit and depend on the overflow behavior.\n# Comparison also require inspecting the sign bit, whereas in two's complement, one can simply subtract the two numbers, and check if the outcome is positive or negative.\n# The minimum negative number is \u2212127 instead of \u2212128 in the case of two's complement.\n\nThis approach is directly comparable to the common way of showing a sign (placing a \"+\" or \"&minus;\" next to the number's magnitude).

In two's complement, negative numbers are represented by the bit pattern which is one greater (in an unsigned sense) than the ones' complement of the positive value.\n\nIn two's-complement, there is only one zero, represented as 00000000. Negating a number (whether negative or positive) is done by inverting all the bits and then adding one to that result.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two's Complement|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|date=April 2000|author=Thomas Finley|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref> This actually reflects the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure on all integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] [[power of two|2<sup>''N''</sup>]]: <math>\\mathbb{Z}/2^N\\mathbb{Z}</math>.

For instance, a two's-complement addition of 127 and \u2212128 gives the same binary bit pattern as an unsigned addition of 127 and 128, as can be seen from the 8-bit two's complement table.\n\nAn easier method to get the negation of a number in two's complement is as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

Thus 0 is represented by <var>K</var>, and &minus;<var>K</var> is represented by the all-zeros bit pattern.

The [[IEEE floating-point standard]] defines the exponent field of a [[single-precision]] (32-bit) number as an 8-bit [[excess-127]] field. The [[double-precision]] (64-bit) exponent field is an 11-bit [[excess-1023]] field; see [[exponent bias]]. It also had use for binary-coded decimal numbers as [[excess-3]].\n\n==Base \u22122==\n{{See also|Negative base}}\nIn conventional binary number systems, the base, or [[radix]], is 2; thus the rightmost bit represents 2<sup>0</sup>, the next bit represents 2<sup>1</sup>, the next bit 2<sup>2</sup>, and so on. However, a binary number system with base &minus;2 is also possible.\nThe rightmost bit represents {{nowrap|(&minus;2)<sup>0</sup> {{=}} +1}}, the next bit represents {{nowrap|(&minus;2)<sup>1</sup> {{=}} &minus;2}}, the next bit {{nowrap|(&minus;2)<sup>2</sup> {{=}} +4}} and so on, with alternating sign. The numbers that can be represented with four bits are shown in the comparison table below.\n\nThe range of numbers that can be represented is asymmetric.

This allows a [[variable-length quantity]] encoding intended for nonnegative (unsigned) integers to be used efficiently for signed integers.<ref>[http://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#types Protocol Buffers: Signed Integers]</ref>\n\nAnother approach is to give each [[numerical digit|digit]] a sign, yielding the [[signed-digit representation]]. For instance, in 1726, [[John Colson]] advocated reducing expressions to \"small numbers\", numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In 1840, [[Augustin Cauchy]] also expressed preference for such modified decimal numbers to reduce errors in computation.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Balanced ternary]]\n* [[Binary-coded decimal]]\n* [[Computer numbering formats]]\n* [[Method of complements]]\n* [[Signedness]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Ivan Flores, ''The Logic of Computer Arithmetic'', Prentice-Hall (1963)\n* Israel Koren, ''Computer Arithmetic Algorithms'', A.K.

Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko, 1988. 291.</ref> There have since been multiple [[manga]], [[anime]] and [[Video game|computer game]] adaptations, several of which have been translated into [[English language|English]]. The plots generally follow the conventions and structure of the RPG systems including ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and ''[[Sword World RPG]]'', in which several characters of distinct [[character class|types]] undertake a specific [[quest]].\n\n==Origins==\n''Record of Lodoss War'' was created in 1986 by [[Group SNE]] as a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' \"replay\" serialized in the Japanese magazine ''[[Comptiq]]'' from 1986 to 1988, though they also used the setting with other systems such as ''[[Tunnels & Trolls]]'' and ''[[RuneQuest]]''.<ref name=Yasuda /> Replays are not novels, but transcripts of RPG sessions, meant to both hold the interest of readers and convey the events that took place. They have proven to be popular, even to those who do not play [[role-playing game]]s but are fans of fiction (including fantasy fiction). Similar to [[light novel]]s, many characters and parties in replays have become popular as characters of [[anime]]. An example of such a character is the female elf Deedlit in ''Record of Lodoss War'', who was played by [[science fiction]] novelist Hiroshi Yamamoto during the RPG sessions.\n\nThe popularity of the ''Record of Lodoss War'' replays was such that the [[Dungeon Master]] Ryo Mizuno started to adapt the story into some of the earliest Japanese-language domestic [[high fantasy]] novels in 1988.\n\nWhen the replay series went on to become a trilogy, [[Group SNE]] had to abandon the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' rules and create their own game, dubbed ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' and released in 1989. All three parts of the replay series were eventually published as paperbacks by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] from 1989 to 1991: \n\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War I'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2160|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki Wan}} (September 1989) \u2014 Parn's party, retake played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules and incorporating elements from the novelization\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War II'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2161|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki T\u016b}} (September 1990) \u2014 Orson's party, retake played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules and incorporating elements from the novelization\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War III'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2162|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki Sur\u012b}} (August 1991) \u2014 Spark's party, played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules\n\nMizuno's novelizations were published by Kadokawa Shoten between 1988 and 1993, and followed by two collections of short stories in 1995, with illustrations done by [[Yutaka Izubuchi]].

The second was also adapted in manga form, and as a four-CD [[radio drama|audio drama]]. The final five episodes of the OVA series are loosely based on the story told across the third and fourth novels and, having caught up with the ongoing novelization at that point, feature an original ending. The ''Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight'' TV series is a more faithful adaptation of volumes three to seven. The first collection of short stories was adapted into the ''Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit's Tale'' manga series.\n\nMizuno later went on to pen two other series of novels: a prequel titled {{nihongo|'''''Legend of Lodoss'''''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u4f1d\u8aac|R\u014ddosu-t\u014d Densetsu}} (1994 to 2002, 5 volumes) and sequels {{nihongo|'''''[[Legend of Crystania|Drifting Legend Crystania]]'''''|\u6f02\u6d41\u4f1d\u8aac\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30cb\u30a2|Hy\u014dry\u016b Densetsu Kurisutania}} (1993 to 1996, 4 volumes) and {{nihongo|'''''Record of Lodoss War Next Generation'''''|\u65b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18|Shin R\u014ddosu-t\u014d Senki}} (1998 to 2006, 6 volumes); ''Legend of Lodoss'' was adapted into the ''Record of Lodoss War: The Lady of Pharis'' manga series and ''Drifting Legend Crystania'' was adapted into manga, an anime film, and OVA series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Record of Lodoss War characters}}\n\n''Record of Lodoss War'' recounts the adventures of a youth by the name of Parn, the son of a dishonored knight. Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high [[elf]] Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.\n\nThe volumes three to seven, adapted into manga and anime ''Chronicles of the Heroic Knight'', continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the [[Avatar]] of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.\n\nThe series ''[[Legend of Crystania|Drifting Legend Crystania]]'', places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by a \"god beast\" of Crystania. The series then focuses on Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Home video releases===\nThe original OVA series and the TV series had both been released in North America through [[Central Park Media]] on VHS and on DVD.

Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko, 1988. 291.</ref> There have since been multiple [[manga]], [[anime]] and [[Video game|computer game]] adaptations, several of which have been translated into [[English language|English]]. The plots generally follow the conventions and structure of the RPG systems including ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and ''[[Sword World RPG]]'', in which several characters of distinct [[character class|types]] undertake a specific [[quest]].\n\n==Origins==\n''Record of Lodoss War'' was created in 1986 by [[Group SNE]] as a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' \"replay\" serialized in the Japanese magazine ''[[Comptiq]]'' from 1986 to 1988, though they also used the setting with other systems such as ''[[Tunnels & Trolls]]'' and ''[[RuneQuest]]''.<ref name=Yasuda /> Replays are not novels, but transcripts of RPG sessions, meant to both hold the interest of readers and convey the events that took place. They have proven to be popular, even to those who do not play [[role-playing game]]s but are fans of fiction (including fantasy fiction). Similar to [[light novel]]s, many characters and parties in replays have become popular as characters of [[anime]]. An example of such a character is the female elf Deedlit in ''Record of Lodoss War'', who was played by [[science fiction]] novelist Hiroshi Yamamoto during the RPG sessions.\n\nThe popularity of the ''Record of Lodoss War'' replays was such that the [[Dungeon Master]] Ryo Mizuno started to adapt the story into some of the earliest Japanese-language domestic [[high fantasy]] novels in 1988.\n\nWhen the replay series went on to become a trilogy, [[Group SNE]] had to abandon the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' rules and create their own game, dubbed ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' and released in 1989. All three parts of the replay series were eventually published as paperbacks by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] from 1989 to 1991: \n\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War I'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2160|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki Wan}} (September 1989) \u2014 Parn's party, retake played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules and incorporating elements from the novelization\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War II'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2161|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki T\u016b}} (September 1990) \u2014 Orson's party, retake played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules and incorporating elements from the novelization\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War III'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2162|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki Sur\u012b}} (August 1991) \u2014 Spark's party, played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules\n\nMizuno's novelizations were published by Kadokawa Shoten between 1988 and 1993, and followed by two collections of short stories in 1995, with illustrations done by [[Yutaka Izubuchi]].

The second was also adapted in manga form, and as a four-CD [[radio drama|audio drama]]. The final five episodes of the OVA series are loosely based on the story told across the third and fourth novels and, having caught up with the ongoing novelization at that point, feature an original ending. The ''Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight'' TV series is a more faithful adaptation of volumes three to seven. The first collection of short stories was adapted into the ''Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit's Tale'' manga series.\n\nMizuno later went on to pen two other series of novels: a prequel titled {{nihongo|'''''Legend of Lodoss'''''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u4f1d\u8aac|R\u014ddosu-t\u014d Densetsu}} (1994 to 2002, 5 volumes) and sequels {{nihongo|'''''[[Legend of Crystania|Drifting Legend Crystania]]'''''|\u6f02\u6d41\u4f1d\u8aac\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30cb\u30a2|Hy\u014dry\u016b Densetsu Kurisutania}} (1993 to 1996, 4 volumes) and {{nihongo|'''''Record of Lodoss War Next Generation'''''|\u65b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18|Shin R\u014ddosu-t\u014d Senki}} (1998 to 2006, 6 volumes); ''Legend of Lodoss'' was adapted into the ''Record of Lodoss War: The Lady of Pharis'' manga series and ''Drifting Legend Crystania'' was adapted into manga, an anime film, and OVA series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Record of Lodoss War characters}}\n\n''Record of Lodoss War'' recounts the adventures of a youth by the name of Parn, the son of a dishonored knight. Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high [[elf]] Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.\n\nThe volumes three to seven, adapted into manga and anime ''Chronicles of the Heroic Knight'', continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the [[Avatar]] of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.\n\nThe series ''[[Legend of Crystania|Drifting Legend Crystania]]'', places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by a \"god beast\" of Crystania. The series then focuses on Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Home video releases===\nThe original OVA series and the TV series had both been released in North America through [[Central Park Media]] on VHS and on DVD.

Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the [[Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track Campaign]] in the south-east of the island of [[New Guinea]], then part of the Australian [[Territory of Papua]] (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n\u00e9e Steel.<ref name=adb /> Growing up in [[Prahran]], Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.<ref name=Dornan1>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11\u201318}}</ref> Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]]. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business,<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McAllester|first=James|id=A150032b|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel (1918\u20131942) |publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|year=2000|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref> a job he disliked.<ref name=Dornan1 />\n\nUnhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at [[Boundary Bend, Victoria|Boundary Bend]], not far from where Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure \u2013 walking through western Victoria and [[New South Wales]].<ref name = Dornan1 /> In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman.<ref name=Dornan1 /> They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury.<ref name = Dornan1 /> As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 29 May 1940.<ref name=WW2Roll>{{citation|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&veteranId=431320|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n===Middle East===\nKingsbury was originally assigned to the [[2/2nd Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/2nd Pioneer Battalion]], but requested a transfer to the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]] to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted on the same day at a different recruitment centre.<ref name=adb /><ref name=Dornan2>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=19\u201326}}</ref> The pair undertook basic training at [[Puckapunyal]], where they were assigned to the same [[Section (military unit)|section]] (7 Section of 9 Platoon) and were given drill instruction, rifle drill and mock battle training.<ref name=Dornan2/> After 7 Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.<ref name=Dornan2/>\n\nKingsbury, along with the rest of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], was shipped to the Middle East in late 1940.

The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat.

On the 29th August, 1942, the enemy attacked in such force that they succeeded in breaking through the Battalion's right flank, creating a serious threat both to the rest of the Battalion and to its Headquarters.

Continuing to sweep the enemy positions with his fire and inflicting an extremely high number of casualties on them, Private Kingsbury was then seen to fall to the ground shot dead, by the bullet from a sniper hiding in the wood.\n\nPrivate Kingsbury displayed a complete disregard for his own safety.

Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the [[Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track Campaign]] in the south-east of the island of [[New Guinea]], then part of the Australian [[Territory of Papua]] (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n\u00e9e Steel.<ref name=adb /> Growing up in [[Prahran]], Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.<ref name=Dornan1>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11\u201318}}</ref> Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]]. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business,<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McAllester|first=James|id=A150032b|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel (1918\u20131942) |publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|year=2000|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref> a job he disliked.<ref name=Dornan1 />\n\nUnhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at [[Boundary Bend, Victoria|Boundary Bend]], not far from where Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure \u2013 walking through western Victoria and [[New South Wales]].<ref name = Dornan1 /> In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman.<ref name=Dornan1 /> They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury.<ref name = Dornan1 /> As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 29 May 1940.<ref name=WW2Roll>{{citation|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&veteranId=431320|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n===Middle East===\nKingsbury was originally assigned to the [[2/2nd Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/2nd Pioneer Battalion]], but requested a transfer to the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]] to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted on the same day at a different recruitment centre.<ref name=adb /><ref name=Dornan2>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=19\u201326}}</ref> The pair undertook basic training at [[Puckapunyal]], where they were assigned to the same [[Section (military unit)|section]] (7 Section of 9 Platoon) and were given drill instruction, rifle drill and mock battle training.<ref name=Dornan2/> After 7 Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.<ref name=Dornan2/>\n\nKingsbury, along with the rest of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], was shipped to the Middle East in late 1940.

The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat.
