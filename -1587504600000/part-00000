Units formed after 1 January 1919 are not listed.\n\nAero Squadrons were the designation of the first [[United States Army]] aviation units until the end of [[World War I]].   These units consisted of combat flying, training, ground support, construction and other components of the Air Service.   After World War I ended, the majority of these squadrons were demobilized.  Some however were retained during the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, and served in all theaters of operation during [[World War II]].   Today, the oldest squadrons in the [[United States Air Force]] and [[Air National Guard]] can trace their lineage back to the original Aero Squadrons of World War I.\n\n==Overview==\nIn January 1918 a new numbering scheme for aero squadrons was set up. Numbers 1\u2013399 would be for Aero Service Squadrons (AS). 400\u2013599 Aero Construction Squadrons (ACS), 600\u2013799 Aero Supply Squadrons and 800\u20131099 Aero Repair Squadrons.   Non-notable support squadrons are not listed.\n\nThe numerical designation of school squadrons at the various flying fields in the United States was discontinued in July 1918, and replaced by letter designation. For example, the 2d Aero Squadron became Squadron A, Kelly Field. In November 1918, the personnel of the lettered squadrons of each flying field was merged into a single Flying School Detachment at such station.\n\n{|  \n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\" width=\"75\"|&nbsp;|| width=\"300\" |Formed prior to 2 April 1917\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CEEEE8E\" width=\"75\"|&nbsp;|| width=\"300\" |American Expeditionary Force combat squadron\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#FFEBFF\" width=\"75\"|&nbsp;|| width=\"600\" |Planned American Expeditionary Force combat squadron (never entered combat)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#E9E9FD\" width=\"75\"|&nbsp;|| width=\"600\" |Currently active as [[United States Air Force]]/[[Air National Guard]] squadron\n|}\n\nIn addition to the Aero Squadrons, whose mission supported airplanes in one way or another, Air Service Spruce Squadrons have been noted and listed.  A part of the Signal Corps, they were located in Oregon and Washington states.   When the U.S. entered World War I, it was quickly discovered that the nation had no capacity to build warplanes in quantity.  Spruce timber, vital to wing construction was in critically short supply.  In 1918, the United States Army stepped in and took over the production of airplane spruce in the pacific northwest, with the [[Spruce Production Division]] organizing loggers and constructing a plant to process the wood, construct roads and railroads into the forests to access and cut the timber.\n\nMen in the Spruce Squadrons were part of the Signal Corps along with the Aero Squadrons, as the Signal Corps oversaw all Army aviation.  About 50,000 soldiers were assigned to Spruce Squadrons, overseeing about 100,000 lumber workers, were assigned to small camps in the Pacific Northwest.   Many of these men were itching to go \"over there\" and take part in combat, however, their labor and skills to produce spruce lumber were needed far more, in the forests of the Pacific Northwest to produce the materiel needed to build aircraft.  The camps where the soldiers were located are listed on the individual squadron entry.\n\n==Squadrons==\n\n===1st to 24th Aero Squadrons===\nAt the time of the United States entry into World War I in April 1917, three Aero Squadrons had been formed.  The 1st and 3d were in the United States, and the 2d was in the Philippines.   The 6th, being destined for Hawaii and the 7th, destined for the Panama Canal Zone were organizing.  The 4th and 5th, to be based in the continental United States had yet to receive personnel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#f5f9B3\"\n! rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"  | Aero Squadron \n! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"  | Established \n! scope=\"col\"   | World War I\n|-  \n|colspan=3| <center>'''Notes/Subsequent History'''</center>\n\n|- valign=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\"\n| rowspan=2| [[1st Aero Squadron]]\n| 5 March 1913 \n| Formed as: 1st Provisional Aero Squadron<ref name=\"AFHRA 1 RS\"/><br>Pre-WWI service in Mexico and Texas{{sfn|Hennessey|1958|p=167}}<br>AEF: 6 April 1918 \u2013 12 May 1919<br>Corps Observation Squadron<br>Combat with I Corps Observation Group<ref name=\"USWD\">United States War Department (1920), Battle Participation of Organizations of the American Expeditionary Forces in France, Belgium and Italy, 1917\u20131919, Washington, Government Printing Office, 1920</ref>\n* Patrols in the Toul, Aisne-Marne, Vesle and Toul-Verdun Sectors\n* St. Mihiel Offensive Campaign\n* Aisne-Marne Defensive Campaign\n* Meuse-Argonne Offensive Campaign{{sfn|War Department|1920|p=50}}\n|- bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\"\n|colspan=3|  \n* '''Most senior organization in the United States Air Force'''\n* Returned to the United States in August 1919, stationed at Park Field, Tennessee\n* Redesignated in the Army Air Service as the 1st Squadron (Observation) on 14 March 1921; Re-designated as the 1st Observation Squadron on 15 November 1922; Reorganized and re-designated 1st Bombardment Squadron on 1 March 1935.{{sfn|Clay|2011|p=1365}}\nCurrently: [[1st Reconnaissance Squadron]], [[Beale AFB]], California<ref name=\"AFHRA 1 RS\">{{cite web|last1=Haulman|first1=Daniel|title=1 Reconnaissance Squadron (ACC)|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/432062/1-reconnaissance-squadron-acc/|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|accessdate=30 September 2017|date= 21 October 2016}}</ref>\n|-  \n|colspan=3|\n\n|- valign=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\"\n| rowspan=2| [[2d Aero Squadron]]\n| 1 December 1915 \n| Formed as: 1st Company, 2d Aero Squadron<br>Pre-WWI service in the Philippines{{sfn|Hennessey|1958|p=152}}<br>Instructional flying squadron<br>Re-designated: Squadron A, [[Kelly Field]], Texas, July 1918<br>Demobilized: 18 November 1918\n|- bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\"\n|colspan=3|  \n* Constituted in the Air Service, United States Army on 3 June 1919 at Rockwell Field, California, as the 2d Aero Squadron; Transferred on 24 December 1919 to the Philippines assigned to the Philippine Department.\n* Redesignated in the Army Air Service as the 2d Squadron (Observation) on 14 March 1921; Consolidated on 8 April 1924 with the 2d Aero Squadron; Re-designated as: 2d Observation Squadron on 25 January 1923{{sfn|Clay|2011|pp=1367\u20131368}}\n* Stationed at Nichols Field, Philippines on 7 December 1941, subsequently wiped out in the 1941\u20131942 Battle of the Philippines; Inactivated 2 April 1946; Re-activated 1 January 1949.{{sfn|Maurer|1982|pp=15\u201316}}\nCurrently: [[2d Air Refueling Squadron]], [[McGuire AFB]], New Jersey<ref name=\"AFHRA 2 ARS\">{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Robert B.|title=2 Air Refueling Squadron (AMC)|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/432610/2-air-refueling-squadron-amc/|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|accessdate=30 September 2017|date= 4 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Maurer\">Maurer, Maurer.

Units formed after 1 January 1919 are not listed.\n\nAero Squadrons were the designation of the first [[United States Army]] aviation units until the end of [[World War I]].   These units consisted of combat flying, training, ground support, construction and other components of the Air Service.   After World War I ended, the majority of these squadrons were demobilized.  Some however were retained during the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, and served in all theaters of operation during [[World War II]].   Today, the oldest squadrons in the [[United States Air Force]] and [[Air National Guard]] can trace their lineage back to the original Aero Squadrons of World War I.\n\n==Overview==\nIn January 1918 a new numbering scheme for aero squadrons was set up. Numbers 1\u2013399 would be for Aero Service Squadrons (AS). 400\u2013599 Aero Construction Squadrons (ACS), 600\u2013799 Aero Supply Squadrons and 800\u20131099 Aero Repair Squadrons.   Non-notable support squadrons are not listed.\n\nThe numerical designation of school squadrons at the various flying fields in the United States was discontinued in July 1918, and replaced by letter designation. For example, the 2d Aero Squadron became Squadron A, Kelly Field. In November 1918, the personnel of the lettered squadrons of each flying field was merged into a single Flying School Detachment at such station.\n\n{|  \n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\" width=\"75\"|&nbsp;|| width=\"300\" |Formed prior to 2 April 1917\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#CEEEE8E\" width=\"75\"|&nbsp;|| width=\"300\" |American Expeditionary Force combat squadron\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#FFEBFF\" width=\"75\"|&nbsp;|| width=\"600\" |Planned American Expeditionary Force combat squadron (never entered combat)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#E9E9FD\" width=\"75\"|&nbsp;|| width=\"600\" |Currently active as [[United States Air Force]]/[[Air National Guard]] squadron\n|}\n\nIn addition to the Aero Squadrons, whose mission supported airplanes in one way or another, Air Service Spruce Squadrons have been noted and listed.  A part of the Signal Corps, they were located in Oregon and Washington states.   When the U.S. entered World War I, it was quickly discovered that the nation had no capacity to build warplanes in quantity.  Spruce timber, vital to wing construction was in critically short supply.  In 1918, the United States Army stepped in and took over the production of airplane spruce in the pacific northwest, with the [[Spruce Production Division]] organizing loggers and constructing a plant to process the wood, construct roads and railroads into the forests to access and cut the timber.\n\nMen in the Spruce Squadrons were part of the Signal Corps along with the Aero Squadrons, as the Signal Corps oversaw all Army aviation.  About 50,000 soldiers were assigned to Spruce Squadrons, overseeing about 100,000 lumber workers, were assigned to small camps in the Pacific Northwest.   Many of these men were itching to go \"over there\" and take part in combat, however, their labor and skills to produce spruce lumber were needed far more, in the forests of the Pacific Northwest to produce the materiel needed to build aircraft.  The camps where the soldiers were located are listed on the individual squadron entry.\n\n==Squadrons==\n\n===1st to 24th Aero Squadrons===\nAt the time of the United States entry into World War I in April 1917, three Aero Squadrons had been formed.  The 1st and 3d were in the United States, and the 2d was in the Philippines.   The 6th, being destined for Hawaii and the 7th, destined for the Panama Canal Zone were organizing.  The 4th and 5th, to be based in the continental United States had yet to receive personnel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#f5f9B3\"\n! rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"  | Aero Squadron \n! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"  | Established \n! scope=\"col\"   | World War I\n|-  \n|colspan=3| <center>'''Notes/Subsequent History'''</center>\n\n|- valign=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\"\n| rowspan=2| [[1st Aero Squadron]]\n| 5 March 1913 \n| Formed as: 1st Provisional Aero Squadron<ref name=\"AFHRA 1 RS\"/><br>Pre-WWI service in Mexico and Texas{{sfn|Hennessey|1958|p=167}}<br>AEF: 6 April 1918 \u2013 12 May 1919<br>Corps Observation Squadron<br>Combat with I Corps Observation Group<ref name=\"USWD\">United States War Department (1920), Battle Participation of Organizations of the American Expeditionary Forces in France, Belgium and Italy, 1917\u20131919, Washington, Government Printing Office, 1920</ref>\n* Patrols in the Toul, Aisne-Marne, Vesle and Toul-Verdun Sectors\n* St. Mihiel Offensive Campaign\n* Aisne-Marne Defensive Campaign\n* Meuse-Argonne Offensive Campaign{{sfn|War Department|1920|p=50}}\n|- bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\"\n|colspan=3|  \n* '''Most senior organization in the United States Air Force'''\n* Returned to the United States in August 1919, stationed at Park Field, Tennessee\n* Redesignated in the Army Air Service as the 1st Squadron (Observation) on 14 March 1921; Re-designated as the 1st Observation Squadron on 15 November 1922; Reorganized and re-designated 1st Bombardment Squadron on 1 March 1935.{{sfn|Clay|2011|p=1365}}\nCurrently: [[1st Reconnaissance Squadron]], [[Beale AFB]], California<ref name=\"AFHRA 1 RS\">{{cite web|last1=Haulman|first1=Daniel|title=1 Reconnaissance Squadron (ACC)|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/432062/1-reconnaissance-squadron-acc/|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|accessdate=30 September 2017|date= 21 October 2016}}</ref>\n|-  \n|colspan=3|\n\n|- valign=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\"\n| rowspan=2| [[2d Aero Squadron]]\n| 1 December 1915 \n| Formed as: 1st Company, 2d Aero Squadron<br>Pre-WWI service in the Philippines{{sfn|Hennessey|1958|p=152}}<br>Instructional flying squadron<br>Re-designated: Squadron A, [[Kelly Field]], Texas, July 1918<br>Demobilized: 18 November 1918\n|- bgcolor=\"#FBFDD5\"\n|colspan=3|  \n* Constituted in the Air Service, United States Army on 3 June 1919 at Rockwell Field, California, as the 2d Aero Squadron; Transferred on 24 December 1919 to the Philippines assigned to the Philippine Department.\n* Redesignated in the Army Air Service as the 2d Squadron (Observation) on 14 March 1921; Consolidated on 8 April 1924 with the 2d Aero Squadron; Re-designated as: 2d Observation Squadron on 25 January 1923{{sfn|Clay|2011|pp=1367\u20131368}}\n* Stationed at Nichols Field, Philippines on 7 December 1941, subsequently wiped out in the 1941\u20131942 Battle of the Philippines; Inactivated 2 April 1946; Re-activated 1 January 1949.{{sfn|Maurer|1982|pp=15\u201316}}\nCurrently: [[2d Air Refueling Squadron]], [[McGuire AFB]], New Jersey<ref name=\"AFHRA 2 ARS\">{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Robert B.|title=2 Air Refueling Squadron (AMC)|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/432610/2-air-refueling-squadron-amc/|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|accessdate=30 September 2017|date= 4 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Maurer\">Maurer, Maurer.

The group debuted in August 2016 with the single \"Chewing Gum\", with seven members [[Mark Lee (singer)|Mark]], Renjun, Jeno, Haechan, [[Na Jae-min|Jaemin]], [[Zhong Chenle|Chenle]], and Jisung, then at an average age of 15.6 years old. NCT Dream has been internationally recognised as among most notable teen-aged artists of their time, known for music reflecting the growth of the youth. They are also commonly known as \u2018SM\u2019s future\u2019, and quite rightly so. Their impact is already big even without SM promoting them well, so future NCT Dream world domination would be very unsurprising. The narrative of their title tracks have conveyed thoughts following different stages of adolescent development, with transition from innocence to rebellion and growth.<ref name=\"time2018\"/> So far, NCT Dream have released four [[extended play|extended plays]], six [[Single_(music)|singles]], and headlined one international tour in Asia. Commercial success of their 2019 EP release ''[[We Boom]]'' turned NCT Dream into one of the top 10 best physical sellers of South Korea in 2019 and earned them Bonsang Awards at the [[34th Golden Disc Awards]] and [[Seoul_Music_Awards|2020 Seoul Music Awards]].<ref name=\"2020gda\">{{cite web |title=[2020 \uace8\ub4e0\ub514\uc2a4\ud06c]\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8, \uc74c\uc6d0+\uc74c\ubc18 \ub300\uc0c1 \ub3d9\uc2dc \uc11d\uad8c\u2026\"\uacf5\uc815\ud55c 2020\ub144 \uae30\ub300\"(\uc885\ud569) |url=https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=076&aid=0003516381 |website=entertain.naver.com |accessdate=April 19, 2020 |language=ko |date=January 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"sma2020\">{{cite web |title=\u2018\uc11c\uc6b8\uac00\uc694\ub300\uc0c1\u2019 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4 \ub300\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\u2026\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 \uc568\ubc94\ub300\uc0c1\u2192\ud0dc\uc5f0 \uc74c\uc6d0\ub300\uc0c1 |url=https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=609&aid=0000241099 |website=entertain.naver.com |accessdate=April 19, 2020 |language=ko |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2019albumchart\">{{cite web|url=http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/album.gaon?nationGbn=T&serviceGbn=&targetTime=2019&hitYear=2019&termGbn=year|website=Gaon Music Chart|language=ko|script-title=ko:2019\ub144 Album Chart|trans-title=2019 Album Chart|accessdate=April 19, 2020}} \n</ref> \n\nAlthough NCT Dream was initially formed to follow an aged-based admission-graduation system in which members would move on from the unit after reaching the Korean age of 20 (19 internationally), in 2020 SM Entertainment announced the admission-graduation system to be removed, with previously graduated member Mark set to return, and NCT Dream will continue activities as a flexible-style group with the seven original members.

Their classic line-up was [[Freddie Mercury]] (lead vocals, piano), [[Brian May]] (guitar, vocals), [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums, vocals) and [[John Deacon]] (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as [[arena rock]] and [[pop rock]].\n\nBefore forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their [[Queen (Queen album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'', in 1974. ''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' later that year and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the [[music video]] format.\n\nThe band's 1977 album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' contained \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", which have become [[anthem]]s at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] bands in the world. \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK]] and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], England. In 1991, he died of [[Pneumonia|bronchopneumonia]] - a complication of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], and Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the \"Queen +\" name with vocalists [[Paul Rodgers]] and [[Adam Lambert]].\n\nEstimates of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. In 1990, Queen received the [[Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the [[British Phonographic Industry]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001. Each member has composed hit singles, and all four were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003. In 2005, Queen received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]]. In 2018, they were presented the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1968\u20131974: Early era===\n[[File:Queen First Public Performance Here 18 July 1970.jpg|thumb|upright|[[PRS for Music]] heritage award commemorating Queen's first performance, [[Prince Consort Road]], London]]\nIn 1968, guitarist Brian May, a student at London's [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]], and bassist [[Tim Staffell]] decided to form a band.

Their classic line-up was [[Freddie Mercury]] (lead vocals, piano), [[Brian May]] (guitar, vocals), [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums, vocals) and [[John Deacon]] (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as [[arena rock]] and [[pop rock]].\n\nBefore forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their [[Queen (Queen album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'', in 1974. ''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' later that year and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the [[music video]] format.\n\nThe band's 1977 album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' contained \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", which have become [[anthem]]s at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] bands in the world. \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK]] and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], England.

{"title_page": "Mold control and prevention in libraries", "text_new": "[[File:Schimmelschaden in historischer Akte2.JPG|thumb|An example of mold damage]]\n'''Mold prevention''' is a conservation activity that is performed in libraries to protect books and\nother materials from deterioration caused by mold growth. [[Mold (fungus)|Mold]] prevention consists of\ndifferent methods, such as chemical treatments, careful environmental control, and manual\ncleaning. Preservationists use one or a combination of these methods to combat mold spores in library collections.\n\nDue to the resilient nature of mold and its potential for damage to library collections, mold prevention has become an important activity among [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] librarians. Although mold is naturally present in both indoor and outdoor environments, under the right circumstances it can become active after being in a dormant state. Mold growth responds to increased moisture, high humidity, and warm temperatures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Kathleen |title=MOLD BASICS |url=https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/2901/2901-7019/2901-7019_pdf.pdf |website=Virginia Cooperative Extension |publisher=Virginia Tech |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> Library collections are particularily vulnerable to mold since mold thrives off of organic, cellulose-based materials such as paper, wood, and textiles made of natural fibers. Changes in the moisture in the atmosphere can lead to mold growth and irreparable damage to library collections.<ref>Baker, Whitney. \"Preservation Perspectives: Mold in the Stacks: A Universal Problem. ''Kentucky Libraries.'' 65(3)(Summer 2001):20-22.</ref>\n\n== Mold ==\nMold is a generic term for a specific type of fungi. Mildew may also refer to types of mold. Since there are so many species of mold, their appearance varies in color and growth habit [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper].  In general, active mold has a musty odor and appears fuzzy, slimy, or damp.  Inactive mold looks dry and powdery <ref>{{cite web |url=https://library.albany.edu/libdru/files/MOLD%20IN%20THE%20LIBRARY%202013.pdf|title=Mold in the Library: Prevention and Response |last=Brown |first=Karen E.K. |publisher=University Libraries, University at Albany |date=November 13, 2013 |website=University Libraries University at Albany State University of New York |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.\n\nMold propagates via spores, which are always present in the environment.  Mold spores can be transferred to an object by mechanical instruments or air circulation.  When spores attach to another organism, and the environment is favorable, they begin to [[germinate]].  Mold produce [[mycelium]] which growth pattern resembles cobwebs.  Mycelium allows the mold to obtain food and nutrients through the host.  Inevitably, the mycelium produces spore sacs and release new spores into the air <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper|title=EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: 3.8 Emergency Salvage of Moldy Books and Paper|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center(NEDCC)|website=NEDCC website |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  Eventually the spores land on new material, and the reproductive cycle begins again.  \n\nIdentifying mold can be a challenge, because some species resemble dust, dirt, or spiderwebs.  In addition, staining caused by mold can be confused with water damage.  Ultraviolet light and magnification are two tools to aid in identifying mold on library collections <ref>{{cite web |url=https://library.albany.edu/libdru/files/MOLD%20IN%20THE%20LIBRARY%202013.pdf |title=Mold in the Library: Prevention and Response |last=Brown |first=Karen E.K. |publisher=University Libraries, University at Albany |date=November 13, 2013 |website=University Libraries University at Albany State University of New York |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  \n\nPoor air circulation, moisture, high temperatures, and environmental humidity are the main causes of mold outbreaks in library collections.  When the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the relative humidity is above 55 percent, mold begins to develop <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html|title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |last=Nyberg |first=Sarah |publisher=Solinet Preservation Leaflets |date=November 1987 |website=Conservation OnLine (CoOL) |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  Collections kept in basements or  environments with uncontrolled temperature and humidity are most likely to be impacted by a mold outbreak [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper].\n\nMold is a dangerous library pest because of the damage it causes to the collections.  Mold thrives off of paper and books; these objects provide the fungi a source of nutrition, namely the sugar and starches present in the cellulose materials <ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Kathleen |title=Mold Basics |url=https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/2901/2901-7019/2901-7019_pdf.pdf |website=Virginia Cooperative Extension |publisher=Virginia Tech |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>.  Mold feeds on cloth, leather, glues, adhesives, cellulose starch and starches in the sizing.\nFrequently, mold is noticed on the bindings long before it begins on the text blocks .  By feeding on books, mold can cause the paper to become thin, soft, or spongy.  Images and decorative elements can be completely destroyed or, at the very least, become stained.  \n\n== Impact on Materials ==\nWhen a book or paper becomes moldy, the fungi will digest its food source, paper and cloth (such as book covers and bindings), in order to survive. This process stains and destroys books, papers, and other library collections over time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.airsystems-inc.com/air-purification-news/air-quality/mold-in-libraries-causes-significant-indoor-air-quality-problems/|title=Mold In Libraries Causes Significant Indoor Air Quality Problems|website=Extract All|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> During their growth mold and mildew produce citric, gluconic, oxalic, or other [[organic acids]] that can damage paper, leather, cloth, etc. They also at times produce color bodies, leading to staining which is difficult to remove.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minitex.umn.edu/Storage/Preservation/Mold/|title=Mold : Preservation Resources : Minnesota Library Storage (MLAC) : Products & Services : Minitex|website=www.minitex.umn.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Mold will continually grow until it uses up its food source, which means a library collection could be totally consumed. Unless every mold spore is treated, the issue will just return. Mold's enduring nature makes treatment difficult and prevention all the more necessary.\n\n==Prevention==\n[[File:CCAHAStaff drying.jpg|thumb|Conservation staff drying mold-damaged materials]]\nThe only way to control mold is by altering conditions conducive to its growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/content/mold|title=Mold {{!}} Library Preservation and Conservation Tutorial|website=chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The generally accepted threshold for mold growth is about 15% moisture content because the predominant cause of mold is excess water. Excess water can come from liquid water, as a result of leaks, or water vapor, as a result of high relative humidity due to improper storage, faulty humidifiers, or HVAC malfunctions. While most research shows that fungal growth is most prevalent in conditions in which relative humidity is above 60%, humidity levels below this threshold alone will not prevent mold growth, given the fact that favorable germination environments vary from species to species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.illinois.edu/staff/preservation/services/damage-response/|title=Mold, Pest, and Water Damage Response \u2013 Staff Website \u2013 U of I Library|website=www.library.illinois.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> \n\n=== Environmental Controls ===\nMany libraries monitor a building's atmosphere through the use of [[HVAC]] systems. These built in\nventilation systems help to combat mold growth that occurs as a result of [[relative humidity]]\nlevels greater than 65% and temperature greater than 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit, as well poor air circulation <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyberg |first1=Sandra |title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>. Proper use and monitoring of HVAC systems can help to prevent mold problems before they occur. Air ventilation removes existing mold spores from the air and keeps the atmosphere relatively dry and cool. Effective HVAC systems have a good system design and the ability to provide environmental control over entire building areas. Proper maintenance of equipment also lowers the chances that issues will arise due to system outages .<ref>Brown, Dors R. \"Collection Disaster: Mold in the Stacks.\" ''College & Research Libraries News.'' 64(5) (2003):304-306.</ref>  At 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit and 50% relative humidity, the equilibrium moisture content of the environment would be 9.2%, low enough to prevent mold growth.  However, proper air flow and air exchange is required to effectively disrupt the boundary layers of air around room contents, which can have high water vapor levels within the surrounding dry air and promote mold amplification.\n\n===Manual solutions===\n\nManual methods such as [[HEPA]] filtered vacuuming serves as a backup to eliminating mold via environmental control. HEPA vacuums possess air filters that do not allow mold to be spread into the air again. Installing drying fans, wiping dry books and surrounding furniture, as well as air ducts and shelves will also help to prevent further infestations. In extreme cases, some books and items are discarded to protect the rest of the collection from being affected. These preservation activities are provided by available library staff or hired contractors.<ref>Alleman, Steve. \"Coping with an Outbreak of Mold.\" ''LLA Bulletin.'' 61(4) (Spring 1999):217-220.</ref>\n\n=== Storage ===\n\nProper storage practices can be effective in preventing mold growth. Storing materials away from exterior walls and damp areas like basements can reduce the risk of mold growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/managing_a_mold_invasion.pdf|title=Managing a Mold Invasion {{!}} |website=museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/managing_a_mold_invasion.pdf|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> In addition, the use of [[desiccants]] can control humidity inside enclosed containers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/content/mold|title=Mold {{!}} Library Preservation and Conservation Tutorial|website=chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\n==Safe Handling==\nProper handling of affected or damaged materials prevents mold from spreading. Because mold spores are released into the air, it is recommended to wear an [[NIOSH]]-rated respirator before coming into contact with affected materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/what-we-do/forums/collections-care-guidelines-resources/ive-got-mold-my-files|title=I've got mold in my files|last=Stauderman|first=Sarah|date=2013-02-21|website=Smithsonian Institution Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> [[Nitrile glove]]<nowiki/>s should be worn to protect the skin from contact with mold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pdx.edu/news/the-proper-handling-of-rare-books-manuscripts/|title=Gloves or No Gloves? On the Proper Handling of Rare Books & Manuscripts|date=2015-06-04|website=Portland State University Library|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> In extreme cases, a full-body [[hazmat suit]] may be required. Materials must always be treated on a surface that can be cleaned with bleach or on neutral, disposable materials such as unprinted [[newsprint]].\n\n=== Potential Health Concerns ===\nMold is harmful to materials, and may cause [[Mold health issues|mold health issues]] in humans. When a library collection experiences a mold outbreak, actions need to be taken to ensure preservation of materials and the good health of the people involved. Mold is more hazardous to those who have allergies or suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma <ref>{{cite web |title=Mold 101: Effects on Human Health |url=https://www.poison.org/articles/2011-oct/mold-101-effects-on-human-health |website=Poison Control: National Capital Poison Center |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>.  Some mold species can irritate other parts of the body through prolonged exposure. In some cases, protective clothing is necessary when handling mold found on library collections.\n\n==Monitoring==\n\nMold spores are always present in the environment and when conditions are favorable, mold will occur <ref>{{cite web |last1=Livingston |first1=Preston |title=Mold Prevention and Remediation in a Library Environment |url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-3762178701/mold-prevention-and-remediation-in-a-library-environment |website=Questia |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> . Regular monitoring of the collection through visual inspection and environmental controls is essential to prevent an outbreak.  \n\nMold leaves a visual indication of its presence. Though mold can be any color, gray and black spots coupled with a musty odor can indicate the presence of mold<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minitex.umn.edu/Storage/Preservation/Mold/|title=Mold : Preservation Resources : Minnesota Library Storage (MLAC) : Products & Services : Minitex|website=www.minitex.umn.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> . Books with these indicators can be isolated and treatment steps can be implemented. Books in the surrounding area can be monitored in case of further infestation. Presence of water or condensation and dust are other factors to look out for that can encourage mold growth. Regular cleaning and inspections will help monitor for mold growth. \n\nThe control and regular monitoring of temperature and humidity levels is vital to prevent mold growth. Guidelines suggest that temperatures be maintained between 65\u00b0-70\u00b0 Fahrenheit and relative humidity between 45%-65%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyberg |first1=Sandra |title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> HVAC systems can be utilized and monitored to ensure these levels are maintained. Temperature and humidity values can be systematically measured and recorded to document conditions, to alert of severe fluctuations, and to indicate the functionality of the climate control systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ogden |first1=Sherelyn |title=2.1 Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation |url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation |website=Northeast Document Conservation Center |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> The systems themselves should be regularly checked for accuracy and functionality.\n\n==Treatments for Mold Damage==\n\n=== Chemical Treatments ===\nPreservation librarians use a number of different chemicals to prevent the growth of mold spores. Chemical compounds such as [[ethylene oxide]], [[thymol]], and [[2-Phenylphenol|orthophenyl phenol]] are regularly used.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study.\" ''The Journal of Academic Librarianship.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.</ref>\n[[Chlorine dioxide]] is a chemical that is growing in popularity due its safety level for library employees and patrons. These chemicals act as effective sporicides in a variety of library settings. They are applied on books and surrounding shelves by manual wiping or using chlorine packets that release the chemicals in gaseous form into the air.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"Chlorine Dioxide: a treatment for mold in libraries.\" ''Archival Products.'' 10(3) (2003)</ref>\n\nChemical treatments are often used in enclosed storage areas with little air circulation. They are also used to deal with emergency situations involving mold outbreaks caused by pipe leaks in buildings. In 2000, the [[University of Oklahoma]] Libraries conducted an evaluation of the effects of chlorine packets on mold growth. Paper items that had been exposed to the substance showed lower overall [[pH]] levels than items that had not been treated. Although long-term effects of chemical treatments on paper [[Print permanence|permanence]] and other library materials have not been documented, libraries use this newer method of controlling mold in the stacks.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and Its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study.\" ''The Journal of Academic Librariansip.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.</ref>\n\n===Freeze Drying and UV Light===\n\n[[Freeze drying]] or [[ultraviolet light]] exposure are other ways to inhibit mold growth, although they do not kill mold spores permanently.

[[Mold]] prevention consists of\ndifferent methods, such as chemical treatments, careful environmental control, and manual\ncleaning. Preservationists use one or a combination of these methods to combat mold spores in library collections.\n\nDue to the resilient nature of mold and its potential for damage to library collections, mold prevention has become an important activity among [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] librarians. Although mold is naturally present in both indoor and outdoor environments, under the right circumstances it can become active after being in a dormant state. Mold growth responds to increased moisture, high humidity, and warm temperatures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Kathleen |title=MOLD BASICS |url=https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/2901/2901-7019/2901-7019_pdf.pdf |website=Virginia Cooperative Extension |publisher=Virginia Tech |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> Library collections are particularily vulnerable to mold since mold thrives off of organic, cellulose-based materials such as paper, wood, and textiles made of natural fibers. Changes in the moisture in the atmosphere can lead to mold growth and irreparable damage to library collections.<ref>Baker, Whitney. \"Preservation Perspectives: Mold in the Stacks: A Universal Problem. ''Kentucky Libraries.'' 65(3)(Summer 2001):20-22.</ref>\n\n== Mold ==\nMold is a generic term for a specific type of fungi. Mildew may also refer to types of mold. Since there are so many species of mold, their appearance varies in color and growth habit [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper].  In general, active mold has a musty odor and appears fuzzy, slimy, or damp.  Inactive mold looks dry and powdery <ref>{{cite web |url=https://library.albany.edu/libdru/files/MOLD%20IN%20THE%20LIBRARY%202013.pdf|title=Mold in the Library: Prevention and Response |last=Brown |first=Karen E.K. |publisher=University Libraries, University at Albany |date=November 13, 2013 |website=University Libraries University at Albany State University of New York |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.\n\nMold propagates via spores, which are always present in the environment.  Mold spores can be transferred to an object by mechanical instruments or air circulation.  When spores attach to another organism, and the environment is favorable, they begin to [[germinate]].  Mold produce [[mycelium]] which growth pattern resembles cobwebs.  Mycelium allows the mold to obtain food and nutrients through the host.  Inevitably, the mycelium produces spore sacs and release new spores into the air <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper|title=EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: 3.8 Emergency Salvage of Moldy Books and Paper|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center(NEDCC)|website=NEDCC website |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  Eventually the spores land on new material, and the reproductive cycle begins again.  \n\nIdentifying mold can be a challenge, because some species resemble dust, dirt, or spiderwebs.  In addition, staining caused by mold can be confused with water damage.  Ultraviolet light and magnification are two tools to aid in identifying mold on library collections <ref>{{cite web |url=https://library.albany.edu/libdru/files/MOLD%20IN%20THE%20LIBRARY%202013.pdf |title=Mold in the Library: Prevention and Response |last=Brown |first=Karen E.K. |publisher=University Libraries, University at Albany |date=November 13, 2013 |website=University Libraries University at Albany State University of New York |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  \n\nPoor air circulation, moisture, high temperatures, and environmental humidity are the main causes of mold outbreaks in library collections.  When the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the relative humidity is above 55 percent, mold begins to develop <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html|title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |last=Nyberg |first=Sarah |publisher=Solinet Preservation Leaflets |date=November 1987 |website=Conservation OnLine (CoOL) |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  Collections kept in basements or  environments with uncontrolled temperature and humidity are most likely to be impacted by a mold outbreak [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper].\n\nMold is a dangerous library pest because of the damage it causes to the collections.  Mold thrives off of paper and books; these objects provide the fungi a source of nutrition, namely the sugar and starches present in the cellulose materials <ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Kathleen |title=Mold Basics |url=https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/2901/2901-7019/2901-7019_pdf.pdf |website=Virginia Cooperative Extension |publisher=Virginia Tech |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>.  Mold feeds on cloth, leather, glues, adhesives, cellulose starch and starches in the sizing.\nFrequently, mold is noticed on the bindings long before it begins on the text blocks .  By feeding on books, mold can cause the paper to become thin, soft, or spongy.  Images and decorative elements can be completely destroyed or, at the very least, become stained.  \n\n== Impact on Materials ==\nWhen a book or paper becomes moldy, the fungi will digest its food source, paper and cloth (such as book covers and bindings), in order to survive. This process stains and destroys books, papers, and other library collections over time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.airsystems-inc.com/air-purification-news/air-quality/mold-in-libraries-causes-significant-indoor-air-quality-problems/|title=Mold In Libraries Causes Significant Indoor Air Quality Problems|website=Extract All|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> During their growth mold and mildew produce citric, gluconic, oxalic, or other [[organic acids]] that can damage paper, leather, cloth, etc. They also at times produce color bodies, leading to staining which is difficult to remove.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minitex.umn.edu/Storage/Preservation/Mold/|title=Mold : Preservation Resources : Minnesota Library Storage (MLAC) : Products & Services : Minitex|website=www.minitex.umn.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Mold will continually grow until it uses up its food source, which means a library collection could be totally consumed. Unless every mold spore is treated, the issue will just return. Mold's enduring nature makes treatment difficult and prevention all the more necessary.\n\n==Prevention==\n[[File:CCAHAStaff drying.jpg|thumb|Conservation staff drying mold-damaged materials]]\nThe only way to control mold is by altering conditions conducive to its growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/content/mold|title=Mold {{!}} Library Preservation and Conservation Tutorial|website=chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The generally accepted threshold for mold growth is about 15% moisture content because the predominant cause of mold is excess water. Excess water can come from liquid water, as a result of leaks, or water vapor, as a result of high relative humidity due to improper storage, faulty humidifiers, or HVAC malfunctions. While most research shows that fungal growth is most prevalent in conditions in which relative humidity is above 60%, humidity levels below this threshold alone will not prevent mold growth, given the fact that favorable germination environments vary from species to species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.illinois.edu/staff/preservation/services/damage-response/|title=Mold, Pest, and Water Damage Response \u2013 Staff Website \u2013 U of I Library|website=www.library.illinois.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> \n\n=== Environmental Controls ===\nMany libraries monitor a building's atmosphere through the use of [[HVAC]] systems. These built in\nventilation systems help to combat mold growth that occurs as a result of [[relative humidity]]\nlevels greater than 65% and temperature greater than 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit, as well poor air circulation <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyberg |first1=Sandra |title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>. Proper use and monitoring of HVAC systems can help to prevent mold problems before they occur. Air ventilation removes existing mold spores from the air and keeps the atmosphere relatively dry and cool. Effective HVAC systems have a good system design and the ability to provide environmental control over entire building areas. Proper maintenance of equipment also lowers the chances that issues will arise due to system outages .<ref>Brown, Dors R. \"Collection Disaster: Mold in the Stacks.\" ''College & Research Libraries News.'' 64(5) (2003):304-306.</ref>  At 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit and 50% relative humidity, the equilibrium moisture content of the environment would be 9.2%, low enough to prevent mold growth.  However, proper air flow and air exchange is required to effectively disrupt the boundary layers of air around room contents, which can have high water vapor levels within the surrounding dry air and promote mold amplification.\n\n===Manual solutions===\n\nManual methods such as [[HEPA]] filtered vacuuming serves as a backup to eliminating mold via environmental control. HEPA vacuums possess air filters that do not allow mold to be spread into the air again. Installing drying fans, wiping dry books and surrounding furniture, as well as air ducts and shelves will also help to prevent further infestations. In extreme cases, some books and items are discarded to protect the rest of the collection from being affected. These preservation activities are provided by available library staff or hired contractors.<ref>Alleman, Steve. \"Coping with an Outbreak of Mold.\" ''LLA Bulletin.'' 61(4) (Spring 1999):217-220.</ref>\n\n=== Storage ===\n\nProper storage practices can be effective in preventing mold growth. Storing materials away from exterior walls and damp areas like basements can reduce the risk of mold growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/managing_a_mold_invasion.pdf|title=Managing a Mold Invasion {{!}} |website=museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/managing_a_mold_invasion.pdf|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> In addition, the use of [[desiccants]] can control humidity inside enclosed containers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/content/mold|title=Mold {{!}} Library Preservation and Conservation Tutorial|website=chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\n==Safe Handling==\nProper handling of affected or damaged materials prevents mold from spreading. Because mold spores are released into the air, it is recommended to wear an [[NIOSH]]-rated respirator before coming into contact with affected materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/what-we-do/forums/collections-care-guidelines-resources/ive-got-mold-my-files|title=I've got mold in my files|last=Stauderman|first=Sarah|date=2013-02-21|website=Smithsonian Institution Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> [[Nitrile glove]]<nowiki/>s should be worn to protect the skin from contact with mold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pdx.edu/news/the-proper-handling-of-rare-books-manuscripts/|title=Gloves or No Gloves?

Materials must always be treated on a surface that can be cleaned with bleach or on neutral, disposable materials such as unprinted [[newsprint]].\n\n=== Potential Health Concerns ===\nMold is harmful to materials, and may cause [[Mold health issues|mold health issues]] in humans. When a library collection experiences a mold outbreak, actions need to be taken to ensure preservation of materials and the good health of the people involved. Mold is more hazardous to those who have allergies or suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma <ref>{{cite web |title=Mold 101: Effects on Human Health |url=https://www.poison.org/articles/2011-oct/mold-101-effects-on-human-health |website=Poison Control: National Capital Poison Center |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>.  Some mold species can irritate other parts of the body through prolonged exposure. In some cases, protective clothing is necessary when handling mold found on library collections.\n\n==Monitoring==\n\nMold spores are always present in the environment and when conditions are favorable, mold will occur <ref>{{cite web |last1=Livingston |first1=Preston |title=Mold Prevention and Remediation in a Library Environment |url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-3762178701/mold-prevention-and-remediation-in-a-library-environment |website=Questia |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> . Regular monitoring of the collection through visual inspection and environmental controls is essential to prevent an outbreak.  \n\nMold leaves a visual indication of its presence. Though mold can be any color, gray and black spots coupled with a musty odor can indicate the presence of mold<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minitex.umn.edu/Storage/Preservation/Mold/|title=Mold : Preservation Resources : Minnesota Library Storage (MLAC) : Products & Services : Minitex|website=www.minitex.umn.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> . Books with these indicators can be isolated and treatment steps can be implemented. Books in the surrounding area can be monitored in case of further infestation. Presence of water or condensation and dust are other factors to look out for that can encourage mold growth. Regular cleaning and inspections will help monitor for mold growth. \n\nThe control and regular monitoring of temperature and humidity levels is vital to prevent mold growth. Guidelines suggest that temperatures be maintained between 65\u00b0-70\u00b0 Fahrenheit and relative humidity between 45%-65%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyberg |first1=Sandra |title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> HVAC systems can be utilized and monitored to ensure these levels are maintained. Temperature and humidity values can be systematically measured and recorded to document conditions, to alert of severe fluctuations, and to indicate the functionality of the climate control systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ogden |first1=Sherelyn |title=2.1 Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation |url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation |website=Northeast Document Conservation Center |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> The systems themselves should be regularly checked for accuracy and functionality.\n\n==Treatments for Mold Damage==\n\n=== Chemical Treatments ===\nPreservation librarians use a number of different chemicals to prevent the growth of mold spores. Chemical compounds such as [[ethylene oxide]], [[thymol]], and [[2-Phenylphenol|orthophenyl phenol]] are regularly used.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study.\" ''The Journal of Academic Librarianship.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.</ref>\n[[Chlorine dioxide]] is a chemical that is growing in popularity due its safety level for library employees and patrons. These chemicals act as effective sporicides in a variety of library settings. They are applied on books and surrounding shelves by manual wiping or using chlorine packets that release the chemicals in gaseous form into the air.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"Chlorine Dioxide: a treatment for mold in libraries.\" ''Archival Products.'' 10(3) (2003)</ref>\n\nChemical treatments are often used in enclosed storage areas with little air circulation. They are also used to deal with emergency situations involving mold outbreaks caused by pipe leaks in buildings. In 2000, the [[University of Oklahoma]] Libraries conducted an evaluation of the effects of chlorine packets on mold growth. Paper items that had been exposed to the substance showed lower overall [[pH]] levels than items that had not been treated. Although long-term effects of chemical treatments on paper [[Print permanence|permanence]] and other library materials have not been documented, libraries use this newer method of controlling mold in the stacks.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and Its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study.\" ''The Journal of Academic Librariansip.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.</ref>\n\n===Freeze Drying and UV Light===\n\n[[Freeze drying]] or [[ultraviolet light]] exposure are other ways to inhibit mold growth, although they do not kill mold spores permanently.

For psoriasis, the mechanism of action is believed to be due to the interaction of MMF and the intracellular reduced glutathione of cells directly involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The interaction with glutathione leads to the inhibition of nuclear translocation and the transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-\u03baB).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMore recently, DMF and MMF has been shown to reduce the expression of micro-RNA-21, which is essential for the production of pathogenic cells in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.

For psoriasis, the mechanism of action is believed to be due to the interaction of MMF and the intracellular reduced glutathione of cells directly involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The interaction with glutathione leads to the inhibition of nuclear translocation and the transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-\u03baB).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMore recently, DMF and MMF has been shown to reduce the expression of micro-RNA-21, which is essential for the production of pathogenic cells in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. This can be achieved because DMF and MMF, as cell-permeable metabolites, can epigenetically regulate the expression of micro-RNA-21 via the metabolic-epigenetic interplay in developing immune cells<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ntranos |first1=Achilles |last2=Ntranos |first2=Vasilis |last3=Bonnefil |first3=Valentina |last4=Liu |first4=Jia |last5=Kim-Schulze |first5=Seunghee |last6=He |first6=Ye |last7=Zhu |first7=Yunjiao |last8=Brandstadter |first8=Rachel |last9=Watson |first9=Corey T |last10=Sharp |first10=Andrew J |last11=Katz Sand |first11=Ilana |last12=Casaccia |first12=Patrizia |title=Fumarates target the metabolic-epigenetic interplay of brain-homing T cells in multiple sclerosis |journal=Brain |date=March 2019 |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=647\u2013661 |doi=10.1093/brain/awy344|pmid=30698680 |pmc=6821213 }}</ref>.\n\nThe main activity of DMF and MMF is considered to be immunomodulatory, resulting in a shift in T helper cells (Th) from the Th1 and Th17 profile to a Th2 phenotype.
